the church says amen God bless you thank you amen for all of that good singing my goodness I felt like that church was this church was about to come apart when that choir was singing I just thought I'll just walk straight up to the pulpit right now oh boy that was awesome that was awesome I just love to hear the worship and praise that comes from not just a not just a talent but from the heart amen I believe that's the kind of Praise that God inhabits amen God bless you it's certainly a great privilege to be here with you just such an honor uh it's been here the last few days we've been here with brother Tim your pastor who I love so much and have so much respect for he's had such a a great impact in the life of my family and even back home I bring greetings from my dad and my mom and the church there and Buford and I just want to say how much we appreciate and love you all amen and I just know that the Lord has something special for us this morning amen I believe that there's something even in this building right now this room right now that's a presence that you feel that's not from this world it's from another dimension brother Brandon said when you begin to feel that Spirit move and you think oh my I just feels like I want to cry and others would say I feels like I want to shout and I don't really know why brother Branham said it's because you're bumping into that other dimension you know I want to bump into that dimension I'm sick and tired of this world and all its anxiety and stress and worry and fear that's gripping the world I want to bump into another dimension and say Lord would you call me up higher this morning let me look beyond the natural let me look to the supernatural God amen well God bless you we want to turn to our scriptures here Joshua chapter 4 if you have your Bible thank you again brother Tim for having us inviting us it's uh certainly just a privilege to be here Joshua chapter 4 well I didn't I forgot my Bible and I got a new briefcase so I asked for a Bible and brother Tim let me use his Bible so if I get to where I just can't close it and I just got to keep preaching then y'all just got to have Grace on me go a little bit long today we just got one service so praise the Lord praise the Lord Joshua chapter 4 I want to begin reading here at the first verse that I'm going to minister to you on a title anointed by the supernatural Joshua chapter 4 and we'll just begin reading it the first verse and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over Jordan that the Lord spake unto Joshua saying take you 12 men out of the people out of every tribe of man and command ye them saying take you hints out of the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priest feat stood firm now that's important wasn't just any stone it wasn't just any place but he said there's going to be a specific Stone because these stones are going to represent something down the road now I've just give me Grace here this morning I've ministered this in three or four different parts but we just have one service but and I just want to well the Tim told me to take my Liberty so I don't I don't really want to have to lay a big foundation and then I'm just going to jump right in so will you just jump right in with me amen let's let's go together Amen Let the Holy Spirit lead us notice he says take the priest where the priest feet stood firm this was a certain position what they stood on what they stood for what they believed and he says take these 12 Stones where the priest's feet stood firm and he says 12 Stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall Lodge this night then Joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe of man Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what do these Stones mean so God was going to provision something now for something that would come later and what was our PR what was our scripture that in the days that that I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and so what was going these Stones going to represent a generation of children who would begin to ask what do these Stones mean then you shall answer them verse 7 that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever in Joshua verse 9 set up 12 Stones in the midst of Jordan in the place where the Feast of feet of the priests which bore the Ark of the Covenant stood and they are there into this day notice here for the for the priest which bore the ark stood in the midst of Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to speak unto the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua and the people hasted and passed over one more scripture Second Kings before you're seated second Kings chapter 2 Second Kings 2 and wouldis begin reading here at the first first and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgal and Elisha said unto Elisha Tara here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to Bethel verse 4 and Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho notice Elisha stays with Elijah verse 6 Elijah said unto him Terry I pray that the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and is thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on verse 8 Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters here's here they are at Jordan also smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground came to pass when they were going over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee in other words whatever you ask now Elisha it'll be done another word sister Hattie whatever you say in other words whatever you say right now and God will grant it to you do you know brother Branham said that when Hattie spoke those words it moved all of Heaven you know why because she spoke she didn't just think it she used her voice you see words have the ability to disturb the atmosphere that's around you and when a word speaks not a thought but when that thoughts expressed through a word that atmosphere is Disturbed around you and it changes the circumstances listen to me somebody you might be surrounded by doubt and by fear and all hell is coming against you speak the word of God it'll change the atmosphere around you you think God doesn't care about what your voice speaks when you say a man to the word of God what are you doing you're you're denying that doubt around you and you're creating the atmosphere of Faith where all things are possible I believe that kind of anointing's in this room right now brother Brandon says when she spoke those words it felt like the room was about to come apart and God's brother Branham says God told her tell her whatever she asks for right now it'll be done Elijah says to Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said unto said I prayed he led a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me verse 10 and he said that was that's the hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am notice this if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so in other words Elijah's saying to Elisha when you see me when I'm gone if you see me Elisha as gone from you in other words your perspective Elisha has to realize you can't stand here when I leave and say oh I just need Elijah where's Elijah if Elijah would just come back Elisha's got to see Elijah as taken from him but there's still a work to do there's still a commission to take place there's still a work to do for Elisha Elisha you've got to see Elijah that he's gone from you and the Bible says if you see me when I'm gone he says it'll be so if you see me as I'm gone as you've transliterate that that's what it means here and he says here in verse 11 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked and behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chair and the horse Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and ripped them into two pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said not where's Elijah but where's the Lord God of Elijah Lord Jesus we just bow our heads here today Lord as one group of people and Eunice and Lord and one mind and one Accord father we come from different places over the world Lord live in different states maybe separated some visitors here even today but at this moment Lord we're all one family all up to your table right now of One Spirit of one mind and one Accord Lord and we ask you now I've raised my hands Lord as some maybe would raise their hands by a special need and just say Lord I have a special request that I'm going to raise it up before you I'm going to represent it by a hand and I'm going to say Lord my expectation is you're going to meet me in this service today may you grant it now Lord Jesus we ask to every life every individual we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can be seated foreign Elijah is going to go home and God's going to call him he's coming to the end of his ministry he's at the very last stages and Elijah knows that very well he knows that his days he's about to go home and he takes Elijah through this Elisha through these cities this was specific it wasn't it wasn't you know just accidental or random places that Elijah was going to take Elisha but it takes him to very specific cities and he takes them to Jericho and he takes him to Bethel what you're reading here in Second Kings is some of the last words of the of the Prophet Elijah this is some of the last moments that Elijah is going to have on Earth in this Dimension and he's beginning to try he's beginning to have a burden come upon his heart you know you can read the last words of of powerful men and men throughout the Bible you read the last words of Elisha later on in his life you can read the last words of David you could read the last words of Jacob and the last words of Joseph in the last things that Jacob is saying to Joseph is don't leave my bones here in in Egypt but take them to Canaan to the promised land and then Joseph says those same words but what you're reading here is the last desires as we could say this is the last moments that he's going to be alive and he and he wants to make sure that he he transfers something there there comes there there's a moment where there's a baton that is going to be passed there's going to be a dispensational change that the worker the prophets leaving but the work is far from Over The Prophet's going home but the work is far from complete there's many things that still must be accomplished and it Elijah no doubt knowing the burden you know of the the weight of this entire thing he's bringing Elisha to these specific cities you can imagine just the awestruck wonder that a man like Elisha would have as he follows Elijah through his ministry and was there for some of the miraculous things and some of the power powerful things and moments of his life that were so special to his ministry just highlights you can imagine what this must have been like for Elisha and Elisha had watched as he followed this man Elijah and seen the supernatural God and he's seen the way that the Lord had used him and and he knew that there was something special about this mantle that Elijah had now Elisha was not going to replace Elijah in the sense that he was going to do exactly what Elijah did he wasn't going to go over and and do the same exact Miracles that Elisha was going to do though he would have great miracles in his life he wasn't going to he wasn't going to fulfill what Elijah had to fulfill but there was a portion of Elisha's Ministry that he had to fulfill for himself and he knew that there was something about that mantle that he lied you you can watch him as Elijah tells him and says you know Terry here Elisha you know why don't you come to Jericho and I want you just to you know build a home here Terry here and you make a good pastor to these people and you know build your house and have your children here and you know just plant yourself here but Elisha knew as long as Elijah was there and there was an anointing upon his life I'm staying right beside Elijah because there's nothing else in the world there's nothing else that can match it there's nothing else that says that that meets the challenge of the hour that I live in Elisha had called a revelation that Elijah was a specific gift and a specific anointing that no other man had and so he tells him take him to these he says come to these cities of Jericho and you know this city of Jericho and Bethel these are two important crucial cities if you study the Bible you'll find that Jericho and Bethel are both profound cities that God does many miraculous things through you can find the city of Bethel and Jacob is there and he has a dream and a ladder is going from Heaven to Earth and there's Angels ascending and descending and Jacob wakes up from the dream and he says oh surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and and he seen that there was an activity of God that's happening all the time that never stops that angels are always descending and descending upon your half behalf and and Jacob makes these Stones as a memorial and he he just wants to some way memorialize this this spot and he anoints it with oil and and he pours the oil upon the stones and he calls the name of that place Bethlehem God had done many miraculous things throughout that City even Jericho can we know the stories of Jericho and Joshua and some of the powerful moments and miraculous that takes place even in Elijah's Ministry these were moments of great Revival these were cities that were on fire these were cities that really just were on fire for for the fire for the power of God oh but how different they were from the beginning of Elijah's Ministry to the end of his ministry and now these cities of Bethel and Jericho are not on fire they're not in Revival they're actually very much backslidden in so much that they're even in one place Jericho's mocking the prophet of God that was such a generation that was so much worse than what Elijah had experienced in his early days of his ministry oh when his ministry was first beginning my masses came and everybody just packed the stadiums to see him and they wanted him at their church and their pulpit in to see the miraculous happen but oh how amazing it changes when when Elijah comes to his actual Ministry and now brother Branham comes to Tucson and he says I didn't want to start a church here I came here and I came in the desert I didn't I didn't want to start it on my own I didn't want to break any Fellowship I didn't want to break anything up but I sat here in the desert for three years and you never had me preach you never invited me to your pulpits and you never had me this wasn't my desire to start a assembly but what happens doors begin to close at the latter part of his ministry and what was once widely rejected is now what was once widely accepted is now rejected by the masses and so much that Jesus even in his own Ministry would have the same type of rejection and would say to this to the to the crowds that followed him unless you eat the Flesh and drink the blood of the son of man you'll have no part with him and they said this is a hard saying this is a hard saying let me tell you something friends to the world if you're not a Believer ordained from the foundation of the world the message is a hard thing it's a hard thing for the intellectual mind but if you're anointed by the power of God and you're a seed of God it's not a hard thing it's the joy of our life it's the joy of my of my salvation it's the passion of my life it's all I have it's all I live for it's all that I desire as David said your word is my daily portion but the doors had begin to close in his life and he comes to the end there and even brother green when he starts a tabernacle he leaves Beaumont Texas and he leaves there as a district president or something there a superintendent and he starts the Tucson Tabernacle you know it's so amazing to steering a testimony the other day and brother green said the reason I started a church in Tucson was I wanted an assembly or a building a group of people or I could say the name William Branham and it wouldn't offend anybody now you imagine the vision of that day and now we have churches I am so glad we have bodies of believer all bodies of Believers all across the world and we can say the name William Branham we could preach the message of Malachi 4 not only does it not offend us brother Tim but it excites the very core of our being it's our Revival you're attracted to it you're magnetized to it it's who you are it's your identity so Elijah brings him to the very last stages of his life here's the last few moments and he's coming down to the last few things that he's going to say some of the last things that he's going to mention to Elijah and he comes to this place and he and Elijah you can see here that there's an anointing that must be passed on I almost titled this sermon this morning the transfer of anointing or the transfer of the expectation that there must come a transfer of the anointing of the expectation or The Inheritance that was upon Elijah must come upon Elisha he cannot live just on the god of the pastor the stories of yesterday he that won't sustain him that won't meet the challenges in fact not only does Elisha need to come under the same anointing that Elijah had but he actually needs twice what Elijah had because now there's a generation of people that's much more dark and twisted in their mind there's an atmosphere that's much worse than Elijah's generation and let me just stop here for a moment and preach to you and tell you you don't just need you say brother matter do we need the expectation and the anointing and the Living God that we see in God's Prophet no friends you need double the expectation you need twice the Zeal you need twice the fervor oh I just say give me a church Lord give me a desire that I say give me double the power give me double the energy give me double the Zeal Lord Jesus this is not a generation of getting cold or going backwards but I say give me an anointing it's a double portion of what you have he knows that there's something about this mentally he knows that there's nothing you know within the mantle there's nothing necessarily special about the fabric or the stitching or the kind of materials that they used it was not in the the was wasn't in any kind of the fabric there was nothing special you know listen all those things were good the stories are good you know I love the stories the hunting stories the fishing stories even the stories of of squirrels being spoken into existence and I love all of those things but listen there was nothing in particularly special about the mantle itself but it was drenched with a promise it was saturated with an anointing it was saturated with an expectation it was anointed with a faith that didn't come from Elijah but it came from Jehovah so Elijah it wasn't Elijah's message Elijah was just the messenger it wasn't brother Branham said it wasn't me who appeared there on the Ohio River I was just standing there when he appeared so it wasn't anything special about the mantle itself but it was the anointing or the expectation or the promise or the pro or the or the scripture you could say or the commission that was drenching the mantle and listen to me friends when Jeremiah had a message from God it wasn't Jeremiah's message it wasn't Micah's message this wasn't their message they were simply the messenger and so when you rejected Jeremiah you weren't rejecting Jeremiah when you turned your back on brother Branham you're not rejecting brother Branham you were rejecting Jehovah because this was a thought not from Brother Branham it was from the throne room of God coming down to a prophet that would need to be transferred to a people are you with me here this morning and so he he would say that come to this place and and you could you could see these are the last words even brother Branham comes to what house will you build me and he's there in November of 1965 some of the last things you can uh hear about even over the last few months uh just been scouring going through the message and and you want to see what wanting to see what was on brother Brandon's heart what was his fervent desire what was he really looking for what was his expectation what was it that he was reaching for what was it that he was wanting to see and he comes to that message what house will you build me and he begins to say oh friends if you feel like I do he says I'm so hungry to see the power of God and spirit of God moving I can just hardly stand it and he says all the experiences I had when I was first Saved what is it here he's after the seals after the after the trumpets after he understands uh the trumpets and the true meaning of the revelation of the Seven Seals after the Mighty God unveiled after 1960 after 1963 after 1964 yet there's something hungering down on the inside of brother Branham oh I say I I resonate so much with that quote and I say oh god I've served you for this long here we are in 2023 but let me just say I am so hungry to see the power of God and the spirit of God I'm so hungry to see the god of the Bible come and make himself manifest in my life in my children in my marriage in my church in my home I say God I'm so hungry I can just hardly stand it it comes to this very last spot and he says ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken from thee and without hesitation Elisha answers I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he says thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me notice it wasn't hard for God it wasn't hard for Elijah it was only hard for Elisha because thou has chosen the harder way was a way of thy own choosing listen this was his choice and we preached on it last night it's got to be your choice and notice he comes to this place and here's this expectation you could say and here's this here's this expectation upon the heart of the of of Elisha and this this transfer of anointings got to come to him it's got to become more than just Elijah's message it's got to become Elisha's message it's got to become more than just Elijah's Mantle it's got to become Elisha's mantle and that same faith and that same expectation would need to be transferred notice this is exactly the same Jordan River that you find just years before that and here's Mo here's Joshua crossing over the Jordan we read about it in in Joshua chapter 4 and Joshua chapter 4 he's saying take up the stones here they're going to Cross Jordan and he says I want you to take a place the priests are going to come into Jordan and they're going to represent something to the rest of the people now brother Brandon says Jordan types death it types sin you could say it types the ultimate death and the change of our bodies when death is swallowed up in Victory and so they're they're representing something here as they cross over into Jordan and God tells Joshua I want the priest to come into the water and he says and when the when the souls of the priest feet touch Jordan Jordan will park now notice it's not before this it's not when they expect it not when God even says it but until they take their foot and they put their foot in death or they put their foot in what the rest of everybody else listen to me they were doing something that not the rest of everybody would have to do but it was their commission it was their place it was how God ordained them it was their calling or you could say they're anointing upon their life was to take their foot and put it in Jordan for the rest of the people and God says I want these priests to go into the Jordan and he says when The Souls of the Jordan when The Souls of the priesthood they would put their foot in you imagine now listen they didn't have to this the the this is this is not made up by their mind it's not they didn't think of it of themselves but this is God's order and God says I want them to take their foot and I want them to place it in the Jordan and then Jordan moves back they take another step here's the waters party here's another priest and he puts his foot in the water and then Waters Jordan just Parts just a little bit I want to show you and I really hope this is okay to do come here I need the ministry team to come here just for a moment I want you to stand where you're at brother Tim and Timothy face him and brother Aaron I want you to face brother Joe I want almost like we do a prayer line here just face this way here right in front of him right in front of him I want you to notice come here brother Joe stand right beside brother Tim brother Aaron I want you to notice here this is the order that God sets for the Israelites to cross over into Canaan face brother Aaron here brother Joe and God says I want the priests to stand in the water I want them because when the priests step into the water Jordan's going to part and how are the people going to get over owned to dry land because priests are standing in their Commission in their calling they're placing their feet in the Jordan on behalf of the rest of the body listen to me these ministers and these God called men that God's put in your life will have to go through things that you may never experience you have no idea some of the Mind battles some of the troubles some of the struggles some of the voices that try to speak to their mind but this is a place in a position when God ordains a man to stand in the Jordan it's for the protection it's for the anointing it's for the Deliverance it's for the victory for the people Hallelujah and God says take your families now that Jordan has parted there's a highway going through Jordan and so families begin to go through and families take their little ones and they take the husband and the father and they move past the Jordan and they go on to dry land you say why do they cross on Joy like dry land because there's a priest who's got his foot in the water he's standing in the gap for the rest of the congregation and I just want to represent her for a moment do you realize what would happen if preachers stop preaching do you realize what would happen if these preachers took their foot out of the Jordan sin would cover our churches it would flood our pulpits listen to me friends if preachers really did put down their notes and close their iPads and their laptops and stop studying the word of God sin would flood our churches it would flood our homes you want to thank God this morning that you've got a Ministry that'll keep their fruit in the water I say brother stay in the water stay in Jordan stay in your commission stay in your anointing it'll get us home someday Hallelujah stay under the anointing stay under the preaching of the word of God I'm just going to stay here and state my claim and say I'm not taking my foot out of Jordan I don't care what others say I don't care others who are compromising I'm going to keep my feet planted and send the Jordan River you say how long brother Matt until it's finished until the work has finished God bless you Brothers why don't you give him a hand this morning say thank God for a Ministry hallelujah oh do we have a church that'll say preach it to me Pastor preach me the word of God don't compromise for anybody don't compromise for any Spirit preach me that Full Gospel I say thank God for a Ministry that I'll preach it bare knuckled straight truth and not compromise they don't tell me regardless if it hurts my feelings the truth of the word now notice this is going to be important because he says I want you to take the stone his foot was here Joshua take the stone that he stood upon not just any storm but that left Manasseh and here's all the tribes are represented each man of trump and here's Reuben and here's his foot and the priest priest is representing that tribe he says his right foot was here so they take a stone his left foot was here and they'd take a stone no no I think it was right it wasn't over here it was right there right there and he takes that stone and he places that stone and what is it it's going to be a memorial say why is that important brother Matt why couldn't there just be any stone why couldn't it just be anything why couldn't this be any old Doctrine any old thing that's preached no friends these were going to be the original faith of what the priest stood upon of what they believed of what they preached of what they lived because brother random said it would be these divinely revealed truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers back to 80 33 back to the supernatural back to the expectation back to Victory it'll be these stones that represent something there's going to be a certain promise there's going to be an anointing and nothing else will turn your hearts back no other ministry will turn your heart back listen to me friends no other Ministry had the ministry of Elijah because he was anointed with a message to turn your hearts back and you couldn't get it anywhere else Elisha knew that I'm not going to leave I'm tearing right by your side you couldn't get it there was good preachers good doctors of divinity great meetings good things that were happening but there was only one Elijah Ministry let me just stop here and say there's only one group of people who can receive that Elijah message that's a special group A peculiar group a royal priesthood a holy nation do you realize you've been ordained to receive the anointing of the message of Malachi 4. you say brother Matt what does that mean that means our churches and our people are drenched with a promise of oil they're drinks with a promise you say what promise a victory of overcoming of power of healthy bodies of healthy churches come on help me preach somebody you're anointed this morning you've got an anointing upon your life you've been anointed to believe the word of God that's why you pull on the word of God it isn't a workup it isn't just because we're shouting up here you're anointed to believe it [Music] that's why when a preacher preaches I'm not up here preaching anything new to you I'm not up here giving you some kind of new revelation I'm only stirring what's already down on the inside of you and when you hear it you identify and you say yes brother that's me I identify with that message that's my message that's my anointing that's my promise Elisha you must come under the anointing you must come under the expectation it's got to be it's got to leave and be righteously it's going to leave Elijah's lips and it's got to come upon your lips that's why brother Brandon said the word of God on the lips of Believers he said it's never failed on the mouths of his believing family why it's the promise of Jesus that's been transferred off of this Bible down into the faith of your heart and you accept it and you believe it and then it becomes your reality you know this is what an anointing was an anointing is that charismatic would use that word in the cliche and there's a very very great truth to it but it's almost just become an anoint and it's just an annoying today they're all of there they don't know really no you say brother Matt isn't a true anointing well brother Branham said that it certainly was but you know what a you know what a real anointing was in the Bible and I won't try to pronounce this word but in anointing it was to smear we spoke on this last night it was to smear or to rub with oil you would take a king who was going to be anointed to be king and they would take oil and they'd pour it on him and they'd anoint his life what were they doing they were commissioning him for a purpose he was going to serve a very special purpose he was going to serve a very special commission they would anoint men like this and they were anointing them or consecrating that office for service in Bible times people were Anointed with oil to signify God's blessing or the call upon that person's life in Exodus and second Kings and Ecclesiastes they were anointed for a special purpose or a special Mission or a special job with special Specific Instructions and so Elijah you can even see this here as David Praises I think it's Psalms 133 and you could read about it and David says oh how precious it is when Brethren dwelled together in unity it's like the oil that flowed from Aaron's head down to his beard all the way down to the collar of his shirt down to the urum and thumbem all the way down to the ground this is what the oil of anointing was to do you say why brother man because in that high priest or that the high priest who would go on the day of Yom Kippur and he would enter in with that tablet he would take that urum and thumb him and then that urum was not just pretty Stones here was the topaz and the carbuncle and the barrel and the Onyx and the Sardis and all of these these weren't just fancy stones or beautiful stones but the stones were representing a tribe and within that tribe represented a family and within that family was a dad and a mom and children and needs and prayer requests and issues and problems and diseases both in the body and in the mind and so Yom Kippur Aaron the high priest would take that tablet and that tablet when he would go into the holiest of holies on the day of atonement and what was he doing he was representing all of the people he was representing all of the families he was representing all of the issues he was representing all of the prayer requests everything that they had as an expectation or a need in their life and that oil would flow it would move or help you catch it here this morning it would flow from the head not just it wasn't in an oil that was just kind of going to come upon the high priest but that oil would flow into the tablet it would flow over all the families what was it representing that that oil had to go from the high priest it had to go from the preacher down into the people's lives that you would come under the same anointing and the same power to serve the same God with the same promise for your life I say today you're anointed it's not just Ministry the ministry has an anointing but you've got an anointed and in your life as a Believer to take the word of God and Conquer The Devil in your family and in your home you've been commissioned and anointed by the anointing oil can we go a little further this morning you love the Lord that oil was going to represent something that was going to transfer something you notice here even brother Brandon begins to talk about this and the message why Christ speak and notice brother Branham says here he says may the Holy Spirit we paraphrase this last night May the Holy Spirit teach us today the things that we ought to know and may we then in return listen closely to every word may we listen closely to every word may we weigh it deeply and then may those who are listening by the way of take Bay they listen close may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us let me just make you aware the holy spirit is always trying to reveal himself to you personally I say oh God don't let me miss it this morning oh God let me pay attention and listen up close how many with me would say Lord if you're trying to speak let me hear it in My Heart Lord Jesus let me not miss it how many times would brother Brandon say that in his sermons don't miss it come to a sister from a prayer line sister don't miss it come to his sermon don't miss it don't miss what the holy spirit's trying to reveal before we realize if he should anoint us then the anointed is not in vain it's for a purpose it might work to the good to the Lord and may our hearts an understanding be open Lord he knows how to do these things and how to deal with man he knows what's in man he knows what you say how does he know because he's the one who put it there you didn't he knows what's inside of you he says he knows we don't we only know from the intellectual side he knows what's really in the man and he knows listen to what brother Brandon says he knows he says Moses was born in this world and a gifted boy he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born born born with the equipment born inside of him born already before you ever breathed your first breath God knew every trial you'd go through God knew every circumstance that you would face in your life listen to me you might have thought oh that's just Misfortune it just happened to me listen God has ordained the footsteps of your life before you were ever born he knew every trial he knew every sorrow he knew every heartache he knew everything you'd have to go through as his son or his daughter and he's equipped you for the job oh I just feel the Holy Spirit that's for somebody here this morning you're already equipped for the job it's already down inside of you stop looking for your answer somewhere else or somewhere down the street it's already inside the seed of God all you got to do is believe it all you got to do is confess it [Applause] it's already there brother Brandon would go so far as to say everything you have need of for this life's journey even the rapture it's already inside the seed of God that he placed before the foundation of the world you say brother Matt why does that make you excited that means if I didn't have anything to do with it to start then I can't have anything to do with it to stop it if I didn't start it I can't stop it it's Unstoppable it's the Unstoppable power of God and nothing I can do will change that no height no give no sorrow no sickness no death oh can somebody accept that this morning and say Satan you can't stop it oh hell can't stop it all the powers of Darkness can't stop it I'm Anointed with a prop I'm Anointed with an equipment if it was already inside of me you say I don't know how to raise those kids I don't want to be a mom don't know how to be a dad it's already inside of you [Applause] the equipment's already there listen none of us could give our kids the Holy Ghost none of us if I had a big red button that you could come up and push and it would give your kids the Holy Ghost I guarantee you would have a stampede an evening like Tabernacle you'd have moms and dads jumping over the pews and getting to that button if you could give them the Holy Ghost I promise you would how many moms would say Amen to that I'd give them it too much you know what God didn't give you that ability God didn't give you that place he didn't commission you that way you say then what can I do brother Matt what weapons do I have preach it to him tell it to him teach it to him bring them to church bring them in the right atmosphere so the word of God in their hearts the seeds already there all it needs is the right atmosphere all it needs is for that light to strike a cross tip listen mom and dad you can't give it to them but you can preach it to them you can live it before them you can talk it to them you could show them you could bring them to the house of God and then put your faith in a promise that when the anointed word of God flashes across that seed all hell can't stop it from coming forth he'll say Lazarus counselor and I don't care how dead they are I don't care how distant they are I don't care if they're not in this service today all hell can't stop it Mom oh hell can't stop it Dad Hallelujah the word of God on the mouths of believing Christians has never failed I say confess it today speak it today why did Hattie Wright ask for her children why did Hattie ask for her children so you mom could ask for your child so that you would have faith to transfer that promise from a little humble woman down into your family into your home you sit by the map but they're not even here today they're not even serving the lord you don't know how distant you don't know how far you don't know what they've said you don't know what they've done you don't know the circumstances you don't know the past you know what brother Brandon said he said if you're sick this morning and you're in a sick body he said what you do is you imagine a well-body and you start walking towards it I say today if your children are not here you imagine them at this altar you imagine them with hands raised you imagine them shouting and start walking towards your promise start walking towards your Victory say God it's my inheritance this is my promise Lord I'm not gonna stop I'm not gonna quit I'm not gonna give up let me just tell you what the Holy Spirit told me in that office and I'm going to believe it because I've said it when I preached the sermon and the Holy Spirit came to me and spoke to me and said tell somebody in this church today don't give up on your promise now you accept that as from the Lord don't give up on your promise I don't care how many years it's been I don't care how many months it's been and don't let the devil reinterpret it and say it'll be different it's not going to be that way God said I'll do it outperform it just the way I spoke it I'm going to do it exactly like I told you Sarah I'm going to do it exactly like I told you I'm going to perform it you're anointed to believe it [Applause] do you realize this is why brother Brandon would speak to a storm so that you'd speak to your story this is why he would had he would have a little woman and say God what do you want anything you say right now and she said the salvation of my boys why so that I could have faith for my children I say don't give up on your promise he's born with the equipment already as every man comes into the world is born with this equipment Moses born and he was afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed and notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith the more he was born to deliver this people and yet it never came to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across it until he seen not something he read about I love this so much not something he just read about something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh I said God give our young people give our families give me that kind of experience something that he spoke to and something that spoke back oh how that did bring I think any man or woman or boy or girl think about an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth can never have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light let me tell you you can hang a picture of the pillar of fire and that's wonderful but until you meet that light for yourself until that light comes and anoints your life I say God how many would pray that and say Lord anoint my life anoint My Faith Lord Jesus he says here notice he says no hundreds and hundreds of years before this Israel be mistreated sojourn and strange come to him and stay there 400 years but God with the mighty hand would bring them out so you see with this Burning Bush just as we know um as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the Rapture now notice what he goes to I want you to pay attention closer a man asked me about the coming in the rapture we know we've lived the time out I'm the time of the Rapture is that hand what was brother random looking for what was the prophet of God looking for what was brother Branham seeking he says and we're looking for rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength to give it some super natural strength you know what that means in the Bible when it's at hand do you know what that means the kingdom of God is at hand it means it's within your reach I hope you catch it here this morning that promise that's been coming a long time is now at hand it's within your grasp it's within your reach brother Adam says what's he doing every day he's reaching every day he's looking you say brother Matt what are you doing every day of my life I'm reaching to say God give me a supernatural strength I'm reaching out Lord to touch you I'm reaching I'm looking I'm expecting give it some Supernatural super natural I'm preaching to you on anointed by the supernatural give it some Supernatural strength I can change these bodies that we live in oh my body just said amen my back pain just said hey man oh my body how many bodies could say Amen I'm looking for some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies one day to give it some Supernatural straight that can change these bodies we live in when we see a god that can raise the dead off the floor or out in the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who can take a cancer that's ate a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that did you catch it what ought to give you rapturing faith brother random points to a man who is dead dead and he's raised to life he points to a man who has cancer and all hope is lost and all doctors have given up and there's no chance for him and brother Brandon points to these two examples and said that ought to give us rapturing Faith what ought to give the church rapturing Faith what do you see here brother Matt I see here that it's going to take something that's apart from me that has listen it's impossible you said brother man is it impossible with man it's impossible but With God all things are possible I'm more convinced now more than I ever been in my life the same power that heals your body is the same power that will sweep over your body one day and it'll change you from the very Atomic level the same power to believe in Divine Healing and heal your body is the same power that'll sweep over our bodies one day and change it in the moment in the twinkling of it it's got to be something if the faith that saved me was nothing I can do of myself it'll have to be the same faith changes my body he says it's a man we see of cancer and he's raised up you know we just experienced that back home in our little town I know Supernatural things are happening listen not just here not just there but all around the world you say brother Matt why are these Supernatural events taking place because the prophet of God said when all hell turns loose all Heaven turn Limitless preach for a moment listen to me Satan is not unborn he's as bold as he's ever been he's right out in the open he's right out there arrogantly bowed and shown himself and he doesn't hide it anymore doesn't hide it somewhere in a closet it's right out in the open I just have to believe that if the devil wants to manifest himself out in the open I just happen to believe that all Heaven has a desire to manifest itself all out in the open step when all hell turns loose Oh Heaven let's go I say let go Heaven I say let go angels I say poured out God pour it out upon me pour it upon my family pour it upon my children pour it upon my mind pour it upon my spirit oh God he's manifested himself say brother Matt you believe it's going to get more and more I already know it's more and more and it ain't gonna stop there it's going to keep on going it's going to keep on moving until this body changes until my mind until my flesh until my all of my troubles are changed in a moment they sing about it today oh that anointing he anoints me my cup runneth over you say brother Matt what anointing an anointing of rapture in faith an anointing that can change your vile body back home we had a man a man in our church uh brother Travis Jackson Who some of you might know one of my closest friends Lord's given me brother Travis has just an incredible testimony we won't have time to tell this morning the testimony you'd have to hear it but some of these brothers can testify I mean 13 14 years ago he came to the message and boy if he's you say brother Matt how's his fire it was a fire then it's an inferno now because he did the brother Travis has just got such a faith just such a faith to believe in the word of God came was searching for God his whole life you know from even from the time he was just a little boy maybe 14 years old started reading this Bible mom and dad his dad was a bastard deacon at the Beaufort Baptist Church his family was religious lived in a good home and and Travis just began to seek the Lord and begins to read the Bible and he he goes to the New Testament he reads during the gospels and then he reads through the book of Acts and he reads all of Paul's letters and and he's saying this is where's these people he goes to he goes to his pastor and of a church there and he goes to the youth leader and he says you know you people are wonderful lovely people he says but where's the god I read about in the Bible where's the where's the Performing of where's the men who are filled with the Holy Ghost where are these men that are filled with the spirit of God like Peter like Stephen and he could say with his eye he'd be in full of the Holy Ghost where's these men that are filled and where's the Miracles where's the Wonders and signs that we see why don't we see you people are good Christians you know that you lead her he'd go from church to church man he'd go from church the church the church that he was a church Opera true bona fide Church Chopper and you go to that youth pastor that Pastor and he'd say where's and they'd always say Travis said they'd say the same exact thing every single time it was like a parrot every single time they'd say well brother Travis those are wonderful things you read about in the Bible but you see the apostolic days are over that doesn't happen anymore and the days of Miracles are over listen this is exactly what they tried to tell brother Brandon almost identical verbatim of what these men were saying it goes to the mega church of our of our back home big old non-denominational massive mega church and he goes to that Pastor gets a minute with him tells him what about men we read about in the Bible what about Holy Ghost Field men oh brother Travis you know those were all good days and those were those where God was doing special things then but he's spoken again at Sun Dry times through his you know through the prophets but now he's spoken to us by his son and and you know and and and those days are over brother Travis we don't really believe in though you don't see those kind of things now it's just a faith that you believe and you just accepted and you just confess it and repeat the sinner's prayer and then you you know and Travis said that just didn't sit right with me he said I just I heard them but then I'd read the Bible at home and say something ain't right here he goes to his parent his mom's closet to this day doesn't know how the book ever got there he's flipping through the books then there's a book without a spine doesn't have the spines broken on the pages are torn the front cover is going but he turns to the first page and it's the book acts of the prophet just so happened to be in his doesn't know to this day mom doesn't know came read that book and it's all here's a man here's a man of God here's the kind of man I read about in the Bible because his mom says mom where did that book come I don't know she takes it she starts to read it she's a secretary of Plumbing business and she's there reading in a man from our church comes there and he sees it he says what no what are you reading there oh there's a book my son found we don't know how like what does your son like that book she says oh yeah he man he loves this book so that brother comes over he brings him Owen Jurgensen I don't know what book but he brings the supernatural blue books to it and since I want him to read this and boy brother Travis starts reading through that book you know just reading all through it and and he doesn't whatever he read was inconclusive of as if brother Branham was still alive so you know what brother Travis starts doing he starts asking everybody hey do you know a man named William Branham huh do you know a man named William Branham you ever heard of a man named William Brown he's driving into in a truck his HVAC Tech and he's he's driving with a a man from our church who had divorced and backslid and his life with just went into chaos he left the church in backslid and was just out of out of the house that God had been for years we didn't even know it is left suddenly and I didn't know if he was even still in the Beaufort area and Travis just so happens is riding with Dave they're riding down the road you know just in here Dave and shorts and he's just a just a world who looks like anybody else Travis doesn't know he's even a Christian and he says hey Dave have you ever heard of a man named William Branham Dave said every hair he doesn't have many but every hair on his head stood up he said uh well uh uh have I ever heard of William Branham he said well uh yeah Tara said right you've heard of him finally somebody you've heard of this man he said yeah he said there's actually a church in Beaufort he said in Beaufort I live in Beaufort where at in Beaufort and he says well they're a little church there in Beaufort he said they believe in you know that this man was a seventh Church age messenger and Travis thinking seventh Church Age and what messenger and what he says well they believe he's a prophet Travis said well definitely I mean that's obvious he was a prophet [Applause] pretty obvious and he said see the power of God he says my goodness he said this man how do you know him so that night we get a phone call I get a phone call from Dave who I haven't heard from and probably I don't know how many years phone Dave oh my goodness how are you doing and he's nervous he says brother Matt he says listen I'm I'm in no place to to witness he said I got a situation he said my life's all messed up he said I gotta I gotta have help here he said there's a fella just a worldly guy Rider with me and out of the blue he just asked me who's William Brown have you ever heard of William Branham he said I got to be honest it's the last name I wanted to hear he said just my life it brought such conviction on my life he said I'm not living where I should he said would you is there any way you could meet brother Travis you know I don't have the time to tell this whole testimony but we go into his house that night and and we go into Dave's house not knowing who he was going to meet and walk into that little room there I am with my brother another brother from Edmonton and he just happened to be visiting in town and I just told him I said this this man just asked him who William Brandon is we're going to see what this is about so we go in there brother Travis if he told his testimony and if he was standing here he said that when he he said when the door opened and he said and three men walked in he said a voice spoke and said behold men of the Lord behold men full of the Holy Ghost Travis said I knew immediately this is what I was looking for my whole life little did Brother Travis know when I told him where our church was it was about 400 yards away from his house he'd lived in in his whole life he said you mean what I've been searching for has been 400 yards from my house listen friends sometimes what you're looking for is right in front of you sometimes what you're searching for is right in front of you you're looking for something way down the road and it's right here Supernatural testimony you get to hear more about how his mom and dad came into the message that's Believers now for years and years solid strong brother Travis never lost his faith tells everybody you ever you ain't gonna be around Travis for more than five minutes I don't care who you are and you're going to talk about the Lord he calls me and he says brother man he actually texted our whole Ministry team and everybody was out of town except me that day I happened to be preaching that Sunday he says you and maybe three months before this I had met a man uh there at an event who he introduced me to because Travis went from church to church and the last church he went to before that event he was going to Evangelical Vineyard kind of church a cool Church kind of thing and uh and so he's he's there and this man is an associate pastor uh to Travis Travis one of the ones who was you know he was talking to his name was Marcus Humphrey and he and he introduces me to Mrs brother Matt this is the Pat this is the associate pastor the church I attended and he said I want you to meet him he's a wonderful guy just a you know a real Christian guy and then Travis really had a desire to witness to him and so I go up and I meet this man I mean he's strong healthy guy just you know just real health conscious family and and he's and he's you know there and I'm meeting three months he said well three months go down the road and Travis calls he says you remember the man you met I said yeehoo he said Marcus I said the big you know tall guy said yeah yeah he said that's him he said Mary called me today his wife and and she's crying and he said she's he's been diagnosed with cancer terminal cancer and they've doctors have given up he's tried chemo eight times and hasn't took it hasn't done nothing they've sent him home to die I said my goodness that he said yay so these they've given up on hope he said but I would you go with me and would you lay hands for him and we'll pray for him I said absolutely brother Travis I said just so happened that was Saturday just so happened I was preaching the next day just so happened I had been studying the book what cancer is you ever read that sermon called healing what cancer is so I was already man a loaded gun had every bit of thing I wanted to say and I've been discouring that but was going to preach on something entirely you know but that book was my main theme and just read through it I said we're going to go there so we go to this man's house in his living room and and I just began to as we walked into that room you could see Marcus and there this was not the same man I had seen I mean he was just curled over and shriveled up just real weak looking and hair was gone and just uh you know real weak had a tumor about the size of a grapefruit off of his neck and he sat sitting there and his family's there and and we we knock on the door she lets us in we go up and and we I look at him and there's another family there is trustee from his church and and and they're a cancer son had passed away from cancer she's a advocate for you cancer research and she's there and there the scene we walked in was just real you're almost deaf it was just real real low and and just didn't have much hope and so I didn't really know how to you know what we were going to do we sit there we're waiting and and so Travis asked him said Marcus what is it you know what have they said he said well you know Travis they've they've given up Pope he said I just I didn't want to die this way but you know it's appointed unto every man he's just resigned to the fact he's going to die tried chemo eight times and you know he said it's just it's felt he said and you know I just uh he said I I don't know he said I don't know what to do he said it's just it's the end for me you know and and Travis said well Marcus he says you know I just want to can I talk to you for a minute he said I just have some things I want to say upon my heart and he said he said I just want to tell you and we began to Travis begin to talk and he and he says I you know you're wonderful people and you're good people and he says but I just feel like since you've got a death sentence he said and you're going to die I said I just I just don't figure there's any sense in mints and words I'm just going to be real straight and tell you exactly you know how I feel and he says you know Marcus when I was at your church and he said and I left your church he said I was seeking for something he said I was there looking for a real God who who was the he said a God who was still alive the god of the Bible that we read about he said I was looking for a men that were filled with the Holy Ghost it never made sense to him how he'd go to the church and then in the deacons were outside smoking a cigarette and that night they'd have a social drink he said it just never made any sense to me how you know these are Christian supposed Christian men he said but I knew that there was something more Marcus and he said and I want to tell you I found that something more and he said I found a supernatural God who's still alive today who still raises the dead he still heals the sick he still fills with the Holy Ghost and he said he's still got the power of God he said there's an Apostolic power that's been restored there's seven Church ages and seven Messengers and and he said and I just want to tell you God is not in your denomination he's a that's a dead God he said he's not in your Trinity of gods I'm thinking my goodness he just laid it all on them I didn't know what he was going to say and I'm just going whoa he's not in your Trinity that's a that's a false Doctrine he's been revealed as a you know and Travis just starts to really lay it upon him and I'm just wondering how he's going to take it you know and he's he's been revealed and he's a real God and God can raise you from the dead God can heal you from that cancer I don't care how hopeless it is and here's my friend Matt why don't you talk with Matt I said well and Travis said Marcus he said I hope I didn't offend you he said I Travis if you knew he was this real sincere guy he about he said he said Marcus he said I didn't I I didn't mean to air I hope nothing I said hurt you or hurt your feelings I believe you're wonderful Christian people but I just and Marcus just bowed his head and never forget he said no he said no Travis He said in fact when you knocked at the door and your friend knocked at the door he said a voice spoke and said these are men sent from God hear what they have to say he said so I was prepared for anything you were going to say I said Thank You Jesus you believe he's still that kind of God he makes the way take no thought for what you'll say take no thought don't stress over it give God a chance give God an opportunity and so I just began to speak to him and I said well I said let me just tell you Marcus eyes begin to go through all of these things brother Brandon teaches us and what cancer is and I told him I said that life that's living on you that's a demon Spirit Marcus I said that's a life that's living off of your life the doctors have given it a name named cancer he was diagnosed with stage four Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and he's I said that that disease I said is given a name I said they've named it and I said hey if doctors can can they got wonderful tools and wonderful medicine and if they could get it out of you and scrape every piece of it and you're then that's wonderful God heals in more ways than one God heals by medicine heals by doctors and I said you know I said but I said but let me just tell you uh that that life that's living on your life that's a that's a life that's a spirit in Mark 9 when Jesus spoke to the deaf and dumb man he didn't say thou death disease come out of the man or thou a sudden deafness or whatever Jesus said thou deaf spirit come out of the man and don't enter him again and I said what was he doing he was speaking to the life that's in that cancer that's living off of your life that set up a life of its own that's a spirit Mary began to say I she said I've never I've she said I've never heard that before but that's exactly what the Bible said and I said that's right I said that life if I said now listen I said you know and I just begin to pray with him I began to talk to him and I said you know those doctors have a tool bag and they've got tools all inside of there and things they could look at I said today I don't have that I said but I do have a bag full of promises and I said I got promises that are still just as real today as the day Jesus spoke them out of his lips I said those same words that he spoke can come to your life what was it those words can transfer off of the page into your body and heal you of that disease Mary said I've always believed in the Supernatural and and you could just tell that the atmosphere was starting to change I said in fact there was a little sister I said in a church in Louisiana I said she was diagnosed with the very same disease that you had stage four Hodgkin's lymphoma I said the same exact thing I began to tell her I begin to tell about sister Elena I began to tell her testimony let me just tell you sister Elena that testimony has shook the devil's Kingdom around the entire world what God did for you wasn't just for you it was for the body around the world it is shaking the devil's Kingdom what was it a faith that left a testimony of a sister in Louisiana got upon somebody in South Carolina and that same promise Came Upon that little that room I began to testify and I hope it's okay I asked if it would be okay and they gave me permission so I hope that's okay but I just begin to testify of this I said this one I said this little sister I said she was diagnosed with the same exact thing you were I pulled up even just recently before I was preaching a sermon I'd never read it before and my wife has friends with sister Elaine on Facebook and I had read something and I just wanted to pull it up and I I just began to read it and I begin to read how that two days before a week before Christmas she was diagnosed with stage four Hodgkin's lymphoma and two days after Christmas she started the first of 12 12 chemo treatments and they told me after four treatments they would do a pet scan to see how my body's responding I believe God Is A Healer I've told that to anyone who asked how I'm doing I told them I was looking to him and believed that he would heal me on Sunday I leap and danced before the Lord with joy and victory because I knew it was already a finished work even though I didn't know how or when even though there was no proof yet you say brother Matt does it matter listen to me friends sometimes what you do naturally has a supernatural consequence sometimes what you think is just physical you're just doing it as a supernatural reaction sometimes what you bind in Earth will be bound in heaven sometimes what you speak on Earth will which you loose will be loosed in heaven sometimes it takes a natural thing to move something in the Supernatural why did Banks Woods would brother Brandon throw up a rock in the air and it started a little change what was it doing it changed the atmosphere and that little disturbance was a tornado that landed on Alaska nearly sunk it Wyatt had it right come on somebody why did Hattie Ray have to open her mouth not just think it in her mind but she opened her mouth and said that's nothing but the truth brother Branham amen I believe it brother Branham that's nothing but the truth what was she doing Naaman had to dip why did he have to go one time two time three why did Jesus spit on the ground and he rubbed a little mud together and wiped it on a man's why because the naturals connected to the spiritual and what you do naturally when you say Amen to the word of God you're disturbing the atmosphere around you you're speaking to that devil you're speaking to that depression you're speaking to that life I say do something natural and it'll have a supernatural consequence why did sister Elena get up and run around the church she was doing something naturally and it moved Heaven Supernatural I say God don't let me hinder me don't let nothing hinder my praise don't let nothing hinder my voice I'm gonna speak against the doubt I'm gonna speak against the devil I'm gonna speak against the destruction in my life I'm going to speak against the Deliverance that I need I'm gonna speak [Applause] she did something naturally and all of Heaven moved you think it's important for you to use your voice sometimes your voice may be quiet and I don't care how small it starts I don't care how little it is footsteps mean possession testified and I said see here here She was what I dread but this is this is what she writes in her testimony on Sunday I leaped and danced before the Lord with joy and victory because I knew it was already finished work they were singing what have I to dread what have I to fear leaning on the Everlasting Arms I was preaching at a church in Flagstaff just here recently and I'd never read this before but the Holy Spirit dropped in that office and said read this testimony I'd never even read it I pulled it off of there I pasted it in my notes and I began to read it never read it I gotta read what I'm going to say I want to read the testimony and it's on their song Services going on as I read these words a week before two week before Christmas I'm going through it and I've come to the part not even realizing they had started a song and as I read these words sister Elena what have I to dread what have I to fear leaning I hear it as my words as those words were in sync with the song leaders I read that leaning on the Everlasting arms I have blessedness with my Lord so did leaning on the Everlasting noise what does it do it disturbs the atmosphere what does worship do what does music do what does singing Do It lifts you up out of this natural as brother right now was told by the angel of the Lord if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand in your way not even cancer what was it brother Brandon was here but the people were here so why did he preach why did he testify he was trying to get the people to lift where he was and all things are possible and all things are possible to those that believe that's why we preach the word of God we're casting out the devil we're rebuking the spirit of fear we're rebuking the spirit of anxiety we're rebuking the spirit of failure we're preaching Victory we're preaching hope we're preaching Deliverance we're preaching salvation and you've got to reach out and take a hold of it it's at hand reach out and grab it say Lord I need Faith this morning I need my wayward loved one saved I'm going to reach out [Applause] thank you what about a fear they didn't only Everlasting Arms that was that service I preached throughout the Angel and the Lord spirit of God so strong as sister who had been battling arthritis in her hands and she had a baby hands all crippled up hurting her everywhere came through that prayer line that day the angels of the Lord supernaturally touched that sister she drove me after she said I've never battled it again all the pains left my hand all the pains left my body the doctor said I'd battle it forever why because God has sent an anointing of faith upon the heart of a sister and it transferred from the Bible [Applause] I begin to just tell him this testimony she says David dance Miriam Marion sounds strange to me but in the Bible marry him dancing with joy when she crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians and slaves who had enslaved them were drowned David danced for Joy when he saw the Ark of the Covenant brought back to Jerusalem it's an expression of extreme joy and victory I know my healing would come sooner or later because that Jesus the Jesus Christ of the Bible the great healer is the same Jesus I've served for 27 years I love this so much she's this is what she wrote I'm sure you've read it declare war on the devil declare war on the devil no retreat oh I just want to say this and preach it to you I want that to become a fresh anointing for your for your family and your children you got unsaved loved ones declare war on the kingdom of darkness in your life you need healing this morning declare war on the devil no retreat lay hold on to his promises she says yesterday I had my pets together today I met with a doctor for my fifth treatment he informed me that cancer is already gone I had a seven centimeter tumor in my lung and multiple lymph nodes that were affected in the picture you'll see the before and after I know you've seen this before the second is totally clear he said this is dramatic I don't want you to forget what God did because the same God the same promise a still Justice real right now [Music] is just as real right now I begin to testify and showed that sister I shouldn't marry that PET scan you could see her she looked at almost took her breath away she shows me Marcus here's Marcus and he's sitting there in his living room tumor about the size of a grapefruit on his neck giving up to die let's begin to testify to him and I said his wife began to look at that picture tears began to well up and I said no Marcus the same God who touched that sister is no respecter of persons and that same God is still here he's in this living room right now and he could touch your body a body that was so full of cancer you can see it in his pet scan went from down normally in this kind of pet scan he had done you can actually see the Blackness of the heart and the lungs and the kidney you can't see any of that there it's just cancer everywhere started on his neck had tumors the size of apples down on his on his legs going all the way down his calf muscles just all messed up everywhere you know what had happened this man was told he was going to die and he accepted that death sentence he had completely given up you know it's easier to have faith for somebody than it is to have faith for yourself sometimes and he had completely given up on himself completely to the point to where he had resigned himself to the fact that he was going to die you know sometimes it's harder when God puts you through something and Satan's attacking your family and your home it's much easier to believe for somebody else than this for you but you know what happened you know what happened in the Bible Jesus was was in a building and he was surrounded by multitudes and there was a man who was lame couldn't get to Jesus he was in a bed couldn't walk he was he he was lame in that bed but you know what happened his friends go over to him and they pick up the bed that he was in and They Carried him to Jesus because that man maybe couldn't have faith for himself but there was somebody who could have faith and stand in the gap for him and the Bible says when they got to Jesus they couldn't get to him he's surrounded by crowds of people he said a little Hut and no one could get to him but you know what they didn't stop there they wasn't going to let any circumstance get in their way they climbed up on the roof of that house and they ripped the roof off and they lowered that man down to Jesus Hallelujah and Jesus said by your faith this man has made wealth maybe they're not here today I tell you in the name of the Lord lower them down to Jesus say God I'm ripping the roof off I'm Climbing Up on the Roof God touch their body touch their mind kill that cancer deliver them from sin Lord it won't be according to their faith it's according to your faith in the name of Jesus [Music] this man had completely given up I begin to pray we just stopped us and Marcus we're going to pray we laid our hands upon him never forget in that prayer I said Lord Justice Hezekiah was given a death sentence but he prays and he consults you and Prophet comes and says that the Lord granted more years to his life I said the Lord just as the doctors given this man a death sentence would you add years to his life we begin to pray you can feel the supernatural move in that room that living room we left that living room went back that day to feeling that we had done what we were supposed to do we left took our burdens to the Lord and we left them there and sometimes that's all you need to do quit thinking you got to work something up or build something up take your burdens to the Lord leave it there maybe two months three months later I didn't hear from him didn't know anything about it had not forgotten about it but certainly didn't know what his mind they'd given up on him he told him he just had a few months to live Travis just so happens to be sitting in my living room and he's there we're just talking and just talking it away not talking about markers or anything and just talking all of a sudden Travis gets a text and he's in the middle of something he just stops and he looks up he says brother man he says this is Mary Marcus's wife and he reads the text praise the Living God Marcus has been supernaturally healed of stage four Hodgkin's lymphoma he's 100 percent cancer oh you ought to Rejoice you ought to praise him Hallelujah he's 100 cancer-free because my God's greater than any circumstance he's greater than any problem he's greater than anything the devil puts in your life he's greater than the trouble he's greater than sin he's greater than addiction he's greater than cancer he's greater than depression he's greater than anything the same God sends a supernatural anointing upon your life that man is 100 cancer free Hallelujah I say let that testimony take the devil's Kingdom let it shatter the doors of the enemy let it break the prison bars oh Hallelujah I say House of Hell give way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ House of hell I speak to you today Satan let the word of God come upon your lips [Music] [Applause] oh give him praise Lord you're worthy you're worthy of all not praise Lord Jesus he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's

going to reach out in faith I'm going to take that promise from the word of God it's going to transfer from off of the words of Jesus onto a page of the Bible into my eyes and down into my body I accept it today oh how many need a promise here and you say I accept it I'm pulling that from the pages of the Bible and I take it into my body I take it into my mind I say release the power of God on
