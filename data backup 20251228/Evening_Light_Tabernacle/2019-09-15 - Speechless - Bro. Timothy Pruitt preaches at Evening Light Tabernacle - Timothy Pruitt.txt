Lord from our lips Lord and then or them to hearts who ears to receive we ask it in Jesus name Amen amen let's turn our Bibles to Matthew 22 in verse 1 [Music] he meant it's always good to be in the house of the Lord like David would say I was glad when they said unto me let's go into the house of the Lord amen there's singing in the house of the Lord there's deliverance in the house of the Lord there's so many wonderful things amen his presence is heaven to us a man a man Matthew 22 in verse 1 and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son that was sent forth and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come and again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my ox and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready coming to the marriage but they made light of it and went their way one to his farm another to his merchandise and the rim remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their cities then saith he unto his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage so those servants were sent to the highways and gathered together as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests when the king came in to see the guests he saw there was a man had not on a wedding garment and he said unto Him friend how come as thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the King to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness and there should be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen a men would let you be seated to see this morning I like to speak to you this morning on speechless something that's been on my heart for quite some time and Wednesday we spoke about the voice as of a trumpet and speaking about that voice and you know when that voice sounds and it speaks it's like as a lion roar it everything in the jungle just shuts up him and him and you know I was just reading the scripture of the wedding supper that was given or the wedding invitation it's an invitation to come to a wedding and everyone has received that wedding invitation you know there's the he said you know many that were which were called he was asked and asked them to come they would not come and so they even destroyed the servants and killed the servants that were or sent sent to give them at the invitation and then he tells them then go into the highways and byways and I'm thankful that the that wedding call has went into them highways in the byways and the places and the deep dark places of the earth to find those that are here's a man to be to call them to a place to where they can come and stand by his side but you know there was this one man that had come to the wedding but you know he must have come a different way there was some other way of coming because when you would come to a wedding it was actually showed there in the Orient even today as they do it when you come to and wet and you know you come and you don't you don't just come with the clothes that you wear but they actually will come and put a robe on you and that way everyone that comes to that wedding they all are the same whether they be rich or poor or they have a lot or they don't have much or are they be somebody on the street or they be someone in government when you come through the door and you put on this garment it makes everyone to be the same and and this is what Jesus is speaking of now we know the garment that he's speaking of is not clothes from a factory somewhere but the garment that we're required in this hour is the garment of the Holy Ghost that when you come into that his when you come to his wedding that it won't be one is rich one is poor one is a way of an important person one isn't nobody but everyone will be the same because they'll have that wedding garment on and and you know here this man came no doubt he came thinking that he can do it on his own or you know the voices that he would listen to that that you know well maybe it wasn't important to put that on or whatever but you know when he came and and the voice of God began or the King began to speak to him when that King spoke and said why have you now have you come to the wedding but you don't have a wedding garment and the Bible said he was speechless in other words no excuse could he offer there was nothing he good enough he could come up with to answer the king's question and and you know one has been given that opportunity and what you know in this time that we live in as far as here in this building you've been given opportunities after opportunities to put on the wedding garment and when you go before him you will be without excuse you won't have like that won't be a voice search or anything in your mind or anything that you can say or any voice that you can come up with your way you won't be able to say anything when you stand before that presence of God and you know and he was speechless he couldn't say a word he he couldn't he couldn't say anything and you know and he said that said to him friend he said friend so this man was not a stranger it wasn't somebody that that that you know shouldn't have been there or didn't get the invitation and didn't get the invite but he was he was some a you know a church member or he was somebody that was accustomed to being in the presence of God and you know here he said friend what are you doing here without the garment on why would you think that you could come on your own or why would you think that you could be good enough or why would you think that anything that you could do or you could be that you could manufacture on your own how do you think that you could do it on your own and not do it the way that I have asked you to do it and and this man couldn't come up with anything he was speechless you know now I get to thinking about those that are that will stand before the Judgment Day and and you know and they stand there and God asked the question why and what are they gonna better come up with to say why did you not go to that church or why did you not give yourself to God when I gave you opportunity after opportunity and you know there's gonna be many that's no doubt gonna stand there speechless you know not not have a word to offer not have anything to to give you know or not a nothing that they could come up with it's good enough in that presence and you know and then no doubt in their mind they'll go back to their mind and think about the opportunities and the wasted times and and the times they could have giving a heart to Mordor they could have surrendered they could have believed and they could have and all of that is all gone now and they have nothing but speechless and and you know and and here the time that this man was standing there and he was and brother Bannon was said like this he said was he a Presbyterian was he a Pentecostal why did he have a robe on he was dressed in just ordinary Street garbin and he said so it was one thing sure he hadn't come by the door he hadn't come by the way of Jesus Christ he hadn't hadn't come to get his robe on he maybe went by his own ideas or other voices or I went buys what his church said or what somebody else said or some man man theology or just shake a hand or just be sprinkled or something but it didn't come by the door if he had he would have repented he'd have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and received that baptism the Holy Ghost just exactly as everyone else there with a robe on did and he said he here he was he couldn't he didn't come by the door he said that's the door everyone has to go by he said because if he is the door he is the bridegroom he stands there the father given the invitation calling you you come up and he give you a robe and everyone receives it just the same way the baptism of the Holy Spirit come up and receive God except God be baptized calling upon the name of the Lord and the Holy Ghost comes in and feels you just like it did on the day of Pentecost it has to be the same way for every person that has a robe on a man he said but the man must have come in a window he must have slipped in some other way and when the King the bridegroom said friend how did you get in that showed that bent some good old-fashioned Holy Ghost preachers down therefore he stood speechless because he knew he had had the opportunity mercy and he said maybe you know and some meeting he knew better he knew but before God he couldn't say I never heard about it he couldn't say I never had the opportunity because he had been in some Holy Ghost meetings he had seen the lame walk yet seeing the blind see he had seen great miracles of God and there he stood speechless and he said why he said what did God say he said bind him hand and foot and throw him in the out of dark in the darkness and then be weeping and wailing the gnashing of teeth he said suit yourself friend that's the gospel he said that Jesus Christ onwards he said it wasn't just a parable it's a prophecy it'll be that way some day said some debts of the night while the gates are open and the waters are flowing free and everything is ready and the father is knocking at your heart he said son you've been in says son you've been playing Church long enough it's time you to get right he said I advise you to go by that door and get a robe all amen go by the way of repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the robe amen the righteousness of God see we try to come on our own abilities her own righteousness or all works or what we think our own ideas but you'll not get to the supper unless you come by that door unless you come by that Holy Ghost so what could he say what they come to the moment that whatever he could say was no good anymore he had said many things no doubt in the church service I'll I'll do it another time or I'll beer I'm good enough or I'm okay he'd said all kinds of stuff but when he came before the king he was speechless his words were no good no more his thoughts were no good no more what he could come up with on his own was worthless because he come by some other way beside the door what is the robe his sword the robe of Christ and when you adorn the robe of Christ it's the Spirit of Christ in you it's the Spirit of Christ if you have the Spirit of Christ in you you'll act like Christ it'll do the work oh Christ it'll have the gentleness the long-suffering the goodness of mercy the meekness the patience the Holy Spirit and that's why though his spirit is living within you but this man was speechless leaning maybe you know I thought well wait a minute I I'm a presbyterian I'm a Methodist I'm a Pentecostal I'm a messages believer that has nothing to do with it and that's nothing to do with that we're not interested in just becoming a name of some some creed or some Dogma or something we want the life of Christ we want him on display in our life so he didn't come by the door he he came by another way he came by a Baptist Church or he came by a Pentecostal church or heard maybe just came by methyl assure message Church just to believe or just to understand or just say I believe something but none of that's going to be any good no more when you come to this moment he came up maybe by some man's way or his own way or Church way or some other way but God has a provided way and that way is Jesus amen that way is Jesus and you come by Jesus and you take on the name of Jesus by spiritual baptism he meant when then you're dead and you take on Christ about the new birth and you're born again and you're filled with the spirit see when the Spirit of Christ comes in you it deals with all of your excuses all of your scooters are wiped away and they're no good no more yeah they come by the door then you row by the same spirit have the same kind of life have the same kind of testimony be the same person but the King says fellow friend why are you here without a wedding garment the question was asked why did you come without a wedding garment and the Bible said he was speechless he had no excuse I wonder how long it had been that he listened to the wrong voice the voice has said me know his brother band was saying you know he said I would get heart to the Lord a long time ago he said but there was a voice that said wait a little longer or there's voices that say I'm good enough there's voices that say I I I you know I I believe the message I've made it no it's more than of the word we're looking for more than just a belief system we're looking for more than just rules and regulations and and then man and voices of do's and don'ts we're looking for more than that we want the Spirit of God in our lives a man you know let's turn to proverbs 1 and verse 1 and we're gonna go through these chapters here this morning and feel bare with me because Solomon you know as Solomon would come into his kingdom he asked God for wisdom he asked God for more than man's intellect or more than man's abilities or more than his own knowledge or his own ways or whatever he could conjure up as a king he wanted more than that I believe we are as children of God we have that same desire we we want more than what we can think or what we can to come up with our own ways we want God's wisdom amen in the same that's wisdom that Solomon was looking for and asking for was not man's abilities as far as intellectual speaking him and all that only take you so far but what Solomon was asking for was God I want to hear your voice and say what you say and believe what you believe and let it be not Solomon's ideas and Solomon's ways but I want the wisdom of Almighty God and here we read in the first verb the product first verse the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David the king of Israel and I want you to listen to voices here he says to know wisdom so to know when wisdom and instruction speaks to perceive it to have the ability to understand I mean the words of understanding - and it's not understanding of human intellectual ability but to understand amen godly wisdom and godly instruction to discern and comprehend of godly understanding to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity to give subtility to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion amen our good judgment or our you know to those who are can be easily misled amen to give something on the inside that inner voice they can listen to he said a wise man will hear and will increase learning and the person of understanding will acquire wise go acquire wise counsel and the skill a artist that will to steer his course wisely or to lead others to the truth verse 6 says to understand a proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayings are there their mysteries that are hidden there a man I believe that we have been given the abilities to understand the mysteries that are there and it's not by a man's intellectual ability but by the wisdom of Almighty God hey man to understand a proverb or a figure of speech or the words of the wise and their riddles are mysteries amen verse 7 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge so if you want to understand God you've got to start reverence God that what God said is dust sayeth the Lord and my excuses mean nothing my dears mean nothing I know it matters not what I think that's hard to say in the Laodicean age that we live in everybody's got a thought and they got a right to say something because it's a age of people's rights listen you can't put yourself out there and any kind of way on on Facebook or any kind of social media without somebody having something to say about it it's age that we live in you can't you know you can't even put out a CD anymore you know of good gospel music without somebody having something to say about it it says the fear of the Lord is the beginning or the reverent fear that is worshiping him I love this is amplified the fear of the Lord that is worshiping him and regarding him as truly awesome he's truly awesome what he says matters what I think no it doesn't Amen is the beginning and the preeminent part of knowledge it's the starting place it's the basics it's it's where you begin when you realize God you're awesome you're beyond what I can think or ask you're beyond what I can come up with or any excuse I can give god you are awesome he said but arrogant fools despise godly wisdom and instruction and self-discipline the man in the parable had an opportunity to get a garment but he didn't think it was important he said through godly instruction to hear what God required service after service after service but still refused to hear them awesome voice amen in verse 8 said my son so to hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother here in other words tune everything else out as we sit as we said Wednesday night there's so many voices is trying to take a little part of the pot to get a little part of your of your mind and and there might get a gateway into your soul there's so many voices but tune it all out and listen to an awesome father listen to somebody that's worth listening to yield your minimum your members to obey is for your good it's not for your evil listen a godly dad or a godly mom is there for your protection not for your destruction amen a sermon is not for your destruction it's for your protection is for your deliverance it's not to tear you down is to lift you up it's to warn you love of the destruction that's coming a menace to warn your the dangerous and let you know Falls are just ahead amen you got to make be warned of these things it's God the instruction to be get to give heed to you're going the wrong way falls are just these parents that Solomon is speaking of they hadn't obeyed the instructions of Moses when he's sitting Dharana me 6 verse 6 and these words which I command thee this day shall be in my heart and thou shalt teach them diligently until our children and thou shalt talk of them without citizen thy house and when thou walkest in one way when that lies down and when thou rises up but what will their children do with this teaching verse 9 for they shall be an ornament of grace into thy head and chains about that neck it's in other words they are a garland of grace or ornaments of gold these these are these are something is very valuable listen these services that we're in on Sundays Wednesdays or whatever during the day and day when the presence of God they are very valuable I don't think sometimes we we sometimes get very you know if you had you know gold for pavement or you know gold yeah all over your house and you know it wouldn't be so valuable to you Khepera need be very rich but when somebody that really valued something is something that's dear to them they they don't just let the words come over the desk and fall to the ground they grab ahold of that's for me it's valuable it's like a crown on a king or a necklace on a queen Amen this robe that this man refused to put on he didn't realize the value of it how valuable it truly was and and this is a solemn and he said my son he said he said boy there's gonna be other voices they're going to try to take you away from God instruction and godly of wit wisdom II said my son if sinners enticing consent not or in other words don't respond don't listen and yours go out as though they never spoke if they say come with us and let us lay wait for blood let us look ply privately if for the innocent without cause let us swallow them up alive in the grave and hold as though go down the pit we shall find all precious substance we shall feel our houses with full casting that lot among us let us have what I have one person other words amen don't don't don't listen to what your father mother is saying that's not truly valuable we can give you true riches we can give you something that's really valuable he meant what it was that they was trying to distill the true voice they were trying to deaden the true voice that would lead that son or lead that daughter to true righteousness to true holiness to true purity amen to something that was truly valuable and to try to cheapen her life listen to this he says my son walk not in the way with him refrain their foot food that I fruit from their path for their feet run to evil let me show you where they're really going and make haste to shed blood surely in vain the net is spread inside of any bird and they what they that weight they and they lay wait for their own blood they lurk privately for their own lives so after the ways of everyone that is greedy of gain was taken away the life of the owners thereof so the father is warning his son not to yield to the voice of temptation but to check the path he's on and don't walk everyone was saying Psalms 1 1 don't walk with the wrong crowd don't play with temptation because temptation leads to a trap every time he says in verse 17 is vain and net it's spread inside of a bird in other words birds don't take the bait when they see the trap and he said people ought to be smarter than a bird you see the trap that's there listen if Satan is talking to you it's leading to a trap amen he's promising all kinds of things but it's leading to destruction verse 19 it says a greedy of gain they take what they want from life but eventually they have to pay for it and they pay then the price they pay is higher than the value they gain and the endlessness and the end of sacrificing the permanent for the immediate and that's a bad investment he's trying to show them this is what true riches are it's the voice of God godly wisdom this is what's truly and and and this is this here is only temporary and only for a moment the voice of temptation verse 11 through 14 is anything that leads us away from the path of God that isn't the right voice the offer may sound exciting but at least a destruction people today actually find enjoyment and doing evil and somehow having fabin fooled I've been fooled into thinking those things will satisfy and they reject eternal treasure with eternal benefits for cheap trinkets of the world and are losing their soul and what they think is a bargain the voice of this world everyone has been given a voice we live in a time everyone has a voice used to people could say something you'd never hear from them because they rarely left five miles from their house they could scream and holler and it only go as far as their voice but now you can say something to be heard on the other side of the world everyone has a voice not one can make a move without somebody saying something nothing is private anymore everyone has a platform they can scream for them and that scream don't just go through a few trees and die out that scream circles the world every artist is trying to find a way to get in your ears every store is trying to find a way to get into your ears and your pockets loud voices enticing spirits trying to have their moment to scream to get your attention the voice of wisdom is screaming also the voice of salvation is screaming also and this is not the voice of man's intelligence this is the voice of the wisdom of Almighty God says it here in Proverbs 1 verse 20 wisdom cries out blood is crying out in the middle of all this chaos and the devil said I'm gonna do this with your life you come with me and I offer you this but wisdom is crying out and she's crying out her voice is honored in the streets in the streets all I see is this advertisement and as ever listen here he said she cries out in the cheap places of concourse in the open of the gates and the cities she utters her words saying how does wisdom speak loud it's crying out people I think they're walking around as though like they're whistling in the graveyard somewhere and they're acting like it ain't saying God's not speaking no more but God is still speaking his voice is still crying out his voice is still punctuated and her guy are going through and and men going down through the alleys and the way and calling out to everyone who so ever will come and let him drink from this fountain his voice is still speaking is still calling and seeing whosoever come you can have this room you can have this life you can have this and people are just walking as though nothing is going on listen no one really has an excuse listen to this right here and these let's turn to Romans 10 and verse 13 they said for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent and as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring good tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for as I as I says Lord who has believed our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God but I say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the end of the world but I say did not Israel know first Moses said I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and my foolish nation I will anger you but as I said it's very bold to say and I found of them that sought me not I was made manifest unto them that asked not for me but the Israel he's saying all day long I've stretched forth my hands unto the disobedient and gainsaying people so his voice is going out it doesn't matter if people won't listen it doesn't mean that is voicing sounding what if they never come to church service and here this glorious truth listen to Psalms 19 and verse 1 people walk away walking down the streets every day and say I never hear from God I read this early the other mornings I got up even before the Sun come up and was studying studying I started reading this Psalm 19:1 the heavens declare the glory of God so a person cannot walk out of their house daylight or dark and not hear the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day after day in uttereth speech and night unto night show with knowledge there is no speech nor language in other words there's not a language and the whole earth where their voice is not heard their line has gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them has he set a tabernacle for the Sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race he goes forth in from the end of heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof so when the Sun rise and it is declaring the voice of Almighty God let there be light and it's so Amen it's showing that is a God whether they want to believe it or not whether they want to acknowledge or not his voice is sounding the statues of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the commander of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes of fear the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgement the Lord is true and righteous altogether more to be desired are they than gold every go back to that gold around the neck or that crown on the head is what wisdom of God truly is a man yea much fine gold sweeter also than honey than the honeycomb moreover by them are thy servant worn and keeping of them there is great reward wisdom salvation has went to the streets to declare the glory of the Lord but people were so busy going after the day so consumed with the voices of the day they miss every day the Sun declaring the glory of God they missed the trees the grass the flowers nature declared the glory of God and then wisdom asks in verse 22 how long you simple ones will you love simplicity and thus corners delight in the scorners scorning and fools hate knowledge three classes of sinners wisdom and salvation is speaking to simple scorners or scholars and fools the simple ones are who believe anything but and nothing they go there gullible and let us stray scorners are those who think they already know everything and when they come here what really coming and they coming here what's really important they turn away and laugh at it fools are they who are ignorant of the truth because they're dull of hearing and stubborn wisdom is asking how long will you be told the way but refuse to listen how long will you sit service after service and not repent they're given an opportunity to turn away from it with the voice of God sounds whether somebody will hear it or not the voice of God a sound where some time I do believe it or not but there will be somebody that I believe it even though there are other voices their voices of Hollywood there's voices of entertainment their voices of temptation their voices of politics their voices of demons all these voices does that does not mean that the voice of God is not sounded and just because the devil is trying to drown it out does not mean it's going to happen remember God's voice will keep on sounding all the way down to the judgement when he asks why when I gave you day after day China but the devil is trying to drown out the voice of God drown out the voice of godliness drown out the voice of holiness but that doesn't mean that the voice of God isn't still sounding and still true you know the things that we teach in holiness and righteousness is not just some man's ideas it's in the Bible so if it's in the Bible it's apparently God's Word that's what I mean I don't know that what you believe is God's Word and God believes it and God's is gonna stand on it no matter what we think or what our excuses are but he wants to put his robe onion too many are trying by their own abilities or their own ways or you know and really if you look at things in the Bible and the way people dress and the Payette way people do and and you know you follow just for instance make up through the Bible and what was it it was somebody as a prophet would scream out he would say when you do that you're not preparing yourself to meet God you're preparing yourself to meet man and we don't want to prepare ourselves to meet man I mean hi what would what would we do if we has gonna have an audience with the with the president man we would put the best clothes on I would think and try to come come or whoever some great man some hero of yours whatever but yet God is calling us to a wedding supper and he's telling us this is not dependent on what you can provide or what you can do or what you can say or think I have something for you I want to go through a few things here before we move on because just because there's other voices does not mean that the voice of God has still not sounding and still not true you can use whatever excuse you want to and you can say well that's just back in the sixties err that's an old fogey whatever but one day you're gonna be asked why why did I not put on the garment he wanted me to put on says no wonder a real true preacher looks upon his congregation tries to lead them before the throne of God and visit their homes find them still smoking telling dirty jokes entertaining with beer and things walking around the streets young women middle age and so forth even grandmother with little shorts on mother out in the street with a baby in one arm sexy enough to attract the attention of any bootlegger walking the street and call themselves Christians he said it would make any true man of God blush to bring such a person in the presence of God and a lot of them are joining churches to you know getting a better class his son because come to nonce they said it did and that day I will do this he says bring us back to God he's not with the injection of education not with the injection of religious Reformation now in the injection of some kind of man theology but back in the old fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost sit down from God out of heaven in a Pentecostal experience burning out all carnality and what we think and all of our excuses and make us sons and daughters of God until we do that brothers and sisters will still have bobbed hair will still have makeup on we'll still have sexy looking men and women drink and smoke and calling themselves Christians because they don't have it in their hearts to do any different oh so now we see what's going on if you found yourself there you got the wrong robe on you can call yourself a Christian all you want to but you're going to come before him and he's going to ask you why did you not put the robe on then I said to put on and you're gonna be speechless all of a sudden all your excuses well I just do it to cover my pimples I just do it to cover my there so I just do it to look better I come on why are you giving those who you're trying to attract you're not doing it for God you're doing it for man well I don't think there's nothing wrong with drinking a few beers you find where you're at you're without the robe of Christ you're lost and you're gonna be thought out gnashing and wailing of teeth that's the Bible he said what we need is some some prophets some blushing prophets somebody that'll stand and call what's right right what's wrong wrong what we need is a good housecleaning a good heart warming a man somebody that's standing the pulpit and call the thing out and tell what's right and what's wrong and preach the gospel without compromising until sinners fall to the floor and weep till God sends the Holy Spirit to clean their lives you know that's right I'm just talking to a preacher the other day a man that went to a funeral he said I've never in my life seen me so many messes women with makeup on why is it because God's Word ain't true no more is it because we let we just say you know we just said well I got that I can do this you know I don't care no more that's your excuse but you're gonna find yourself speechless you gonna find yourself without excuse hey man maybe we're gonna get it looked a little better spot here in a minute it's gonna get tight but he's hang on for a moment so I preached there not long ago said that every woman in this city was guilty one way or another of adultery a woman go downtown you can hardly buy a dress until looks like they're poured in he said this is my own church this is my own church he said I have a right to preach what the Holy Spirit tells me to let me tell you I'm not criticizing you my sister but don't let don't but don't the Holy Spirit teach you different if it doesn't I'm afraid you didn't get the Holy Spirit that's right the Holy Spirit is not just shouting it's not dancing the spirit it's not speaking in tongues the Holy Spirit is righteousness God gives us the Holy Ghost revival he says of God to send back righteousness he said did you realize when you dress yourself like that and walk down the street men look at you the wrong way you'll be at the judgment bar you may be as pure as a lily to your husband but judgment and judgment you'll be guilty of committing adultery with that guy the way you present yourself he said no wonder it ought to make a person blush what must he do to God when the Bible said the beginning it grieved him that he made man it grieved the heart of God he looked upon the days of the hand-tighten delivery instruction that he ever made man what happened they begin to look at the daughters that they were fair there was a perversion that was taking place and they were left speechless dead floating in the flood no more lungs in their body all they'd said all kinds of things before that moment to know all kinds of excuses was coming out of their mouth well I just don't think it matters I just don't think that's just brother Tim that's just brother that's just brother branham that's just that you might as well say that's just God because it's in the Bible well I don't think it matters no more what you're saying really you don't think God matters let's just put it where the rubber hits the moat you don't think the road you don't think God matters when he said if you'll listen it'll be as a crown on your head and it be as a gold around your neck you'll have true riches that a man can't give you an a man can't take away he said we see today see the church has taken its pattern not out of the Bible not from Ruth not from the only not from Sarah the ones that allow their pattern even the women of the church after Hollywood and the very dregs of the devil is how our people who call them some Christians go out there and get this evil wet man's ways it was Presley an author Godfrey and all those listen that kind of nonsense on your radio and refused to hear the good gospel sermon being preached in the Bible God have mercy on you what kind of spirit have we got a mungus that's right no wonder the prophet of God blush before the Lord he knew that was unrighteousness and he stood and pleaded a call to said God we're unrighteousness and he said we are to friends he said listen quit trying to put on plasters quit trying to put on some sound the healing can't come unless the bloodstream gets right he said that's the reason people's got diabetes if one could ever cut himself probably never heal up because the real red blood cells is ate up and he said the whole church has become diabetic selfishness greed and moral a all kinds of wrong doings men drinking smoke and well it wearing shorts telling dirty women cutting their hair wearing makeup doing all kinda Zee dressing themselves and morally and face of people all these things are because it's the lack of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that cleanses us from all righteousness mercy but one day somebody's gonna hear the word of God somebody's gonna say that's nothing but the truth let's go back to proverbs 1:23 let me read this before we do he said he was god of the Old Testament he's God of the new he's a God same today yesterday today and forever you know then down in your heart that a supernatural

plans Oh hallelujah even I know every one of us was going down the wrong path and we was going down the wrong road but all of a sudden we heard another voice and that voice said that's not where you belong that's not where you're to go that's not your path you're going down the wrong path and we heard and we tired and we started tuning in our voice to another dimension to another land and that land has become such an effect of my life until it makes us act different think different walk never talk different and ain't a devil hollow they ain't a devil that can make you do it again if the

trumpet as of a line that roars and when he speaks everything else goes silent I had to go back again and look at some more things when God says go get going when God says you can do it you can do it

fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possessions and you shall return

that's saith the Lord she's healed and told her how many hours would be exactly to the dot and she would go home well and they laughed it to scorn they said it couldn't be so he was impossible but that very same hour the Holy Ghost is spoke she went home well a well woman hallelujah when that thought speaks there's nothing that can hold it any longer even every devil may try to come and and camp about it hold back the promises but that voice is greater than any devil that force is greater than any sickness that voice is greater than any torn in spirit that voice is greater than any kind

on his righteousness I put on his holiness I don't want to be just a Methodist Baptist Pentecostal message person I want to be yours but there's coming an end to the voice of Satan revelation is twenty one and three and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God Oh glory to God I don't know how we can read that without just cry on a shouting or doing something because he said that and if he said it he's got to bring it to pass and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death death voice is shut forever there shall be no sorrow no crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away they lay silent in the grave one day the voice of death will sound no more we just heard the voice of death as it took a little girl 16 years old snatched her away from a family one day that voice will sound no more we heard the voice of sorrow as they were crying over their lost level one day that voice will sound no more cuz there'll be no more party there'll be no more goodbyes

realize I tried to do it on my own I try to manufacture I've amped for the wind used that in a youth meeting with an old church about vamping that's what actually actors would do they called it back in the 20s was a word that was used very regularly called vamping they'd make them to be something they were it wasn't thanks to what Jezebel did she vamped when she came before the man of God she tried to put on something that she wasn't it's fake and it will be exposed when you stand before him and your speech or will it be there shouting its glory and honor and praise in God there's worshiping around the throne there's giving glory to the Lamb who was slain took away your sin you're singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound and your enemy is speechless he can't bring up one thing against you because it's all gone I think of Rahab but she'd come out of that city and they would bring her in the law was if it was a harlot he was to stone her but you also had to bring her at Qs her with her and they begin to bring her to a trial to bring her as a harlot and they said wait a minute got to bring her accuser also where's your accuser they're all dead they're speechless I never did it in the first place I'm justified it's all gone it's all buried in the sea of his forgetfulness he dealt with it and he said that I could go free which one's gonna be speechless you or your enemy this barians for the former things have passed away let me read this all again and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with me and he would dwell with him and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said it is done I am Alpha Omega the beginning of the end I will give unto him that a thirst a fountain the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake of the burning
