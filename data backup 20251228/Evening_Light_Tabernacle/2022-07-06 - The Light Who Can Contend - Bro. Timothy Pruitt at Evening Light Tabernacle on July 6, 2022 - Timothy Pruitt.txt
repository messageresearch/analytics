service to you for your glory for your honor for you in jesus name amen amen let's turn to nahum chapter 1. like to speak to you tonight on the light who can contend amen chapter 1 and verse 2. god is jealous and the lord revengeth and the lord revengeth and is furious the lord will take vengeance on his adversary and he reserveth wrath for his enemies the lord is slow to anger but great in power and he will not at all acquit the wicked the lord hath his way in the whirlwind and then the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet he rebuketh the sea and maketh the dry he drieth up all the rivers beishan languisheth carmel and the flower of lebanon languisheth the mountains quake at him and the hills melt and the earth is burned at his presence yea the world and all that dwell therein who can stand before his indignation and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger his fury is poured out like fire and the rocks are thrown down by him but the lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth him that trust in him amen god bless you today to be seated the light who can contend it's pretty amazing scripture as we read in the first few lines he would speak over and over of a god who revengeth a god who is furious a god who takes vengeance a god who reserveth wrath but he said he's slow to anger amen but once he gets there look out amen once he gets to that great pla place of anger and and that he it comes in great power and not he said it will not at all acquit the wicked but the lord will have his way in the whirlwind and the storms and the clouds and he rebukes we'll reap the sea and make it dry the mountains will quake the hills will melt the earth will burn just at his presence amen and he goes on to say who can stand before his indignation or who can contend who can stand who can abide who can contend in the fierceness of his anger his fury is poured out like fire and the rocks are thrown down by him so amen as we read here amen the wicked or our enemy the devil is not going to get away with anything but he is going to pay for all that he has done but but during all of this the lord is a good god and he's a stronghold in the day of trouble and i believe that's the time that we're living in we're living in a great day of trouble and he also knows them that trust in him now i was looking at this word contend it means to strive it means to vie for a win or in a contest or a rivalry or it means to strive or win against difficulties it also means to play to win amen in other words if i'm not going to win i'm not going to play amen that's my attitude i'm going to win so amen god has this attitude towards amen the time that we're living in he's going to win he's not going to lose he's going to win the war he's going to win the the time that we're living in he's going to win amen every heart that belongs to him they are going to be his and when it comes down to the end because he's not going to give up in other words god is not in this toulouse amen this light is contending against the darkness it is holding it back it is telling darkness you can only come so far as we heard in the song amen you cannot cross the bloodline you can only go so far you can only do so much just so as he would tell job when job would come or when the uh the satan would come before the sons of god as they would present themselves and he would say have you considered my servant job and he said yeah but you do this you got a hedge around him he said i'll take all of this away amen you can do whatever you want to him but you cannot take his life in other words he puts something there that devil the devil can only go so far amen the devil is only is harnessed in the harnesses put on him by god therefore he can only do so much he can only put so much on you he can only uh pressure you so much he can only put sickness on you so much he can only torment you so much he can only go so far amen but there's a line there that he cannot cross and therefore who can stand against this great god that we're talking about this god is a great god it's a great light nothing can stand against it you know there was a there was an army one time that thought they could stand against it and they thought they could put enough men around a tomb and they thought they could put enough garrison there and they could hold it they hold that body in a tomb but they found out on that resurrection morning when that light of god came down amen and it blinded all them around and it put them as though they were dead men amen they found out there was not a match for this life amen we can go on into the into the acts and we can see peter when he was thrown in prison and he was held there by guards and he had guards sitting around him guards at the door but the bible said prayer was offered up unto god without cease in other words they kept praying that god would somehow set this man free and their prayers went before the throne of god and god sent down an angel which the scripture said a great light shone in the prison and those that held him and those that tried to keep him there could know they lost their power to hold they lost their power and their ability to keep him in the prison and the angel smote him and said get up and let's walk out of here and i think about that as we look in times of where we're around and people that are caught in prisons of of sin and prisons of unbelief and prisons of fear amen if you'd begin to pray and the church of god will begin to call upon god or maybe they're imprisoned of sickness but if the church of god will begin to call without ceasing and begin to pray god will send the light that is greater than that sin that is greater than that sickness that is greater than whatever is holding them and an angel can step out and say come on it's time to walk out of this place amen as i was reading this i couldn't help but think about our brother ron who's been held in this moment amen held in by this cancer but i believe this prayers is being offered up without ceasing i i believe in just any moment there's a light that's going to come down and tap him on the shoulder and say ronald spencer your time with this cancer is over amen get up and go back to the people of god i believe amen if we would hold that faith there is a light greater than that cancer and that cancer cannot contend against that light in other words it can't stand in the presence of that light amen one thing we find out about this light it never quits amen just as the sun never quits shining but every morning it comes up again to herald a new day and it begins to push back the darkness so does the son of god day after day push back the darkness push back the thoughts in your life push back the darkness is trying to surround you and trying to put you put put you under his feet he will not stop until every enemy is destroyed hallelujah amen the cup of god's vintage vengeance is about to be poured out and every cancer every sugar diabetes ever high blood pressure every spirit of hell that has attached itself to some weak cell one day is going to burn it's going to be no more because god is vengeance is going it will not be a creed will not be acquitted what the devil has done to you he is going to pay for amen what the devil has tormented you and try to strip you of your peace and strip you of your joy and strip you of your children he will pay for his sins hallelujah amen we can say the light is with us amen in this time and hour that we're living in fear is coming on more and more than it ever has it's getting more and more more people are being diagnosed with anxiety disorders and and there's a lot more things to worry about i mean how many has had time to sit on your front porch and kick back in a rocker and shell some peas it don't happen no more amen it is the time that we're living in things that goes on and and it's getting worse and worse but i can take great confidence in the scripture right now in this moment that we're living in in isaiah 41 and verse 10 it says fear thou not for i am with thee hallelujah we can have a rejoicing moment just right there because the devil you know fear comes when you think god's a long ways away amen when you think that he's no more around he's not answering he's not moving he's not you don't see the movement of god and how he's orchestrating things and fear tries to set in and fear tries to overtake you just as it did those that was in that boat on the sea of galilee and the waves began to get up and the waves began to come against the boat begin to crash over the bow what happened fear overtook them to such a place they forgot who was with him he never left them he never went away he was there all the time i believe we heard that last wednesday this god has been with this bride all the time he's not got to 2022 and decided it was time to pack up and go home no he said i'll never leave you or forsake you i'll be with you he's in the ship [Applause] the ship might be bouncing up and down but don't forget he's in the ship i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god and i will strengthen thee in other words you're not going to be dependent on your strength little bride i'm going to give you my strength i will help thee and i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness behold all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded and they shall be as nothing. hallelujah has the devil been against you today come on now be honest has the devil been against you today amen he will be ashamed and confounded and shall be as nothing. [Applause] he's been telling you you're nothing why don't you turn around and say the bible says the word of god says you're nothing and they shall perish [Applause] thou shalt seek them and shall not find them even them that contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing. i've invited that devil especially here tonight so i can tell him he's nothing amen he's nothing a thing of naught for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel i will help thee saith the lord and thy redeemer the holy one of israel behold i will make thee a new shark-threshing instrument having teeth i'm going to give you something to fight with i'm going to give i'm going to arm you with my armor i'm going to give you my weapon i'm going to give you my word that can not only be in your hand it'll be in your mouth and you'll begin to speak it and it has some teeth to it hallelujah you'll speak healing to a body and he has teeth in it and that word will go in there and grab that sickness and drag it out and say you don't belong in this body hallelujah you'll speak to that son or a daughter that's wayward and that word with some teeth will go and it'll grab a hold of that seed and it'll begin to shake hallelujah amen it'll begin to tear it from limb to live until there's no more sin can be found there's no more drugs to be found there's no more alcohol to be found there's nothing to be found it's all gone [Applause] and thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small you shall say unto this mountain move and be cast into the sea and it shall be done i'm going to give you something you can thresh that mountain with you say that mountain been threshing to me when you come to the right service you've been given something that you can contend with that mountain with and beat it small and shall make the hills as chaff amen shall make the hills as chap thou shalt fan them and the wind shall carry them away and the whirlwinds shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the lord and thou shalt glory in the holy one of israel psalms 35 verse 1 says plead or contend for my cause o lord with them that content strive or contend with me fight against them that fight against me amen isaiah go back to isaiah 49 let's answer that isaiah 49 and verse 24 shall the prey be taken from the mighty who's he talking about the enemies who's he's called the mighty or the lawful captive delivered shall the pray that the mighty has said i'll destroy the mighty has said i will take down to nothing the mighty has said i'll there'll be nothing left of them the mighty has said they won't ever get their children back the mighty said all kinds of things shall the prey be taken from the mighty and the lawful captive delivered but thus saith the lord even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away amen i believe it's time that we can have a little joy for fourth of july celebration amen this world don't want this you know you got so many voices out there we don't want no fireworks we don't they don't want to remember the great things that happen in this country they don't want to remember amen the liberties that were fought for and the liberties they enjoy today they don't want to remember but there's a people that wants to remember it amen i ain't even talking about what happened in 1776 i'm talking about what happened amen in 1963 amen in our generation what happened in this hour that we're living in i want to see fireworks tonight i want to see some rejoice in the night amen that you see a god who's contending for you a god who's standing for you a god that's going to go and get the captive daughter and bring her back a god that's gonna go and get that captive out of the mouth of the prey for ah hallelujah for i will contend with him that contended with things hello somebody you're not fighting this battle alone he is with us he's never left us he's always been here i will continue with him that's contending with it listen ron spencer it ain't just you it's fighting that cancer there's an angel of god that is fighting that cancer hey man it ain't just you it's been on your knees crying out for your children the angel of god has been contended with that devil that's been holding your children and he said i will contend with him who continue with me and what and i will save thy children somebody needs to say my child o god [Applause] i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and they shall be drunken not on your blood but their blood as with sweet wine and all flesh shall know that i the lord and thy savior and thy redeemer and the mighty one of jacob i will contend with him that contended with thee but you know contending can go two ways he can contend for you or you contend for him amen we're going to take a little flop here for a minute jude chapter 1 and verse 3 but i love it when i give all i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly what contend for the faith which were once delivered unto the saints that you should earnestly or vehemently or very wholeheartedly brother brennan was saying with all your heart content he said not for a faith but for the faith the same faith jesus would speak and he would go out and he would do and he would move and do mighty miracles he would preach the word this is the faith that we are to contend for he said well why has brother tim been preaching what he's been preaching because he is contending for the faith that was once delivered hey man this ain't a new faith this is the faith that we have went back to again amen there's the same church in the first age tall we teach as they preach we preach therefore if they heal we heal if people come out of prisons in that day people will come out of prison in this day we must contend i'm going to skip down because i i i don't feel like you quiet with me yet brother matt watkins shared this testimony back in march i was asked but we're talking about contending for the faith back in march i was asked by a brother in our church brother travis jackson's got a wonderful testimony of how god saved him and even his mother and dad's incredible incredible man of faith he said if i'd go if he asked if i would go with him to lay hands and pray for a good friend of his marcus humphrey who had been recently diagnosed with stage four hodgkin's lymphoma cancer he was told by the doctors he had a few months maybe to live marcus is the associate pastor of what they call a vineyard church here in beaufort it's an environment in evangelical church evangelical church he was brother travis's pastor before he came to the message more than 14 years ago so we went to his home where i could tell immediately he was very sick and he had a tumor the size of a large grapefruit on his neck and brother travis now listening to this contending for the faith amen brother draft brother travis told him that because of his death sentence there wasn't no time to mince words and to be bold and honest with him he shared his testimony of how the lord led him to the truth of the end time message into a living god who is not just was alive he's still alive and he's living among his people he boldly declared to him the true jesus wasn't living in a denominational church amongst fox doctrines like trinity but that god had been revealed himself again in the last days to a prophet and restored the original apostolic gospel with apostolic power to heal the sick and raise the dead [Applause] he shared that this was a fulfillment of scripture marcus was very receptive and so i'm sure anyone told me what months to live would be he told us that he when we walked to the door the lord spoke to him and said we were sent from god and you want to know where the book of acts are it's happening all amongst us i began to testify to him about sister atlanta butts and how she was supernaturally healed of the exact stage four hodgkin's lymphoma i showed him the image of her pet scans before and after well why was it he that was contending against her he turned and began to contend against him give me some more brother tim his faith began to rise as he wept here hearing about about a living god we then laid hands on him with his wife and other people in the church in the room from the church and we prayed for him that god was supernaturally deliver him and healing of this cancer demon that was killing him we just received the report from his wife after a special visit this hospital earlier this week all in caps praise the living god marcus has been supernaturally healed and is a hundred percent cancer-free hallelujah the doctor said it was the most aggressive cancer he had ever seen but now it's miraculously gone the doctor cried and said this is truly a miracle he is still the same yesterday today and forever he said be in prayer because we're seeing him later in his home to follow up and to continue witnessing to him about the message of the hour and i say this if god could come down in a hall and heal a man preaching half truth hallelujah why don't we also contend that the same god can heal a man who preaches all the truth he's still the same yesterday today and forever i refuse to back up hallelujah if god will do that god will do this is there people that with the same mindset and the same contending faith say devil i'm contending with you you've held him long enough it's time for him to walk out of that prison i feel it right now i want you right now to lay your hands on somebody right next to you and let's pray right now for ron spencer satan you're defeated in the name of jesus doesn't matter what the signs may look like may not look what the doctors may say it matters not what matters is my god is a god of vengeance my god is a god who contends with this cancer and i say cancer give way to the name of jesus christ pneumonia give way to the name of jesus christ take your hands over god's property [Applause] let the angel of god fall in that house let the light of god fall in that house cancer i have someone against thee you've come against a servant of the most high now you take your hands off of him and loose him and letting go [Music] hey i don't care if the service ends right here hallelujah all i know is he's ashamed yesterday today and forever and i feel his presence so real peter of fire among us the light is contending against the darkness thank you lord thank you lord jesus [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] thank you lord [Music] hallelujah we believe lord we believe you're the same yesterday to damn forever we believe these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink in a deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we contend that the scripture is true [Applause] we contend that it hasn't lost one moment of power but it's still the same as when they went to the gate called beautiful and they grabbed the lame man and said silver and gold have our nun but such as i have give unto thee in the name of jesus rise up and walk jesus may the same church of the living god tonight say in the name of jesus ron spencer be healed in the name of jesus our sons and daughters are coming back in the name of jesus god's gonna move mountains in the name of jesus he's gonna open the red sea in the name of jesus he's gonna make a way where there seems to be no way in the name of jesus healing is here in the name of jesus you don't have to live another moment under that complex that you don't belong you are here because you belong [Applause] thank you jesus you were here because god called you to be here [Music] hallelujah let's just worship him uh this is his service it ain't mine some of y'all need to start contending against that devil that said your son and your daughter is not coming back [Applause] some of you need to start contending against that mountain of fear and that mountain of doubt and that mountain of unbelief some of you need to start contending you say how am i supposed to the word of god is naive and it's a sharp threshing instrument you need to start using it and start speaking against your enemy and say devil i'm not going to be held another service under this thing i'm not going to be held another moment but i'm going to speak the word and i'm walking out of my prison cell hallelujah we need to contend he's not a god of history but he's a god of the now for this moment what he did then he still does because he's the same yet today yesterday and forever he's still the same god and he changes not brother remember said my contention is my ministry is to contend that jesus christ the son of god is not dead his body is now sitting on the throne of god in glory but a spirit that was in him is now in the church and it's moving among his people that's according to the word i say holy spirit move unto every wall comes down move onto every complex swing move until there's no more fear among us move until we can get some men that'll draw a sword and say i'm going to get a drink for my kids [Applause] amen i got in my notes i'm just going to preach it amen brother branham said that there was a david he got him some gentile warriors around him [Music] he was an outcast he had been put out of the economy of god he'd been but he had been anointed to be king and he said those men saw a great light they saw an anointing there and they began to move around that anointing and one day that anointing was caught up somewhere and he got so thirsty he said i want a drink and i don't want just any drink i want a drink from bethlehem wales i want to drink where the fresh water of god's been spewing out i want a drink where jacob drug dug a well [Applause] he was contending that was his will well everybody by three men said you know what we're gonna go get him a drink and he said it was garrison by about 16 miles of philistine but two grabbed a sword and one grabbed a bucket said let's go get our king a drink and they begin to fight through doubt and fear and from complexes they brought through cancer and they caught fought through every kind of thing that said they couldn't make it said they might as well give up and go home but on this wednesday night their king wanted a drink he wanted a drink of that brother brandon would call that old pentecostal wallet something that's flowing something that's got life in it something that's moving something that might have a little shout in it something that might have a little dance here something that's moving and that was enough to make three gentile warriors fight contend against them uncircumcised philistine it says this well is not your will you philistine says we can't drink from that well no more i'm going to cut your head off euphelistina says amen the baptism the holy ghost ain't the same today i'm going to cut your head off you philistine that says days of miracles are passed i'm going to cut your head off you philistine that says god don't heal no more your head's coming off you philistine that says god doesn't save it and alter no more i'm cutting your head off you philistine that says i'm not going to give back my son i'm not gonna give back your daughter i'm cutting your head off and i'm gonna dip down in that well and i'm gonna bring him back a drink tonight i'm gonna dip down in the well and i'm gonna bring my king a drink they did not fall they didn't just fight their way there they fought their way back [Applause] one hole in the bucket two holding swords and after a minute they got to that last one a demon of fear he picked a dumb place to show up at the last stop fear more than everywhere fear more than any time fear more than anxieties and every kind of supernatural demon being but there's a group of people has been armed with a new threshing weapon satan this weapon's got teeth it cuts going and it cuts coming it'll cut one way and it'll cut another way it'll take your way to divine healing and it'll cut its way to the holy ghost it'll cut its way to an office hall it'll cut its way into a prayer line i don't care how many philistines say god don't do that no more we are here to cut their head off and if you're hearing this tonight you need to grab your sword and go to swing it and get yourself out of that philistine camp get your way out of that unbelief get your way out of trees involvement and get a drink brother branham stood night after night contending for the faith [Applause] contending he's the same yesterday contending he's the same today and forever how dare us lay our swords down he stood against giants intellectual giants and said it ain't possible no more well it ain't possible till it's possible but when it's possible god makes it that way it wasn't possible for goliath to die but one day it became possible because there happened to be a little boy there in that camp that morning hadn't been there the 40 other days 39 whatever it was but that morning he came with some meat and some cheese and some bread and he's gonna just feed a few brothers of his and his mind but the whole time the light was whirling it was leading him to the valley because again god wanted to show him he's not just god on the mountain with his sheep he's god down the valley where the giants are amen he brings him down to that valley and he hears a voice says send me a man brother adam said there was a different set of ears in the camp that day on that wednesday night there was a different set of ears said that devil i'm done listening to you i don't need another day of that i don't need five more minutes send me i'll go kill him this is what those gentile warriors saw in david they saw a man that was not afraid but his trust was in his god and tonight he's looking for another drink but will you fight through your complexes well brother timothy i'm just a quiet person yeah you ain't been close enough to the fire you get close enough to the fire it'll warm you and then it'll burn you and something reacts i don't care who you are how many have here been burned let me just hear for a moment what'd you sound like i know good and well and you didn't go mama i burned myself i'm so sad no there was a reaction there was something in you and i don't care i'm not trying to say you gotta scream and you gotta holler but when that fire gets close there has to be a worship come forth whether if it's just hands up and tears streaming down or you can't contain yourself and you take off running around whatever it is amen something's going to happen something's going to respond if there's life on the inside of you and tonight he's looking again for and i'm so far off my notes we just where he's looking again for somebody who's a somebody who's a somebody he said i don't care what's the matter tonight if you will believe for divine healing it's yours god promised you it and i wouldn't walk away from it i would take it he'd give it to you it's yours he'd give you the lair you might have to fight you might have to press you might have to push you might have to draw your sword but if you'll rise up you will possess it hallelujah how many possessions do we have here tonight i will possess everything that he has not partial no no no we're not going partially [Applause] oh yeah he says right here he said there was a lot of them that came at cades barnea and they refused to contend they said why was it he said it was a bunch of borderline but a bunch of borderline preachers that would get right up to the border line and say we can't do it we can't have that no more god don't move that way no more god don't do that no more god he ain't the same anymore you might as well say it don't say everything but that but that's what they're saying he's not the same and they go right up to the borderline and they'll scratch their toe in the dirt and he'll jump back over and he'll jump back over here and he gets a little bit too hot for him and they jump back over i ain't jumping back over i like how my brother brandon said he i love it i i thought maybe kayla must have been a little southern he said caleb walked over there and he come back and he said those 10 other preachers said we couldn't do it caleb looked and said we'll take her we'll take her i believe that's the way it is if you want don't want that true bride of jesus christ we'll take it if you don't want those acts to spa tongue speaking acts 2 38 believers will take her if you don't want that divine healer we'll take her if you don't want the miracles we'll take her we'll take all god has for us if you don't want it hand it
