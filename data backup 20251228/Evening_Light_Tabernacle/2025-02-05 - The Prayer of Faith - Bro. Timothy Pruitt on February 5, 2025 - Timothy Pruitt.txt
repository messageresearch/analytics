no way you'll open up the Red Sea you'll open up the Jordan whatever it takes Lord you'll provide Lord we're thankful for that today ask Lord you'll bless us in our time together this evening in Jesus name amen amen you can turn to Matthew chapter 6 I guess it's uh a little bit of my turn to be under the weather uh um got up this morning didn't even know if I'd have the voice to even speak but amen we're here this evening ask you to be praying for me men sister Ruth are leaving in the morning have meetings this weekend in sason with brother Kelly and so just ask the Lord to give us strength amen and also somehow to give us warmth there going to only going to be about the -2 so um anyway I I'll think of you for while I'm there in that cold weather and amen Matthew 6 and verse 9 says after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive our us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen also Luke 18 and verse one said he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought to always to pray and not to faint saying there was a c in in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this w Widow troubleth me I will avenge her lest by any by her continuing continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust said judge saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him though he bear long with him I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth amen we let you be seated um just been thinking about prayer and I'd like to speak to you about the prayer of faith the prayer of faith uh Jesus uses this Parable and he speaks about someone that is not uh righteous or didn't fear God and didn't even regard man but because this woman came to this this judge and repeatedly asked of this request he finally amen resent he finally came and he finally said yes I I'll I'll do what you're asking me and and God was just Jesus was just saying if if this this unjust man would do this how much more would God do for you if you come and make your request known unto him now it isn't just coming and asking over and over and over and over but when he comes he wants to find somebody body that's asking in faith amen not just asking just just to ask or asking out of uh repetitiveness or whatever but someone who is standing there in faith believe in his word I I know a lot of times and it does speak about when he when the son of man cometh and many people put that to the very end when he cometh back will he find faith and but I believe it's when he comes and he comes to hear your request or he comes to answer you will he still find find you standing in faith or will you be in standing in doubt and disbelief and and not even knowing if he can fulfill the very things that you have requested but when he comes will he find you asking in faith and you know in James chapter 5 we're going to go through quite a bit of scriptures tonight but James chapter 5 and verse 15 talks about the prayer of faith how it shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise them up and if he committeth sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for the other that you may be healed and he says this the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now brother Brandon would take that and he said now it did not say a sinless man it said a righteous man and a righteous man is someone who has confessed his sins to the righteous one amen it's not someone that is practicing sin or or or living in sin but someone that if they have fallen as it goes on it speaks about the prophet Elias was a man of subject to like passions as we are but yet he prayed earnestly that he might not that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three and a half years and he prayed again and the heaven gave forth rain and the Earth brought forth her fruits so Eli Elias was a man subject to passions as we are he but he but he he he had ups and downs he just like we have he was not an angel he was a man amen and as a man we have our ups we have our downs we have our moments that we don't feel our best or we don't act our best or we don't do our best amen but that does not mean God cannot hear our prayers because if we have done something wrong a righteous man is going to go to him first and say father forgive me amen of my sins forgive me of what I've done wrong and then make his request made known unto God and He Man he said he he was a man of like passion he was subject to passions as we are he was just as apt to make a mistake as you and I are and he's was just as apt to do something wrong as you and I are amen but he prayed earnestly that it not rain and it rained for not the space of three years and six months think of that God listening to IM mortal's prayer and he said I say this with all true reverence there is not another force on Earth there is nothing on Earth no matter what it is what kind of gift it is there is nothing in the world that'll come ahead of prayer prayer is what does the work prayer is what does the work prayer is the key it is the answer Prayer Changes Things amen prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God yes sir amen amen prayer can change the mind of God did you know that it'll do it it did it one time in the scripture we can get to that in a moment Prayer Changes Things from Death to life amen it'll do it for every sinner here today it'll change you from death to life amen it'll change a sick person tonight from someone that's sick to someone that's healed amen it's that powerful prayer changes things so we must always bear that in mind amen as the scripture says to pray without ceasing you see brother BR made this statement it's qu quite incredible he says if you want to be an hindrance to a meeting just don't pray oh my if you want to be a hindrance to a meeting just don't pray but if you want to be the greatest help that a meeting can ever have is not financially amen here's the greatest help you can be to this meeting set aside an hour or two amen every day to pray for the meeting to pray that God will move to ask him Amen to come on the scene to ask him to heal the sick to ask him Amen to save the Lost he said go out and visit someone the Lord puts on your heart and bring them to the meeting but pray that God will save them when they're there if they're not saved or heal them if they're sick in need of healing that's the greatest contribution you can give to any meeting is to pray and seek God God and to help in this time of trouble come on now I'm not going to ask for a show of hands how many prayed for this service tonight but I believe we ought to be pray in prayer amen no matter what service it don't have to be a special meeting I know sometimes we get in our mind about special meeting we we place that word special but I believe every time we get together it ought to be special amen amen forsake not the assembling of yourself together even the much more as you see that day approaching every time we come together where it's a Wednesday night or it's a Sunday or whatever day of the week or whatever moment is it ought to be a special time if it's special to you we ought to set aside time to talk to God about it amen have we been asking him to save the lost have we been praying for the sick have we been asking God to save the prodical have we been saying God I need you to come in this service I need you to speak to my heart I need you to answer something that's on the inside of me you know how many times people have has that and that very service God anoint the men of God and sometimes it's off of his notes but he goes right down the trail and he gives them exactly the answer sometimes verbatim to what they have asked and God hears our prayers that's why it's important to pray prayer is not a perhaps come on now this is a quote prayers prayer is not a perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God God Amen prayer is not get you know get down shut your eyes think about your washing or your work you're doing and say Lord help me and John and he'll miss Jones is that's not prayer that's repeating some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize you're in the presence of God and you're moving to the deepest of sincerity first prayer is a worship is is what he showed us My Father which are in heaven hallow be thy name he started he's showing you Amen to Give Him worship and adoration and praise Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done Amen on Earth as it is in heaven and then once you have worshiped him and entered into that prayer then you can make your requests known unto God give us this day our daily bread but don't forget about your sins and your debts and and the things you've held against others say God forgive me as I forgive others yes lead us not in Temptation and Deliver Us from Evil and then end in worship begin with worship end with worship begin with adoration end with adoration is it what he I mean it's red-letter words it it really can't be argued with he gave us a very uh recipe that prayer should be given by amen that we worship Him and we give him praise no matter what the situation we're in if you if you father follow the scriptures and there there's a lot I'm going to get to but prayer and Thanksgiving Works hand in hand amen no matter what situation you're in that you can pray and still be thankful that God is allowing you to even walk the walk that you're walking cuz if you're prayer and bitter what Good's it going to do but God has allowed you to be in this moment therefore if God's allowed it he's got a plan for you amen prayer is the key prayer is the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon amen so you know he said if we can only get quiet and along with god brother Mike uh Dexter BR brought this quote up the other night and I thought it was very good and I thought I'd just bring it into this if we can only get quiet and along with God how the do how the do would strengthen us he talks about the Dew that falls out of heaven in the evenings and falls upon the grass and and it said it takes the wilt out of us and it makes us fresh he said did you ever go into a Rose Garden or some Garden earlier you ever get into a hone honeysuckle bed early in the morning and the whole air it just bathed with the fragrance of it he said oh I love that he said down in my part of the country in Indiana I get up early and I turn on the switch key and I get out there somewhere where the Locust or the honeysuckles and they're blooming and I just sit down by the side of the road oh I love to smell it and I look at it and I see those little honeysuckles standing up why cuz the to do had come upon them and it took all the wrinkles out of I said oh God in the run of the day in the Runs run of the days if I get a little wilty and indifferent let me lay in the presence in the quietness along with you till I come out fresh again he said that's what God wants to do with the fragrance of prayer all over us covered by the blood of the Lord Jesus how fresh we are then before the Angels how fresh we are in the presence of God when we've laid in his presence and prayer has come out of our Lives to where we're once again not all wilty and indifferent but our our our our our our all around us is a fragrance of prayer and Thanksgiving Prayer Changes Things prayer changes as we said sickness to Health death to life Sinners to Saints is prayer brother man said you can laugh too much you can shout too much you can eat too much but you'll never pray too much the Bible said I would that pray men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands so you're never able to pray too much he said I believe that prayer changes thing I've seen death be drove back by prayer and life come and take its place I love that death be drove back by prayer and life taketh place and if you ever eyewitness of these things you know that what you're talking about I tell you it make you appreciate prayer more he said along this journey he promised to Supply everything that we have need of whatsoever we ask the father in my name that will I do whatsoever things mark 11:24 whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them he's give us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world and that's prayer prayer is what changes things the Christians don't Christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he gets on his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he don't realize what power that is if the people could only realize what's been given them and the rights to them anything you ask in my name it shall be given to you he said if you can appropriate the faith to believe for it God's word will bring it to pass now let's go through some scriptures in Acts chapter 10 and verse one there was a man in cesaria called Cornelius he was in Centurion he wasn't you know people at that time probably didn't think he was he was even could be in the message yet he wasn't a Jew and they wasn't seeing all the things what God were doing yet Peter didn't even know had to be revealed we can read it in later in the chapter revealed to him by uh by Vision don't call unclean what I've called clean but you know he makes his prayers a devout man and one that feared God with all his house with which gave much arms to the people and prayed to God always and he saw a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming into him saying him Cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thy arms have come up for a memorial before God that's I maybe maybe that didn't mean nothing to you come up for a memorial you know what a memorial is it's something that's built in remembrance of something amen and his prayer amen built a memorial before God that cor Cornelius was on Earth asking him to fulfill his word maybe you don't realize just how many prayers you have prayed amen maybe you prayed prayer after prayer after prayer for your lost loved one don't worry it's there as a memorial amen to remind God that there's somebody still on Earth that has Faith to believe and they're calling out in faith and I'm going to answer them in my [Applause] time your prayers are not ever unanswered there is no such a thing as an unanswered prayer before God Amen we read read in uh in Revelations about the prayers of the saints that was stored up in The Vow it was prayers he couldn't answer at that moment not in the way they wanted them answered avenge me oh god of my blood but there is a time that they will be answered and they're going to be poured out upon the enemy and God's going to see his his Avenger is going to take place his avengement is going to take place those prayers will be answered come on now your prayers are also as a memorial they're stored up as a vow and at the right moment they're going to be poured out upon your enemy Hallelujah amen hallelujah their memorial before God we can read in Acts 12 we can read about Peter amen who was throw in a jail housee you know brother Mike I'm just kind of tying this in with what some of the things he had said you know and it's true we we we want to be a continuation of the book of Acts but many times we want to look at that as the power of healing and deliverance but if you look at the book of Acts it was also a people of Prayer amen and this is where Peter was throw in the innermost prison and and was kept there but the but the but the Bible says in verse 5 let's see let me go back acts 12 verse 5 Peter was kept in the prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him amen until an angel came down to where he was and he fell into his and there he's guarded at the door and beside him all all all all of there and there he is am man locked in the most inner prison but listen it doesn't matter whether the devil's got somebody that's God's God to go after them it doesn't matter if you maybe your own child has been locked in the deepest darkest dungeon of Hell and Hell has surrounded themselves amen around them amen just keep calling upon God and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye an angel can go to the ark and bring them out to Freedom amen but can we find somebody that'll be standing in faith pray in the prayer faith it doesn't matter what signs look like it doesn't matter what circumstances look like it doesn't matter how bad it looks or how many more drugs are in or this that and the other whatever they're in it does not matter what matters there's about to be a vow poured out upon my enemy and my child is going to be set free Hallelujah and this is what happened and he was brought out in Freedom we can read all about it but we save a little time Romans CH 12 and verse 9 says let love be without dissimilation other words don't let your love be in a pretend kind of love pretty much what it means you know you can pretend to love somebody but that ain't the love of Christ amen abour that which is evil cling to that which is good be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in Hope patient in Tribulation continuing instant in prayer well brother Timothy I'm in a trial just be patient God's going to move amen well I've asked and I've well just keep standing there in faith well I what about this knock and keep on knocking well I believe we ought to do that that's what we're talking about but if you read that scripture it doesn't say go get a preacher and he knock and keep on knocking for you come on it's you and your relationship between you and God making your intercession in prayer amen before you and God listen if we ain't careful we can turn our own our own thoughts and our own thinking our own message movement into another Catholicism where you have to come to a priest and the priest pray for you and he he he you know all that ain't what it's about sure I believe in laying hands on the sick but I believe that a little mother somewhere can Amen in faith amen cast out a devil I believe that someone under the unction of the Holy Ghost can speak a word it doesn't have to be a preacher but speak the word and freedom take place 2 Corinthians 1 and verse 8 says for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life that sounds like a pretty good test right there but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raises the Dead who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet Deliver Us in other words we've already put our trust in God and he's already delivered us from the main death amen he delivered us from the death where we are separated from God and and we're we're away from God he's delivered so God can Deliver Us from that death he can Deliver Us from a physical death amen but we had a sentence of death in oursel that we should not trust in oursel but in the god which raised the Dead who Deliver Us from a great death and does deliver in whom we trust that he will yet Deliver Us ye also helping together by prayer for us how can I help by prayer for us amen I I actually somebody put this I don't know where I seen this somebody put this about David Livingston he's known as Africa's greatest missionary from he lived from 1813 to 1873 but he he would go into the inner parts of Africa and the native tribes and many of them opposed him and many of them threatened to even kill him and eat him uh and there was a particular particular warlike tribe that was going to kill him and everyone in the and it said they was going to kill him and everyone in their party one afternoon they was setting up camp and the Word was that these warriors were tracking them all day and they were outside the camp and they were going to attack when it got dark making reference to that evening he would write this on January the 14th 1856 he said it is evening I feel much turmoil and fear in Prospect of having all my plans knocked on the head by Savages who are just now outside the camp those who studied his handwriting said you could even see the fear in the way he wrote the letter said he wrote but Jesus said all power is given to me in heaven and earth and lo I'm with you always even unto the ends of the Earth Livingston will also write this is the word of a gentleman of most strict and sacred honor so that's the end of my fear I feel quiet and calm now hallelujah what did he do he went back to the word amen the warriors were still out there the threats were still real but he went back to his word to the word that said he is the he is with us even to the end of the world so God knows exactly where we're at Warriors didn't attack that night later the tribe would be brought to brought to faith in Christ and a couple of years later David Livingston asked the chief of that tribe said do you remember the night you was tracking my party he said yes said we had heard rumors that you was going to attack he said that's right we were ready to attack the camp and kill you and everyone else he said well why didn't you attack he said well we got close to the camp we looked and there was 47 Warriors surrounding your camp with swords in their hands and David livon was baffled they didn't have any guards or any Warriors but later when he was in Scotland on a Furlow and he shared the story at a church that had been supporting his mission a man came forward and said afterwards with his prayer journal and said look I wrote it down on January the 14th 1856 was at the night and David said yes the man said that night he was ready to him that night a group of men came to pray for you we prayed for your protection and I wrote it down there were 47 men praying for you that night come on even though they thought there was maybe around a chair gathered together in a room but their prayer took them over into Africa in the jungle and set them as a protection around a man of God do you know how powerful your prayer is sometimes the devil wants to make you think it no goes no further than 6 foot or S foot or 8 foot whatever the height of your ceiling but he want you he don't want you to know that it goes over and it places a guard between the enemy and the one you're praying for come on somebody that is what your prayer does no wonder the devil hasn't taken already some of your children and killed them in a car wreck or killed them in drugs or whatever and they laid their life to was they can't because there's a pillar of fire that is surrounding them why because there's a faithful mom and dad that gets on their knees every night and say God don't forget this one don't forget this one God I need you to reach out and touch that one I need you to move over there and your prayer is not just in your room it's not just 6 foot above you but it's going to wear their at and it's putting a fire around them and the devil can't touch them if he wanted to I remember one of my first trips I've told this before but I one of my it was my first trip overseas as far as a minister brother Danny Steam and brother Jackie Benton and when I say this I always got to mention this because some people think because a man doesn't have a certain type Ministry or a certain type way of Deliverance or a certain way or he he he preaches just simple Faith or whatever they want to call it that he that that you know just because he ain't mentioning the Seven Seals or this that and the other then he's not preaching deep things well listen prayer is one of the deepest things there is honestly but I'm not even talking about myself I'm talking about brother Jackie Benton man circled the globe I don't know how many times went to the Philippines I don't know how many times to the point they actually wrote songs about him I would actually be there with him you know the day we would meet there in Miami Florida I'd meet brother Danny steaming there and he brother Jackie would fly and meet us there then we'd get on a plane and go to Guyana brother Jackie had just either the night before or two one night before had just flew in from the Philippines got on another plane and flew down to meet us to go to Guyana and you go down into the jungles and you'd walk by these houses and and would even Believers house and these little kids would come out and they' say Hey Brother Jackie is back that man has done Untold things for the kingdom of God there going to be a lot of lot of people scrubbing their feet when that man gets his rewards amen because God used him in many mighty ways there there was a man that was there one of the pastors he said hey he said we love we love brother Jackie here he said we love we love his his preaching but he said when that man sings he gets down in your soul yes sir and he would he would take guitars he would take clothes or whatever and he would just leave them there for the be find somebody with a little heart to play guitar he'd leave it with him and there was guitar scattered all up and down that jungle but here we are in the middle of this jungle and my papa buts was facing uh heart surgery pretty I think it was heart surgery or maybe it was remove his kidney one of the two facing some major surgery and it wasn't looking all that great and and I you know I love Papa me and my papa would Liv next door had lot of great memories and the devil starts working on my mind you know like you're here in this jungle now and you can't even call out you can't you can't nobody can't even tell you if you live through it you don't even know and you're going to be here for a week and all this stuff is just mind battles I never forget though one morning we decided to go up and visit this other other tribe that was way up in the north part there way way it's a long travel it was about 8 hours by boat anyway we went up and we morning was breaking they didn't even know if they'd be there cuz they're nomadic and they still hunt listen when you went when I went there in 2003 I don't know what it's like now but it was like going back two or 300 years and and here they still travel by Dugout canoes and and all that stuff and here we come up on this little motorboat and we drive up Under The Canopy of the Jungle and I'm kind of getting up out of my seat and wondering what's happening and and this white haired Indian and two guys with these big old looking Spears had had stepped out of the bushes right as we pulled up they stepped out of the bushes and he screaming to the top of his lungs I'm thinking oh lord well brother Timothy I thought you'd be in faith well pardon me I'm a man of like passions I like man cuz I done been that done been told we was about 40 miles from those that eat people so here we are we got all this going on and he's screaming but all of a sudden I see a tear coming out of brother Basil's eye and I seen a tear coming out of that white-haired Indians and he turned around brother Basel turned around he said this is the chief of that tribe we're coming to visit he said he was in his his tent or his little cottage or whatever little little jungle house that he was in he said he said he was in there in prayer and while he was praying an angel appeared to him he said go to the mouth of the creek I got three white man bringing fire yeah Faith arose in this old boy's heart I realized God knew where I was at he knew even if I was in a place the GPS couldn't find me and nobody could even get to me I couldn't get a call nowhere but God knew where I was at the angels of God knew where I was at come on somebody listen that ain't just for the jungles of Guyana that's for this building here tonight God knows exactly where you're at he knows exactly what you're going through he knows exactly the trials that has tearing your heart apart he knows all about it Philippians 4 and verse4 says rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice let your Mo moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanks giving with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God and then the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus Colossians 4 and verse 4 and verse2 says continue in prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving with all pray and also for us that God would open unto us a door of utterance speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds 1 Thessalonians 5 and: 12 say we beseech you Brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you in the Lord admonish you and to esteem them very highly in the love for the work's sake and be at peace among yourself now we exhort you breth warn them that are unruly Comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and all men Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks ties it all together pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of GE of God in Christ Jesus concerning you 1 Peter 3 and verse2 for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ear are open unto their prayers 1 Peter 4 and verse one says for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that has suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh of the lust of men but to the will of God for the time pass our life may Su suffice us to have wrought the will of Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness and lust excess of wine revellings banquetings and ab abominable idolatries wherein they think it strange that you run not with them that are same excess of Riot speak e speaking evil of you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men and flesh but live according to God in the spirit but in the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore so and watch unto prayer be on guard with prayer so we should always pray that we're worthy to escape Jude 1:14 talks about this but it goes down to verse 20 but you beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of Our Lord CH Jesus Christ unto eternal life Psalms 5 vers1 says give ear to my words oh Lord consider my meditation hearken unto the voice of my king My Cry of my king and my God unto thee will I pray my voice shalt thou hear in the morning oh Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will look up I'll keep my eyes on you no matter what the answer is no matter if if the answer comes when I think it ought to come I'm going to keep my eyes on you Lord so therefore that's the reason brother man say the reason the prayer of faith shall save the sick that's the individual's prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much if he only knew that in your hand Christ gave us the authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon the world's ever known prayer it changes things it'll change the mind of God it did it too after death was pronounced on a king he prayed and God told the prophet go tell him I heard his prayer the prophet came in and said you're going to die and he turned his face to the wall and began to pray and the God said go tell told the prophet said go say thus sayith the Lord you're going to live it changed amen the outcome of that moment prayer did could you mind imagine Isaiah come through thus sayth the Lord you're going to die he's going to die your King's going to die told everybody King's going to die God told him go back and tell him he's not going to die what happened prayer the most powerful weapon that was ever put in anybody's hands and I can see Isaiah walking back saying pardon me he's going to live thus say the Lord he's going to live Prayer Changes Things he said so so many times on the platform I see it turn so dark I'll just say go ahead the Lord bless you the Lord make you well but when you hear it speak out thus said the Lord Mark your book down he said when I'm speaking it's not me under it's not me it's under is under inspiration it's not me it's him the pillar of fire you seen in the picture the woman was told with his stomach trouble the woman told the sto thus say the Lord you're going to be well go eat and the woman came behind her lump on her throat and what happened they went off the platform rejoiced she said if God could Inspire that person to tell me what my life was I'll not disbelieve it no matter what happens and here she goes on and we know the story they go home and it ain't immediately it ain't in that moment of such great expectation I just heard him tell me my name told me who I was told me where I live told me this had to be God so God's going to heal me but it wasn't in that moment it was some weeks later going about everyday chores everyday living everyday life one of them making a bed one of them just cook some breakfast for their children all of a sudden she feels a warm feeling come over her and there she had been in prayer and Thanksgiving and a warm feeling come over her yes sir man I kind of feel a little hungry she hadn't been able to eat just boil right back up because of all the things on her stomach here she sits down and she begins to eat oatmeal she begins to eat this she ate all the leftovers she had brother said a g gastronomical Jubilee she said I think I'll run down and tell my neighbor what's happened to me and she gets down there and they're screaming and shouting going on there and here this woman had got up and started making the bed and was just thanking the lord and all of a sudden she realized this thing had fell off and it fell off she couldn't find it she's shaking out the sheet she's looking for it and she can't find it it had left her he said what happened he said the healing angel came through the [Music] neighborhood and he found at this house a woman still had Faith yes she wasn't in doubt it was weeks later but she wouldn't say man he told me who I was but I don't I guess it just ain't going to happen maybe I lost my faith no she was still in faith when he comes will he find faith and he comes into the house and he finds her under anticipation to receive what was told her that's exactly the ones that's going to go into Rapture Amen on the ones that when he comes they in anticipation to receive exactly what he told her the healing angel came through the neighborhood he said don't you know sometimes when you pray the angel of God can't get you at that get to you at that right that just at that moment we can't see all of that that goes on in these other atmospheres we know a Daniel that prayed God heard his prayer the first day but it was 21 days right 21 days till his a prayer was answered but he said I heard your prayer on the first day but the prince of this Kingdom with stood me there was a battle that was going on could you imagine the angel fighting that battle and coming and finding you that lost your faith he done fought for 21 days through all kinds of things of of demonic forces to get to you and he gets to you and he finds man they done walked away they ain't in F no he wants to find some somebody that's in faith that has Faith to believe that no matter how long it takes what the circumstances are I'm going to give Thanksgiving unto God and pray and ask God to fulfill what he said he would do and I know my prayers are being held there as a [Applause] memorial and he's heard my request and he will answer in his time he says the Angel God knew those people he knew what God had pronounced on them and he was going through the neighborhood right then hunting those women up hello when's it going to be your turn to be hunted up yes sir we get hunted by Devils all the time but what about being hunted by the angels of God to come knock on your door and say hey it's your morning for your request to be fulfilled Hallelujah this is your time for it to happen this is your service that you've been asking for and looking for and this is your moment that I'm going to fulfill your request come hunting them up perfor to perform what he said would come to pass what if they would have disbelieved what if
