blessings that you have passed on to us lord in our way times you have kept us from harm and danger lord times that you've looked over us and lord there's times that we're not even aware of but yet you've been there the whole time lord you have led us and passed a righteousness father you've led us a long life's journey and father many times we're not even coherent to the plan of god but lord we're so thankful that you're mindful of us tonight we're thankful lord that we're your children and where your children are lord you're there to impart the blessings of life so father we just come and we humble ourselves tonight and we just ask that you would just freely speak words to your people father i ask you give us ears that can hear give us mouth that will speak but more importantly father tonight give us a heart that can receive so lord we just commit this service to you tonight father we love you lord and we're so thankful god we're so thankful that we are saved and we're your children you have called us you have chosen us and you've anointed us for this opportunity and for this time for we ask it in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen if you have your bibles tonight we're going to look here in the book of nehemiah you love the lord this evening amen it's good to be here nehemiah we're going to look here in verse chapter 4 and verse 7. chapter four and verse seven glad to see that the rain the storm didn't keep you guys away tonight i was concerned about that when i pulled up at five o'clock it was pouring down a monsoon but we're glad we're here so you know what you made the effort to be here right so let's have church let's allow the lord to speak to us we find here in nehemiah 4 and verse 7 but it came to pass that sin ballot and tobiah the arabians and the ammonites and the astrodites heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very roth you know what i believe that the devils of hell realized this past weekend that some breaches got stopped up that somebody ruined the devil's plans over the weekend he had plans for your life he has plans for your future but god has other plans so god came down and destroyed the devil's plans that he had for you we find here and then in verse 8 they all conspired to them together to come in the fight against jerusalem and to hinder it nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god come on church and a set watch against them day and night because of them and judah said the strength of the bearers of burden is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we're not able to build the wall and our our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them enslave him and cause the work to cease notice the devil he always tries to slip in unaware unannounced when you least expect it that's why we always have to be on guard we never let our guard down and to recognize the devil in every one of his schemes so we find here that says verse 12 and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times they reiterated the enemy's plans to him ten times they wanted them to know that they know that the devil is against you all right they had done it ten times for all the places which you shall return unto us they will be upon you therefore said i in the lower places behind the wall and on the high places even or i even set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bows notice you wasn't unarmed but god prepared you he's given you a weapon it's up to you to use that weapon it's up to you to to take that weapon with you and i looked and i rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren if ever there ever been a time for us to fight for our brethren is now fight for your brethren fight for your sons come on moms and dads fight for your daughters fight for your wives fight for your houses has there ever been a time for us to fight this now so i hope you come tonight to fight hope you come tonight with your sword or whatever you got you come to use it tonight and not to sit idle and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and god had brought their counsel to not that we returned all of us to the wall everyone unto his work and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both spears and shields and bows and herbergens or however you say that word i'm sorry and the rulers were behind all the house of judah they which build it on the wall and they would bear burdens with all those that were laden or laded everyone with his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand he held a weapon you can be seated this evening i just want to speak to you once again on god does impossible math this will be part six but i want to give it a subtitle tonight from that time and we find here that nehemiah had a great burden to rebuild the wall so that his people could worship god again and offer sacrifices but it's just as any of us and you try to do god a service the devil is always there to disrupt the plan of god so he comes in and he and he's he you know that we know how the devil does he calls cause disruption but nehemiah went down to the city he surveyed the walls he didn't tell anybody what he was doing and we finally gathered the people again the next day in nehemiah 2 and verse 18 and he begins to tell them the revelation that he has or the desire that he has to rebuild the wall so that they can gather together again in the city behind the walls there and begin to worship god and offer god's sacrifice and praise so that their burdens and their sins can be lifted from them and we find here that each of them the bible would tell us they all commanded they all spoke back to nehemiah and they said let us rise up and build so they caught the revelation or they caught the inspiration behind nehemiah's desire and i wonder tonight if we can catch that inspiration behind this prophetic ministry that god has sent down in this hour it's not to build his own kingdom but it was to rebuild the kingdom of god where you can worship god in spirit and in truth with nothing broken no breaches stop we can serve a living god with signs and wonders and the outpouring of the spirit i believe that's what god sent william branham for in this hour was to rebuild the walls of true worship but we find just like in that day they came in this day and they want to throw off well you can't build the wall well you can't do this we're going to bring it to naught and we'll find here that anytime you start to do something for god you're going to face opposition and we notice the work cease for a little bit not permanently but it ceased for a little bit but god brought the enemy's plans to not god brought the enemy's plans to not and when nehemiah and the people begin to look back and they realize god brought our enemies plans to not they can't stop us from building the wall we've already started this work and he that started it is more than able to finish it so what did they leave they looked back from that time and they drew courage all the fear left and they had a courage to drive to finish what was started and i wanted to like young people oh can you realize what happened this past weekend or over last month in oklahoma can that be the driving force to finish what god has started you can look back from that time and realize that's the moment that i met god that's the moment that i've been changed that's the moment where god does something supernaturally for me give me give me a little bit more volume up here if you don't mind brother madam will say this in the message from that time he says you know we as humans we can all think of things as in a certain time such as things that are taking place you know many of us we have parents or grandparents they would always tell you that they trust over the hill both ways to school rain sleet hell and snow uphill both ways they don't ever tell you about the downhill but it's always up it's always the worst part of it and they always remember from that time they're always pointing back and we and brother ben would tell us we all as humans tonight can recall things from a certain time he says practice all of us here tonight could call to remember remembers of certain things that are taking place in a certain time and from that time something changed now notice it could be good things or it could be bad things but nevertheless we can recall a certain moment or a certain time or a certain event or a certain memory and we could go back think about this the gutenberg printing press it changed the world as we know it because before then there was the or the the literate the educated the elite that they are the only ones able to read and to write and now with the printing press it it it destroyed that or broke the monopoly of the literary elite and on education and it brought learning to everyone and it bolstered forth a middle-class people we look at the spanish influenza what it did in 1918 in 1919 it increased the need for medical science to be able to devise a vaccine so it can vaccinate the people to combat the disease or the virus and yet it was because at that time that they were able in this day to come up with a vaccine within a year for coping 19. it's what they learn they look back to what took place in that time and we think about the stock market crash of 1929 and what did it do it was the longest economic downturn in western world but yet it was from that event that it changed how we do banking it changed how we how we invest in our stocks and bonds how everything is traded it was because of that event and we can look back today and realize that event is still having a lasting effect on us today you know brother danny made a comment this weekend i may say that a couple times in this service this evening and i told brother tim that this service is going to be more so directed to the young people but he said well good we're all young so what that tells me is i'm expecting eight minutes from the front to the back all right from the front to the back from the front to the back from the front to the back because we're all young people what we found he made a comment he said you know he says preaching is about moments preaching is about moments notice here now as i tell this story this is in 1958 the sin of unbelief brother brahma said some time ago i was speaking to a girl and i felt led just to say something to her and i said sister after the service was over i said would you come to christ she said i belong to a church and if i wanted somebody to speak to me i'd get a pastor that had some sense said don't you try to ever embarrass me i said well very well i'm sorry no one knows of this but you and i i didn't mean to embarrass you i only asked you because i and i said i felt led notice here a prophet of god is standing for this young teenage girl to lead her to the lord her moment and notice her response don't you ever try to embarrass me call me out speak to me aside make a public spectacle said i only asked because i felt led standing by the side of a little rose bush by a baptist church down in nashville tennessee never forgot that night the wind was blowing the moon was shining she turned her little painted lips up her little nose and she snickled away and met up with a bunch of boys and about a year later because i was walking down the street i seen a young lady walking down the street with her skirts terrible and i looked at her and i thought surely that's not her and i turned and i started following her she looked at me as they passed and i caught up with her and she said hello preacher she remembered that time hello preacher i said how do you do aren't you she said yes i am she stopped and she reached in her pocketbook pulled out a cigarette says have one i said shame on you she said well maybe you'll take a little drink out of my bottle and i said does your daddy know this he being a deacon in the church she said i want to tell you something preacher now listen young person said i want to tell you something preacher do you remember that night you spoke to me by the bush and i said out and he said i'll never forget it no it made a lasting impression on the prophet it was a moment it was her moment she said that was my last call what a moment what a time to recognize it was your last call she goes that was my last call and here's the remark that beautiful young woman made she she got to this she got to this modern teenage rock and roll stuff and she said preacher my heart is so hard till i could see my mother's soul frying hell like a pancake and laugh at it my heart had become so hard that i could see my mother's soul fry in hell like a pancake and laugh at it so we find this young girl had a moment and she can look back to a time that she recognized that was her opportunity that she could give her heart to god and live a life victorious but because of embarrassment because of bitterness because she felt he called her out she turned away not from a man but she turned away from god and her heart becomes so hardened that she could see her own mother the one who birthed her into this life the one who cared for the one who gave her son the one who nourished her she could see that soul burn in hell and sit back and laugh at it what a moment but i want you to know young people not every moment has to be like that oh what we've been experiencing and even like tabernacle what we've been experiencing at oklahoma youth camp not every moment has to be like that but i will tell you tonight you will have that moment and it may very well be your last moment but what decision are you gonna make tonight in this moment in this time this could be the the moment that you drive that stake down and through all the the time that you have left you can look back to this night and say that was my moment and from that time you either begin to walk toward god or you're walking away but i'm here to tell you tonight this ain't a song or this ain't a sermon about change because our chains are gone this ain't about the past because we're moving on somebody's going on with jesus somebody's made a declaration i'm gonna serve god i'm gonna follow god i'm gonna give god hallelujah i'm gonna give god my all i'm not going to lay down i'm not going to give up i'm not going to quit i'm going to march on with god and from this time i beg god oh hallelujah i found my freedom in jesus i found my victory in his word i found who i need and he's tased me and he's here tonight to change you we find our freedom in him not just on wednesday night not just on sunday morning but every day every day we wake up and he is our freedom take for instance tonight say we have a woman of ill fame she was not always a woman of hill fame no there was a time that she was good there was a time that she was righteous there was a time she may have been a moral girl but on a certain night a certain place a certain thing happened and since that time she got on the wrong road and her life had been marred with sin blackness darkness and only judgment awaits you know i grew up not in church so i went to public school and i did everything that they did and i remember a lot of girls as i was growing up 9th grade 10th grade that you had a lot of respect for because it seemed like they went against the norm we would call them good moral girls you didn't hear anything bad about them but all of a sudden they made a choice all of a sudden this girl that you used to or this person this young person that used to kind of maybe set up a little bit higher than the rest because they seem to live a moral life for a better life they didn't just go to the parties and things they made a conscious decision to fit in and whether it may have been the first drag off a cigarette or it may have been the first hit off some drugs some marijuana joint or the first drink of a bottle and from that time he led them down a spiral path to darkness to where now maybe they're sleeping with every other boy in the school and we find their life is ruined their character is ruined and you'll never get your character back young person protect your character with everything you got listen to me protect your character young girls you protect your character you guard it with everything you got don't you letting some little boy weasel his way into your heart you protect it [Music] i don't even know why i'm going there but protect it guard it watch over it draw your sword build walls around your heart then only that one person is able to ever be able to enter through the gates of your heart to win your affection we find here take a drunk for instance a drunk he never started off with the intention of being drunk but no maybe he points back to a time brother brandon would would tell us that he was in new york with another preacher and they went down to this this drunk alley there there's drunks all over the place and he reached down to one and said you know hey let me just try to talk to him why are you here what did you do and he couldn't get a response out of the drum so the other preacher reached down there and he says now hey who are you why are you here and i'm just paraphrasing for the sake of time tonight and the drunk said oh if you just buy me a another drink i'll tell you my story he says now we can't do that we don't want to add to your sorrows but they finally got this drunk aroused enough to come to his senses enough that he could point back to the moment he could point back to an event that caused him to be there with all the other drunks and he said i came home from work one day he was a bank president a bank president no doubt made six figures had a good life of since we would look at him or he dressed in a three-piece suit and drove a nice car lived in a nice house and you think all that is happiness there was something missing and we found there was a dear john letter wrote for him when he got off work maybe came in a little bit late because he had to close the month out some of y'all get that later he had to close the month out so he worked a little bit late but when he got home he saw a dear john letter dear john i don't love you no more i took the kids and we're gone and maybe she left with another man another man that she allowed to get past those gates and win her affection and so he comes to his reality he says i can either shoot my brains out or i can go down to the saloon and he made a choice to go to the saloon and become a drunk on skid row because he looked back to a moment in a time that drove him or had an influence on him to drive him down a certain way and we find that it happens oh so many times but we don't have to allow the negative things in our life to influence us but if we're going to allow them to influence us let them allow them to influence us to things that are eternal you know i remember and i told you over and over and it seems like that's what we do as preachers we tell our own testimony over and over and over and maybe you don't realize how impactful that testimony has become to us but if you were where i was 20 something years ago when you were struck out of your mind driving your car at a high rate of speed ready to commit suicide and the angel the lord comes down and says turn your car around let me tell you that'll do something for you you can point back to that time that devil would come and lying you're saying you don't have it you never got nothing i can point back to that moment i can point back to that time i turned around i've been different i've been changed why because the angel of the lord came down and he's here to come down tonight i tell some of you young people it's not too late turn your car around turn your life around jump back home you can turn to something that has eternal benefit you can turn to something that's got eternal life in it there's a time where a man can come to something that's eternal some of you tonight you've had things nagging at you you've had spirits bumping into you trying to invade your space trying to influence you try to get you to doubt try to get you to quit trying to get you to give up trying to tell you you didn't get nothing friday you didn't get nothing saturday you didn't get nothing sunday you just didn't get nothing but i'm here to tell you if you can point that devil back to what you got that's where it's going to take place young person you got to realize i got to point him back to a time back to a time where i met face to face i came in a parallel but i walked out different combat came packing the devil but i left dancing in victory i left for choices because while i met god at a certain service and from that time i've been changed and from that time i've been different see when you come in the presence of the angel you cannot lead the same you know we make our vows at new year's how many you ever made a vow you know the way we just leave that one alone we know we made our vows i'm going to lose weight i quit saying that one it is what it is i'm past 40. ice cream cone here i come i'm all good with it i've been married close to 18 19 years now she's good with it we're happy okay no more i'm gonna lose weight it don't matter but we make our vows we make our so we're going to turn a new page you know many times that's how we come that's the mentality that maybe some of our young people that come to the altar i'm going to be different and it's you doing it and we appreciate your effort but you got to get to a point like buddy robinson look i'm coming up here he's going to give me the holy ghost and if i'm going to stay here until he does unless or if he doesn't i'm going to be a pile of bones when he comes back we got to get to that same determination we're going to serve god we're going to love god we're going to point we're going to drive down a stake in our time and we're going to anger our soul to it and we're never going to look back to the world see a man can come to god and his whole eternal destination can be changed i'm looking at men i'm looking at men and women right here tonight come to god in their entire eternal destination has been changed i look at a man back over here looked up at a water tower that's all it took a water tower looked to another young man all the parents didn't come home at 11 o'clock but god used god used that lake coming home for a purpose to bring a prodigal back to himself i look at another young man now one of the greatest gifts in this church come to a youth service and i was casting the net and casting the net and casting it trying to catch the young man that was behind him and he got caught up in the net but let me tell you oh what a catch we got that night and andrew tushner what a great gift what a great blessing he's been to even like tabernacle the young boy skateboarder punk going out drinking and doing god knows what there's no desire to serve god but one night in a youth meeting and tonight he can point back to that time he can point back to that service that's where it changed that's where my life turned that's where everything changed for me and i'm not the same i don't have the same desires it all changed and we got to get to that point young people let me say it like this we got to get to that point old people sometimes we think we've been in a message 20 years 30 years we don't need to make a move shame on you your heart needs to be tender enough to make a move toward god [Applause] god wants everybody god had grace for cain genesis 4 7 if thou doest well shall not be shall not be accepted so don't tell me tonight you can't live for god god's not calling god calls all everybody has an opportunity see we got to meet god not meet a doctrine not meet a church creed or church ideology or some man's idea but we got to get to a place until we actually meet god we actually encounter our moment and forever and forever and forever it has changed not only are you changed here but you're changed over there it changes your eternal destination think about this last time i spoke we spoke about the prodigal son how it's not the end of your story let me just pick back up if y'all don't mind on the prodigal son just for a minute here he was slopping the swine man his life had hit rock bottom he was the dregs of humanity the scum of the earth filthy stinking loss away from home no hope no future no promise of tomorrow you will look at him and say he don't have a chance he don't have a chance but he met god despite your unbelief despite the way you would judge him despite how he looked at him despite everything he's ever done despite him being living there with the swine and feeding the swine and eating pizza despite all that the angel of the lord came to him and shook him he said arise go back to your father's house and from that time he pulled himself together the best that he could and began to march on back to his father's house and i can just picture as he's going through maybe the city some of the unfamiliar places that he used to hang out at some of his old friends would come hey hey proddy come over here come back in here let's hang out a little bit we've all missed you you used to be the life of the party oh but used to where he used to be tempted and where he used to give in now he just keeps on walking he just keeps on walking how can he keep walking brother joe because he met the angel oh his spiritual amnesia had left now he realizes who i am i'm not a swine bobber i'm not somebody that's no count no good for nothing my father is a wealthy man our father is a wealthy man you belong to the king of kings and the lord of lords all you got to do is awaken yourself and come back to the father he turned down temptation he turned down the women he turned down the alcohol because his desires were changed his desires were changed in one moment because in one moment the angel of the lord came to his filthy dwelling one moment so i don't care where you are tonight i don't care where your loved one is tonight god will come to your filthy dwelling and god has a purpose and a plan for coming for your life he's not going to leave you the way he finds you come on some of you older people in the back back here need to rekindle that experience maybe you down there and you don't lost your feel for god and lost your love for god but i'm here to tell you all you got to do is come to yourself and realize why am i here i don't want to be here i don't want to be this way i want to be a real son of god i want to go back to my father's house you know abraham met god out there doing whatever he was doing shepherding picking berries doing whatever but there was a time the voice of god came down and spoke to abraham abraham it's time for you to leave the land of the chaldeans you need to depart from your your father and i'm going to take you to a city i'm going to take you somewhere and abraham oh he will begin to set out on this journey begin to follow this unseen god but he knew he heard the voice he knew he had met god and when god promised abraham that he was going to have a son and yet his body is old and his body is dead and his wife's body is dead yet the same god that spoke to him in the land of her the city of the chaldeans was the same god that spoke to him there and he had enough faith he could look back and say that god has never failed me and i'm saying he won't fail me today no matter how old i get how decrepit i get how dead my body becomes he won't fail me he's not failing me yet see abraham can look back he can look back to a time to where god moved many of you came in the prayer line many of you i spoke to after the prayer line and i ask you if god did something for you write it down in your bible write the date down we said brother joe come on that sounds a little bit odd well it's only odd if you want to be hot because what you're doing is physically driving a steak down this right here anytime your memory may fail you when you flip that follow if open it's right there right there april 4th right there something happened april 3rd 20 21 my life was changed 20 21 april 4th i got delivered i came in a prayer line i walked away different i asked god to give me my dancing he gave me more than a dance he gave me joy unspeakable and full of glory i asked god that i needed deliverance and god not only gave me deliverance but he gave me the holy ghost i asked god i need direction not only did god give you direction he told you exactly where you needed to be you write it down what does it do it reminds not only you when you can't see and you get feeble and sometimes you may come into amnesia but it also reminds that devil what god has done for you because you've got to eat down there and yeah you can point that devil back this is it right here i can open it up that's where i've been changed that's what god's done for me take that devil i'm not the same i don't have the same desire i don't have the same desire ideas i've been changed because my i was in the presence of the angel the man will say that's when a man meets god it changes his makeup it gives him a super sense gives him a super sense my my my clock is running crazy see when a man meets god something takes place see the super scent supersedes anything that we can taste phil smelling here it controls the five senses see the five senses will tell you when you feel the anointing of the holy ghost come down to stay in your seat because it's not normal for you to act the way you act when the holy spirit falls on you but if you allow that super sense to take over you'll find yourself laughing uncontrollably you'll find yourself running around the church you'll find yourself dancing in the spirit because why because that super sense makes you act in ways you wouldn't normally act because that super sense is the is the holy ghost the problem of god will say it's the holy ghost coming down and it overrides all the other false senses the problem is some of us can't get out of the way long enough to allow that super sense to take over you feel the spirit move by you how many you've ever felt the spirit moved by and you just quenched it not me not me i ain't gonna look like that run like that act like that when we then we then we we look back at these young people we don't need that like that in church shame on you you ain't met god i told the young people when i got the holy ghost i didn't jump and shout i didn't have that i can't tie my experience back to that but i know i got it how do you know brother joe because my desires are different the things i used to desire without the holy ghost i don't desire no more look i got i got an ipad i got an iphone i got computers i got everything i don't have no kind of protection on them why because i got the protection of the holy ghost he guards me i'm not saying that to prop myself up i'm just telling you that's what the holy ghost can do for you the holy ghost can take that desire out of your heart well you used to want to look at those kind of things now it makes you want to get into the word where you study the gifts of god and what god has for you in this hour so we find some of this past weekend some of you got so drunk on the spirit he was acting in ways that defied the five senses see that's what happens and no matter how hard you could try without that sixth sense you would look like a total fool trying to act drunk you can't do it you've got to get intoxicated to act like a drunk man and you're not acting at that point you're drunk so when you allow that sixth sense to add super sense to overtake you and lift you up into the heavenly places where you met god and god's come down and broke the shackles and feathers off your life you got a reason to to dance you got a reason to get drunk you got a reason to laugh in the devil's face because why because god has come down and changed the devil's plans and brought his desires for you to not well he thought he was going to destroy you when he thought he was going to get you to commit suicide or give up and turn back to the world god comes down in a weekend service and changes your very makeup where you want to give up where you wanted to quit god came down and give you that power and said you're not a quitter you're a finisher born it is coming oh ain't nobody's gonna hold me down i've been born for this moment god throw me here for this time hallelujah there was a sister over the weekend came in a prayer lie bound by fear her family had a history of issues schizophrenia she was fearful that these things would would take over her and she'd come underneath that and become that very reserved sister brother aaron and i began to pray with her she'd come up and we'll just begin to tell us these things but then i began to begin to pray and the lord began to speak to her in a personal way she began to jump she'd been a shout but it was more than just a jump and a shout a revelation broke forth in her i don't have to be that that may have been underneath my first birth but i've been born again of the spirit of god i don't have to fear being a schizo i don't have to fear any of that kind of thing no because why because we begin to tell her you're a daughter of god you never was and that yeah you never belonged to the devil to begin with you've always belonged to god and that revelation dropped down and they told us some of her some of the people from dallas told us that that's not like her she never has done that in her life and they've been to church with her for a long time that's not her nature to do that but let me tell you when you come in the presence of the angel oh he'll get you to do things you wouldn't normally do and i could testify on brother aaron can too when we came and stepped in right up here the presence of almighty god met with us it wasn't brother aaron it wasn't brother joe it wasn't the effort of a man but the angel of the lord stood right here dog patient after patient after patient and wanted to do he deserved and he cast out and he brought deliverance and he brought the holy ghost and he brought healing he did it right here and you can tie yourself back to that moment that's where i met god that's where i got free that's where i got delivered that's what service i got the holy ghost right there he lay hands on them and before you say one word five seconds in they're out brother aaron i don't know but have you ever just laid hands on somebody and they went out like that under your own power for the tim we don't have that power we don't have that capability what am i telling you church i'm telling you that the holy ghost that the angel of the lord visits this church [Music] service after service well why do they have to act like that take it up with the angel why don't they gotta dance and jump and shout and scream and they laugh in the spirit take it up with the angel but i'm here to tell you as long as he's coming i'm coming in i'm stepping in i'm going to have my moment i'm going to have my change i'm going to have my opportunity i'm going to go down my stake i'm going to point the devil back to that service that's where that's where from that time from that service the chains broke liberation came the holy ghost fell i'm free i'm free tonight no longer bound by feet hallelujah see the holy ghost is that super sense see abraham against hope he believed in hope being not weak in faith the bible said he he considered not the weakness of his own body or the deadness of his own body and the bible say he staggered not you face a lot of opposition here in laodicea but don't stagger young person don't stagger mom and dad i'll stagger her mamaw papaw however you want to say that grandma granddad however you like to say it don't stagger don't stack it through unbelief don't stagger because you're in a trial don't give up god knows what's best for you let me give you one word of confidence like god doesn't make mistakes god doesn't make mistakes if god brought you to it he's going to bring you through it all right notice here a young teenage boy that some of y'all can can kind of fit in with this young teenage boy we all know his name is david david one time he encountered a bear stole a little sheep well you know that bear's bigger than me i guess that little sheep would just let it go off no that wasn't david's mentality david wasn't going to give a sheep up he wasn't going to give a hoof up he said david said that's mine see some of us we live and we compromise a lot of times with the devil well i guess i can just live with this i'll figure out how to get through this let me tell you brother danny was conveying a story to me and brother aaron in the back room the other night said about a brother that was coming to his church and he was bound by a bunch of different things and a long time ago he went to a certain church and a certain brother prayed for him and he said lord we ask that you give this brother a season of victories and that brother got a season of victories he got a season of victories let me tell you when the season was up everything came rushing back on him and he was a troubled man i'm gonna tell you even like tabernacle we don't preach a season of victories we preach the holy ghost we preach total victory we preach total annihilation we preach deliverance and total deliverance and you can point back to that time not a season but a real experience where you met god [Applause] thank you sir so we find david the bear come up took a little slingshot bam knocked the bear down got sheep back great story that's how we read it ain't it black and white we read it like a newspaper article well did you read that story today brother there was another a line came up roar david knocked it down split his throat got the sheep back i'm gonna tell you if david was telling this story it'd be more emphatic and more intense than that he wouldn't just be oh well that's a pretty good story here's his 14 year old kid got a little sling in his hand he's poorly dressed little ruddy guy he ain't very big you know probably looks like austin also knocked his below his pale boy just a little bit short thing and you know and he wouldn't think he could do anything right little bitty frail skinny little fella don't wear buckle five that's how we read the bible sometimes but put yourself where david was at put yourself when david come against that bear david knew that there was no human ability that he possessed that should be able to kill a bear that was grave big a wild beastly animal but the anointing of the holy ghost came upon david and brought david the victory and when the line rose up the same holy ghost fell again and brought david another victory david had an experience upon the experience and began to add to his experience and when he faced goliath he didn't shudder he didn't fret he didn't go and don't believe he said come here boy i'm ready for the job i've had a moment with the bear i've had a moment with the line i've had my moment i'm gonna tell you ain't nothing cause i'm distorting me i'm a son of god i know my position i've had an experience i can point back i can point back to a time where i met god there was no future possibility but god but god david would point back to a time and from that time he never feared from that time he never worried he knew he met samuel and samuel had anointed him to be a king oh young person mom and dad we have been anointed in laodicea to sit with the king we have been anointed to be the bride of christ we have been anointed not just by a prophet but by the seventh angel by the messenger by the one who's going to close it all wrap all the loose sins and reveal the mysteries you have been anointed by that angel why do we fret why do we fear it's only the father trying to bring you the revelation of the word notice now see the problem is the bible would tell us in ephesians 6 12 we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places so the things that you face here is greater than what david faced there you face depression you face suicide you face anxieties some of you face fear you know what fear is fear is keeping you bound and keeping you living free while you're alive because you're afraid to do anything you're afraid to go anywhere you're afraid to step out and trust god but i want you to know fear is a liar see what we face is greater than what they face sister atlanta stage four lymphoma cancer and with that no doubt most likely came fear fear the unknown fear how she was gonna how severe the case was gonna be severe if even death would take her life severe hit the children severe hit the father what's gonna happen to my wife what's gonna happen to my you know my mom what's gonna happen see there's no human possibility for a little frail woman whose lungs on one side was full of cancer but god but god anointed sister atlanta in the butt's family for victory did you hear what i said anointed them for victory well what are you saying brother joe does the did they ever worry anymore no i doubt they have any kind of concern about word because all of that family can point back to a moment that little sister got down and began to run around this altar began to run around the church why because she caught the revelation i'm leaning on the everlasting hand or the everlasting arm of the almighty and when you can realize that's where your faith is anchored that's where your soul is is tied to it's not tied to some man it's not tied to some preacher it's not tied to some doctor but it's tied to jesus oh when you got cancer you can dance when you got fear you can fake free from it when you got brain bleed you can know that you're god's still healed you're god's still safe you're god's still delivered sister karen faced a midline shift there was no human possibility to hurt for her to make it doctor told me she's got five minutes maybe five years but she'll be in a vegetable state but god but god why did god do these things it's a landmark brother johnny you can look back to sister atlanta's testimony and say and realize that same god is your god that same god delivers sister karen is your god tonight it's a landmark you can look back this church can look back and say god god saves are god healed cancer is not bigger than our god brain bleeds is not bigger than our gospel why does god do these things he does it so that you can have the assurance that he will do what he says he'll do he will he has destroyed the enemy's plans see when god promises god will keep his word when god promised to heal you he will do it when god promised to give you the holy ghost he will do it so don't come to me and say it doesn't work it does work i can testify it's life-changing power i can tell you that the holy ghost is real i can tell you that deliverance and healing is real i can look at them cases after cases our god is a deliverer our god is awesome our god is mighty our god is able to do exceeded abundantly above all that we can even ask or think if we could just let ourselves get away from our five senses and came into the presence of the angel unreserved say god here i am i'm going to let go i'm in your presence oh my brother said what the ministry needs tonight there's not so many bas and dd's but it needs an experience of the baptism of the holy ghost that puts life into the man and gives him faith in a living god that change is not an experience so that's kind of where i'm driving this home to tonight what the ministry needs is not trying to extinguish the fire that said even like tabernacle no won't you stop trying to put the fire out and come and join us come on down here to louisiana we invite you one and all come and taste and see that god is good and i'm gonna promise you one thing when you come in the presence of the angel and he meets you at this altar you will not go home the same you may go home staggering you may go home drunk you may even speak in tongues but one thing's for sure you will not go home the same criticizer that you came with because god is giving a promise that he will meet you if you come with a real heart i want to meet god i want to have a real experience i don't want to be this way any longer god is obligated to meet you god is obligated to do something for you hallelujah we need to set aside our theological ideas set aside how well you can explain the mysteries i don't care how well you can explain the mystery it don't bother me i like teaching but i love anointed preaching amen i love teaching it grounds you it solidifies you it ties you back where you know the foundation you stand on that's all good but that's all you got and i don't want it if all you got is teaching i don't want it you better give me some anointed holy ghost preaching to go with it you better give me some fire you better give me some some of that real and knowing that real intoxication so when i come out of that service i could take some i could take some wine back when i was in the in the world we drank wine we drank beer they're nastiest things in the world they have a different flavor altogether they still have the same effect one takes longer you can just take all that doctrine you won't you can take all that teaching you want let me tell you you start drinking other real heavy stuff that holy ghost comes down through that anointing preaching it'll do something for you right quick you'll lay over here you'll be drunk laughing in the spirit because why because you've become under that that intoxication of that strong drink you know moses we know the story of moses the bible tell us in exodus 3 that the angel lord appeared on him in the flame of fire out of the midst of a bush think about that one what if he was hurting sheep out there in the wilderness all along you and a bunch of sheep blatant around the mountain and you go and you see this bush and this bush is on fire and this bush ain't putting out a bit of smoke it's just blazing brother danny said that moses's attitude toward the burning bush determine his destination and your attitude toward these services toward the outpouring of the holy spirit will determine your eternal destination your attitude mom dad grandparent see moses said i will turn aside and i will see this great sight while the bush not burn so let me just say this tonight he not only god was not only the god of abraham isaac and jacob but he was moses's god too and he's not only the god of abraham isaac and jacob and moses william branham and all these other messengers came before them he's your god the same god the same power the same signs the same wonders the same anointing see brother will say this he said now there was a time when a man had to be trained in all his wisdom and all the theology of the word of god and he know that by letter he'd been schooled he had all the degrees he was smart until the until he could teach the egyptian scholars and their teachers he knowed all about it by letter but a coward with it he knew it all in his mind but he was a coward with it he was running and he went out on the backside of a desert herding sheep for a stranger but there come a time that when he when god met him there in the burning bush and from that time moses was changed see from that time moses was changed and you know he he tried to do it all in himself without an experience and anytime you try to do it with yourself and without the anointing of the holy ghost or without the real experience of the baptism of the spirit of god you're just going to fail teaching is all right the prophet of god said but the letter killeth the spirit gives life say in the presence of that burning bush he know more about god in five minutes than he'd been taught in 40 years so what are you saying brother john said i'd rather have a five-minute encounter with the burning bush than all the years all the education all the theological discussions of the message of the doctrines of the the seals of the the church ages of all the mission you give me five minutes alone with the angel of the lord it's more than all the doctrine you can lay before me because the letter killed it but the spirit of god is the one that's here to give life he can anoint those mysteries anoint those shields and anoint those church ages and anoint the word of god so it not only just lays on the page but it becomes a living reality when the word becomes real and you take it into your bosom and you become the word of god five minutes five minutes is all you need tonight in that presence five minutes see moses had a supernatural experience in order to be a prophet he had to in order to be the bride you have to as well see we got to be going born again can i go just a little bit further we'll bring this i won't hold you much longer but i'm saying the the message this day the scripture is the field he says i talked to my nephew a while ago a little catholic boy that's an uncle bill i've been running from pillar to post going everywhere trying to find something night after night before this meeting started he'd been crying and out at nighttime he'd been dreaming dreams of coming in and running up to the altar we're preaching and making a confession that he's been wrong i said melvin no matter where you try to go how many churches you join how many hail marys you say or how many blessings you get from man you've got to be born again of the spirit of god it's the only thing that'll satisfy the human heart he says now i know they got a substitute today being born again shake hands with the preacher put your name on the book be friend that you know that is a dogma that's not the bible truth he says now when the day of pentecost fully come the pastor walked out and shook hands with the people that ain't what we do it even like tabernacle but when the day of pentecost was had fully come at the inauguration of the church there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and it filled the house where they were sitting that's how the holy spirit comes the first time that's how it comes every time that's how it comes since that time he is god and he changes not see it was an experience he just didn't have a letter to read or lost read or books to read he had an experience that god still lived that's what we want for you not just a letter not just an idea not just a theology not just a doctrine but a reality that he lives that he lives you know i i made a comment i actually put it down here and i probably got to it i don't know if i may have skipped over i'll make this comment to you tonight you got to get to the point if you had to go to hell and you was a last man standing but you met god he's going to deliver you from hell if you went to hell and you met god and god changed now we know that can't happen but i'm just being hypothetical because sometimes that's how we feel all alone we feel like our life is in a living hell we've got trials on this side and trials on that side but you get to the place where you met god and you're standing all alone in the midst of all the adversity that could be around you but yet you got an anchor of faith because you had an experience where you met god and you know god will deliver you and you just sit there waiting if it ain't today god i'm gonna be waiting tomorrow if it's not tomorrow god i'm gonna come the next service and the next service and the next service i'm gonna come with an expectation because i have met god and i'm ready for the holy ghost and i'm ready for my deliverance and i'm ready for my healing and i am ready to light god because why because i have made god and i can point that devil back to a time where it all changed in a service where it all changed in the service where i was born again in a sermon where i received the holy ghost it's backside of the desert experience and when you have that all the devils out of hell can't talk you out of it you met god and until you meet god you'll be like that young girl that i spoke of earlier you got to have an experience but i said what we need today is somebody to meet god face to face talk to the situation and when you meet god things are changed certainly that's the only way we can have things moses was a coward running from the issue but after he met god he went marching with a stick in his hand a baby on a donkey and a wife going to take over what a difference what a difference the experience makes so moses when he got down to pharaoh i want you to notice he didn't bow his knee to pharaoh mr pharaoh could you please let my people go no i think them i can see moses kind of being kind of like me a little bit loud passionate he stuttered i do a little bit of that too so we're in good company moses went down there he stood flat-footed look here pharaoh i know who you are i know your position but i ain't afraid of you moses you let my people go you let them young people go you let them old people go you've held them by fear you've held them by depression you hit them by anxiety you heard them by sickness but today moses i'm telling you let them go how can moses stand before them because moses had bent his knees in the presence of the angel at the burning bush and he had had an experience that god is real and when you have that same experience church i don't care what you face you'll fear no enemy you'll fear no opposition because a god we serve will turn the devil's plans to not and you can look back on it and say come on it's time to get back to the wall we got to finish this thing up and wrap it up for a rapture so we can get out of here see the burning bush had what moses lacked and it has what you lack tonight as well let me tell a few testimonies can i go with a few testimonies as we bring this to a close i could go on and on and on but it's not sunday and we're tired but it's good to be in his presence you know mary magdalene she was put out on the street living as a prostitute her life was ruined and in ruins but one day she met jesus she had demons of lust depression anxiety fear suicide and all together seven demons she had a past but her past didn't have her so she had a past and each of us here this evening we have a past some not so good but i want you to know church your past doesn't have you because why because you met the angels amen had a young sister come in this prayer line brother danny and i brother danny and i stood right there and began to pray with her it was i think it was saturday night like all of it just kind of runs together i've been in a lot of prayer lines here lately but we began to pray just as she came up she confessed what was going on and me and brother danny began to pray and we'll begin to pray that things just pulled back like that and fell to the ground and i knew instantaneously what it was this is not my first rodeo i've seen this before because any time you begin to pray with somebody and that demonic spirit is there the first thing it does is pulls away and runs from it because he said he knows he's about to be cast out she pulled back and hit the ground and i began to come down when i began to come down to go pray for she rose up and that spirit spoke out of her leave me alone let me just go ahead and tell you i didn't read some casting out devil book for dummies no sir i knew my position i've had an experience with god not only that but we had an experience at camp we had dealt with devils before but i had met god and god had anointed me to cast that thing out and i began to curse that devil and that thing left her let me tell you that's when you gotta know let me you don't come into a prayer line and just think you're gonna play church or play preacher because that thing will jump off on them and jump on you you got to know where you stand you got to know that you had met god you got to know that you had met god there was another young sister come in a prayer line she was actually in a prayer line in oklahoma brother timothy preacher masterful service if y'all hadn't heard those services please by all means go back and listen to him wonderful and not only watch the service watch the anointing watch the movement of the spirit watch how everything just orchestrated this young girl came up and we began to pray it was one of the evenings brother timothy had preached and i stood over from the side looking and him and brother wendell was praying for some people and the grandmother this girl brought her up and i come over a little bit closer and i knelt down and i'm not knocked down i look down and i'm just watching kind of surveying just kind of understanding what's going on here what's the issue and something spoke to me said that's suicide well brother timothy came up before he came out his first words when he stepped out from behind the platform or behind the altar the pulpit that morning that evening he said now the lord just dealt very heavily we heavily with me in the back about a spirit of suicide did he not such a jessica he said lord just put it heavily on my heart to deal with suicide somebody's here that's got a suicidal spirit and i didn't think anything about it let me tell you i'm the farthest one that's being super spiritual but something said that's suicide and she's just shaking and going on and and i knew right there something ain't right this girl is not delivered and they just kind of moved her along well the service went on and on and on and on and and actually she come back up at another time he brought her back up and brother timothy and i were standing right to beside each other in a prayer line and i leaned over in his ear i said this is suicide right here this is the one you're looking for and brother timothy said you can ask him in his own words he said that's the one he waited for that night and when he got done praying for that one he left off the platform he was weakened and left off the platform and he come to me and says brother joe you were spot on that was the one i was looking for but that same girl the same girl came in our service mother and aaron not dealt with her right here suicidal spirit because of her past because of things that happened to her not her fault a lot of times it's things that are not our fault but the devil makes you think it's your fault you did this you created this mess no he created this mess but through his mess you're gonna rise up victorious we begin to pray for this girl she came up and she she confided in us told us i'm dealing with this thought i'm dealing with these these things this is what happened to me as a kid and or you know what happened to me and i don't know i just got ugly with it i'm thinking you know what you didn't torment this girl long enough and the spirit of god just began to flow out and we began to pray and brother aaron and i began to pray and she just began to pull back and just jump and shout and just beat her head against the pew right there you know that's how the devil does and if you're not wise to that first thing you do you may just let them say oh well we got the victory they shouted and jumped and jerked and all that and they screamed and you know they kind of get a little steel and you think that's it well it wasn't it both brother and i had our hands on her and we began to speak peace to her and all of a sudden just the spirit of god just come over and you could just fence sense every muscle in her body just relaxed and she subsided and she looked up at us from there she said i'm finally free i'm finally free i'm finally free i'm finally free oh she rose up she had a reason to dance she had a reason to shout because she's finally free finally march 17 2021 i got a touch april 4th 2021 i got it all brother william butts he can point back he can point back to when he got a touch and he can point back when he got it all he can remind the devil i don't belong to you i got my touch and then i got it all i got the holy ghost i got delivered from depression i got delivered from fear i got it all this day april the 4th 2021 was my day my moment i found my deliverance i would rather die than give up what i got i am a finisher brother luke i am a finisher i hope i'm talking to more finishers tonight i would rather die than give up what i got i would rather die to give up the experience than i had this past weekend because i am a finisher a few more i don't think musicians are going to make their way up here you can just play something softly as i read through a few of these can i go just a few more minutes to read a couple of these these are testimonies of our young people what are you saying brother they can look back to a certain moment you had your moment now they got theirs here's another one i went to service expecting to move in my life i'd ask god or ask the lord to give me a dance but not just a dance but i wanted a victory dance you know i think you need to be precise with god anybody can dance but there's a whole different element when it's victory in it by the way you're coming home with me tonight because we're gonna have a victory party yeah fear is a liar did you hear what i said fear has kept joshua butts bound over years after years after years after years keeping him from going to somebody's house his friend's house to enjoy a good fellowship because he's afraid to stay hope you don't mind this is just spontaneous hey he was scared to go to somebody's house to be away from his home away from his mom away from his his dad and his siblings and just away but he could go out into the woods by himself isn't that a tormenting spirit i'm more afraid of the woods than i am somebody else's house i'm walking in there got every light on my head on i mean i'm scared to death i don't finally subside until i'm 20 foot up the tree and then i hope there ain't nothing up there waiting on me but he come in the prayer line the other sunday morning april the 4th came in the prayer line said brother joe brother aaron i can go into the woods by myself but i can't go to somebody else's house and brother aaron does such a masterful job dealing with that demon of fear joshua butts looked at me he said brother joe i'm coming to your house next opportunity i've come to stay announced your house i'm like well you're my son's friend but come on i said yeah fear you're alive fear your reign is over it doesn't earth we're gonna point back to angel the fourth when the spirit of fear has lost this grip for the spirit of fear can't hold you no more the spirit of fear is no longer the ruler of joshua butch but almighty god is your ruler and he's given you a spirit not a fear but a sound mind and the holy ghost where we fear not we stand boldly in the face of our enemy [Applause] let me get back to brother andrew i told brother joe i wanted the holy ghost and to be free and he told me that the devil had been telling me that i had to do this and i had to do that to get the holy ghost which was very true and he prayed for me and when i go here and grab me uncle here and grab me you know it makes a difference when you're loved and young people i want you to know right here that man that man and this man we love you and i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna fight until i ain't got a tooth in my head i'm gonna fight for you but nobody has hope we're gonna fight for you nobody believes you're gonna make it we're going to be there to help you make it brother uncle aaron grabbed me and pulled me to the side and was saying stuff that i don't remember all of it but but when he let me go i started stumbling around something took control of me and had my eyes closed the whole time but i remember like i was a puppet and i started jumping and my arms were going everywhere and i felt myself hit the handrail and i grabbed a hold and let myself dead on to the steps where i'd stay for probably 20 minutes just thanking the lord i was just amazed how the lord orchestrated it all and gave me my victory damn i'm still hungry for more so take this whole world forgive me jesus take this whole world say you can have laodicea you can have your women you can have your drugs you can have your alcohol you can have it all but give me jesus give me a reality give me an experience give me a holy goat give me a service like we had last week give me an outpouring of the holy ghost you can take it all but give me jesus but if you're gonna give me jesus make sure he's got signs and wonders when he's coming maddie join her i was watching all the young girls just dancing that's such a wonderful i'm not going to be able to get all these i'm just going to hit the highlights on a few i was watching all the young girls dancing have such a wonderful time and i wanted to experience that and i almost went up for prayer about it but the devil told me that you don't need to do that what are the people going to think about you and i just stood there and the devil said you don't even have the holy ghost how many has he ever told you that mom dad every day you ain't got it you're just playing you hypocrite going through the motions i say devil i tell you what you may be true it may look like i'm just going through the most but i can tell you one thing my heart's been turned deal with that one you bad cause you can't turn it back you upset because you done lost the victory i'm here to tell you i've been turned my desire to take i got the holy ghost you got the holy ghost why because anybody jumping in ain't about shout it's about having your desires changed when you know that you know the things that you used to quit the things that you used to desire you don't desire them no more now you desire the living word of god now you desire services like we're having tonight now you know the outpouring of the holy ghost then i stood there and the devil said you don't even have the holy ghost so i went up for prayer and i told you speaking to me she told brother joe that i don't know what i had just didn't feel like i you told me that that it's mine i just had to take it that he died so that i could live victorious so i did myself a little dance knowing that i am free and i had the holy ghost see that's the devil's life to keep you from it young people if you can ever realize that your desires are changed and when your desires are changed you may not point to a jump you may not can point to a shout or to laughing or to fallen out in a service but if you can point that devil back to where your desires were permanently changed there ain't no devil hear me no devil in hell can ever come and erase that experience from you let that be your assurance let that be your title let that be your driving force look back to that time that to some emotion cause i'm here to tell you when you get the holy ghost the emotion is going to come let me read this last one and i'll say the name for last okay so let me start out by saying this that this world has nothing that some people may bet this world is nothing that some people make it out to be let me start by saying this that this world is nothing that some people make it out to be nothing oh the devil paints you a pretty picture for a season what happens when the season's up what happened when your body is ravished in sin and aching and emphysema and you got cirrhosis of the liver what happens then well he painted you a picture for a season but this world is nothing being in the world was one of the most difficult things for me i was depressed all day every day i was never truly happy i faked a smile every day i was to the point that i wanted to end it all i tell you what it's a low place it's a low place been there done that got the victory i'm testimony to you tonight church been there done that in that moment depressed all day every day but i can point that devil back to a time that i got the victory it all started when i got up the age and i realized that my dad was an alcoholic and how my brother my sister both left the message after we went through a bunch of stuff with my dad and i felt like i had no one to talk to whenever i was going through a bunch of family stuff but at family camp one year i went up for prayer and i felt like i got a victory within every but whenever i went home the devil went right back to messing with my mind and my head telling me that i wasn't saved he was telling me that you had to excuse me a minute he was telling me that all my worldly friends were going to call me crazy because of the difference that i was trying to make and so i went right back to doing all the things that i had been doing so peer pressure is tough mom and dad you may not remember it but it's real for your young people it's a spirit and it's a spirit of oppression it goes on to say i've done a lot of things that i'm ashamed of and even now the devil keeps throwing that in my face let me just stop right here and say this you may have a past but your past don't have you i feel like dancing right now i've done a lot of things that i'm ashamed of and even now the devil keeps throwing that in my face and it keeps telling me how are you going to explain the difference in yourself to your school people and your friends but i'm ignoring that lie casting down imagination and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god so on saturday night when everything was going on and they started singing and i was crying because i wanted the holy ghost so bad so i whispered to them to my friend that i want the holy ghost but i felt like i couldn't get it because of what the devil's been telling me so finally i got out of my seat i went out front to get excuse me let me read this again i went out i finally got out of my seat i went front to get prayed for and i told brother joe that i wanted the holy ghost but the devil keeps telling me that i can't get it but once i got up there i felt the spirit of the lord like i've never felt it before and he started praying for me and i just started dancing and then i fell to the ground and uncle aaron i'll tell you what a team what a team god has assembled at this church it's not a one-man ministry but a team of devil defeaters that god has put together for your benefit for your benefit for your benefit for your kids for you for your household situation god has put a team together to defeat your enemy we're here to build the wall we're here to finish the job and the people had a mind to work we need your mind to be right in sync with us we're going to work we're going to cast out every devil of unbelief we're going to defeat every enemy we're going to bring down the strongholds of the enemy you bring hey let me tell you invite your devil to church sunday we will be here and we will be waiting because we have been commissioned we have been anointed for the task uncle larry took a lap on the stage and when when he came back i was on the ground he started quoting scripture to me telling me that i was a daughter of god and then i got up and i took off running and i never felt more free since then i've never felt more free since then let me tell you you may have a pass tonight but that pass has no claim on me why because i'm a son i'm a daughter my teens are gone i've been set free devil you can't hold me you can't keep me you can't bend me you can't break me i'm a child of god i've been anointed for this hour i've been selected i've been hand-picked i've been chosen for the mission i'm ready to fill the wall

oh go could i go oh where could i hope [Music] the refuge for my soul give me that second verse i want to look at it just a moment you know friends are good and it's good to surround yourself with good friends neighbors are kind they're our neighbors our friends we love them everyone we can get along and sweet accord but when my soul meets manna from above where could i go but to the lord you see you can get comfort for your human spirit from friends and these friends can console you and help you and encourage you and you know help you to get in a little better atmosphere and lift you up out of the shadows of your your doldrums but when your soul needs manna from above where can you go but to the lord now i'm going to tell you you know we've had some wonderful moments and these are very very important you must have that moment if i start talking to the lord you're going to have to feed on the word of god get it within your soul because the devil is going to come store it up like ammunition brother timothy's been preaching on casting down strongholds and every high thing that exalts itself against the word of god every one of us have nine battles every one it's the devil's it's the it's the ground it's that neutral place where the war the greatest battle ever fought is is is fought it's it's there in the mind you you're not going to be free from that you're going to have the enemy attack you day after day after day that's why you need the ammunition of the word of god thy word have a kid in my heart that i might not sin or disbelieve against god amen so you've got to you've got to have it there and you've got to been feeding on it and when the devil comes and he's going to come and remember no he's a liar he don't tell the truth and why do you want to believe him over what god's word said god said i'm a christian god said i've got the holy ghost god said i gained the promise god sent the promises for me god gave the promise i'm not gonna back up on that promise i'm gonna believe it's from me it's from my house i'm gonna take every divine promise i'm going to expand my borders i'm going to have greater experience i'm going to walk with god enough with the rapture you say but brother tim the devil reminds me of my past enoch had a past the bible said that he lived 365 years the bible said he walked with god 300 years that means he had 65 years he didn't walk with god every person the saint list of all christians had a past they had a time that you didn't walk with god but you see one day he started turn around and start taking a step and he took another step and he took another step and he took the other step he went from adventure to adventure to adventure from glory unto glory unto glory you don't stop in your experience you keep on going what i got yesterday is wonderful but praise god i can have some more tonight what i got last year was free but we're not gonna get more tonight that's what you do you build on your experience [Applause] so go out of here and add to your experience that you have had with jesus go fall in love with him don't worry about nothing else and sure don't worry about what the devil said but what he said in my path listen as far as the east is from the west i have removed your sins from you [Music] hallelujah though your sins be like started they shall be as right as note though they were read thy criminals they shall be as well this is what god's word said god can't go back on his word you say well last week i was doing this that was last week you don't have that anymore your sleep is clean [Applause] your past is forgiven oh man your future is clear amen your future is clean there's nothing in your future but a greater one with god one with god friends are kind and i love them everyone and it's great to have good christian friends and they love us and they encourage us songs lift up our spirits but when my soul needs manna from above where could i go but to the lord neighbors are kind i love them everyone and we get a long and sweet [Music] tell me where could i go where could i go oh where could i go seeking a refuge for my soul and needing a friend oh where could i go where could i go [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
