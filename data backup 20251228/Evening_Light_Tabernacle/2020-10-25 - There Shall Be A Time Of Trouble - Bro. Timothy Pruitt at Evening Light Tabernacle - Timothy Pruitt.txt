we're just a needy people lord and we have need of you we're so thankful lord though we have great needs we have a great god for our needs we just asked lord that you would minister to those lord that are away and resting and having a time away father just bless them we pray be with us today in this service in jesus name amen amen let's turn to daniel 12 and verse 1. amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen i know you was maybe expecting brother senior this morning but amen we we actually was able to get him and mom away for their 45th anniversary this weekend and he had made made the statement to my sister lydia that he would like to take her off you know for because you know let me just say this since last a couple wednesday nights ago you know she came up for prayer and she's just really been battling a lot of things one hit after another but since that that evening amen her strength has returned her heart has returned to fight the battle and so amen you know and seeing that we just felt like they needed to get away for this weekend and so they're returning today but we just asked the lord to give them traveling mercies as well amen so we're here today amen to fight the battle and uh i want to speak to you this this morning on there shall be a time of trouble amen let's read it here and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time amen if you would view it in there and and with that last part of that verse in your mind it would look very dark but don't forget at the beginning he said at that time michael shall stand up say amen and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever amen we let you be seated this morning speaking there speaking upon there shall be a time of trouble and it's very easy to get our eyes on the trouble it's very easy you know many times it's all that this natural eyes will pick up is the worst case scenario or as we've been speaking on casting down imaginations your mind always goes seemingly every time to the worst amen the worst case the worst problems the worst whatever but you know i i think i i i we're gonna deal with that a little bit but i also want to bring us to another part of in that time of the worst time ever michael will stand up in that time of the worst time of trouble peop thy people will be delivered amen and i and i want and i think our focus should be upon our deliverance because that's why we're here amen we're not here to go down into defeat we're not here to go down into death we're not here to go down amen into into everlasting shame and contempt but we're here for our deliverance you know and i thought it was interesting because i've always thought it interesting that brother branham would take for the rapture out of the for a rapture text he would take it out of psalms 27 verse 1 it says the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and failed so in this time we can see fear is here we can see uh trouble is here we can see the wickedness here we can see the enemies are here but but in verse three though of hope shall encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall war eyes against me and this will i be confident even though i've got fear even though there's things to be afraid of even though there's wickedness all around us even though there's enemies and foes that are trying to destroy us of this i will be confident one thing i've desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord to inquire in his temple for in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock amen what a comfort in the hour that we're living in because you know i don't believe that the time that we're living in is going to get any better i don't believe that we're ever going to go back to a time when we would consider normal anymore normality is all gone things are progressing very rapidly towards an end time amen towards the end of all time towards the end of but you know in that is a very wonderful thing because in the end time it's also as we know the end of strife it's the end of trouble it's the end of sickness it's the end of amen demonic oppressions but amen it's it is an end time but it's not our end time amen and you know and i don't want to put that upon like a fear or dread because for a child of god there is no end time it's only our really truly our beginning it's our beginning into the eternals amen in our beginning into everlasting life and this is what he would say in psalms 37 39 he would say the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them why because they trust in him but we see gross darknesses upon the earth and we see that it's getting darker and darker and darker as we go on and spiritually speaking even in the spiritual realms it's even getting darker you know in political realms it's getting darker in every kind of realm around us amen physically spiritually politically it's all getting darker and darker and darker as we go further into this world that we're living in and when we wouldn't think that things would happen in a modern civilization amen it's getting worse and worse and worse amen why is it because gross darkness is upon the people amen brother brandon would speak that in shalom he would talk about the darkness the oncoming darkness that is coming upon this world and it's only getting darker amen it's only getting worse it's only getting amen more crime more ungodliness more homosexuality more perversion is only getting worse amen this this world is no hope we have no hope in this world we only have hope in another world to come and brother branham paints a pretty dark picture but he says now but upon those who have turned to light amen there's more is going to get brighter and brighter hallelujah said but those who will not turn to light there's only one thing that i can say for the coming year you're going to go into more darkness and the more darkness as the years goes on but to those who turn to the light you'll get brighter and brighter until that perfect day that we're looking for is appearing when all darkness will fade away what a day that'll be amen as the prophet said gross darkness upon the people and upon the people of the world gross darkness but he said have you noticed in these last years now this is in 64. and we can say it's it's a hundred times even worse than what it was even then he said some of you men and women around my age he said but look how each year it seems to get darker each year it seems to get darker now i know in 2020 it seemed to be a great leap in the darkness or the terrible or the time of trouble as it was the year before but i'm not sure that the next year won't be another leap amen because it's rapidly it's a junction that's taken place it's a darkness that has come upon the earth for to set an atmosphere for something to take place amen and so he said i've noticed you know that amongst the women he said you look out on the streets amongst the women you watch their desires the men you watch their desires what they like to do they're changing attitudes all the time men are becoming more like women women are becoming more like men seem like there's no way to stop it he says across the nation preaching the things that i'm preaching coming back the next year and it's only worse it's only worse he said them people want to do right but there's something about it that won't let them do right it's pressing down upon them it's a force coming down he said it's like a heavy dark fog upon the whole earth you know i was overseas one time and i was i was being talked to by a person that was apparently very proud about their country and they were down in the americans and how bad the u.s was and the prophet of god said this and the prophet of god said that i said yes i know amen america is going to burn but i said have you read the bible the whole world's going to burn this whole world is evil there's not a government here upon this earth that has a man a christian amen fortitude about them there's nothing christian about this world amen this world is going into it's plunging in the further and further into darkness he said it's and he makes a statement and this message says it's not only in phoenix which is where he's where he's preaching he said but it's all over the world there seems to be just groping darkness that's gathering getting more dense and more dense all the time it's trying to smother out real manhood it's trying to smother out real womanhood it's trying to smother out christianity it's trying to smother out everything that has anything to do with god amen he would speak about it in the world falling apart he said our world is in such a sadness right now it's polluted on every side there's no other way in the world it'll ever come back to itself again it can't do it he said we better take heed what we're doing in this day that we're living in because the world is again falling apart amen he said not only in america here but it's all over the world wherever you go the religious world has fallen apart the political world is falling apart the world of moral morals he said that 80 is just not even no more he said there's not even morals morals maybe just amongst a few good people but he said it's very hard to find this is in 63 where are we at now do you realize today amen this year brother branham is going to be gone as long as he was on earth yeah that's what i did i went wow surely we're in overtime surely we're right we're right at the time amen of the coming of the lord amen morals have decayed politics are decaying and listen november november the third no matter which way it goes it's not going to fix anything it's only going to get worse it's only going to it's it's going into complete delusion and darkness and hell is here upon the earth amen he said see politics everything corrupt the whole thing is sick it's putrified source from the head to the feet the whole world our political system our religious system our moral system everything we got is gone and there's no way to get it back together she's finished we're at the end of the road amen he said i know we talk about a long time but one of these days is going to be past talking about it's going to be a historical thing he said we better find that way and we will find ourselves outside if we don't watch it at this time he said the hour that we're living he said oh god the world is falling apart there are hangs in the hangar bombs there hangs in the hangar exactly things to bring about an end he said but the church is ready amen she's sealed in she's ready for the coming and he said there's going to be a big outpouring of the spirit that'll grab that church and take her to the skies so it's not all bad news hallelujah it might be bad news in the paper it might be bad news on every website but it's not all bad news there is a people on this earth that is prepared for it going away there is a people on this earth that is looking not at the darkness but looking to the light there is a people upon this earth that's not looking to the destruction but looking for her body change for the rapture that is about to take place hallelujah he said see what is happening christ and his ministry is in the bride which is a supernatural body of hears upon this earth listen christ is still upon the earth he is in bright form but he's still doing the works that he did back 2000 years ago or even 55 years ago he's still provided he's still moving he's still healing i don't care how dark it is he's still healing i don't care how dark it is he's still raising the dead i don't care how dark it is he's still saving this the lost among us i don't care how dark it is he's still here hallelujah the age this age meets exactly to the signs of one of the things god promised to do in the last days this church or the bride itself will be ready and we'll go in a rapture with jesus he says why because we have received a kingdom they cannot be shaken the world's shaken politics is shaken listen i don't i i don't know what's about to take place in our in our own american politics i'm getting texts from all over the world who's going to win who's going to do that i believe that i don't know who's going to win it don't really matter as we as we know it's all going into darkness amen i don't know how god's going to orchestrate things everything is being orchestrated by god for an end time don't ever forget he's still in control he's worked all these kingdoms of this earth amen are moving according to his own will amen to bring about an end time amen look what's happening over in israel now and all the peace packs that are taking place what does the scripture say they'll say peace peace and then sudden destruct we're talking about a place has never had peace amen he said we but we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken all the world is shaken every nation is shaking they're shaking about coronavirus we just had the worst day ever in cases hospitals are being filled up people are shaken to their roots people are shaking and what what to do how do i do this what i do here oh and people are being shake christians are being shaken people with morals are being shaken there's nobody exempt amen but we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken hallelujah heavens and earth will pass away but this kingdom will never pass away he said i'm so glad tonight to be a part of that kingdom just think he said listen this now this is in 63 the world falling apart he preached right here in shreveport louisiana he said just think what could you promise yourself today can you promise yourself anything can you really promise that tomorrow your 401k will be as good as it was today can you promise that tomorrow you'll have anything amen he said what could you promise yourself today in another 10 or 15 years if the world will stand what it what if it does stand every man in shreveport every woman you'll have to pack a gun on the streets or in your pocket with you to protect yourself how are you going to stop it he said i was in new york i don't even want to go to new york i was in new york listen we got people that's moving on our street because they're scared of what's taking place over in in in washington and places people are scared to death literally scared to death went down there for miles nothing but teenage hoodlums earrings in the ear ratted hair leotards on girls with these little bikinis they call it out on the street and the public has given them the right of way what's the matter with this country it's a sign of moral decay a god rejected nation did you catch that not a nation that rejected god and they did but a god rejected nation a god rejected nation he said how can you build up upon the charge of some ruins like that you're not going to do it when hoodlums are walking the streets and will shoot the president right out of his car another night a roadhouse man up for rackets and everything walked in jumped before the police force over a hundred and something standing there walked right in everybody looking at him pulled out his gun shot a man in cold blood murder walked out he plead insane and gets go gets to go free he said right in our country a man right in the garage other day right into a little car dealership pulls a gun shoots a man four or five times plead's insane they let him go free it's insanity this world is insane you see it everywhere the whole thing is a bunch of corruption republicans is a bunch of corruption democrats are a bunch of cri this whole world's a bunch of corruption amen the whole world is guilty the whole world stands guilty the church stands guilty before god no wonder we're falling apart he said this is the greatest of second-handed rope he said it's the greatest time that anyone or any age ever lived in is this time it is a great shaking time it's a troublesome time you ready for the next part it's a troublesome time for sinners but it's a marvelous time for christians hallelujah because we know we are packing up and gathering the little last efforts together to go home to meet our lord hallelujah even people today look around and see great trouble and distress and problems he said but i'm looking for the meeting in the air he goes on and listen this is where we're at he said a few nights ago i was talking to someone these agents that watches and looks at things brother branham he said we're just instructed by the government never to advise people anymore to lay down or by the wind away from the wind of the floor if a bomb hits it never goes in or go never go in the basement because the new bomb you know was radio guided and he's talking about listen we're way past these things now people want to hide from the government and i just laugh at them you can't there's no place to hide it's impossible to hide people think they got their little little pla you can get on google earth and you go sit right on top of their house you see how many doll pins they got how many chicken pins they got how many cows is out in the pasture you can do it i just was looking at our place notice that google just updated i can count how many cows have got in the pasture people think they can hide there's no place to hide amen you can see it being set up for the tribulation and hunting down the persecuted group of amen the foolish virgins you can see it taking place there's no place to hide there's only one place of safety and that's in the pavilion of christ amen he said they said see you and see there's bombs hanging everywhere there's they can blow away depths i mean thousand or hundreds fit he said 15 square miles we're beyond that can totally annihilate a city and just one bomb being dropped totally annihilate hundreds of square miles gone and just vaporized the dust that's where we're at we're in the time of nuclear warfare that's never been seen before there's no hope in this world amen he said there's nothing to do but get ready to take a flight upstairs that's the only thing to do when them times comes is to get ready to go there's no hole in the ground of the savior there's no amount of food that can keep you there's no amount of nothing that can take care of you there's no government government that can protect you there's only one place we can go and that's running to the tower that's running to the tower the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous how many righteous we got here this morning the righteous run into it and are safe i'm so glad we have a shelter the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it are safe and no matter how many bombs no matter how much sickness we are safe did you hear me no matter if there's no hope no rooms in the hospital we're safe no matter if there's a pandemic after pandemic after pandemic we're safe no matter if there's no money we're safe no matter if there's no government we're safe hallelujah i'm glad we have a shelter he said i believe if i wasn't a christian i would go crazy that's that is the truth i mean if i didn't have what i have i don't know how i'd make it day by day if all i had was fox news or cnn or god forbid if that's all i had i would be insane no wonder people are insane he said thinking of what might happen at any time i'd go crazy if i wasn't a christian with a house full of little kitties i wouldn't know what to do if i wasn't a christian i'm so glad that i can stand in my house and introduce them oh my introduce them to a shelter that no bomb could ever touch that's shouting grounds right there not even the most amazing whatever kind of bomb nuclear bomb mega warhead can never touch amen he said nothing else can ever touch under the protection of the wings of the lord jesus not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord that is our protection he said what a great glorious time it is to know that in all the sins and all the struggles and all the trials of life will soon be over it'll be all finished one of these days and we'll be home with the lord what time is left to the preaching the gospel and to bring that great tower to as much and as many as we can but we can read in first second timothy three and verse one this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come so if we can read the bible why are we surprised people get shocked even message people are shocked and you know they're screaming i pray for our country pray for brother branham back in the 60s said he wouldn't even pray for it said she's rotten she's rejected if you're praying for this country you're praying for a people that have rejected the lord totally outcast crucified him again had an opportunity started out as a christian country amen but listen what this perilous means it means hard to take it means hard to bear dangerous troublesome harsh fierce savage we're seeing a world turn into a bunch of savages there's nothing to hold them they can't even write they can't even have a good conversation just to talk about things and work things out know it's immediately to the streets burn every building down destroy everything around them makes no sense at all to me but destroy their own neighborhoods it's the truth and it's only going to get worse lawlessness he said because the men would for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetedness boasters proud blasphemers disobedience to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection have you seen any of this coming to pass truth breakers false accusers incontinent fears despise of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power there from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with dr diver's lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now janice and james underst withstood moses so do these who also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith hard to bear troublesome harsh fierce savages god's word is a true witness we can read the word this morning say it's true never has a time been like the time that we're living in god's word said in the last days there'll be perilous times men's hearts would fail them for fear perplexities of times distress between nations there will come a falling away men would rise up showing themselves to be big dignitaries and so forth with power from the church have a form of godliness but deny the real power of god a bunch of church joining a bunch of creeds a bunch of dogma he spoke of a church getting that condition and we are witnesses that the word of god is fulfilled amen he said see what it is he said i challenge any man to show me any organization on fire for god filled with the holy ghost signs following him rise and tell me one anyone but they're powerless and dead to where now we've got the pope saying that homosexuals are okay we shouldn't be surprised because she's the cage of every unclean and hateful bird uh you know i was kind of wondering where he'd been all this time you know this great leader hadn't hardly said a word through this whole coronavirus you hadn't heard nothing out of it first thing he comes out and says he says that this world of com of a of free trade free trade does not work we need something different then he comes out and says homosexuals they're going to be okay looks terrible around us brother timothy but he also prophesied there'd be a real church in that day a little flock he said there would be and there will be there will be a people who know their god the whole world's turning away from me but there will be a people who know their god and will do exploits there will be a people with the power of god in her there will be a people with enough power in them that the loss can come and be saved not live in their sins but be saved hello save from their sins if i was drowning i'd want to be saved saved from drownings not still living in the water come on somebody saved from drowning is being taken out of the condition that you're here and being put in a new place this is what it means to be saved from sins not living your sins but to be removed from them and your sins removed from you as far as the east from the west there is a church that believes in that kind of power there is a church who believes that god still feels of the holy ghost that a man can walk through satan's eating and not be defiled from it but live above it i know we got fatalism in the message that says well we believe in predestination and what will be will be therefore go ahead and do all the drugs you want and all the drinking you want that is a bunch of baloney that's nothing but the lie of the devil speaking out of a lip of a man there is a power in the church that'll take drugs out of a man i got an amen here there is a power in the church that'll take cigarettes and drop them at your feet never to hold you anymore now i got a witness here today there is a power that'll break lust off alive there's a power that'll break every kind of spirit off of people amen and unchain them unhinge them take it all away there is a power and there is a people upon the earth that still believe it he said it would be therefore it will be hallelujah it will be turned back to the original that'll be turned back to the bible that'll get away from the organization and the nominations and go back to the first go back to the original pentecost i know there's some in the message don't like to hear that go back to the original pentecost to the original feeling of the holy ghost to the original power of god the word testifies that it'll happen the word prophesies it to be so therefore it will be there will be a people he said in the last days he talks about let's look at it malachi 4. five and six behold i send unto you and who's you amen i know there's some that don't want to say they want to say well this is just for the jews i'm i'm you you don't want to be you i'll be you behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and what dreadful it was a dreadful day when it came the first time politics was messed up people were all in up in arms it was all kind of chaos in the land and all of a sudden a star hangs over a place and people are going about their business and they're so caught up in the darkness and the romans this and the romans and rome and there's this is happening over here that's happening you hear what's on fox news today and let's don't see it all of a sudden there's a star up here there happened to be three men or however many men we think maybe three who knows how many i hope there's more than three but some wise men that saw it said there's something happening over there we got to go see what's going on i hope there's a star hanging over even light that people are saying something's going on there hallelujah i'll be that you before the coming of the great and dreadful day and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the father so it's in the bible so that there was a turning back in our generation look back to where we started the seed that went in the ground is the seed that's coming out of the ground and therefore if it's a life that went in the ground the same life follows all the way through the roots the tassels all the all the shuck all the way all the way back to seed again and that's where we're at back to seed again therefore the same power went to the ground the same power comes up the same life goes in the ground the same life comes up hello somebody it didn't go down a week and come up a cuckoo bird no it goes down a week and comes up a week hallelujah so the same power that was in the original church is now in the group of people in the last days and they'll know their god and do exploits they'll be a witness they'll recognize when the angel of god is moving through amen couple wednesday nights we had that kind of moment supernatural move of god and i'm here to testify from that moment my mom has never been the same we're going to rejoice about that because that's a miracle little drew got up here and sing this song with his daddy jesus is a waymaker amen let me read you a testimony three years now drew has had thyroid issues been on medicines to control his thyroid levels in those three years we've seen two specialists who were baffled how to handle his case drew has had a routine lab work to make sure his medicine is balancing his levels one and a half months ago i was getting so weary of the appointments and blood work i told dad brother tim well we need a miracle for drew drew look dad looked at me and said the waters are going to be stirred and when they are you'll know it and you take drew and you step in it he's going to have his healing last wednesday as my brother preached halfway through his sermon the spirit of the lord broke out and he said the waters are being stirred you better get in it i felt like i was pushed out of my seat i grabbed drew by the hand down the aisle we went i had no clue at the time we was only mid-service i just knew i was not going to miss the waters being troubled and stirred today we took doc drew to a new doctor as the one who had been going to it we'd been going to retire after going over three years of charts and recent blood works he said drew looks so good i believe his body will be able to regulate his own levels let's have the medicine for now and let's make a goal to get him completely off this medicine hallelujah it doesn't stop there drew has small bones and weak muscles just to know that those just know that those will be growing as normal too and the whole body is going to obey the word of lord and receive a total healing jesus is a waymaker if he can take the children of israel down through a red sea and down through a desert with no water and no food he can take you through coronavirus he can take to you through whatever sickness he can take you out of sin he can do all kind of things he is a waymaker how many hairs witness him to bid i know he's a waymaker i've witnessed him as a waymaker jesus would say in matthew 13 a sower went forth and sowed seeds and explained that he sowed them upon the earth and the enemy came and sowed tears behind them that enemy was the devil and the husbandmen the preacher said let's pull them out and take them out he said no no let them grow together now watch if a seed starts up by the side of of a weed they grow together and he said when the first shoots come forth they come forth both ways both of them grow and seize together and he says see they're getting both getting bigger and bigger and bigger he says we're always complaining i'm about to change this now we're always complaining about the world and how wicked the world is getting he said but don't you forget to realize how much more powerful the church is getting it ain't just weeds growing it ain't just devils getting greater seemingly more all the time the weed is growing hallelujah he said we're always saying how bad the world is how the booklet joints and the whiskey and the legalized drinking and the gambling and the prostitution and everything that's going on we're always talking about that but don't fail to look where the church is to she's moving on up signs and wonderings appearing everywhere she's putting out seeds too we're nearly there don't worry the harvest is soon he said what church you talking about brother brown the born-again church was that methodist he said that's all of us that's born again hallelujah methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostal catholics how many methodists we have that came out of there just raise your hand methodists yeah we got no we got no we had one brother hell brother mike where you up there i knew there was another one baptist presbyterian which by the way i think donald trump said he's not no presbyterian no more right yesterday he changed he's now a non-denomination yeah pentecostals catholics whatever you are or whatever you were if you're born again you're sons and daughters of god and he said if you are born again we believe in the phenomena amen we believe in divine healing we believe in the power of god and we see him working with signs and wonders he said but if we're not careful we always talk about how bad the world is how wicked the world is but look how great the church is getting all the time hello somebody we fail to look at that side jesus said let them grow together so if the world is getting more wicked and more wicked and more wicked the church is getting more powerful and more powerful and more powerful hallelujah therefore if we see the world where it is we ought to see the church where she is and where she is there's a phenomenal and where she is the miracles are taking place and where she is the dead are being raised and where she is the healing is taking place in the body and where she is the sinners are finding their way to christ where she is so let's just don't go out of here where the heads down how bad the world's getting that ain't what this mess is about in the time of trouble he's standing up in the time of trouble his people's going to be delivered we could see that all the way through the scripture we had the time you could you can watch it brother brad what he used he would use it like they said in the darkest hour that's when jesus comes it's got to get dark because he's coming as a thief in the night did you hear me he's coming as a thief in the night he didn't say in the day he said in the night dark gonna come in catch his people away and be gone and the world know nothing about it rioting contingents on the streets earthquakes and divers places all kinds of calamity upon the earth and it all of a sudden it seems to go into turbo three and a half years worse worse worse until it ends but meanwhile where's the bride hallelujah sheltered in the arms of jesus so we we failed sometimes to realize how powerful the church is getting he said don't forget when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise a standard up against it the winds are blowing just set your sails move right into the face of the storm why do you care what the storm is doing who's the captain he's been through a lot of storms and he ain't lost the boat oh my god that ought to make us shout just for a moment to think about the storm if you just go through your mind the storm after storm the darkest hour after darkest hour and he never lost a person he never lost a boat he never lost he never loses he never will he said all that are mine will come what confidence he has in his word to speak that knowing how dark it was going to get knowing how bad it was going to be how terrible the earth was going to be but all that are mine will come but the politics all that are mine will come but the problems all that mind there comes but the sicknesses and the pandemic all that are mine will come hallelujah when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise a standard up against it you know some time ago i preached on that you know i actually found where their their cereal a lot back for long time theologians are arguing over the translations because they said the common was put in the wrong place you know when the enemy comes in like a flood they say the bible says it like a flood comma he'll raise a standard but they said the actual it should have been when the enemy comes in comma like a flood he'll raise the standard did you understand but it really doesn't matter where the comet is the standard's still there and the standard is greater than any flood the devil's got the standard will overcome no matter what the devil as we've been saying through this year the devil ain't got enough amen the church is getting more and more powerful all the time move right into the face of the storm why do you care who's the captain he will take care of it he'll tell you once again don't fear i'm here with you he said i want you to understand as they were talking about the sower again he said let them grow together as the church natural begins to get formal and ungodly the church spiritual is receiving great gifts and powers from above so we see the church world what it's doing what are we to be receiving great gifts and powers from above they're both going into seed as the world gets more wicked the church is getting more powerful he said i don't mean all this called church i mean the church the born-again believers not by membership but by one's spirit we're all baptized into one body he said i believe the hours approaching now where missing limbs will be restored that's some gifts that's some power in the church where missing limbs will be restored the glorious power of the creator in his bride listen if he can make a squirrel appear not just a limb of a squirrel but a whole body up here he could take fish that were that were in a little boy he brought for lunch and he could break them apart and then and and and in that another piece would appear amen fully cooked seasoned ready to eat created you know how hard your problem you have going through you're going through is to him that's all it is let's break it off another one's there listen he ain't run out of healing he ain't run out of joy he ain't run out of the holy ghost he hasn't run out of power break it off and there's another piece there and this this one needs healing well here you go this one needs here there's plenty of healing for everybody there's deliverance for everybody listen there's enough power in the blood of jesus to save every person on this earth today there's enough power in the blood of jesus to heal every person on this earth today there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right before them hello somebody there will be a people in the church or people there's powers coming into the church to anoint a people they'll speak the word and they'll see it created right before them he said we haven't seen powers likes coming into the church he said i know it for a fact say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said shall come to pass and you can have what you said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost is in the church then critics mouths will be shut hallelujah but we need to set our faith on one thing thus saith the lord in this darkest hour we can't set our faith in politics there's nothing here to save us we can't set our our faith in anything on this earth to do with this earth humanly speaking there's not a human on this earth there's not a superhuman on this earth that's got enough superpowers or super money or super anything to save this place she's going down there's only one place to set our faith it's on thus saith the lord and when you're on thus saith the lord no matter what comes no matter what goes no matter whether today's easy tomorrow's hard the next day they're teasing you the next day they're making fun of you the next day they say you're crazy you endure because your faith is not on anything around here that's shaken your faith is not even on your own mind's ability your faith is not on your reasonings and how you got it all figured out how it's go well i believe it's going to do this brother timothy and this one's going to win it's going to turn us over here and we're going to you might have it figured out i don't know i got one thing i know thus saith the lord this is where everyone has to stand abraham had to stand on one thing thus saith the lord no matter how dark it got no matter how troublesome it got no matter how tempting the temptation took a hold of it was thus saith the lord david had to stand on thus saith the lord elijah had to stand on thus saith the lord where did jesus stand on it is written thus saith the lord it is written that's the only place we have to stand god is making it to where people cannot stand upon their own abilities they cannot depend upon their own on on on things they've done the kingdoms they built the money they got in their 401ks the retirement plans they got their retirement this this that whatever they cannot stay you cannot stand on none of that it don't take but just a little flick in the economies and everything's gone i mean just look what this one sickness has done to the world totally people's wealth just vanished some have gotten greater but many of them just vanished what is happening he's making it to where you can only stand on one thing thus saith the lord amen even jesus no matter if he was in the storm and the gales knocking the boat from one side to the other he would stay or he was standing in the face of a bunch of demons if he was if they was hanging everywhere it never moved him he walked right along as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious to fear in anything around him he was standing on thus saith the lord hallelujah walk unconscious to it walk unconscious to fear unconscious to criticism walk unconscious to the world walk as you walk in christ walk with him not paying attention to the right hand or the left hand did you hear that the right or the left amen not paying attention to none of that if something comes in the church walk with god if sickness strikes you walk with god if a neighbor don't like you walk with god just keep walking with god enoch done that one day till one day he walked with god and he didn't come back home again hallelujah walk with god the doctor said you're going to die walk with god doctor says you can't get well walk with god why god said i will never leave you or forsake you i'll be with you and he took that oath that covenant that he gave you and he can confirm it with you and just keep walking with him oh you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you'll go through briar patches it may turn around and seem like oh all of a sudden everything's rosy and nice and cozy but don't change walk with god in the good times you walk with god in the bad times you walk with god whether you're healed or whether you're sick whether you're up whether you're down whether you're discouraged or you're happy as you as a as a bird walk with god with thus saith the lord amen you'll have it you'll go over sharp rocks over bluffs over hillsides up and down mountains over waters but you just keep walking with god there's so many hills to climb you've heard the old song how little it seemed when you get to the end of the road just why just keep looking at god keep walking with god amen god is moving even now amen you mean i can see nothing but don't fear god is still moving god is still in the building god is killing his people just as they were at a at you know brother brown will take it in the junctions and we're at another junction there's so many junctions that you can go through but you can go through the you know one of the major drug junctions was when jesus came upon the earth that was a major junction and then now again as he returns it's another major junction but listen to this right here at every junction omnipotence speaks i know everybody else is speaking every kind of demon is screaming what are they trying to do to keep you from hearing the voice to clog up your channels in your mind to where you don't hear him when he speaks when omnipotence speaks miracles happen omnipotence has spoke at every junction when the church cooled off omnipotence speaks miracles take place this is a junction of all junctions this is the end time the end of the whole history of the world is right now at hand so you can expect omnipotence to speak did you hear that omnipotent spoke the other night listen if i was one of you that walked into the water i would just be expecting the same news drew god because he was in the same waters hallelujah amen he says right at the end of the world history of the world so you can expect omnipotence to speak what can we expect brother timothy what are we expecting out of this election what are we expecting in the next year what are we expecting what what you can expect you want to hear what you can expect the greatest and mighty its miracles that's ever happened on the earth will happen in the next few years to come people are so worried what can we expect i'm expecting miracles i'm expecting such a miracle that's going to take place that a body is going to change all of a sudden gray hairs are going to fall off wrinkles are going to fade away bones has been being pulled back down the earth gravity taking their play and pulling you down the earth all of a sudden that's going to change and you're going to take one step walk with god what if the next step was a body change how many years did any walk years hundreds of years he walked with god but all of a sudden he's walking just like he walked every day every moment he's walking going to his job going and doing things as a normal man would do having a normal day but he's walking with god and this walking with god don't think every day was a good day he had bad days he had rough days he had days he didn't know if he was going to make it out of he didn't know if it was going to be another day but he's just walking with god 100 years ago by walking with god 200 years go by walking with god 300 years ago by walking with god but that last few months is coming last few weeks is coming last few days are coming last few hours are coming last few minutes are coming last few seconds are coming and all of a sudden and he looks back and all of a sudden his old body is no longer there he's changed it's a new man again he put on new clothes his thinking no longer is fear and dread and worry about what the next day's gonna hold it's all gone because he's walking with god and sure it was dark sure there was things taking place it was a dark time don't kid yourself it was a dark time it was right at the time of the flood evil was everywhere i mean even jesus would say as it was in the days of noah it was terrible rough days terrible days but he just walked with god went to his job walking with god went back home walking with god went to visit his children walking with god and all of a sudden that's what it's going to be like you're gonna get up one morning you're gonna comb your little gray hair or or shave that old bald head but you're gonna be walking with god gonna go about that time you're gonna step out of your house and oh got my lunch run back and get your lunch go back go back and grab your truck door and all of a sudden [Music] who's that oh that's that's grandma how you doing grandma you don't look old no more pimple mama you don't look like what i remember you looking like i began to tell you do you realize what day it is we've come to tell you the king is coming [Applause] on that day where's that darkness at then where's that sickness at there where's those demons at there on that day where are they at what happened you was walking with god in a time of trouble like it's never been seen before there's a people walking with god in a time of trouble that's never been seen before there's a people saying yes any day now i'm seeing the signpost i'm seeing the signs of what it ain't just the signs of a of a nation just falling off the end of the earth it ain't the signs of a nation that's not what my eyes are upon these are only pointing to something people only can see them but do you realize signs are put there for a reason to show you something when you're driving down the road and all of a sudden you see a sign that says stop ahead what is it doing it's telling you just right maybe over this hill there's a stop sign you better be prepared to stop or if there's a sign that says you know has a curve with a little arrow pointing this way it's telling you something's ahead something's taking place amen and you're not to keep your eye on the sign you keep y'all on the sign you're going to fall off the road you got to realize what the sign is pointing to and this whole world don't get your eyes upon the signs they're only pointing to something they're pointing to destruction but not your destruction they're pointing to a body change they're letting you know the atmosphere's set the darkness is coming things are taking place he's about to appear as a thief in the night get ready it's right before us quit looking at the signs and look at what's ahead what's ahead is the greatest joy we've ever known hallelujah could you imagine that morning when you take that one last second step maybe it was in your kitchen maybe you made it to your job maybe you made it to your school maybe you made it to shreveport maybe i don't know where you might be that morning but all of a sudden you just take that one step all of a sudden things around you has changed and you're seeing things like you've never seen them before you're understanding things like you've never understood it before and you're seeing the dead in crisis rise rose all around i feel like that's going to be a good day i feel like there's going to be some shouting and rejoicing and thanking god for his mercy and his grace and his loving kindness we are at that junction he said it's the great junction it's one of the main junctions that's ever happened the greatest of junctions we're coming to the time talking about he was even talking about even the junction let me back back up a little bit he's talking about the junction when jesus came the time when the sin question be settled the time and the miraculous must make himself fully understand there's coming a time when men's hearts had to be changed because the laws and the judges and so forth couldn't do it the blood and goats couldn't do it just before that great judgment came the devil came amongst the preachers and began to say days of miracles are passed there's no such a thing same thing we've heard in this junction it's the same time that ain't at the same time angels are sent to the earth and here's this man down there making intercessions for for the people of god and a great angel shows up proving the junction of time was at hand he told him he would bring forth a boy from his wife which is old and stricken in age the bible said jesus said himself there's never a man born on the earth like under john of that time he was a prophet the greatest there was that time because it was the greatest junction that god had ever made with the devil when their paths would cross and in that path he would strip him and rob him of everything he had amen in every junction god wins satan loses hallelujah john was a prophet gabriel was an angel they were appearing at a junction time glory to god about 33 years before it happened god started plenty time to forerun them a junction time was at hand tried to get it away tried to get it away finally it killed every everyone that said anything but satan did and fussed it and began to bring up fusses and drive tried to drown and unbelievers beginning to wax worse satan was trying to help make them miss the junction but god moved in a miraculous just the same for he's omnipotent he said look what's taking place now as we move to this junction we see john coming up the river preaching he's telling one that's coming mightier than he begins to preach he begins to talk about jesus and all of a sudden he steps out into the place and omnipotence was made flesh and it dwelt among us as he walked the shores of galilee the little boat tossed about he acted like he didn't even pay no attention here he's tired but it came a junction of time something had to happen he put his foot on the brell of the boat and looked up and said peace be still the very creator of the heavenly earth laid that boat and nature had to obey it why when the junction comes omnipotent speaks and miraculous takes place amen we can see it all the way down in that junction miraculous the leper miraculous amen lazarus in the grave omnipotence speaks miraculous takes place it was miraculous after miraculous after miraculous why omnipotence was speaking but here we are at our junction here we are right now at this time and we can tell hell is gathering this place spirits of every time kind is coming in trying to bring thrusters and divisions and uh sin is rising up on every hand sickness on every hand what is it it's trying to get people to miss a junction but in the middle of it omnipotence is going to speak in the middle of it there's going to be a spell of voices speaks out and says peace be still in the middle of it there's gonna be a voice that says lazarus come forth people are seeing signs and wonders they're seeing things taking place but they're scoffing at it they're mocking at it they're laughing about it just like they did when at the junction of noah destruction was just before them and they're laughing and they're making fun and they're saying ha ha ha crazy noah and crazy people believe a prophet who's been gone 55 years crazy crazy crazy well noah believes something that he heard 120 years before and he just went on walking with god and all of a sudden omnipotence spoke direction destruction fell and millions died omnipotence when it speaks it'll change you it'll take a drunkard cigarette smoker a runner to the dances chain and carry it on like that but once omnipotent speaks the miraculous takes place and it'll change a life that was headed for death and hell back to life again omnipotence speaks miraculous takes place it is speaking even today omnipotences spoke and brain bleeds move away omnipotent speaks and thyroid issues vanish doctors don't know what to do with omnipotence speaks and cancer vanishes omnipotent speaks and alopecia vanishes oh that don't mean it ain't gonna come scratching back but he's defeated omnipotence speak and hearts are changed cigarettes fall off omnipotence moves we're at a junction we ought to be expecting omnipotence to speak we ought to be expecting more than any people on the face of this earth miracles to take place healings to take place deliverances to take place perhaps to come home spirits of every kind defeated there ought to be a people on this earth that says yep that's my god hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever and when he speaks it changes everything but the devil wants us to get get us caught up in just the fog and brother brandon was reading earlier in the message here in shalom he said it's like a fog that has just fallen upon the earth and he said it's only going to get worse and worse and worse but in the middle of this don't worry he's standing up and he's delivering his people you know i think about a story brother branham upon up on the mountain there we know the story but he gets caught in a fog and he's so trying to find his way and he's looking at everything he can try to look at to find his way trees the moss on the road what side's the moss on everything is a woodsman he said man i thought i was a woodman until i got in that position he said i finally realized i don't know anything he said i was lost and i was in such a fog i couldn't see where i was going and he actually started on what they call an indian death walk as he would walk and he said i'm going to go this way and i'm going to go this way just as hard as i can and i'm not going to turn to the right or left i'm going to go this way and next thing you know he'd come right back to the place he started i i i know it's this way and i'd go and he looking at every sign trying to figure it out trying to see how you get itself out of this situation but he said the whole time a voice was speaking to him i'm the very present help in the time of trouble i'm a very present help in the time of trouble i'm a very present help in the time of trouble uh you may be in the fog we're all in the fog we're all in this darkness as far as this world's concerned but don't forget there's a voice i'm a very present help in the time of trouble i'm a very present help in the time of trouble he said he kept hearing and he thought man am i losing my mind uh and finally he said i finally come to my real life realize hey somebody's talking to me so he just knelt down and said god if this is you he said i thought i knew the way out of here i thought i knew how to get out of here but i'm lost i need you you know that's really all the words god needs to hear lord i need you he said he got up said his amen grabbed his stuff and said i'm gonna head this way and he sets his course and he starts walking the whole time walking the exact opposite way that he needed to go he said but all of a sudden he felt a hand grabbed a hold of him he said when he turned and felt that hand he turned to see who was behind him so there wasn't nobody there he said he looked up and all of a sudden the fog parted and he seen hurricane mountain that was the direction he needed to go maybe this morning you've been in the fog but you could hear the voice on the very present help in the time of trouble i'm the very present help in the time of trouble i pray that you can feel that hand upon your heart say hey child i got this this election i got it this world situation i got it coronavirus i got it this whole thing that's going on in this world it's only working about an end and it's not your end at the junction of time god wins satan loses every time he's setting up an end but it's the end of pharaoh it's the end of the devil it's the end of his torments it's the end of his mind battles it's the end of his spirits it wants to come night after night time after time and haunt you time after time he's setting up his end omnipotence is going to speak say lord let me hear that voice let our eyes turn just for a
