there'd be someone that says you know what i i'm a little cold a little indifferent lord may they find warmth at the fire of god to warm them back up lord again with the fire and zeal of the holy ghost lord would you commit this service in your hands in jesus name amen amen hallelujah amen turn to the exodus chapter 2 if you would amen this thought has just been on my heart i actually spoke it it'll be somewhat different tonight but spoke it at the first service there at uh up in ohio there with brother andrew spencer i'd like to speak to you tonight on loose them and let them go amen ask you to remember me in prayer i'm flying out tomorrow to go and be in canada and brother kelly hildebrandt's amen to minister there with brother ron spencer uh brother tim as you know was to go and and i was just planning on carrying his bible and his briefcase and his luggage or whatever had to do but with his surgery and things and coming up next week he felt he needed to be at home so it felt my lot so remember me in prayer i really appreciate it we were flying tomorrow getting about 12 30 at night but then preach a couple of times and come home monday to be here for the surgery on tuesday for brother tim so we'll be remembering him in prayer as well that the lord had just directed the hands of the doctor and and uh and that it'll it'll accomplish what it's meant to do amen that he can have relief from these things amen exodus chapter 2 verse 23 and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up to god by the reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of medium and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in the flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight while the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he had turned aside the sea god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place wherein on thou standest is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hit his face and for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i've surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them out of that land into a good land and a large into a land flowing with milk and hunting unto the place of the canaanites and the hivites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel has come unto me and i've also seen the oppression where with the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt moses said unto god who am i that i should go to pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of egypt you shall serve god upon this mountain and moses said unto god behold when i'm coming to the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said to moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am has sent me unto you and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has sent me unto you and this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations amen we'll let you be seated this evening as we have been on the thought of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we can no doubt as we read this scripture see it very clearly of him expressing himself as the same he said i am the god of abraham isaac and jacob but he didn't leave it there he said i want you to understand that i am so i am the god i am that i am amen i i even whatever i was to them i'm also in this situation and in this time and you know and we see that as they were in a difficult time and it was no doubt very chaotic as their life would unfold every day as slaves in egypt and under the first exodus and they they found themselves under very much a hardship and under very much toiling as long as they would go amen and it seemed like there had been a promise of a deliverer but it seemed like it went on and on and on until god had completely forgot about it but god never forgets his promises we can see here that time does not matter to god at all time only matters to man because we're time beings and we only really have a short time here on this earth so we expect things to be very quickly and very fast but god is an eternal being as we know and so time means nothing to him whether it be five minutes five years 50 years 100 years or 400 years it means nothing to god but what means something to god is that his word is fulfilled and so and so we find as it came down it seemed to be a the dark really dark time and it was a very dark time for the children of israel and it seemed like their cries were no it wasn't going to heaven you know they would cry out to god why why are you forsaking us why were your children you know we we come to this place and and we came to and then there became a pharaoh that didn't know joseph and now we're slaves and what have you forgot about us and and their cries began to go up and no doubt they thought their prayers were not being heard they thought their prayers would would never be answered but you know i love it how he told moses in the very beginning as we read in the scriptures he said god heard their groanings he heard their cries the cries came up to god amen and i want you to understand he's still a god that hears he understands even what we're going through in this exodus that we're facing and you know i don't think we should be surprised that if they in that exodus would have a very it would be a very dark time and a very chaotic time that in this exodus it'll be also a very dark time and a very chaotic time but in the middle of it god's word is going to be fulfilled it's going to come to pass as he said it would you know and it doesn't matter that is 50 or 60 years past when the prophet of god came upon the earth time means nothing to god it means something to us because we're a time being but unto god amen that means nothing what means something to god is i'm going to fulfill what i promised i would but i'm very thankful in this time that we're living in because it is a very difficult time and it's a very trying time seems like every day there's more and more things that are happening and more and more things that are going on darkness is increasing every moment and every day amen every day you get up and there's news and more darkness and news and more darkness and news and more fear and more anxiety and more plagues upon the earth amen it's not going to get any better it's only going to get worse because this world is going into a tribulation amen i didn't say the bride is i said the world is going into a tribulation but i'm thankful in the time that we're living in we still serve a god that is i am not i just i was or i will be but a god that is i am and so if he's a god that is i am he's the same god that heard their cries here's our cries the same god that heard their groanings here's your groanings he hears your cry he hears your requests he sees the tears that fall he sees and hears the questions in your heart amen we're not serving a god that's somewhere off somewhere you know you know and his mind is off of us but he's very involved in the situation that we're in even now amen behind the scenes it's not you know i understand this is satan's eden but satan is only given the reigns by god he can only do things as god allows him to do it so he builds governments he builds kingdoms and but it's under the rulership of god to bring about an end time amen so we're serving a very personal god a god who is present even tonight for your need no matter how little it is no matter how great it is that matters not to god but he is present for your need he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble so if you need a healer he is i am if you need a savior he is i am if you need a deliverer tonight he's i am if you need a waymaker he's i am if you need a promise keeper he is i am if you need a comforter he is i am hallelujah if you need a god he is i am if you need a friend he is i am so whatever your need is in this present situation that you find yourself in he is i am amen he knows amen exactly what it's like to carry the human burdens that we are carrying because he also came in a time a very dark time of the human race amen as he would come up on the earth it was a very chaotic time it was a very unnerving time it was unruly rulers are unruly unruliness and things that was going on amen but he came in that moment and then that time so he knows exactly what it's like to face the pressures of an age he knows what it's like to face the pressures even that you're what you're going on hey man he as brother donny would bring it out there in my mom's memorial he knows what it's like to ask why amen he knows because why why hast thou forsaken me he knows the feeling of being forsaken or feeling forsaken therefore he promised you i will never leave you or forsake you well hallelujah so in your middle of your trial he is still there no matter how much your feelings may not declare it or your sight may not declare it that does not matter he is still there because his promise declares that he is he's heard your cry he's seen the devil and what he's been doing against you and coming against you and he has come down to deliver you hallelujah now this god is a supernatural god and when god comes supernatural things takes place when the supernatural comes and falls into the midst amen that's what we saw there in moses it was a supernatural thing that a burning bush would appear and a bush would catch on fire but yet not burn and it was so supernatural that it caught a backslidden prophet and he's on the backside of a desert no doubt his mind was a million miles away amen from the children of israel and he'd put it out of his mind been out there for 40 years and was having a good life but all of a sudden the supernatural fell in place and he said i'm going to see what that's all about and a voice begins to speak and his voice began to declare god in that present time amen of god for that present situation it was showing in that moment he's always present tense he's never in the future or oh never just in the past but this god is always present tense amen a voice spoke and he said i have come down to deliver my people and when that voice spoke pharaoh lost his power amen pharaoh may not have realized it at that moment but a voice spoke and said i've come down to deliver them and at that moment pharaoh lost his power amen amen pharaoh's day was over he lost his power and god began to plague his kingdom he began to plague his god the gods of egypt until every god of egypt amen was destroyed it was a pillar of fire that appeared in that day amen as in that first exodus he appeared in a pillar of fire and again in this exodus he has once again come in the form of a pillar of fire it's another supernatural event that has taken place in our day amen oh hallelujah and a voice has spoken our day amen i'm not i don't just want to point to the first text of this what good is it it's just the first exodus and he was just a god there he's still a god today [Applause] amen and a voice spoke amen out of the prophet's mouth in our day and it wasn't just a man speaking it was god speaking through a man and at that moment satan lost his power hallelujah amen the seals were tore off the questions and the liens that have been struck off and now as satan lost his power we can realize we are a free people satan has lost his power to hold you any longer [Applause] hallelujah i'm here to declare to you depression has lost his power anxiety and fear has lost his power it once could hold a people but now a voice is spoke in our generation [Applause] hallelujah amen it was his last days pharaoh had a last day he lost his ability to hold people amen just as the devil in this day has lost his ability to hold people in sin oh praise be to god amen they're used to he used to have that ability to hold somebody in sin because there wasn't a power great enough but a power came back in this day as it did on the day of pentecost and a holy ghost can fall in a bed and a man or a woman and satan lose every bit of his power where once there was power of cigarettes to hold somebody amen the holy ghost can come and cleanse it and it loses power you all have a witness in the building tonight you knew when it lost that that demon of a cigarette that demon of drinking one day lost his power [Applause] i love to remind the devil you've lost your power [Applause] amen amen you are the very proof tonight you are the very proof tonight that satan has lost his power [Applause] we know the stories they would go and the ten plagues that fell and it was actually a plague against every god the god of the nile and the god of the flies and the god of this and the god of that all the worship the gods they worship they i am showed i have authority over that amen and i want that devil to remember that tonight the i am still has authority over you i may not have power over you as a human being but as a son of god the i am has power and authority over you amen we saw it expressed amen when demonic expressions would come out of people it'd be a son of god that would take his god-given rights and say you devil you can't hold her no more you can't hold him no more and begin to preach the word of god and the prayer of faith and that demon realize i'm done i'm done i gotta get out of here i've lost my power hallelujah i'm looking at a people tonight that the devil has lost it he don't have power to hold you no more he's lost it all i'm looking at young people that the devil lost power you would have been there when he saved them you want to be there when he turned them around you want to be there when he moved on the scene hallelujah no wonder we could sing hallelujah no wonder we can say as long as i'm alive i'm gonna glorify you can take your church of christ spirit and pack it out of here there's worshipers that realize the devil lost his power and i'm gonna see why there there's a lamb that will sway hallelujah so it seemed like you know what this is going to be a wonderful thing we just got released we're out of here god says i got one more thing up my sleeve i want you to go tell moses about the battle plan and the you know they didn't have waze or gps back then i don't reckon he said but i want you to go buy this play and you're going in camp over here and you're going to move over here he said the reason this is going to be because pharaoh is going to hear about it you know man they don't lost their mind they're entangled they're entangled in the wilderness and i will harden pharaoh's heart that he'll follow after them and i will be honored on faith on pharaoh amen maybe that's the reason the bible has been walking for about 50 or 60 years you think god don't have a plan he's got a plan may not fit your plan but it's his plan and i mean as far as i know he's still god [Applause] i don't know why we're still here but amen maybe it's to entangle the amen for the devil to say what you don't look at that that bride don't got as much power as she thought she did she don't have as much as what she once thought she had look at her she's still walking around here's 2021. we ought to go down there and god's saying come on amen come on amen i'm building a trap for your devil and you just don't even know it i'm bringing you to a place i'm inviting you into a place amen for your destruction hallelujah so he's invited cancer and he's invited coach i'm gonna get somewhere with him he's invited every kind of devil into this rail not for your destruction not for your destruction it's for his destruction hallelujah because he knows he don't have power [Applause] so he made ready his cancer and he made ready his covenant and whatever other disease and he's riding after him he made it already his sin and different things trying to come back after them with his whips and as well and and these things of the past did you hear me the things of the past you try to come hold it over them again but god had a plan he said he got here he's coming don't worry about it in god's mind he wasn't worried about it it was the children of israel started thinking what is there no graves in egypt you brought us out here to die in i just like to say this i'd rather die free man than die slaves [Applause] amen if i get down to the end of all of this and i close my eyes and there's nothing to it i got a free man because i drank all i want to i've smoked all i want to i've seen all i want to i just don't want to cause it's been broke in my life i'm a free man amen and so here they go but what happened that pillar of fire moved between them and the egyptians amen we know the story moses began to speak the word of god he said fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which it shall show you this day for the egyptians whom you've seen today you'll see them no more again no no again no more forever and the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace you know i i i thought that was it was really good when i thought about it being just good old southern you know the lord shall fight for you and you'll shut up but it's more than that it's time for you to hold your peace because you got a peace the world didn't give and the world can't take away so it doesn't matter if the egyptians are breathing down your neck hold your peace it doesn't matter if the death the doctors tell you you ain't got four more days to live or four more months to live hold your peace because there's a word that speaks about you amen it ain't time to let go of our peace and we go back to our anxieties and our fears amen you know what god did for you amen amen it's hold your peace amen speak and go forward there's one objective in this army go forward [Applause] and you see what he's going to we know the stories i'm going to harden their hearts and they're going to follow after you the wind blew here they go across him a god that can make a highway out of a red sea do you re we realize what kind of god we're serving one moment there's a sea there and you might could cross it on a boat on a good day and the next moment there's a dry highway and waters are piled up on each side and you're walking right through them looking at all these issues around you he's still that god you might be looking at a red sea tonight hold your peace let the winds of the holy ghost go to blow it it'll open up a way where there's no way it'll make a sea into a highway and before you know it you're walking right through it making your way to the other side and sometimes you won't even realize it till you get to the other side look what god did for me look how he moved on my situation amen and here they are on the other side in the egyptians pharaoh thought this is a good idea let's go after them they did it we can too god said come on you've been waiting for this moment you cannot make give me a moment god maybe i'm sure has some humor man i've been waiting for a long time for this maybe there's a little time come to him there for a moment i've been waiting for this come on right come on here they are they're riding their chariots they're coming after them and they're booking down through that red sea and they're looking up through there just hold until i get to the other side and they're running through there and the last few bit get to the other side that's all we're waiting on we're waiting for that last bit to get the other side we know the type of that it's the type of the blood it's the type of the holy ghost amen we've got to keep the we got to keep all these all these demons back that wants to try to take it out of the house of god because we got some more that needs to get to the other side [Applause] come on now we got some more man i ain't just talking about young people i'm talking about old folks too i need to get to the other side amen you've been you've been trying to drag that bitterness along you've been trying to drag off it's going to hinder you and you're going to fall ain't even deal with that thing before it kills you where it destroys your family well i got you don't understand what happened in my family and i got all this i just can't forgive it'll take you down amen amen but what happens if you hold on that thing the next thing you know those chariots are going to run over you but there's some more that still got to get to the other side that's why we're standing there amen with our hands lifted up and saying hey it's for you too amen the same experience that we got you can have it too the same god we know you can know him too the same one that freed us can free you too come on over it's good over here amen and when they got over to the other side he stretched forth his hand again over the sea and the sea returned to his strength and when the morning appeared oh my mama that puts me in a thought of a brother ron's statement brother ron's sermon morning's coming that devil has been after you and he's been hot on your trail telling morning's coming [Applause] it's about to be morning and you're gonna breathe your last breath you're going to put out your last stretch you're going to whip that whip one last time mourning is on its way and morning appeared oh my and the egyptians fled against it but the lord overthrew them in the midst of the sea and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the hosts of pharaoh but the children of israel walked upon dry land and the waters were a wall in them on the right and on their left thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hands of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the seashore dead upon the seashore he just told him the egyptians you see today you'll see no more forever it was a little different egyptian when they saw them before they had whips in their hands had reigns in their hands and they were coming after them and they were snarling to make this time they saw them ain't no breath in their body you know what miriam realized they're that one right there he can't pick that whip up no more there ain't no strength in him anymore to pick up a whip and whip me one more time amen one of them realized there's that one that took me around the corner and beat me and ravished me he can't do that not one more time and some joy came on their hearts amen you should have been there [Applause] amen you either think there's something against shouting and dancing you should have been there when you realize the egyptians are dead they don't have no more breath they don't have no more abilities they've lost hallelujah you should have been there when that little girl realized that fear can't hold me no more that anxiety can't hold me no more amen that depression can't hold me no more hallelujah this should have been there when that sister realized that cancer can't hold me no more and around and around this church he went leaning on the arms of the beloved you should have been there it was a glorious time but you're here tonight you're here tonight he's i am he's still the same one who heals delivers set free they no longer had power no wonder that people could no wonder they're dancing around brother branham would look at that woman dancing there in this church and said they're going to turn in my to my church into a tavern he said she's over there beating on that piano said there been four rows of keys i think should have hit every one of them so the next thing you know this little girl got something started beating on a little washboard wouldn't work in some churches that's drums beating on the watch board amen that's rock and roll music that's what brother brown thought too he said they're turning my church into a tavern playing that stuff like that he said next thing you know this little girl got out dancing in the aisle that really stirred him up it was wrong with my hand i shouldn't have had half time that's what it was he said he was teaching on the second coming of christ and said he'd be going about four hours that don't go against that goes against some of your message believers too don't it church order brother churchill okay four hours he said i thought i'd have a little half time let him have a little rest hey man amen it's time some of you lose that slave mentality some of you two slave too much a slave to a clock i didn't mean to go there but we went there my beans are burning let them burn who cares they got more beans there's only one eternal life amen amen he said they're turning into a tavern he started thinking about it said where i danced he said there's he said you know where's dancing is it in the bible he said there's a lot of things we don't know what's fundamentalist i think is what he called himself you know what he said though something but we ought to all take the heart he said i wouldn't say nothing about it he said because they might be right and i might be wrong man oh to be more like the prophet well try that amen this is the next thing you know he started thinking about where is dancing ordained in the bible we got to thinking about miriam seeing no dead attack masters and he said wow yeah she danced she played the tambourine and danced got thinking about david and how he saw the word being restored and he got so tore up about that he started dancing he said but you know what he said there was one thing about that he said this his little wife got tore up about it because he was out of order he said what did god do he said he cursed her seed she never could bring forth life so be careful what you say it might be the holy ghost you're mocking amen and so here we go he said but the next thing i knew he said you know what happened i got to realize as i was looking at that listening that music and watching that girl dance he said my methodist foot got the patent he said next thing i knew he said i was out there dancing with her he said i've never done ain't nothing that before he said but i think he'd done a pretty good job amen amen so we need to realize amen that we we we want more than just a intellectual knowledge amen that we want more than intellectual knowledge that satan has lost his power we want a reality of it a revelation of it amen it's one thing to know god and say pharaoh lost his power or this lost his power amen that one got free but what about you when you see him dead when you see that devil that's tormented you dead it'll do something to you it'll put a shout in you it'll put a dance in you i said this before but i say it again amen ii timothy paul would say in the last days perilous times shall come last days for who where are we living in we're living in the last days for the devil we're living in the last days pharaoh had a last day philistines had a last day goliath had a last day haman had a last day hallelujah he had such a last day that even this in this hour we're living in they still write his name on the bottom of the soles of their feet and they read the book of esther and every time haman's name comes up they stomp their feet until every mark of that name is gone amen if the devil's not under your feet he's out of his place hallelujah he belongs under your feet he belongs unto you amen what was meant for your destruction god is turning around for your good satan has lost well think about that anxiety has come to his last service lust has come to his last service suicide has come to his last service fear has come to his last service would it be tonight cancer has come to his last service it did before it comes service after service but there came a last service oh mercy jesus let's turn to acts 12 and verse 5. mercy had time to go we got the armor girl flip it back the other way come to her last day last time sweeping the floor last time taking out the trash last time just like they did there as they walked out one day a slave the next day free do you hear that book board coming i think i hear it amen we've been hearing it been preached actually acts 12 and verse 5 peter therefore was kept in the prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him and when herod had would have been would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison but did that matter to god oh i got him this time i got two right beside him and i got two at the door he's done and behold the angel lord came up to him and a light shined in the prison and he smoked peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off of his hands and the angel said on him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and saith unto them cast that garment about me and follow me and he went out and followed him and was not it was true that was done by an angel but thought he saw a vision but when he was past the first and he was past the second and it came to that he was past justification sanctification and the holy ghost amen it came to the iron gate that leadeth into the city which opened to him of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and fought with the angel departed from him and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety the lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews i love that word right there from all the expectation of the people of the jew now the devil had a lot of expectations for your life he tried to keep you covered up he tried to keep you bound with chains and guards all around you but there was an angel that could get beyond every guard get beyond every chain get beyond every gate every door amen you might have been in the innermost part and seemed like it was so hopeless but an angel still could get to you i'm so thankful i couldn't go down far enough that that angel couldn't still get to me but he picked me up and he smoked me on the side and said timothy this ain't your life this ain't who you are let me lead you to where you belong [Applause] and it led me past all the things in my life all of all my past mistakes all my past failures and all the things that try to hold me down i'm beginning to realize i'm free and the devil's expectations didn't come to pass whoo some of you he expected you to end a drunk he'll expect you to end a dope head he expects you to end in all kind of misery and strife but god sent an angel and he changed the expectations he even changed your expectations maybe peter's expectations in the morning i'm going to be stoned or i'm going to die but almighty god came on the scene and it changed even his expectations to where now he realized i ain't bound no more he's loosed me and he set me free and we also the story as we bring this on down of lazarus and it's really where we want to draw from we know the story of he went down into the grave going through a lot here passing a lot and he goes and jesus is seemingly going another direction he seemingly didn't know he's he's heard the request but he's not answering it he's heard it but he's not answering it just give him time he will answer he will answer he may not answer the way you expect him to answer but he will answer i've realized that even the last few months i expected a different answer but he still answered you know when that ipad played and began to speak about the down down from his glory and all that as i was speaking about amen the the three hebrew children going into the fire and he came down and that ipad began to play behind me amen the worst sinner in the city in 56 favorite of all the hymns because it expresses his extreme deity especially in the day that we're living in when they want to make him just a prophet but he's more than a prophet he's god my expectation was that was for my mother she would rise up there out of there without a smell of smoke on her she did she was in a place saying another brain bleed can get her we saw god heal we know god heals brain bleeds he did it but it wasn't my expectation that wasn't what i expected but then i get to realize and afterwards as the time would go and i'd go down to her bedroom there in the or i see your room i see your room in the hospital she ain't spoke for 17 hours hadn't even said a word we prayed for her and she didn't even act like was praying for her but tim walks into the bathroom i get down in her face and i begin to talk to her about i just begin to speak about he's come down to deliver and she starts singing me the song down from his glory whole first verse into the course and through this time i began to realize that was for me i was about to walk through fire but he's with me about to go through one of the hardest trials of my life but he's right there with me amen you can take that for yourself tonight because he's still with you too because his word says he is he said i will never leave you or forsake you so it may seem like he's walking four days away but he's still right here beside you amen and here he went disciple he tells us you know disciples he sleeps and they said well my if he's sleeping he's doing well good nap he said lazarus is dead and i'm glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent you may believe nether nevertheless let's go unto him and so he begins to come and they come and tell martha he's come but mary still sat in the house martha came to and said lord if i would have been here my brother would not have died but i know that even now whatsoever thou ask of god god to give it to you and he said thy brother shall rise again she said i know in the last days in the resurrection he said i am here we go again i am i am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this amen believeth thou this she said yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world amen she was coming to the moment okay he's i am thou art the cries sees i am when she had said so she went away and called mary and said the masters come and called us for thee and as soon as she heard that she arose and came unto him and jesus not yet come to town but was in that place where martha met him and the jews in which were there in the house comforting her and when they saw mary she rose up hastily she said well she's going to the grave to weep mary came to where jesus was she fell down at his feet saying lord if i was being here my my brother not died and jesus saw her weeping and the jews also weeping and he groaned in his spirit and was troubled so where have you laid him he said lord come and see and jesus swelled he's the jew said well he must have loved him someone said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind caused even this man should not have died jesus therefore again groaning himself coming to the grave he said take away the stone we know how do we know what happened is he would stand there and he would scream with a loud voice lazarus come forth branham said if he wouldn't have said lazarus it'd have been a general resurrection because that was the voice of the resurrection amen lazarus come forth and lazarus was on a four-day journey but a voice caught him where he was and he turned around and he moved back to where the voice was coming from and the dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and jesus said unto loose him and let him go hallelujah listen he don't want you to just rise up he wants you to be loosed you don't have to be bound by those things walk away from those grave clothes he wants his children free free to serve him we can see that in luke chapter 13 and verse 10. he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years that was bowed together and could not no wise lift herself up and when jesus saw her he called her unto him and said woman thou art loose from thy infirmity and he laid hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god it doesn't matter how long you had it it doesn't matter how difficult it is when that voice speaks it's over with you may come into services bowed down maybe your whole life has been bent over under the weight but let that voice of resurrection speak and say you're loosed and the ruler you thought the church had been oh hallelujah praise the lord got a free one in the house she's dancing all over the place she's loosed they answered with indignation because of jesus healed on the sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days which men ought to work and them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day and the lord then answered them said thou hypocrite oh he knows who they are no every one of you on the sabbath day loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to water then ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham who satan has bound lo these 18 years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day hallelujah oh i pray that that voice will speak tonight and say you devil you hypocrite you held them too long that's a daughter of abraham that's the son of abraham they have a right to be free [Applause] so loose i want to go through this word for a moment as we bring this down here matthew chapter 24 and verse 35 is actually heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away this will pass away actually means to be loosed or changed from his present condition so really is you know i've always looked at that like heavens and earth will be no more but we know heaven's going to be renewed or the earth is going to be renewed and we're going to come back out on it and we're going to live upon it amen brother branham brings it out like this he said he said but go another another one in second peter 3 i'll get to it he said the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away it's the same word and with a great noise and elements shall melt with a fervent heat and the earth also in the works that are therein shall be burned up amen so there's there's some that's going to be changed and there's some that's going to be burnt up or annihilated completely done away with oh my oh i don't know let's let's read this for a moment he said doesn't mean that doesn't mean that the earth the planet is going to pass away but the world the cosmos the politics the sinners the system the sin the disease the germs everything that's wrong will pass away wow that makes me happy when i realize one day there'll be no more sin one day there'll be no more fear it won't even be a word no more there'll be no more doubts there'll be no more mind panels there'll be no more sickness it'll pass away it'll be annihilated he said notice here peter said and will melt with a fervent heat and the works they're in burnt up not the planet the works the works of men all their politicians and their schemes all their denomination and manmade schemes will go with it when it burns heaven will pass away with a great noise did you notice that heaven will pass away with a good great noise listen the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite the gases that are in the earth and the heavens and exploded listen this bible said here heavens will the heavens will pass away the earth with a great noise such an explosion will rock it he said because it's going to kill every disease it's going to kill every thistle it's going to kill every thorn everything that's ever been done by the fall it's going to kill it the fire is going to burn it up and remember it's not all together just a literal fire it's also a holy fire and that holy fire will take away satan and all his devils well can i read that to the devil one more time that holy fire is going to take away satan and all his devils you ought to be there when depression goes in the fire and inside it goes in the fire and cancer goes in oh we're going to have a little clap and we're going to say oh no there's going to be shout on the hills of glory when you realize that devil will never ever ever ever ever bother me again hallelujah he bothered me for a short time on earth but he'll never fire me again because there's a holy pie that's going to take him away and we shall be loosed we shall be loose oh it's the same power of god that fell inside your heart and your soul and burns all the sin out [Applause] woo jesus call the devils let's name them holler them out all the devils oh my my my my both heaven and earth will pass away killing all germs did you hear that covet all germs oh all the insects [Applause] i'll be glad ain't no mosquitoes i'll just be honest with you at least if they there they got their own spot and they ain't bothering me all natural life forming around it even the h2o the water will explode think about it talk about a noise he said you know when a man receives a baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around that why because sin is being burnt devils are running and screaming amen what is it is the baptism taking place the fire of god is going on you know we're getting into the fall season don't be seated but i ain't done i'm sorry amen you get into the fall say hi how many like that cool weather this morning hallelujah and you start looking for a fire pit and some wood to sit around don't you hey man sit around because southern people like to be hot we don't like being cold it's like being cold not cold anyway you get around a fire pit what are you looking for you're looking for some wood that's ready to be burnt you don't want no green wood that's still got sap in it and life in it and something in it that keeps the fire from going and burning and causing some real red hot hot coals you want some fire that's been dried out of itself it's life is gone it's everything it ever was it's gone it's just it's it's just that wood laying on there and you light that old fire and it gets to crackling it gets to popping it gets to spitting and sputtering and the fire gets to jumping and man you're just having yourself go get the coco s'mores what they ain't no hershey go get it why because of something by the fire listen when the fire of god comes down and it wants to fall upon something it ain't looking for some green wood it ain't looking something that's got to steal its own wants and its own ways and its own desire still and it's still soggy and wet it's looking for something that's been dried out and said i don't want no more of my whole life i don't want no more of my pride i don't want no more my arrogance i don't want no more of timothy pruitt i don't want no more myself then that fire will fall then it can light up upon that wood and it'll go to jumping and popping and carrying on and every devil in hell [Applause] my my my the devil don't like fire but he's about to get burnt up with it amen he said this will change the whole surface of the entire earth she'll burst and blow to pieces on the outside the crust and 100 feet below it'll simply be demolished the atmospheres the gases that's in the earth now they're finding their missiles they can't get through to it great spheres up there way up some kind of fear all the gases they say that will burst the holy wrath of god will come upon it it'll cleanse it it'll change the entire service surface heavens and earth will pass away now this word means passing from one form to another it does not mean annihilation as the english word would mean pass away it's annihilated but the hebrew word or the greek word here does not mean that it means passing from one form to another it from one condition to another it's being loosed from the curse of the fall and being restored back to an eden hallelujah amen same word would be used in titus 3 verse 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration regeneration is loosed it's bringing us changing what it was into something new again paul is using the same word means regeneration of a man that man has passed from being a sinner to being a saint not annihilated but the man's been changed he isn't annihilated he's a changed person he's been changed from what he was to what he should be jesus would use it again and then matthew 19 and verse 28 jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which follow me in the regeneration in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory amen you shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel jesus used the same word you set with me and my father's kingdom regenerate it you're changed he used that same word when he said to the cut said to the colt loose the colt and let him go he said the same thing at the resurrection of lazarus loose him change him he's been tied let him go what did it mean the earth will be loosed from the grip of satan it'll be loose from politics it'll be loose from denominational religious systems and be used for the kingdom of god to establish the kingdom of god here on the earth but as long as in the hands of satan politics as we heard well i'm not a democrat what are you a republican i'm a conservative no i'm a christian i'm not from this kingdom gets down to it i'm not a u.s citizen i'm a heavenly citizen right now satan is the ruler of this earth he owns it but christ has come to redeem it he said just like one time i was satan's property but not now how many can say that tonight one time i was but not now one time that little woman was his property but not now he's talking about the woman at the well he came to loose the grip of satan on that line he came to loose the sin of satan on my life on your life and now we are no longer satan's we are sons of god he said that's why you often hear me saying prayer satan take your hands off of god's property off of god's property have faith to claim your own that's your right take your hands off of her take your hands off of him that'll be some mamas and daddies enforcing that claim tonight say devil that's not your property i dedicated her to god a long time ago she belongs to jesus take your hands off of them not annihilate the person just take your hands off loose them and let them go pass it away it changes the earth will change politics will change the religions will change the nominations will pass away politics will pass away but the kingdom of god shall be established forever he would also say this in revelation 1 and i'm bringing this down one in verse 5 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood hmm this word washed is loosed he's loosed us from our sins in his own blood loose from sin bound up in the blood oh i'm wrapped up tied up tangled up in jesus i used to be a tangled up soul but now i'm tangled up for the right things amen he said isn't that wonderful did you catch it it was his own blood that loosed us completely from our sins not our human blood it was the blood of god peter called it the blood of christ paul called the blood of the lord the blood of jesus not three but one person there's a revelation again one god that omnipotent jehovah god came down and made himself a body by means of the virgin birth and indwelted that it might be the blood of god that would free us loose us entirely he don't lose you partway if you're only part way is cause you're holding on to something there was a lot of part way in the first exodus and they end up staying in egypt don't be partway he wants to loose us entirely he said he that loveth the world don't love god you're saying you're loose from sins and yet you still sin that's what i call an idiot how can you be loosed from something and still do it well it's okay long as you don't indulge you're trying to tell me it don't got you it's got you you know these people who wants to walk away from the message they claim they're loose they're more bound than ever they're so bound by demons they can't even walk away without scratching back at the door and haunting and screaming and cursing and this that and the other why because they're tormented souls they're not loosed they're bound mercy we're going down to this as you can see i got way too much we could go through many of them as he would loose them the woman with a blood issue loosed blind bartimaeus loosed woman at the well loosed complete the woman the man i love that story about the man that was born blind he was born in this condition and the disciples are even asking is this man born blind because he sinned or is mom and dad saying he said no he said that the glory of god might be revealed you're wondering why you're going through something and so the glory of god can be revealed in you you wonder why you're having to go through this difficult trial it's so that the glory of god can be revealed in you and we know the story he's spitting some clay putting his eyeballs his eye sockets and he created the eyeball to me that would have told them who that was ain't no man can do that he come he coming and created in my boss you guys go wash he wouldn't wash and he came back seeing and asked him who did this they called his parents they didn't want to get thrown out so they said ask him it happened to him he said you mean before the world was ever formed never has a man been born blind given his sight and you don't know who that is who was blind they want to say we're blind because we're following a man and you're telling you to ask me let me ask you this there's never been a ministry like what took place in that man that wasn't not the ministry of a man that was a ministry of christ in a man only christ could do the things that he did oh sure there's been people lay hands on the sick and they recover that's part of it but the discernments of the heart time after that's the sign of the messiah now i want to ask who's blind if you don't know who that is but god wants to make a loose to do a loosing brother bring it out so powerfully as we finish with this satan you might as well go to squeak in your brakes because i charge thee by jesus christ that you turn these people loose all throughout the world wherever this message may go how many is hearing the message turn them loose i claim them they are bought by the blood of jesus christ they don't belong to the devil they're not their own they're bought with the price the royal seat of abraham the lord jesus christ has paid their ransom thou filthy dirty stinking hypocrite deceiver of men leading them blind into the ditches of hell turn down loose i charge you by the name of the living god by the sacrifice of his son jesus you turn them loose that their souls may be charged with this blessing and with this presence that they might possess [Applause] that they might possess not just the preacher possessed that they might possess every gate of their enemy you've got them waiting for this or that and the other some holy touch but i'm telling you tonight you will turn them loose hallelujah i say that the voice of resurrection oh speaks you're defeated being you have no power the son of god has stripped you of everything you ever have he broke your back at calvary and he proves he is a resurrection of the life he's proven to this church i am the resurrection and the lies i say come forth in the name of jesus walk out of those graves oh i could hear it coming through my heart today if he walked out of the grave i'm walking too oh if he called lazarus had a degree and that boy spoke and up out of that graveyard and he walked out then i can walk out because i've heard the same voice i've heard the voice of resurrection
