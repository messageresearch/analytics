allow lord god your people to be fed lord that's the desire of my heart that you now lord will speak father we ask these things in your precious name jesus name amen and amen amen if you have your bibles tonight i'd ask you to turn with me over to the book of proverbs the 24th chapter while you're turning there just tell you a little something funny that happened to me while i was preaching at brother danny's on on sunday we were preaching along and then i got into preaching about gideon and what makes this really embarrassing is it's not the first time i've done this i did it to the young people one time and i was preaching about gideon and i got ready to make a point and i told the whole congregation to turn to gideon seven and uh and about that you should have seen them man there were so many of them brother danny that was the funniest part was watching people have been reading the bible for 40 years trying to find the book of gideon and uh and after i said it about the third time i hear brother danny go judges what judges that's exactly right but uh we are going to read from the book of proverbs tonight and that is a real book in the bible turn to the book of proverbs the 24th chapter and the 30th verse i'd like to take a little thought tonight maybe a little different on broken walls and the hunger of nature broken walls and the hunger of nature in the 30th verse it says i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and received instruction if you'll also turn over with me to galatians the 5th chapter and the 22nd verse galatians the 5th chapter and the 22nd verse it says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness and faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit amen may god had his blessings as you have your seats i mean i believe that each and every one of us tonight and in every service and in every day are being called to further our walk from wherever it is that we find ourselves we are never all on the exact same spot or in the exact same place and in our spiritual walk but i believe that god is always calling us to take another step the moment that we're not walking in the moment that we're standing still is when our our relationship or our experience as it were becomes stagnant so he's calling us tonight to take another step and to to go to greater depths and for each one of us to reach higher heights and as i was studying this and looking on this thought i know that within every congregation you have people at every single level you have some that have never even accepted salvation you have some that are justified and sanctified and then those that are filled with the holy ghost and everywhere in between those sit underneath the roof of every single congregation but as i studied this thought out i wasn't studying it from the standpoint of someone that was lost but from the standpoint of someone who is doing everything that they can to walk with the lord walking with god doing their best to push on and take that step that i believe god has called us to and i was looking at through the standpoint of you are god's people and you have been called to be fruitful every single christian is called to be fruitful to bear fruits of the spirit now i was i was looking at it thinking that we above all people in the earth should be a group of people bearing forth the fruits of the spirit all right if anyone should be bearing forth fruits in this day in this age it should be the people and the followers of this message that have a revealed word that light has shown in this day on the word and when we have a fool where we're not looking at it through a glass darkly as it were but we can look at it with revelation we can look at it in truth and and if we can see that we ought to be a people that can bear fruits in this day so when i got to that i asked myself and i asked you this for you personally what hinderath what hindereth if we're supposed to be bearing all these fruits what hindereth what is it stopping you what is it hindering me why don't i have a greater harvest than that which i have what is it that hinders us and brother branham says here in a quote he says god bless you god bless you god bless you in the balcony is somebody up in the balcony that would say brother branham i once had the victory i once was a godly person but somehow another the weeds and the thorns and the things has choked me down the weeds and the thorns and things has choked me down what happened to this person why is it that they can look and say i once had the victory this isn't someone who wasn't walking with god this isn't someone who wasn't serving the lord this is someone who lived for a period of time and and had the the testimony that i had the victory i walked above sin i walked above i had the victory that i needed but but thorns and things has choked me down i once was a godly person now notice what it is that brother brown on when he's speaking these these people that he says has stolen away the victory he says what is it that has choked the life out of this person weeds and thorns and things has choked me down weeds and thorns and things has choked me down now christians are called and instructed to be a fruit-bearing people we are instructed and called to be a fruit-bearing church not a church that's living off past traditions not a church that's living off past moves or a church that's living out of a past glory but one that is bringing forth the same fruits as the original church one that is bringing forth the exact same harvest as the original church because it is of the same vine and so the fruits that we're bringing forth shouldn't match the fruits that we see there in the book of acts in the very first church age i know sometimes it's hard for us to look at it like this but in the first church age every church was a message church every church in the first age was a believing church so we should match up with that when we look at and bring forth the same fruits we are called to have fruit-bearing fruitful homes our homes should be those that bear fruit where the atmosphere is right for spiritual growth in the family where evils are kept out and the token is applied and children are nurtured and not a place where they are exposed to all the evils of the world i've often wondered what good it does us to homeschool our kids in order to keep them from an evil influence and then just bring the influence right into our house you might as well have just sent them to school you might as well just send them off to the wolves you're bringing it right in your home you're going i'm trying to protect them i'm trying to protect them but here i don't got time for you go watch this yeah that's okay yeah i'll tolerate that what good is it what have you really done if you're doing that you're cutting off the harvest you're killing the fruits you're making your home an unfruitful home you're making it where the the kids have to literally fight uphill to get where it is that you want them to go or where we hope to see them get you're putting them off in a bad situation because the the place that they're supposed to be protected the place that they're supposed to be nourished the place the atmosphere where the holy spirit is supposed to be able to deal with them you've got them living in a worldly atmosphere in a so-called christian home but it's a home that's called to be fruitful where the atmosphere is right for spiritual growth spiritual church it's built on spiritual families which is then built by spiritual leaders spiritual individuals that take charge and recognize the buck stops with me i tell my children all the time you don't understand one day daddy is going to answer for what goes on in this house one day daddy's going to answer it may make you mad right now it may make you upset right now you may not like this decision but that's okay because you're not going to answer to god for it i am fruitful individuals fruitful homes make fruitful churches we're not to be bearing our own fruits we're not to be living how we see fit people like to say things like well it's my life no it's actually not your life it's his life lent to you for his purpose and it is not your life that life was given to you by almighty god and he expects it surrendered back to him to be used according to how he sees fit we are not to be people conforming to the world and producing fruits of the world but living a life led of the spirit let of the spirit of god producing the fruits of the spirit in galatians we read there where it said the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering which means patience gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance which means self-control i doubt there's a person here that would raise their hand and say i've maxed them all out let me go ahead and tell you right now i can pick out several that i'm like struggle i ain't got much patience and if you pray for it that's just whoo you're asking for it and i don't mean patience all of us can grow all of us can see our harvest increased all of us can see a greater harvest and a greater yield the bible talks about some fell on good ground and yielded 30 and some 60 and some 100 fold we all could increase our harvest and grow more a life surrendered to christ will bear forth these fruits and not only will they let me tell you it is expected of you that it will god expects you to bring forth fruits this isn't an optional thing this isn't something we just chalk up the personality well she's a meek sister i'm not well my family just don't have patience god's not gonna listen to that excuse that day he's saying i expected you to bring forth my fruits i put you there as a testimony i put you there as a witness i put you there to show people what my spirit living through human flesh would do and what is your excuse for not manifesting those fruits we can't just chalk it up to personality too many times when we chalk it up our shortcomings to our fleshly nature and when surely this does play a role but that flesh although it will always war with you and although it will be a thorn in your side that flesh was never meant to control you that flesh is not meant to control you yes i'd realize it's unconverted and we'll deal with that as we go along but that unconverted converted flesh is meant for the spirit in you to grab a hold of and bring it into subjection and you are to rule over that flesh that flesh is not to rule over you it is not to be your crutch it is not to be your excuse well i just can't help it this flesh is unconverted then what good is the holy ghost what good is the holy ghost if every time we trip and fall we're just going to blame the flesh and we're going to blame the flesh and i'm just not strong enough i know you're not strong enough that's why he sent the holy spirit that's why you got to be born again that's why you got to have the token in this day and it will overcome your flesh galatians 5 24 and they that are christ have crucified the flesh [Music] a life with the holy ghost on the throne will have battles as much as the next man you as a holy ghost feel believer is going to have battles just like the ranked center down the street is that it's not going to make it to where you you are immune from having battles but the life of the holy ghost christian will bear out victory the life of a holy ghost a christian will walk after the spirit and not after the flesh and the fruits of the spirit will be evident it will be an evident thing sure all lives have seasons i recognize that you can't just live in harvest time where it's just constant and constant and constant brother joe preached wonderfully not too long ago on the mountains and the valleys and the experience and where sometimes you're in a growing season sometimes you're in a harvest season we all have mountains and we all have valleys and therefore we'll have times where the harvest is great and other times where maybe it's a struggle but even in the struggle you will overcome even in the struggle you will produce the the fruits of the spirit maybe not as much as at other times maybe you're in a struggle maybe you're in a valley but even when you're not in so-called fruit growing season you must make sure that the ground stays prepared you got to make sure that the ground stays tilled up and ready to receive seed because if the ground is hard and you let the thorns in and you let the other things in and the seed falls in then it gets choked out but you got to keep the ground tilled up you got to keep it soft and ready you got to keep the walls of your estate fortified you got to keep them built up because the walls is what kept the wild beast and the wild animals out from eating up the crops you got to keep the walls fortified and you got to live in the condition to produce fruits even if it's not fruit growing season so that when the word comes forth so that when the spirit does move you are ready to receive it you are ready to produce you are ready to have a harvest in that moment you got to live ready for your opportunity so many people the spirit moves and nothing happens and the spirit moves and nothing happens and why it happening white and it happened i thought i had something was the ground prepared was the ground tilled up were you looking to plant the garden that day or did it fall on stony ground did it fall on concrete ground because of the season of life that you were in to where your ground wasn't prepared your life has to be prepared to take that seed and nurture that seed and allow it to manifest exactly what god intended for it to do when he sent it by your way because when he sent it by your way he sent it by your way with an intended harvest that was the purpose of it he didn't do it it's not meant to just be scattered out so he can say well i did it he did that he sends it specifically by your way and he comes by evening like tabernacle service after service and the word goes forth and the seed goes forth and he's expecting a harvest to come forth from all the seed that has gone forth over the pulpit it's so time after time and the spirit moves and the atmosphere is right so if it's not producing a harvest then there's something wrong with the ground that's not to say that those who would live in these can this condition prepared for it overcoming filled with the holy ghost it's not to say that you're never going to have issues not to say we don't acknowledge the fact that the flesh isn't converted that's not to say that bringing forth good fruit won't be a struggle at times that you're never going to have an argument with your spouse or never have a bad day at work that you're never ever ever going to raise your voice at your children it's never going to happen it's not saying that it's not saying that that you're even that you won't ever do a single thing wrong brother brown's asked a question one time can a holy ghost feel believer be pushed to do small things i'm paraphrasing wrong and he said absolutely it says a matter of fact when you get the holy ghost now you're in a position for that attack to come now you're in the position for those things to be pushed upon you but then people stop right there he follows that up the next sentence he says is but greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world don't stop halfway and use it as your crutch for why you're sinning and why you can't stand and while you're failing what brother branham said these things would happen but he also said you'd overcome those things [Applause] you will do things wrong you will have hiccups and stumbles here and there because nature is hungry and it wants to consume you nature is hungry and it wants to consume you beast nature is your enemy you are not your friend this flesh is unconverted we acknowledge and it will be a thorn in your side as long as you were here and it will try to fill your life with thorns and thistles to choke out the fruits that the spirit is supposed to bring forth we know that originally adam and eve didn't have to deal with sin nature when they were first placed in the garden that's not something he ever ever had to deal with ever had to worry about but because of reasoning and because eve stepped out from behind her wall of protection which is the word then mankind and all of earth fell into the condition that we now see genesis 3 17 says and unto adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it curse it is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistle shall let bring forth to thee and thou shall eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and dust thou shalt return earth is cursed before this time adam had no trouble finding food adam never had to work a day in his life to grow food he didn't till by the sweat of his brow he didn't have any trouble bringing forth fruit as it were bringing forth fruit was an easy thing in eden nature was not adam's enemy it had not been at war with him in the eden condition adam was in total control brother branham would lay out so beautiful things other people don't even realize he said how do we know this because look at the second adam look at the way he would say peace be still look at the way he would command nature so we know that adam was in total control the weeds didn't try to take over the life of the fruit-bearing plant wasn't choked out by the life of the weeds adam operating from this place called called eden was told in genesis 1 28 to subdue the earth he was told to subdue the earth in other words eden was to stretch from sea to sea god said yes eden is in a wonderful condition yes this is a wonderful place but i'm commissioning you to expand eden i'm commissioned you to subdue the whole earth i want you to take more i want you to possess more i want you to make it all operate underneath your dominion not just eden but from sea to sea i want you to go and i want you to subdue the earth that was his commission but instead adam falls and now a constant struggle begins cursed is the ground thorns and thistles shall it bring forth dust thou art dost thou shalt return and it's not just the earth out there that we call the earth that is cursed it's not just going to be difficult to grow fruit out here in a garden but with the curse of nature and with the curse of earth now this earth is cursed now not only is this earth curse but now nature is against you so now not only is it going to be difficult to grow fruits and bring forth fruits out there but it's going to be impossible to continually bring forth fruits here because the ground is cursed it's going to be something you work at it's going to be something you toil as can be something you try to do but fail because it's all cursed nature is against you and now earth is calling for the very bodies that came forth out of it and it's calling for them to return to it earth is calling for it drawing it constantly pulling you back constantly pulling you down sitting this old age pulling at you drawing gravity to where as time sets in you begin to stoop you begin to go down you begin to be drawn back to the earth that you which you were drawn from because nature always has a desire to reclaim what has been taken from it stay with me a little bit here nature always has a desire to reclaim what it is that has been taken from it you came from the earth and so now the earth wants you back sin nature had a claim on mankind right there at the fall right there sin nature laid a claim and if something has a claim that means they want it sin nature laid a claim right here on man right here on this earth the earth became crowned in attributes of sin there was wickedness there was sickness there was death and dying and thorns and thickets became a symbol for the curse how could one bring forth fruits in that condition how can you overcome the world in that condition how can you overcome the curse walking around in cursed earth it was impossible brother branham say all was lost for adam's race he said there was no hope i'm so thankful that when he sent him out the garden he didn't just let him walk out the garden i'm so thankful that he couldn't take it brother branham said he couldn't stand to see him go he says and then when i see adam as it was standing there and heave the beautiful stature of her and while she's standing there these old bloody sheep skins and the blood running down her legs adam and his great fine stature of a man the blood of these sheepskins running down him and god standing there pronouncing death sorrow heartache and destruction watch then i can see eve put her lovely head over on adam's shoulder and him put his arm around her they started weeping turned around and started to walk out of his presence god depart from him he had sinned there's your judgment then when i can hear going down along that path through the garden of eden something like this brother branham claps what is it bloody sheepskins slapping on adam's leg as he goes down then i see all that great spaceless eternity conforming down like a funnel to four little letters l o v e he loved his children so much until he couldn't turn them away then i hear him say stop i'll put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed promising a redeemer god making preparations to redeem oh what a moment if i say there was one of the greatest moments in time that was one of the greatest moments in time because once he made that preparation it was as good as already done he was already making preparations to come as the lamb he was already the lamb slain before the foundation of the world now in time he promises it to his children i won't leave you in that condition i won't leave you without hope i won't leave you without a way back into eternity i won't leave you in this sin cursed world making preparations for a way back and there in that moment what god gave was a substitute there in the garden he took the life of an innocent lamb and it covered their nakedness and then the blood from that lamb covered their sin but that blood didn't have the power to bring cursed earth subject once again it didn't have that power to bring cursed earth subject it didn't have the power to subdue nature we see it at mount moriah genesis 22 and 11 and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou has not withheld thy son not only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son what is it it's a foreshadow of christ but it was still a woolly lamb the life of that ram could not come back upon abraham the life of that lamb couldn't come back on him and give him the power to overcome sin nature no matter how many rams were slain it would never give him the power to overcome sin nature it couldn't give man the power to subdue his own flesh so year after year man would have to give another sacrifice and he would sacrifice but he'd walk out with the same sin desire he'd walk out with the same nature only to fall again and fall again and fall again he would come back and he would once again get his sin covered but it couldn't do away with his sin he would go out with the same nature that he came in with go out with the same sins that he came in with i want you to notice there in the scripture the ram was caught in a thicket we're from the south most of us know what a thick it is but a thick it is briars thorns brambles and such it's a thicket and the ram is caught in the thicket by its horns what you're seeing there in that thicket is the curse from genesis 3 18. that is the curse and you're seeing it there and the curse has the ram held by his horns notice that the the thicket is upon the ram's head showing that sin's curse would be upon jesus's head but there's a major difference between the two i want you to notice that the ram in this situation is trapped the ram has no power over the thicket this woolly lamb doesn't have strength over the thicket even though he's a sacrifice in this situation the thorns and the thickets still have power over the woolly lamb it's the thorns that have the power the curse here represented by the thicket is shown to still be in control of humanity it's still in control but that lamb was only a substitute a substitute for what you say behold behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world he carries the sin away when those thorns are put on his head it doesn't trap him the tables have turned now he takes the curse he takes the thorns and he marches them up to calvary and he breaks in curse off of your life oh the thicket held around but the thorns couldn't hold jesus he took those up there and he took them to calvary he carried away the sins of the world [Applause] now it wasn't the lamb that's trapped by the power of sin and satan didn't know what he had done and all his mocking and crown of thorns not realizing symbolically what he was doing his great curse was being carried away the curse that had been put on humanity would be no more the tables have been completely turned this ram this lamb isn't trapped no no no no but now sin is trapped now sin is cursed now sin is defeated now sin can be overcome oh before you couldn't you couldn't come in under a woolly lamb and be set free only covered but now there's freedom for a child of god now there's victory now there's a new nature that can come into you [Music] this lamb took those thorns to calvary and crushed his sin's curse and now through his death his burial and his resurrection and then the return of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost now man has the power to subdue once again the nature that has been ruling over him so now nature no longer is going to rule over me they tried to live right they tried to do right they couldn't do it sin nature had control but now because of the baptism of the holy ghost now the nature that once ruled over me the nature that once ruled over you now i rule over the nature i rule over sins curse i am victorious i walk in victory i walk in freedom i overcome hallelujah [Applause] now there is a place on the inside of man that he can operate from in order to bring forth fruit [Applause] he couldn't bring it forth out of the cursed ground but now there's a place to bring forth fruit not since genesis 1 28 has man been in the position to subdue nature he says and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and now down through time back in that position once again so what happens when you're saved and you receive the spirit of god it takes a part of you back away from sin nature it had a claim on it and nature along with anybody or anything else don't like to let go of a claim but now you're filled with this spirit and so a part of this nature a lot of it is still cursed a lot of it is still sin nature but there's a part of me that he has reached down inside of and he's ripped that away and he's put himself in there and that sin nature has no right there that sin nature can't control that as a matter of fact from that place i now control it [Applause] it takes a part of you back from fallen nature and now your soul is ruled by the spirit a part of you is now beyond the control of the flesh and that part actually begins to rule over the flesh and when we're filled with the spirit we get in behind the wall of the word and we stay behind the wall of the word and behind that wall we are safe behind that wall nothing can hurt us behind that wall we produce fruits sin nature once again being ruled there was a time when sin nature would rise up brother joe and as tries you might you couldn't withstand it try as i might i couldn't withstand it i would say i'm not going to do those things i'm not going to look on evil i'm not going to go that way and sin nature would rise up no matter how hard i fought i would fall but now when it tries to rise up there's something within me that puts it down now when it puts sin in front of my face there's something within me that turns my head i don't have to fight it i don't have to try i don't go you know i shouldn't look at that no that was sin nature now something within me says no sir that right there is a gate to hell that right there is deceit that right there is a lie i'm not going that way now something rises up on the inside of me there's something that gives me power over sin nature when temptation comes in temptation will come how many times do we deal that with with young people and they feel so guilty because they've been tempted there's no guilt in temptation let the devil tempt let the devil tip let the devil chant i'm gonna keep walking i'm going to keep overcoming i'm going to keep being victorious he can scratch he can claw he can bark he can how you know why he's helen because we got the devil's answer oh there's something on the inside of me that overcomes temptation now let's balance that out don't build your house on the cliff and then blame the devil when it falls off don't be like them and i don't want to call him by stupid but all right them stupid people bless their hearts that built all their houses on the wrong side of the levian bozier parish because it hadn't flooded in a hundred years and like three years later the whole thing flooded and the whole thing's underwater and like we can't believe i'm like they built a levy there for a reason stupid i'm sorry i shouldn't be saying that but we did god puts things in your way and if you willingly go around them don't get mad at him or the devil when you fall devil didn't do it you did it matter of fact if you're constantly setting yourself up for temptation intentionally or accidentally i didn't know when i clicked on that site that down at the bottom of the page after i scrolled 72 times that i was going to find that yeah you did and those accidents are pretty no not a pretty good are in evidence that you don't have what you claim to have i don't take anything away from people and what they claim to have i don't de-christianize people but you buy your fruits young person i'm not saying put it off but you got some meetings coming up this weekend and you know if you're really where you need to be or not you have an opportunity tonight but i'm just talking do i know how young people think you're facing me in some powerful meetings this weekend you're gonna have every opportunity to make it right don't go there and act like you're okay go there and get real go there and pour you listen look i'm i'm not a current events preacher but let me tell you what current events are pretty um important right now it is evident where we're at we're not in the end times church we're at the end of the end times we're at the moment of crossing over we're at the blending of time and eternity we are there it is not it is time to make your calling and election sure it is time to make sure you're overcoming if you're walking around saying i got it i got it i got it but your attitude's distorted your appetite's distorted you argue with mom and dad all the time you can't get along with nobody you're meaner than a bud saw you're rude to everybody you ain't got [Applause] all it but i ain't gonna leave you there you can have it it's for you it's there for you listen let me tell you something and i know i'm speaking to young people right now but i find it very important to tell young people this so many times we preach the token the token the token and we should and you got to have it and we preach the baptism of the holy ghost of baptism on the hugos and we should you got to have it make sure you understand where i stand on that but i want to tell you that i appreciate how far you've come if you're at justification hey i'm proud that you're at justification but i'm telling you tonight take another step you know if you've been sanctified i'm proud you made it that far but i'm telling you not you got to take another step i'm proud that you're in this fight it's the greatest fight that's ever been you're facing things i never had to face so i'm not putting you down i'm telling you you can make it i'm not taking away what you got i'm telling you there's more i'm not telling you what you've done it and amazed i'm telling you you can have it all you can have overcoming power you can live victorious it doesn't have to be a struggle you can have it all take it claim it live it rapture hallelujah what a power whereas before you couldn't now you can whereas before you would fall now you stand there's something in you that's doing it a place within you has returned to a condition of power an eden on the inside of cursed earth but now the reality of it the cursed earth all around that eden wants to take it over the cursed earth wants to subdue it the cursed earth wants you to back off what you've claimed the cursed earth wants you to give back over to the desires of the flesh but just like adam was told i'm telling you don't give in expand your dominion take more of your dominion claim more of the promises walk more in victory than you ever have before overcome the world you can expand your dominion tonight you can walk in victory and bring forth fruit colossians 1 10 says that you might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long suffering with joyfulness brother brown says and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness gentleness patience meekness temperance fruits of the spirit god knows today that what the holiness people need and also the calvinist all of them needs today is more fruit of the spirit more lives to prove it we've had many testimonies but as the old saying is your life speaks so loud i can't hear your voice we are written epistles of god read of all men so here we are the people of god called and chosen to be fruitful and i'm believing saved sanctified justified let's get them in order justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost i want to believe that for everyone in this building and here we are and yet even in that condition you can go through dry times you can go through times where you let your guard down a little bit we find ourselves in a situation when we do those things like brother branham was speaking to those at the very beginning god bless you in the balcony as somebody up in the balcony would say brother brown them i once had the victory i once was a godly person but somehow weeds and thorns and things have choked me down now listen let's keep it in line with what we've been preaching i'm not talking about going back into the world i'm not talking about sinning okay i'm not talking about living a life of sin i'm talking about someone who finds that they don't have the victory quite like they once had i'm talking about that somebody who finds that their joy just isn't quite as full as it once was maybe little things are nagging at your life something is choking down the harvest so you just aren't bringing forth a harvest like you know the word says you can 30-fold 60-fold 100-fold it doesn't take sinful things to rob you remember that as a matter of fact the the scripture very specifically says that the seeds were choked out by the cares of life it doesn't take sinful things to rob you of the harvest that god wants you to have of the fruits that he wants you to bear but regardless of why regardless of the reason if you find yourself in this place where you just aren't progressing forward i want to ask you a question how up-to-date is your experience when is the last time that you actually took another step with god notice i'm not saying you backed up but when's the last time you took another step that you progressed farther listen brother tim did an amazing job on sunday dealing with how our experiences are not just a one-and-done that we go from glory to glory that we have refillings and that experience is built upon experiences and and that you must keep moving and that you must experience more of god that you don't serve god on a memory we don't serve god on what happened last service was amazing but what about tonight last year's oklahoma camp was amazing but what about this one coming up god what about right now if you have come into dry places in your life what i'm offering you tonight is a fresh drink because the holy ghost is a gusher and it's welling up and it's there for you you just gotta stop you just gotta take time and you gotta take another drink and don't let a day go by that you don't take a drink don't let a day go by that you don't stop and fellowship with the holy spirit on the inside of you because that keeps you fresh that keeps you annoying and it keeps you full of power it gives you the ability to overcome the way that you need to overcome our experiences with god are not a one-time thing he calls you to many different levels he calls you to more of himself so tonight i'm telling you press forward take another step now listen i know some of you are thinking but i thought once you're filled with yes once you're filled with the holy ghost and you have that experience the upper room experience like they did in the book of acts you are sealed unto the day of redemption but we got many here that are seeking for just that and i'm telling you many times they come up and they realize they don't have it and so the devil will point to the last thing that happened to him and says that wasn't nothing no sir if you had a real experience as a real experience build on it build on that experience don't throw that experience away you recognize you need more drive another stake down tonight and if you need more sunday drive another state town and drive another state down until you get what it is you're seeking for but don't throw away the things god has done for you don't let the devil belittle what happened to you last time you came down for prayer oh you didn't get nothing he's just telling you that because he's scared of what you got and he's scared of what you're gonna get don't let him rob you of what god has done for you already seek for more walk to another milestone because listen if you're always walking forward you will never point backward to what you were as being something greater than what you are the only time if you're always walking with god the only time you'll ever point back is say i used to be that but god has brought me here the devil used to have me but he don't have me no more the devil held me bondage but now i'm free you'll never go i used to be in a better place because if that's the case you are backslidden but if you're walking with god and you're feeding on the word anytime you will never point backwards to something that was greater than what you have right now if god did something wonderful for you don't stop right there feed it feed what god did for you grow from it get more tomorrow seek more tomorrow how many times have i seen mighty deliverances i can think specifically of one where me and brother tim were praying for a sister at youth camp i can think of several with me and brother joe mighty deliverances or the holy spirit falling upon somebody or seeing discernment directly deal with a person's life in ways that would blow your mind and within months or a year or a few years or whatever it is they're right back in the condition they were before that experience oh brother aaron that must not have been a real experience no no it was very real it was a very real experience but the problem was they thought that was the end when it was the beginning they thought i've arrived when they were just starting their journey and there was no hunger to feed it and make it grow there was no hunger to progress into it there must be a hunger for more one of the greatest signs i know of of a solid experience is an intense desire for more of what you got brother branham would say now i'll give you my estimation of what i think that the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a christian than anything i know of you know what it is it's travail of soul a person that's always so hungering and thirsting for god they just simply day and night they just can't stand it they've got to do something for god there is a hunger there is a burning desire for more i gotta have more of it because if you don't have a desire for more of it i wonder if you ever tasted it because once you taste it you're going to want more of it you can't stop getting more of it when you have an experience with god moving deeper into this when you reclaim a portion of that fallen nature and you begin to subdue it that's when the battle begins because nature always tries to take back what it is that it lost listen a person with the holy ghost isn't going to go out and commit adultery a person with the holy ghost won't go seek out pornography they won't go out and willfully sin but don't think there ain't going to be traps for you don't think there's not going to be attacks on you don't think that there's not going to be your weak spot weak spots that are probed at don't think that temptations aren't going to come at you stronger than ever this is why you must have an up-to-date and fresh experience because you have to have the strength to push through those things when those things come at you that's why you have to keep subduing and keep pushing and keep expanding your territory and growing larger and pushing the borders back and pushing the evil back why would i want to live inside this little circle of freedom where i can't take a step that way and i can't take a step that way because that's all the freedom i got no but i want to take the sword and i want to expand my borders this way and expand my borders that way and expand them in every direction so i can have freedom so i can live in a godly atmosphere you got to keep pushing keep progressing keep subduing because the minute you sit down the minute you relax the moment you take a break gardeners gardeners will know what i'm talking about weeds thorns thistles and the hunger of nature begins to creep in what do you mean by the hunger of nature brother aaron what do you mean that nature always tries to reclaim what is taken from it do you have those pictures from me i just thought i'd bring a visual aid tonight it's an escalator inside of a mall we're used to there was life used to there was people used to it had a purpose there was people coming there was people going you would have walked in that you to never envision this but nature is always hungering to reclaim what was taken from it it's always looking for an opportunity next one somebody used to live here there was life there was a family there was thanksgivings there was christmases maybe grandbaby's feet ran across the floor for the first time now it's reclaimed nature came in the moment that it quit being taken care of next one an entire village in china that was abandoned reclaimed you can go the next one another picture of that same village you can clear a spot in the woods you can cut down all the trees you can clear you a nice yard there you can build a home you can plant a nice garden and that place can be so full of life but you got to stay on top of it because nature is gonna try to creep back in this weed pops up and you deal with it and this thorn pops up and you deal with it and you run over here and you cut this one down you run over here and you cut this one down you spray the whole yard with roundup and you think i got it but two weeks later you can have wonderful grass planted but try to go one year without fertilizing it have a great experience but go a long time without fertilizing it with the word fertilizing that experience with faith and all sudden there's weeds trying to creep back in nature trying to take back what it was that was stole from it the weed pops up and you deal with it tries to grow and you cut it down but you stop taking care of it for one minute stop tending to it for one little bit stop caring for it the way you should stop subduing nature the way you did when you first got it stop praying as much as you used to stop reading your bible as much as you used to stop playing sermons as much as you used to and soon weeds begin to move in amongst your grass stop working the garden the way you use tooth and keeping the weeds out the way you used to and soon your harvest won't be what it used to be the harvest won't be what you're expecting the weeds and the thorns will take over because they will never stop trying they will never stop pushing they will never stop trying to crowd you in but i'm telling you that's okay because a holy ghost-filled christian is never going to stop pushing back never going to stop feeding never going to stop fighting never going to stop overcoming we can't stop there's something on the inside of us that won't let us stop some days i'm tired some days i want to lay it down but i can't lay it down i can't quit there's a deep calling to the deep keep fighting keep pushing expand and subdue you got to stay on top of it because the weeds choke out life by robbing the nutrients that were meant for the crops by getting you tangled all up in complexes they choke out your joy they choke out your victory you gotta chop the weeds back you gotta have the attitude of i will subdue more look i've got this parcel but i want more joy so i'm going to take it i've got this parcel but i want more peace so i'm going to take it i need victory over this thing that keeps hindering my life so i'm going to go out and i'm going to take it because now i have the power to subdue i don't have to live with my problems i don't have to live with these complexes i don't have to live with fear i don't have to live with these things because i've been given the power to subdue those things i'm called to be a fruitful christian so now i'm going to subdue pride i'm going to subdue selfishness i'm going to subdue the things that keep me out of the house of god i'm going to subdue those things i'm going to subdue my anger i'm going to subdue my temper because i'm called to be a fruitful christian and yet nature hungers and flesh hungers but the spirit on the inside also hungers and as long as that's what you feed it will be victorious the spirit man will continually subdue the flesh man that's why experiences once again must be up to date and they cannot be stagnant because when it's stagnant that's when weeds grow when it's stagnant that's when thorns grow listen you can't feed natural man all the time and then wonder where your spiritual harvest is you sprinkle in these movies and sprinkle in this and sprinkle in a little bit of that and then you go where'd the weeds come from you planted them you literally took a handful from the evil sower and went i'll take a little bit of that and you threw it in your own garden and you wonder where'd it come from we're gonna do our best to bring this down maybe you've been noticing that the harvest hasn't been as plenty maybe the joy isn't there like it once was the self-control the patience the kindness it's time to start examining your patch of ground have you been tending your life the way you used to when you first fell in love with jesus checking it up all the time that joy was there and you were checking to make sure am i doing everything right i'm not doing everything sometimes we look at that and go yeah that's the sign of an immature christian that's the sound of somebody that's deeply in love and they want to please the father am i doing everything right is it lining up with the word is this how i'm supposed to be are you checking up are you watching vigilantly over the fruit making sure no weeds are coming into your rose making sure that there's nothing there robbing the life from your harvest it's time to start searching for the cause of your harvest being down it's like them big green horn tomato worms you go out there and all of a sudden your plants eat up you don't go bad luck better luck next time i know you find the worm you search for it you look for it then you find it then you kill it you don't pick it up and go oh cute little worm it probably won't hurt this plant let me move it over here that's how we all was to oh my temper got me again let me just move it to next week maybe it won't hurt me next week yeah it will it'll eat that plant it'll eat the joy there it'll eat the harvest there and it'll keep robbing and keep robbing and keep robbing until you find that thing go yep there he is there's the problem boom squashing problem dealt with problem solved now i can walk in victory now i can have joy because my plan ain't getting heating up my harvest isn't getting eaten up because i dealt with the problem we got to start dealing with the issues there's something robbing you of your harvest why do i not yield fruit like i should what is it that we found that chokes the life out of it thorns thistles cursed earth which is your flesh brother brown says what we needs in old fashion scoring out digging out get those weeds out the patch so the corn can grow jesus is coming all right that's what we need back to the old hewing line again back to the way god will come among us sometimes we have to go through terrible chastisement chastening of the lord many things to correct us that we'll be fruit bearing christians sometimes he has to prune us cut off take away take out of our hands we think sometimes oh god what are you doing to us but he knows what he's doing so we pray father that today you will prune every one of us from the least to the greatest to the least to the greatest pastor god we pray that you'll prune every one of us take away all that's unlike you father take away the thing that's hindering us from being fruit bearing christians god does not look kindly on things that are supposed to bear fruit but don't how do you know well if you could i'd say ask the fig tree it says and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing their own but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforth forever and presently the fig tree rivered away why because he expected fruit he's expecting fruit don't get caught with the master coming by and finding the field overgrown don't get caught with the master coming by and finding the wall torn down seeing that nature has taken the fruit away back to our opening scripture proverbs 24 31 and actually what's happening here is solomon is out for a walk that man didn't know the king was going to come by his place that day he didn't know the king was walking down the road and lo it was all grown over verse 31 with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and received instruction listen as solomon strolls by like i said that man had no idea that that day was his day of visitation you don't know when the king's coming but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night mark 13 33 take ye heed watch and pray for you know not when the time is but when the king comes by all he finds are symptoms of the curse thistles thorns things i died to give them power over i gave my life so i wouldn't find this i gave my life and sent back my holy spirit that they would bear fruit that they would be protected behind the word that they would stand there and have a shield that they would put on the breastplate of righteousness i gave them armor i gave them things to keep this from happening he finds fallen nature reclaiming a field he finds the wall of protection broken down even if the field had been growing a crop the wild beast would have divided it all because the wall had been left unattended too and solomon makes the statement i received instruction and what he means right there is i knew all i needed to know about that person's life i looked at it he said and i received instruction and then he goes on to say how and i'm paraphrasing put that scripture up for me so i don't have to paraphrase it then i saw and considered it well and looked upon it and received instruction next yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep in other words you didn't deal with things you just laid around you laid in bed you didn't deal with it yeah that that wall needs to be built back up yeah i need to go get some of those weeds out it's right but you know what a little sleep next so thy poverty come as one that travaileth and i won't as an armed man you're gonna be found without a harvest you're gonna be found wanting and it's coming upon you quickly because you didn't deal with things how's your harvest evening like tabernacle is your life yielding the fruits of the spirit if the king walks by today how will he find your wall of defense how will he find the harvest i say it's in time it's time that we go inspect our rows i say that it's time that we go inspect our field to make sure there ain't no creepers coming in and choking out the life it's time to take the sword of the word and cut back the weeds and cut back the thorns and cut back the pixels and i say it's not too late to do so it's time to subdue the land that you once had i'm not saying you've given it all back but what i'm saying is you woke up one day and realized something's creeped in here something's crept in there i don't have as much joy as i used to have and i don't want the king to find my field in this condition i don't want the king to see my wall in this condition i want to do something about it's not too late but now is the time now is the time to do it now is the time to drive the enemy from the field proverbs 25 and 28 says he that hath no rule over his own spirit we're just bringing this now it ends with the wall and the fruits of the spirit because what this is speaking of is temperance self-control he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls when the walls are broken down all that is good goes out and all that is evil breaks in now is at the time now is the moment to inspect your walls inspect the walls make sure they're strong brother aaron a couple weeks ago you preached don't tear down the wall that was different that was man-made walls i'm talking about the walls that god has given you providing you protection in this day inspect the walls a wall that is functioning according to its purpose will completely surround the area it is intended to protect and it will establish the boundaries of separation that fallen nature is out there but on this side of the wall on this side of the wall is an eden condition i'm keeping cursed nature out i'm keeping the power of the flesh out but from here i rule my flesh but from here i'm in control right here i have the power to operate and i'm keeping the wall built up because i'm not going out and i'm not letting it come in the wall of protection in behind that wall you can have your harvest how is the wall tonight around your soul how is the wall that you've built around your children how is the wall around your home tonight i say let's build it back tonight i say we start tonight building it back and when you go to do it the devil's not going to make it easy on you he's going to bring all kind of condemnation and things and tell you what you're doing is is futile and it's not going to work because anytime you begin to look and take an honest inventory and an honest assessment of where you are it will always stir up the devil anytime you begin to truly look inward and take an assessment and see where am i at the devil doesn't like that the devil doesn't like you to take honest assessment he wants you to be comfortable right where you are he doesn't want you to rebuild the wall or push back the weeds because that hole in the wall is his access to your victory so he doesn't want it fixed and we're going to close here with nehemiah because nehemiah goes back to build back the wall around jerusalem he weeps when he finds out that it's torn down because there's no defense and the people are easy praise nehemiah 2 19 and we're going to read some of this but when san bala the knight and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn notice none of these were israelites they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that you do will you rebel against the king then answered out them and said unto them the god of heaven he will prosper us and therefore we his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorial in jerusalem notice the mocking and the jeering and they try to mock your progress what are you really trying to do evening like tabernacle do you really think that stone you just put up on top of that other stone's gonna provide you any protection they act as if it's all nothing has actually ever happened to you it's all in your imagination but all the while what it is is they see a wall going up oh they're telling you oh that's not doing nothing oh that's not doing nothing but all the time they're seeing stone upon stone and stone next to stone and stone next to stone and so they're trying to get you to stop because they are seeing what it is you're accomplishing and they know it will keep them out of course the devil's going to try to talk you out of building up your wall tonight that's what's going to keep him out of your victory i love how he tells them he will prosper us therefore we his servants will rise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorial in jerusalem he says this is going to keep you out and that's how it should be because you don't even belong here satan you don't belong in here this was ripped away from you this was cursed earth but now it's eating on the inside of me it's a place i operate from in power you can't come in here you have no memorial here you have no right here this was stripped from you that day on calvary oh the beast don't like to see the garden wall repaired they don't like to see it because they're used to robbing that but that's not their portion that's for you that's yours that's your inheritance that's your harvest of course they don't like it wall them out young people when you start building up that was because you hadn't done nothing you really didn't get anything look at all the rest of that wall that's torn down look at all that listen every victory matters every experience matters they were real the devil just hates to see stones going up he hates to see stones going out chapter four verse one but it came to pass that when sam balot heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria and said what do these feeble jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned now to buy the ammonite was by him and he said even that that they built if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall you think that's going to keep an army out if a fox runs into that it's going to knock it over and he's mocking you the whole time trying to get you to see it through that testimony because in the reality of it they know they're closing us out i've had free access to that harvest for years i've been taking that away from shamgar for years i've been robbing him for years but now he's building a wall he's building a wall and now i'm going to be locked out i'm going to be kept out i will not be able to rob his victory anymore verse seven but it came to pass that when sand ballad and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the astrodites heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very roth and conspiring all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem and hinder it even like tabernacle they're gathering their forth as the fight against you nevertheless we made our prayer unto god and we set a watch against them day and night because of them and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall and our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst of them and slay them and cause the work to cease and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places which you shall return unto us they will be upon you they're about to be upon you evening like tabernacle as you're trying to rebuild the wall what are we going to do what are we going to do about it are we going to quit building the wall are we going to give up on the harvest we're called to be fruit bearers we've got to protect the harvest what is it we're going to do therefore said i in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places i even set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bows and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren fight for your sons fight for your daughters fight for your wives fight for your houses even like tabernacles fight for one another fight for your children pull your sword get on the wall fight for me i'll fight for you fight for your wives fight for your friends fight fight fight press the battle subdue it so do it it's yours you are called to be fruitful fight you're called to be fruitful hallelujah the wall will be built the enemy will be kept out of the harvest i will have my joy i will have my peace i will have my patience i will have all that i'm called to have and i will build a wall around my family and they will have it too blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah i say fight like never before fight like never before you can stay on your feet musicians come don't let your fruits be robbed any longer what is the fruit of the spirit joy long suffering meekness love patience kindness gentleness and faith brother branham says does that accompany your life don't be deceived we're at the end of the road friends this might be the last time you get a chance to check up better do it he says god expects fruits don't give up so there's a big green tomato worm somewhere in there don't let him have it find it deal with it subdue it for the first time there's a people on the earth with the power to subdue god bless you church [Applause] for many years [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] is oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] for whatever we find on earth [Music]
