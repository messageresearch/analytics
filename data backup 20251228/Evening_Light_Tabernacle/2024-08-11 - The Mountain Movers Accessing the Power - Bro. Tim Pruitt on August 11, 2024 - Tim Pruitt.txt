theophany is a spirit body it's a word body we know that's what God revealed himself to Abraham in was a body that he made stepped down here from theophonic right into flesh and the same thing when we leave from here we step into theophany into a spirit body amen it's really a manifestation of God because it's God in manifestation and we'll be Sons and Daughters of God in manifestation we're looking forward to that time really I am I you know I I um was even speaking with brother Ron Spencer today and who sends his greetings and his love and he ministering today but um he just said good morning said this is another morning that another Sunday morning that we have before the Rapture in joy I said well I'd rather this be the day that the saints come amen rather than just another Sunday morning to enjoy it would be a great day that the dead in Christ rise they will come in that theophonic form and they will meet with the body and resurrected and glorify and then we who are alive and remain amen that wordy image of us that theophany will come to us and we will be changed and glorified in a moment in the twinkle of an eye you say why why do you believe that well the Bible said that you already have an eternal house a body made in heaven amen it's already prepared for you it'll step right from God's thoughts right to you and you'll be changed in the moment and twinkling of an eye what a promise that is to us we hold that really dear today amen if you got a need in your life today why don't you just make it known by the uplifted hand understand there's sickness out different ones um are out because of it the Joel and Trish Pro it their children are sick I think Brother David Dexter has some sick ones at home and others like that that's got needs you just hold your requests before the Lord he's a God that discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart amen he'll reveal himself to you in a special way today let's look for him let's talk to him a moment Lord Jesus as we bow before you today you are the almighty God and we are your children gathered in your name and you said when We Gather like that you would you would be gathered with us Lord your presence of your Holy Spirit would be real said I'll be there in your midst thank you Lord and we are thanking you father that you are here today in this building in this place Lord and you are to I know will manifest yourself through the word as you speak through a gift of God an oracle of God to minister to souls and I I just pray God that you'll Lift us up out of our the confusion of this age and the trouble of this world and Lord the this the sound of the crowd and just let the Holy Spirit reign supreme today I pray Lord for our young people as they're in their final service there that you will bless them in the the camp meeting father may this be a wonderful Crescendo of your presence and Lord I pray that you'd give them traveling mercies on the way home and bring them back to a safe all our loved ones Lord father as We Gather here now in your name there have been many that raised their hands and they said I I need you Lord then we hear little children that are sick with whatever cold flu whatever it is I don't know but God you know and you're the Healer and I pray Lord you'll minister to them in a very special way Lord God bring healing to your people those that raised the hand toward you that you'll Minister them now we are asking in Jesus name speak to us Lord now father I stand here is a just a vessel that you have filled with your spirit and I'm to speak as an oracle of God and I cannot do that unless you speak through me an oracle is one that you step in and speak through now father Jesus today we press past all our feelings of our flesh our emotions of our spirit we presspass all the hindrances and we just enter into the realm of the Holy Spirit now Lord laying before me as fragments of thoughts and things that I've jotted down as we feel to go a certain direction today but Lord I pray that you would now anoint it and take those fragments Lord that would be just scattered thoughts and put it together as a concise message Lord that you would form the words I I remember in the scripture that you said when we stand before men that we were not to even think about what we were going to say or how we were going to say it but it would be the Holy Spirit speaking through us but Lord we have fed ourselves on the word we have taken on the things of of the word we've we prepared for this moment Lord just filling ourselves up with all kinds of good things now father I just pray that you would direct it now and it would be your message that you would step in now and use the gift that's in my life as I surrender to you in Jesus name amen amen God bless you thank amen isn't it good to be together amen certainly Grand to be a Christian and have this privilege of serving the lord together this morning and uh you know we are a little bit smaller in number but we're here Jesus is here amen I started out preaching to 12 so you know you're a few more than 12 this morning and um so you know we uh we we know what it is to speak to small crowds middle middle-sized crowds big crowds doesn't matter what it is it's all the same it's God's people and it's our responsibility to be here now we just want to just enter in with all that we have today and surrender ourselves to the Lord and and um look into him John 14:12 for our scripture reading this morning John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that I will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and if you ask anything in my name I will do it amen God bless you you can be seated today we're going to be speaking on the mountain movers the accessing the power and I've just been feeling in the the last few days knowing that we're here in and and fulfilling end time prophecy to and knowing that we must have um a Rapture in faith in this day of a faith that will be elevated to believe God's promise for the impossible and so knowing all of that is um uh laying before us I'm just been speaking here about faith and brother Timothy is coming back right behind me and or I'm right ahead of him or he's behind him somehow together we're working in sync together as he's been speaking on faith as well and so we're going today speak about accessing the power now as we're looking at this we see in our scripture reading that Jesus is telling his disciples that he is leaving and he's leaving this world's Dimension and he's going back to to God he's leaving the human form and he's actually going to go back into the God form again and it's not that he wasn't God but he it was God but it was God now working and dwelling in a human vessel as Jesus said it's not me that doeth the works but it's my father that dwelleth in me that doeth the works so again uh again we we have these words of Jesus telling them I'm going to go away and that True Believers will continue his works and they will also even do more than that but do Greater Works and and using the authority that Jesus will give them by acting in his name that the believer will act ask and he by asking will do God will do his Works through them they will work the work of God because the spirit of God will dwell in them now Jesus was God manifested In the Flesh amen now of course he was he was human for the sake of Dying God made a body for himself to dwell in but he was God Amen he was more than a man and so the the Holy Spirit uh overshadowed a virgin and and then that blood cell wrapped himself uh the spirit of God wrapped himself around a blood cell and and and of course the the blood cell of our Lord Jesus then would Veil the life of Jehovah the man Christ Jesus his body would become the temple or the dwelling place of Almighty God now difference between you and me and him is is because he he was the fullness of God in the body and we have a portion of God the Holy Spirit within us but remember even a portion of God is omnipotent so in there is is all power and together together we make up the body of Christ now in the beginning was the word or it was the logo cross the eternal spirit and and he made himself flesh if you go back to uh John's writing of the beginning and you know he doesn't do it like in the Book of Genesis in the beginning God created a Heavens Earth no he starts way back before that and said in the beginning was the word and so he goes Way Beyond you know just a creation of the world to where it was the logos the word and then that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now so you see everything in other words that God was in the pillar of fire he emptied into the son Jesus Christ and in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily you see God said that God himself Jehovah the mighty one the buckler Jehovah jyra Jehovah Rafa all of his descriptive names of himself El shedi all of his Redemptive names everything that he was he emptied into Jesus Christ for the fullness of God dwelt in him and God in other words he made himself little coming down and got into a teeny blood cell and then begin to build something around him so God through his condescension from God to man he did this in order to have many sons he would come and condescend himself and WRA himself in a blood cell God would become a human and doing so God would father a body in other words he would he would actually through creation make a body for him to dwell in and thus become a son and that through the creation of a germ life in the womb of Mary and in her you know the cells would multiply around that from the food that she ate and flesh made of the earth wrapped itself around the blood cell of life and remember he does this for the purpose of DME because and for paying for the price of sin because as God the Eternal Spirit he cannot die so he takes on a body that he can give it up to death now we know The Germ of Life comes from the male and when God condescended and overshadowed Mary he created a blood cell to wrap around that life then at Calvary when the spear pierced his side and his life's blood was poured out he brought forth from him the elements that he would need to make a bride now this was foreshadowed many many many years ago before you know that's prophesied in Adam when God put Adam to sleep and from Adam side he took a rib and from that he made a woman so God did the same thing at Calvary with the second Adam you see as Jesus went to sleep in death that from his body came the elements to make up a bride so there were three things that came for from him at Calvary and that was water blood and spirit in John 19:34 the Bible said that when one of the so Soldiers with a spar um pierced his side forth with came out blood and water then in Luke chap 23:46 he said and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I Comm in my spirit and thus he gave up the ghost so there were three things that came forth from from him which was water and blood and spirit these are the elements that make up the new birth are the elements that make up a bride and God did this just as he did in Eden when he put Adam to sleep took forth from him elements to make himself a bride he did the same thing at Calvary and and he took from Christ from the body of Christ the elements to make for his wife the bride of Christ and in doing so you see he rebirthed us who was born in sin now stop a minute I want you to get something nobody nobody was ever born again before Pentecost amen nobody was ever born again before Pentecost now the doctrine was being preached Jesus said to Nicodemus you must be born again but there could not be a new birth until the elements came forth from him to bring forth a new birth so there was no new birth under the Old Testament it's only in the New Testament that you have a a new birth and that could only come after Jesus death burial Resurrection Ascension and coming again by the spirit on the day of Pentecost so he rebirthed us who was born in sin thus we were lost and alienated from God and he brought us through the blood of Jesus that thus we are cleans from all sins and this re this brings us back to relationship to God and God's original intent and his original intent was that he would have sons that he could fellowship with sons and daughters of God and in giving up his life he destroyed sin and he brought us into the family of God now not by adopting the devil's children not by taking the devil's children and make them one of his and cleaning them up and say okay I'll take the Devil's Child and make a one one of mine no sir he didn't do that he brought us into the family by birthing us as Sons anden by putting part of his life or his holy spirit in us and now our body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen for God's spirit dwells in US isn't that marvelous What A Plan of Redemption that God had that God the Bible said you know that he would condescend and he would he would put off his Robes of godship to become a man in order for the for the purpose of redemption so didn't Jesus say in and that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you you see you see the Church of the Living God then is the anointed body of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're walking here upon the Earth given a hope to the world that blessed hope that that nothing else can give is the hope of eternal life amen and the proof of his love is that his Spirit Bears witness with our spirit that we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen now there at Calvary when he was pierced with a spear it released the from the blood cell the spirit of God and released in the Holy Ghost and washing Us by the water of the word you know out that came came from from him it brought us into himself by the holy spirit's baptism and now we are sons of God Amen we are part of God deity lives within every Spirit-filled child of God Amen every man or woman that's born in the spirit of God is a part of God Amen and no wonder then we can believe in the Supernatural no wonder we can believe for anything that nothing is impossible why is it because in US is a portion of God that is wrapped up within this moral body a body that came because cuses sin through sexual birth but birth down on the inside amen within the soul by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost is a work of God Alone through the power of regeneration by the shedding of the blood of Jesus that makes you and I Sons and Daughters of God and deity manifested In the Flesh no wonder Jesus said then these signs shall follow them that believe they can believe for the impossible Amen in my name they shall cast out Devils they will have dominion over the spirit realm amen and they you know if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover they have the right to impart uh impart life amen through the power of the Holy Ghost what is it you know we because we have become a part of Christ and any man that is born of Jesus that believes in him that believes the word you have to be a part of God Amen you're an offspring of God you're a Son of God a daughter of God you you can't do nothing else but believe it's impossible for you to still be a an unbeliever you something that on the inside of you from that new birth causes you to believe God's word and when there's something about God he cannot deny himself that scripture amen and if God's on the end you inside of you you cannot deny the word amen so as Sons and Daughters of God we're join I with him in the in the Kingdom believe in everything that the father says to be the truth amen now unless you're born of the spirit how can you believe when there's nothing to believe with you you have just a carnal mind with a mental conception therefore you can't believe and that's the reason that many don't believe today in Divine Healing you know I was just I was just on um the other day and and was uh was looking for a certain thing and came across in in my study there about the different denominations that take the position of why they don't believe in Divine Healing For example the Baptist say that they it was only for for the apostles that that was for just to establish the gospel and after the gospel is established um is not for us anymore so you see you see they make every excuse to deny it because they've never walked into that bloodstream to The Fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ and and truly been birthed by his Spirit you said well they they believe yes I I met a man the other day you know when um a young man that well I I call him young but he's um probably starting toward middle age now but never the less a few years ago he was a part of our youth group and then left and went out into the world and I met him the other day and he said brother Tim I believe every word in the Bible I believe in Jesus and I'm looking at him and I'm I'm one to believe that he believes I really am and it's not because he's not going to my church but because I see the fruit of sin of smoking and drinking and and drugs and you know a life and yet he's he's telling me but I believe but I believe in other words I can accept that as being true you know it's a mental conception but a real Faith bursts you into the kingdom of God as a Son of God and then it produces the works of God Amen now so you know again again I I didn't try to take from him what he had I just tried to add to what he had you know I tried to encourage him to to move in the right direction I didn't even try to take away the belief he had and man I just try to get him to build on it you know but you see again when you receive the Holy Ghost you you have God's attributes you have his characteristics and characteristics of God his character you can't help but believe in the Supernatural you can't you can't help but believe that all things are possible as an offspring of God then my soul is in God's likeness if I'm born again I'm in the image of God and in the image of God We Believe the supernatural now I know you're look at this body it's not the image of God it it's a fallen image but on the inside of the inside amen there is one that is born in the image of God that can believe God's word for anything that he says amen his love is within us we believe all things hope all things a man truly born again you talk about to him about divine healing sure he believes it you believe in miracles sure why because he's a part of God Amen if he makes excuses and says well it's not the season for miracles well that was only for the apostles or that was only for 40 or 50 years ago in in a certain a certain dispensation and you know he's not of God that's right amen he that is of god Hearth God's word believes on it and acts on it yeah Amen Let allow me to quote from God perfecting his church brother Bram said that blood cell The Germ of Life Of God himself wrapped in this blood cell that brought forth the son Christ Jesus now what he did or does by that to make you perfect and to bring you back into Fellowship he brings you to the blood cell and to himself you get it through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus that unveiled the life of Jehovah and we come into the blood cell becomes a part of that life so deity itself lays in the man that has received the Holy Ghost yeah Holy Spirit you're a son I'm a brandom by birth a part of Mr Mrs brandom is in me and if you become a son or daughter of God part of deity lays in you see how the devil robs you say oh you can't do this all things are possible to them that believe no matter what it is you're a part of deity a son or daughter not a servant a son or daughter so you know this is not different from what the word says amen the word says this about us that now we are the sons of God again in Acts 17 verse 28 he says for in him we live and move and have our being for we are also his offspring amen so you know Paul had quoted even from a poet who had said that but he said this is the fact that in him we live and we move and we have our being for we are also his offspring amen so now again this is the word of God and and then he says in 1 Corinthians 6:17 that he that is joined or made relation to the Lord becomes one spirit with him so if you are joined to the Lord you are one spirit with him amen again 1 Corinthians 619 says your body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit within you whom you have from God you are not your own so you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen your body is God's Dwelling Place thanks be to God Amen and the Bible says about that one that lives in you in 1 John 4 and4 he who is in you is greater than he that is in the world Amen and we are Overcomers and conquerors like Jesus for he says in Romans 8:37 in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so he that is Born Again is a conqueror an overcomer amen he is a vessel whom God dwells in and greater is he that is in him than that he that is in the world and then he says in galatian 3:26 for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith and then he says in Romans 8:17 and if children then HS HS of God and fellow HS with Christ am a't that amazing these are wonderful scriptures he sums it all up by by bringing this in 1 Corinthians 2:16 we have the mind of Christ we think like he thinks so you think like Jesus that means you have the same attitude toward the loss he did amen somebody's truly filled with the Holy Ghost ain't going to try to close the door of Mercy amen they're going to hold it open and say whosoever will let him come come on I'll I'll read it to you from the Bible in the Bible Revelation 19 it says it said and the spirit and the bride say come and those that are thirst say come and come and drink of the Water of Life freely so it goes to show you that is who the bride is she is a people who is saying come not we closed the door somebody has the come watch now so we we have the same attitude toward the sick like Jesus did because why sickness is a result of sin not our sins per se but but the sin of Adam all the way from the beginning now so again we have the same attitude of redemption we believe that God can redeem the soul we believe he can save the body so again that makes us then a a a different species from another kingdom we're birthed into a kingdom for example 1 Corinthians 2 um excuse me Philippians 3:20 says our citizenship is of heaven so we're a people born of another kingdom that's why we don't do the things the world does that's why we're not influenced by what the world does we don't dress like them we don't act like them we don't believe like them behave like them because we are from another kingdom and we are here representing the kingdom we're from amen so again we are again the Bible said in 2 Corinthians 5:20 we are ambassadors for Christ which means we are God's representative so we are here right representing him as his Ambassador we are a citizen of heaven we have a kingdom within us we are we are inviting others into this Kingdom we are resisting the devil's Kingdom that's who we are now I did all of that because I want to remind you again what the word says about you yes now Jesus had faith in the word and that said it is written of me so I've just I've just read you just a small fragment of things that was written of you so just so you just have a sampling of of what it says about you amen and so that you can have faith like Jesus did of what was written of me he says that's what gave him faith and he would refer back to the Psalms and and and and said didn't David and the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him remember this is the way Jesus when he walked with the Copus and the other disciple on the way to EMAs what did he do he began to go through the scriptures amen and began to reveal things concerning himself what the scriptures said of him and the Bible said he began with Moses and that's the five first books The Books of Moses amen he began with Moses and all the prophets and explained to him what would to them what was written in all the scriptures about himself what a marvelous sevenmile walk amen it was seven it was seven miles there that he he went down they were heading down even away from the promise I I want to get something to you there let me stop and talk about it here there was Copus and the other disciples and they were sad and brokenhearted because things hadn't happened the way they had it figured out to be they had it figured out that Jesus would be the son of David he would be the king and he would Reign and he would bring Rome under their feet and all the other things and and they didn't realize it wasn't this that coming that's a future coming he had to come first for Redemption amen so he he he joins them he has told them to go to the upper room go to the city of Jerusalem and stay there and wait for the power from on high but they're going the wrong direction amen and Jesus himself Drew near don't don't that tell you something amen that if he's got an upper room experience for you and you are going the wrong direction he's going to go after you amen he's going to start walking with you and begin to reveal things about himself and and saying shouldn't this have been done and wasn't should this been the way it be all of these things try to make you understand your current events and what is happening to do what get them back to Jerusalem again they ran all the way back I don't know how they did it but I I'll tell you what if IID have sat with him and he had have broke bread like he did before I don't know how he did it maybe pulled a piece off and another piece appear and another piece and another piece appear he's still the Creator somebody said the other day Jesus never performed any Miracles after his resurrection so you see there's no Miracles after the resurrection of Jesus I said oh come on come on you're talking the wrong f yes I have read my Bible this Jesus would come and appear and lock doors right through the walls this Jesus didn't put a hook in line and take a net out but he had fish on the fire this Jesus would tell them cast your net I'm talking about after his resurrection on the other side and they would and they would they would draw in the net and there would be 153 fishes so much that their Nets would start breaking he didn't do any Miracles his very Ascension was a miracle amen his resurrection was an was a miracle his Ascension was a miracle him coming back on the day of Pentecost was a miracle but unless you receive that Miracle then you're going to have to you'll have problems believing in his miracles so you see starting back in Genesis the first first book of Moses he began to tell he looked into the scripture is my point looking there and said okay I you remember all the way back in Eden who was that tree of life if a man eat of me he shall never die I am that I am I'm that burning bush I am that light that was in that burning bush I've come down to now to delivered from sin and sickness and he looked back at the Mana and he could point to that and he would say I am the bread of life that came down out of God from Heaven he would look at a serpent on a pole remember Moses the Bible said in John 3:13 as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up what was he doing he was looking back into the scripture and he could even say I'm going to be crucified it'll be sin judged on the tree I'm going to die for the sins of the world come on amen he he would show it there I I'm going there to to the cross and and he says he said that whosoever should believe in him would should not perish but have ever eternal life in joh John 12:32 if I lifted up from the earth will draw all men to me this he said signifying which death he would die so Jesus would would look at himself as that serpent on the pole that's right that would be a little hard without Revelation without the spirit of God quickening to him the word when he read it to look at a serpent on the pole and said that's me not that he was sin but that he became sin and if anybody who's bitten by the serpent will look to him they can live so you see this he knew with perfect faith that he was a anointed Messiah now I'm trying to get you to understand because we want to think oh he was God though I mean he could remember all those no he would Veil from himself so that as a man he would go through it just like you did remember when he defeated the the devil on Mount Transfiguration he didn't use his great power not Transfiguration Temptation you know he he would he wouldn't use his his um um Power to do it he used the word because maybe you are not gifted as he was but you got the word like he had and what I'm trying to get you to do is read your Bible amen they are they that prophesy of this day that we are living they speak about you look in there and see what the word of God said let the Holy Spirit brood over you and reveal you who you are the scripture is speaking over over and over and over again pointing to this very day and hour so Jesus knew with perfect faith and if I believe and you see you see of course God was in him he was a word made manifest and when the word comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer and the believer is the faith of God that moves in you it's because you're not truly a Believer if the faith of God cannot move in you and through you so you must know who you are yes let me stop there a minute you got to know whose you are before you know who you are and when you know you never were the Devil's Child you were just lost and a strain from him but you never originally belonged to the devil in fact your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and when you know who you are then you know who you are now if you you must know who you are and who it is within you and and I just say if you're not there push toward it that's right like a little ACR and dig a Little Deeper amen dig in the nutrients from the soil of the word and push toward the sun toward the light until you become a Mighty Oak you see we've been planted into the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and we are just to drink and drink and drink and as we do we push out amen and and everything that we need for life's journey is is within us Divine Healing the power of God you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost everything if you're planted in Christ amen everything you have need of for the life's journey is already in you even the Rapture is in you yes sir man you you like Jesus would say I am the resurrection you got to realize I am the Rapture he can't leave without me amen the church can't go without me I am the Rapture you you see the Rapture is in US amen well how do you know that's true because those he called he justified and those he justified he had glorified so it's already within you so therefore as far as God's concerned is an already done deal we're just we're but he's he's up here watching in our journey here we see ourselves not there but he sees the end and he sees you already there so knowing who he was without a shadow of a doubt Jesus knew he was the Son of God the works identified him he said if I don't do the works of my father don't believe me but you just if I do them then believe the works for they are man the manifested word promise so he could actually stand and say who can condemn me of sin or of unbelief show me what the father said about me that I haven't done amen who can condemn me of sin you see that's exactly where the church has to come to where we can say ourselves who can condemn us of unbelief show us the scripture in the Bible that we're not fulfilling we're fulfilling what was spoken of us who can condemn me of sin sin is unbelief oh my I mean how how could don't you know we're going to be condemned of sins if we're saying days of Miracles are passed that's right if we're not believing for the impossible amen don't you know then we can be condemned of sin the only way we can be not condemned of sin is believe that all things are possible to them that believe amen then we will not be condemned with the word world Amen when we deny the gifts that's in the Bible the things that's in the word of God and say it's for another age well then we can be condemned of unbelief that's amen but you see but but you see the identification of a True Believer is these signs shall follow them that believe so how can you even call yourself a Believer and deny those words how how can you call yourself a Believer and and deny any word of God you have to believe oh my now I tell you what brother brandom talked about a church that is on his road that will be able to say those things who can condemn me of sin who what word has been spoken of a bride that I have not fulfilled I want to say I'm in that church amen I and I'm not talking about even and light I'm talking about the body of Christ amen the the power zone is God's provided unlimited power and unlimited resources but it's knowing how to exess it let's talk for a moment knowing how to access it we all know that there's electricity in these sockets and these electrical outlets if you plug an appliance in amen and and nothing happens well you're not going to say there's no such thing as electricity because you know you SE it work amen you say it's worked before it can work again so there's either something wrong with the appliance something wrong with the cord something wrong with the acceptable receptacle something wrong with the lines or something wrong with the power source what the thing about our power source mind it never ever ever Runs Out come on so we don't we know it doesn't lay in God it lays somewhere in the wiring something's disconnected somewhere now let's think about this because too often people do the same when someone's prayed for and don't get healed they want to say that there's no such thing as Divine Healing and that's just essentious to saying there's no such thing as electricity amen others are getting healed we can point them out right amen you know the world is full of electricity you know that there's electricity and unseen force in the heavens and when it builds up enough we see a light show in the heavens is called we call it lightning there's electricity in your hair there's electricity in your clothing it's everywhere you see you but if you're in the middle of the field and at night and you can't see where you're going and and you don't know if there's a snake you may be stepping on your next step you might stand out there and scream and you say oh it's dark I need electric I need some lights oh electricity you're in the heavens make light for me I know you can get light you know electricity I this is a dark place here and I know you're here electricity while you're in my hair you're in my clothing you're you're in the heavens you're there but even science has proved you're here come make me a light well you know you're wasting your breath be awful foolish wouldn't it looking out at our parking lot you know it was once a dark field but now at night it's lit up why because instead of screaming we have went through the right channels and made made have the power to light it up see and and let me say this way the whole room is full of the power of God there is enough here to make every person that that would in any person in here well whether it be a lady on the stretcher a boy in a wheelchair or or make people cripples walk by th seat there's enough power in this building right now to make every cancer patient well amen actually see every old person young amen there's enough power in this building right now but you got to know how to access it now and the way that to do it you've got to get the Holy Spirit flowing through the right category to do it now you say what how much power well we're seated in Heavenly places with power and authority and all the power of Heaven is behind us amen again you know right down here we right down the road we own this little Pond right here on our Church property and it has a spring in it has water in it all year round and we got right here on this field and around us we got grass that needs to be watered you're not going to get it by screaming at the pond and say come water this you know oh you great gusting spring from that that pond down there well up Old Spring and come up here and water our grass oh you can scream you can cry you can shout you can run you you could speak in tongues you could you could jump up and down you could sing songs you could preach but until you work in harmony Sir with the laws of nature you're not going to get that water here to water you see and the same thing you you can scream you can cry you can shout you can you can do everything you can work up but unless you get in harmony with the Holy Ghost you just make yourself horse and get nowhere so you see the water will water the grass if you work with the correct laws of gravitation so you can actually dig a ditch and if you will aim it down low enough you'll get water pulled up around here that you'll have water in this lawn but you know you just can't make it jump over here or you can do it the Modern Way which makes a lot more sense to me you could you could run electricity to pump put it out on the pond and you can irrigate this whole field out here there's enough water in it to sprinkle every day amen now what I'm trying to say is we've got enough of the Holy Ghost to heal every person in this place if we will work according to the plan and the will of the Holy scriptures there's enough Christians in this building today to close the heavens but you got to work according to the will of the spirit of God according to his laws and that's what we're trying to do right now is help you to understand your position in Christ amen where where that you instead of just running away from this truth and denying it and But realize there is a way to bring healing to the sick salvation to the lost and a Rapture to the church now again if you connect the wire with the word of the word with the Damo of the Holy Ghost and then you check the voltage that says the connection is true mountains are going to move because if the connection is true without a breakage in the current amen it's going to flow energy and power and it's the power that lays Within your Bible in the word of God is going to be released to do its work so like I said you know you just like taking an appliance cord and sticking it in a socket where there's no current there you know it's just a dead wire that no matter how much socket it is and I wanted to say a lot of times we have a lot of places that they got the structure they got the structure you know they got wires that are run but they have never connected to the Dynamo they have never connected to the Holy Ghost and as long as you're still a dead wire you know it has no life in it it's just dead Thunder with no lightning amen now electricity is a funny thing do you know you know I I I had to look it up the other day to to to be able to to to understand this but you know no one knows what electricity is you ain't figured it out yet in fact let me just quote it from from from their authorities what but what exactly is electricity that is a very complicated question and as you dig deeper and ask more questions there's really not a definitive answer only abstract or theoretical representation of how electricity interacts with our surroundings so now after all these years we don't even know what it is amen but we have made an invisible force work for us now that's in the natural realm with God's laws that he put up on the earth then if that's true how about the spiritual round am man I mean we're taking something we don't know what it's all about about and we're putting it to work and then you think about there's God he's so vast he's so big he's so beyond our human understanding and it ain't an understanding him it's just knowing he's the power and putting to work that it'll work in your life it'll give you overcoming power it'll defeat the Devil anywhere any place anytime no matter what it is physically spiritually whatever it is now brother bradam would simplify it in his terms and say it's two pieces of material rolling along together that makes the continuity and sends out the electricity and that's the way it is when those two pieces get to Rolling together what brings it off of the generator and so that's the way when a Christian gets to working with God rolling together that brings an unseen force that does Mysteries that none of us know nothing about Only We Know It's God amen now you know there again we we had a man some years ago back in the early days of America his name was Ben Franklin Benjamin Franklin he had a hunch that there was electrical charges in the heavens and he flew a kite in a storm and the wet uh kite string picked up the ambient electrical charge from the storm and the feel of that current let him know that electricity was in the heavens electricity is power and even the heavens were full of it and Franklin just needed to find a way to harness it and we know that the heavens are full of the power of God Amen and God is omnipotent power and we know that even his word has power somebody help me preach it's full of divine energy but we must know how to tap into to Heaven's resource now Franklin's Discovery did very little to put electricity to work it just proved it was there but here come along another man and his name was Thomas Edison and Thomas Edison believed that he could make that work that he could take that electrical charge and put wires together in a vacuum and make uh it Glow and produce a light and I tell you what he was tireless he would go through hundreds of wires trying to figure it out and you know that's the way it is with the with the Bible the Bible said he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him amen you know there again you you you plug your Appliance in it doesn't work well you don't say there's no electricity you want to find out okay why isn't it working amen there's something broken somewhere there's a broken line there's a broken wire there's a short in the system something there it's running it's a breaking wire it's running it into the ground and the power isn't reaching here why is it and you you don't give up on it you keep working until you figure it out and that's why the Bible said you must be persistent because he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen we don't just say oh well I was prayed for it and I didn't get healed well I guess there's nothing to it but you know don't throw the appliance out and say the days of electricity has passed amen go and find out where there's a break in the line amen God wants somebody who won't give up amen for a winner will never quit and a quitter never wins you got to stay and you got to call things right amen before Satan and tell him it is a way it is thus say the Lord the Lord said so it's written it is written whatsoever I ask and I believe God I shall receive it it's my property it's attainable it's mine it's a deep caller to the Deep there has to be something in the human heart that desires Deliverance that's why you'll never get delivered unless you desire Deliverance even on the on the physical on the physical as well as the spiritual until you're ready until you're ready to surrender your life to God you're not going to be delivered from sin you got to die out to every desire of it right same thing with you with healing with Deliverance you got to come to that point is you know I I love God I love his word I don't want to live that way like I said and I've used Jonathan for example brother Jonathan come time after time I want to give up these cigarettes I want to give up these cigarettes and he never could give them up finally one day he said to me you know why I can't give up them cigarettes I said why cuz I love them brother Tim I love the way they make me feel oh I get a cigarette after my meal oh I love it I love it brother DM I love it I said and it's killing you it's destroying your life and I said until you hate those cigarettes and you love God more than you love those cigarettes you will never be delivered amen what was it with the maniac well brother brandom made the spirit be subdued but he didn't cast it out of him he said he loves that Spirit he worships it and and and I want you to say as long as you worship as long as you worship that thing oh you know you get people all the time they pull it out oh see my scars see see where I've been hurt see what people did to me see what see my and they glory in their scars they glory in their past and they're not willing to move on past it well I I need to talk about it well talk it over with God give it to him Surrender Your Life let him take it out of you and you'll not glorify that thing anymore amen I you know I I well this is the way I was raised and this is why I'm this way and oh come on the reason you're the way that you are is because you choose to be the way you are you have a choice well people did this to me okay but you have a choice now well my daddy okay but it's your turn well I'm codependent because of them no you are what you are because of your children voice you don't want to move past it let God heal you of your past and move forward into God's future for you heals a rewarder of those that diligently seek him but you run looking for somebody with another sympathetic ear to hear your problem listen you you know all you are doing is feeding and worshiping that thing Let It Go move past it well things happen to me this is not the Millennium this is where we're Overcomers and God didn't allow anything in your life that is too big for his Spirit to move and overcome through you it was given to you to overcome rise up above it so I well then Surrender Your Life to him and you can amen so you know again Edison tried wire after wire and finally he found a wire that would light it had to be something was something inside of it told him this is this work everybody else you know would criticize make fun of him but he just go on through the night trying this trying that trying that to finally he found something now brother brandham Likens himself to Edison and he says I've been on a search and he said now brother sister you can call me a fanatic if you want to but I know there's a power of God first thing because God said so that ought to settle it right God said so amen second thing because in my heart I know there's something in there that says that there's a power of God to heal every sickness and I believe it and as long as I believe that I'll spend my life that I know it's the truth it's God's word verse and there's something in my heart telling me it's there and I'm searching every wire everywhere trying to find a place that we can get it into church Fanatics may rise and go but you'll see the day when the Church of Jesus Christ will stand to its feet with this great power that they're laughing at us about today it'll be brought forth just like electricity was because there's something down in the human heart that says it's there is the same angel of God there is a power we read it in the Bible we read it we read it that it raptured Enoch it flooded the world with water and saved Noah in this household it made it made a sterile 100y old man a barren woman age 90 give birth amen it created lice and flies amen it pled the Egyptians with it it turned it it it turned the sun Into Darkness it opened up the Red Sea I'm talking about the power it caused the sun to turn into to to to uh it caused the son to stand still and Joshua for Joshua it Stood Still for him why because he believed amen it opened the Red Sea and the Jordan where Israel crossed on dry land do I need to go through all the prophets and one by one tell of the miraculous hand of God and his power that was on display and I just say it this way if he could do it once if can do it [Applause] again hallelujah amen it's the power of the Holy Ghost made crippled walk blind eyes open rais a man that was dead four days amen that's power and if God could do it once God can do it again amen and even you know it's here you can testify in this church we know the power is here to make cancer disappear Amen to take and and in the place of dark lungs healthy lungs in the place of that Darkness it can make a crippled boy walk it can make hair to grow back come on the power of God is is here to make an alcoholic sober Amen to make a gentleman out of him the power God to take Street Walkers and harlots and make ladies out of them come Church the power of the word going forth just in a service or two ago you know as I was preaching there two or three weeks ago brother brother Jason back here was attending the service as the word went forth a nicotine demon left him delivered of a two three pack day habit amen right there there he didn't even realize what had even taken place gets it gets it home and eating lunch or supper together with his family you hadn't had a cigarette in four years I mean four hour says his wife what the desires gone what it left me while I was in church what the power was released amen you experiened the power when you were saved Hallelujah you know the power it transformed you it changed you amen I'm trying to tell you you used to live and go into the muck and the mire of sin and live down there smoking drinking gambling everything else amen all kinds of habits and vices and everything but one day in his presence One Moment In His presence amen from that moment on something happened you were changed you were transformed it was a power of God working salvation in your life that same power that saved your soul is the same power that'll heal your body it's the same power that wapt your church all we need to do is ride higher into healing and more faith and just pushing out even if you're sick and you're not a Christian you can become a Christian right now healing power will come amen amen I just push out toward it and brother brandham said it like this if God loved you enough to bring you out of sin and filled you with the Holy Ghost what's the matter with you poor spineless weaklings around the country won't he much more deliver you from your afflictions when he promised he would do it amen God's word said so so wouldn't we be spineless weaking after God brought to us such a word with such a display of the power of God and restoration the power is not coming the power is within you you you you're waiting for a a a certain surge a certain thing a certain but the power is there acts: 18 but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you in Luke 24:49 I send the promise of my father upon you but tear you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so if you have the Holy Ghost the same power that raised Jesus from the dead dwells within you amen it will also Quicken or make alive your mortal body that power that you have within you from a boy hearing this quote of brother brandom listening to this it just always stirred my heart let me share it with you today he said that power that you have in you now could make a new world Amen God doesn't have little weak spots and big heavy spots that that's powerful the least little touch of God is omnipotent the least little touch of God I'm trying to get you into faith now then again in in everpresent waters he says if we're born again of the spirit of God God doesn't have little weak parts and big strong Parts he's allog together God that's right if you had enough God in you till it was just barely a shadow that's enough power to make a new Earth right that's enough power to make a new moon and a new system Solar System it's God and it's strong and right now and every believer in here that has eternal life which is God's spirit in you there is enough power that will raise up the dead that'll heal the sick that'll set orbits into conditions it's controlled by law it's the spirit that Spirit that's in you your sons and daughters of God the same spirit that you got in you will raise yourself up the day of Resurrection am amen so and brother brandom said the power is there that's what it can do how do we know that because the power of God made the universe it made the world it made the moon everything you see came from the power of that omnipotent God are you with me so we know then the power if God is in you then that power can make a new world we're living proof on it we got a we got an earth that we're living on amen amen now again but there's a law to that that Sons and Daughters would create a new world and go and live a private life on it you have the power in it if you got a shadow of the power of God in you you have the power to do it God is omnipotent that power is in you you can speak a world in its existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are that's what the power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and the law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of faith and Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever listen to this carefully whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours amen every place The Souls of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you so you see the if you're son or daughter of God that never leaves it's within you all the time but your faith gets away from you but it's still there so the power the power that raised Lazarus up is still here today amen the power that took took men a young man that was there had a chain around his neck and and was on all fours and was not in his right mind and and did tricks you know for for money in Africa and and there when when brother brandham prayed for him saw him by Vision picked him up by the chur p and as he did every bone in his body cracked as they all went back into place mou form bones is somebody with me amen that was the power of God Amen if you don't believe that how are you going to believe that you that one day gray hair is going to come back the right color wrinkles will fall off your face old age you'll become young again if you can't believe that you can't believe this are you with me but that power is still here that power didn't leave because brother Bram left the angel of God didn't leave because brother brandham left amen the Holy Ghost didn't leave because brother brandham left amen we are here and the word that says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world is right right now resident in The Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's enough power to make a new world now are you going to make a new world no because why the law of God keeps us from making a new world now but the power is there now again Israel couldn't say I tell you what we're in The Possession mood glory to God anything we ask for we're going to get glory to God hallelujah we're more than conquerors I tell you what Esau you got some pretty land there we're going to take it and God said no that ain't yours I didn't give you that well glory to God I tell you we're more than conquerors and amen we got a pillar of fire over us and a prophet why don't we just take Egypt over and live right here well Israel Egypt no that's not your Promised Land The power was there to bring Mighty Egypt to its knees but the law the word was not given to possess the land of Egypt now Jesus said it I do only what I see of my father what he leads me what he permits me to do and he says I'm not here to do my own will but to do the will of him that sent me so now you know again this is where at the tomb of Lazarus John 11:37 John 11:37 some of them said could not this man which had Open the Eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died the power was there but not the will of God to do it the will of God was for him to die be in the grave four days and to show God's power by Resurrection come on Amen and then Jesus said I go to wake him you see but he could not do it until it's time amen now watch watch this for a moment because we cannot deliver all nature until it's time even Jesus could not stop all death and dying here upon the Earth if he could have he should have but the plan and purpose of God had not been fulfilled right P have called a halt them to it all and none of us would have been born and we had to be born this way to be redeemed come on exactly so so the plan and purpose of God had not been fulfilled we we cannot curse the Harlot system and and them vanish into Oblivion they have a purpose to fulfill so you know that's why in the Bible there are plagues that are stirred up yeah and vessels are they're called vials seven vials have you ever read them in the in the Bible in the Book of Revelation seven vials and they're bows they're they're held up judgments and they're poured out in the tribulation period why was these thored up in them vials and and these bows all these years because down Through the Ages God heard every time that that whole system was cursed and so saints were dying and judgment was pulled down upon them amen but he could not wipe it out then it is spoken to be a part of the end time it's got a part to fulfill somebody with me so God put it in vials and held it up to be poured out in the tribulation amen amen now so again there there are things that it must be working toward the law of God and of course one of the laws of God is faith faith is a revelation of the will of God now but the power is here it just to be harest brother Bram would say the power of the resurrecting Christ this morning is right here in the building to save every sinner to fill with the Holy Ghost and to heal every sickness that is in the world if you just know the right wire that leads to it amen Franklin when he got that kite string and it was wet through that water wet string it flowed down there and he felt it and he says I got it I got it he didn't know what he had and he didn't know how to use what he had he just knew he had it and that's what way many Christians are today they get saved oh yeah amen Jesus forgives your sins you say I got it but you don't know what you got and that's as far as Franklin took it you see but what was God doing he was with Franklin he about to reveal the world electricity and he said you know that's the way they get you know they they're blessing they they they believe we got it you know Salvation is here the power is here but now they don't know how to harness it how to use it how to make it work now one thing about it is that requires to make it work is the right atmosphere that's right amen even them in the upper room they got in one mind and one Accord what does that tell you to get the Holy Ghost for the power to come for the power to flow that had to get in one mind and one Accord now they still disagreed about who who whether Rome should rule or this should Rule and or whether the sades are right or the or whatever they were Jews they were human amen that was not one mind and one Accord what they were one mind and one Accord was God made a promise amen he said we were to receive power he told us to wait here in the upper room until it come and it's coming and we're all agreeing it's coming we're all in agreement he's going to pour it out and they got to blessing God before it even came and while they were blessing God the power came and I'll tell you what when the atmosphere gets right in the church amen when people start believing my God can do anything my God is here with his power but he's more than here with his power we have access to that power power we have access to the throne of grace and we begin to praise God before we even see anything happen Hallelujah the atmosphere get right Faith begins to rise as the word is preached amen and a man like Jason tiger a slave to a cigarette walks out free Hallelujah and you can walk out free may not be cigarettes it may be a habit it may be sickness it may be sin it may be a vice it doesn't matter what it is there is nothing too big for this God and when we get in the atmosphere of believing then all things are possible when we believe so when faith is preached amen then the atmosphere gets right so you say wellow brother Tim they were there in that upper room and bless God I mean they were blessing him and but the Holy Ghost has already come and it can't fall like that anymore you just can't have a an experience like that today because it already came you see and once it came well then you don't do it that way no more cuz it's already come well let me help your theology out just a little bit let's go let's remember right after Pentecost there's a mighty Miracle takes place there's a crippled man at the gate called beautiful and he gets healed so I'm going to take you down to the scripture let's just see now this is after the upper room experience let's see if it can happen again acts 4:18 and they scribes Pharisees called them commanded them not to speak at all or teach in the name of Jesus that's right but when Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right in the site of God to hearken to you whether it be right to in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than God you judge that that's right verse 21 they said they but so when they had further threatened him they let him go and finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people because all men glorified God for that which was done verse 23 and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders had said to them watch now and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord here we get it back again the atmosphere got right and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and to see and all that is in them and verse 29 and Lord behold their threatenings and Grant to thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of the holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with [Applause] boldness Hallelujah listen when they got in one Accord again it happened again and if we get in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost believe in all things is possible and begin to praise God Hallelujah in what not yes he can do it yes it's for me yes it's the hour yes Lord yes and when you get in people together in one mind and one Accord and the atmosphere gets right things happen when we believe they we're filled with the Holy Ghost listen to The Prophet oh couldn't we get in an atmosphere here that ever crippled ever blind every sick person everything always went Accord believing and all the sick I seen it last week in Wood River he said boy there wasn't a person left they just piled up the crutches the wheelchairs the Cs I was standing at the platform preaching like this and they began to rise up and throw them to the corners the atmosphere got right Hallelujah that was not with a hand laid on them that was not with a gift of discernment that was not of anything just preaching the word and the atmosphere got right and when they the atmosphere got right they threw away their crutches Hallelujah they threw away their cigarettes they threw away their dop they throw away everything come on Amen they walked right into the promise and he says oh God send an atmosphere that'll make it of one Accord let the power of God search down through the atmosphere gets right it'll open every clog the law of God will move now that's true true right now we're in need of gifts of healing workings of Miracles prophecy but one day the atmosphere that we're feeling this morning will get right and there will come a charge through our mortal bodies and the Holy Spirit will take the church in such control of divine love until the sick will be healed the blind will see and the lame will walk without hands being laid on them and we'll be changed in a moment a twinkl of an eye and friends that's when all gifts will be laid on the shelves when we change our bodies we won't need them no more we won't need prophecy we won't need Gifts of healings or workings of miracles in our new bodies but as long as as long as we're here we need them amen so brother brandham said in the message speak to this mountain now you know he saw now that scripture greater than these become take even more meaning because up to this time he uses the that you know verely verely I say unto you the works that I do shall he do also and greater than these shall he do because I grow to my father and he would say well it's greater because there's more he's now in a multi a multimember body and so there's more and it can happen around the world all simp simultaneously his body in Africa his body here body everywhere and God working and God enlarged that because after the squirrels were created where he saw and and I don't have time to go into all of that but you know where he just spoke and there was a squirrel appeared just by the because as he was contemplating these scriptures and God wanted to show us the power of this word that he watched in it as he said you know let there come a young squirrel and sit on that Sycamore limb and there it was let there come one and those briers right over there and there was another let there come another and run out on this Leaf instead right there there was another right amen the power of creation and after he saw that power of creation that was working this side of the atonement where that whatever you say shall be done you say to this mountain and here he is told to say it and he said it and creation was done by the words of a prophet of God by a man of God a Son of God can I say it that way and brother brandham comes along and he said now Greater Works because when Jesus did Works he took bread and multiplied it and made more bread he took fishes and made more fishes off of that fish but this was created out of nothing it was Greater Works now then he comes and he says I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into a spear now that's going to shake the whole world the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth into a human being ask anything you will and it shall be given to you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled and it's going to come to pass s pretty soon I'm I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen now that that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she'll rise to her feet like a mighty marching Army the sick will be healed by word the blind will see the death will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now and I believe it's coming to pass I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to strike the Church of God soon and it's going to start a Revival that'll shake the world well what does that mean to you somebody's going to access the power amen amen I mean we got the power but our atmosphere gets twisted up some believing some doubting some questioning some accepting it we can ever get in one mind in one Accord it can happen it did it before it'll do it again we got a people that are taught right amen things will start happening because we'll create an atmosphere while in this place people are delivered in this people place people are saved in this place people are healed when we come together things happen and you come start coming with an expectancy that's right amen now again Thomas Edison wouldn't give up on it and brother bradam said himself he says you know I I I I'm doing everything I'm doing everything to find those wires I want to bring this down I'm trying to find a place to stop he said there's enough power in the room that to heal every sick person open every blinded eye unstop every dep ear make every lame man leap like a heart save every sinner Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost every believer he's here just as real as can be if you could just find the wire that brings that current to you again he says there's a power of the resurrected Christ to save every sinner filled with the Holy Ghost and and to heal every sickness that's in the world if you'll know the right wire that leads to it and he said it's love and faith that is the right wire now brother brand said I found the wires now electricity you know it kind of goes in in like a a circle you know it comes from here and then it goes back there it comes down into the appliance it runs back you have a a negative and a positive and so it runs down one line and back the other so it's a cycle that goes through so you have to have both you have to have two wires for it to complete the cycle some with me brother brandom is telling us there are two wires first of all you receive from God the love of God flows down into the human heart amen and causes him to believe and going back to God is Faith to believe every promise that he made that when a man or woman loves God right then they know that this God will not lie he will keep his word and so Faith turns back to God completing the cycle and brings healing to the church so he says I have found the two wires the conduit to make every promise of God come to pass and in the 20 years of research of the Bible and talking with the angel of the Lord and the many things I find there two things it's love and faith if you love God just purely unadulterated love you've got to have faith in him it'll accompany Faith every time so that the love of God can come from the nature of God into your heart from the source he first loved you if it'll come to you his love and you in turn believe back in him then Deliverance starts taking place you see brother brandham said in these 20 years if you love I found it he said if you love God with this purely unadulterated word you have our love you have got you have faith in him it'll company Faith every time when love and faith gets married you ask what you want to and you can have that's right and he said perfect faith in perfect Faith he said love and faith goes together they're kin folks they love love produces faith and when Satan tempts us we are to resist him with perfect faith in a perfect word like Jesus did the word of God is perfect and we have we're to have perfect faith in this perfect word and resist Satan watch these words when you know that that your heavenly father cannot tell you any lie he's God and he can lie and then you believe him with all your heart and you believe that what you ask for you ask for it for not with a selfish motive but you have the right motive behind it there to ask it for the glory of God and believe without a shouted doubt that your father would not lie to you something's going to take place once you get all the cuckle birds of hindrance out of the way and just look right straight there to Calvary and believe with all your heart so you see you see every one of you that he said that has got a soul when you go to believe it's that channel of faith and that's when the Holy Spirit will move in we don't take emotion now it takes faith and love Lord I love you so if you want to be healed or delivered get the love right first that's why I told you brother Jason forget about everything else do one thing fall in love with Jesus Oh you could talk about oh my scars and they hurt me and they did this and I tell you I've been wounded and I you can talk about all that just forget all of that do one thing get in love with Jesus any person that ever falls in love with Jesus there's a faith going to start coming back out of you toward him to start believing for deliverance knowing this that he he says when you go to believe and it's in that channel of faith and if you get with one Accord that's when the Holy Spirit will move in now what is one Accord it's one Accord with his word come on we we talk about oh we're we're going to all agree together no we're going to be one Accord with his word amen the power is here and he wants to do it he wants to heal every sick person he wants to deliver every lost person and when you begin to do that and it takes faith and love and you say Lord I love you and you can't lie because you're God I love you and love settles the whole thing when you love your wife with all your heart with all your soul you just love her there ain't nobody else in town could make you to believe she wasn't a good woman that's right same old tattletales will come to you you your husband ain't true when you really love him you got confidence in him see love covers it over that's right and when you love God all the fears just scatter everywhere and you just say God you're right I love you and I'm Healed and I'll just go on and take it that's what then everything can happen spontaneously if you just believe it but when you start doubting your lover well um but but they this old tattletale over here says no you don't do that anymore you say it's of yesterday or it's not for us today are we we're we're too deep in the message now to believe anymore you know we we got too much great understanding and we're higher than that we don't need anything from God when you go like that you'll never get anything but when you go to looking and you begin to see his word if it worked once it'll work again if it healed once it'll heal again if it delivered once it'll deliver again if it delivered one man from cigarettes it'll deliver another man even deliver come on somebody am whatever God's word said because you love him you believe it and you just say Lord I'm Healed you said it I just love you enough to believe I got it and I'm going to start acting like it come on now so brother Brandon said the only wi I know is love and faith the father can't lie and I love him and I faith in him so can't we love him and have faith in him our confidence our faith proves our love back to him now we know that electricity works so like I said you go in plug your iron go to iron the close before you come to church iron don't come on you don't just say there's no electricity now we do have a lot of Amish believers menites who agree it's there but we're not to have it and they want to stay with their horse and buggy and their lanterns and live in a primitive way and pretend they're oldtime Christians well if they was they would have the power like they did on the day of Pentecost so but when we have it then we real and we realize hey it ain't working then we go to say what's the matter you know we what what is plugged up says some Theology and I I want to get in this I'm going to take a whole sermon on the things that hinders it the things that will cause it to to not flow things that will keep you from crossing over you know if we but if you're really grounded in Christ and rooted in him with faith in God and you know you got those two wires that are coming you know it's going to pack the light of the Gospel so like I said you know would you would you stand out here and say cuz it's dark and you're screaming and trying to you know said well it don't work anymore there's no such thing as electricity no you go to work we know scientifically it's all been proven that electricity works you'd be stupid not to think it and scientifically if we want to say it that way spiritually we know it's here how could sister Atlanta be sitting here today after being given a notice of death with for stage fourth hot hodskins L lymphoma how oh you only God can do that come on you know that only the power of God I mean go from a full-blown infection one day to nothing you know what about little Jude you know with how could he be a healthy normal teenager and yet as a baby had such poor kidney function till he didn't even wet his diaper at night you see and yet go back to the doctors after prayer prayed and something happened they had to testify like sister Lily the other day came up for prayer I called her up for prayer y'all saw me she was the doctor said she had a liver disease and and and they were pronouncing all kinds of things on her after prayer she goes back and what is it's totally healthy and normal hallelujah amen what is it what is it when we can see somebody was a drunkard some weeks ago few months ago and a Gentleman now what about it when you can see a street harlot and you know become a lady what by the transforming power of the Holy Ghost amen God come and change into the nature make you a new creation make you a new person amen that unseen power at work hallelujah hallelujah working right Among Us I'm trying to tell you Church it is working right Among Us plug into it amen just in the serice brother Jason tiger there in the fellowship ball told him go fall and over with Jesus forget the past failures and the failures of others that made you stumble and do one thing fall in love with Jesus amen get that right that wire right amen then when it comes in then put a faith back to him amen like I told that boy the other day you know when I stand there talking to him I said listen I know a God that will take and transform you you and change you amen you don't have to remain the way that you are he can take and I named him a drunk as that has been a drunk since 16 years old and make him a hailed well man in a moment of time he can do the same for you am mean you once walk with God you once was in a youth group you once was there and you've Fallen away but God is a restorer I'm speaking to you today for your children for your need this God is a restorer I said that song said what he's done for others he'll do for you With Arms Wide Open he'll pardon you hallelujah oh we know coming right through this room right now is radio television all we have to do is plug it up you don't feel it you don't see it but it's here God is here amen we should be able to be a people that believe amen who believe that it's more real than television radio waves microwav sound waves that unseen Wireless wave it makes up your image in real time is you talk across across the globe oh yesterday I wanted to see my little granddaughter she'd been sick up in Ohio Little Brook told her mom I want to want to talk to Brooke she facetimed me there I'm seeing her there I'm seeing her seeing Brook she's seeing me I'm holding something in my hand it's a receiver it's a phone it's got an invisible current signal coming from somewhere Unseen World taking that in another world and transferring it to this world do I see this image and then my image sent back to that world states away miles away amen what what is it we we are living as a supernatural people that is not even natural anymore we have tapped into Realms of the Unseen realm amen until we are doing things that we we would be it would be out of people's mind they would think oh my we're gods or something you know 150 years ago to where we are now we're doing things that was thought impossible but because there were men that would not give up there were men who would build on an idea amen that they would go until we're here and we've Advanced are you with me let me tell you friends if that is all true then the angels of God are here if it's not some way way somewhere else come on there's even another dimension that is turning faster than this one amen where the dead in Christ are and it's just as real as where we are amen and we we have we in this generation we have heard voices we have seen images we've had proof that that realm exists are you with me brother Brandon was say the angel of God is here I didn't see the angel of God but I knew he was there because he was doing things that man couldn't do he was Discerning hearts and calling out names and telling addresses of things a man cannot do I knew there was another realm because the receiver brought it visible it made me know it was there I think that electricity is invisible but I can PL something in and make it visible I know it's real it works and we have been given proof of that realm Hallelujah one day theop needs to be more real than even television or whatever they'll be right here we'll connect with them and be changed right now God is present in this room first his word said so first his word said so where two or more Gather in my name I'll be there so Jesus is here because his word said number one the word said it number two I've already felt it every once in a while I get a charge from it am man I get a there Comes A jolt and I know just like Franklin knew electricity was in the heaven he got a jol every once in a while I get a joke amen the anointing comes down the spirit begins to move things begin to flow that I don't even think about they're just coming out of my mouth why why is it because the unction of the Holy Ghost the power it's a world that we cannot see but angels of God are with us everywhere amen they're they're with us everywhere now men have built on the discoveries of Franklin Edison didn't think it's a discredit to Franklin to put electricity to work he built on his Discovery right amen other men didn't say well but that was only for Edison and for his time it's not time anymore for us to have electricity for us you see light bulbs was only for the initiation of of of the thought and the concept of electric electricity but it's not for us today we wouldn't do that would we no sir invention after invention was built upon his until today we have a entirely different world from what they lived in so somebody not only you know made a light bulb but had a string power to light up a city it went from a one little place one little bulb to lighten up an entire city amen and somebody figured it out way back in 1870 those of you Old-Timers with me been here for years and years you remember meeting in the old the old white church that we had there on White Oak Road then we'd build another one but anyway back then we had this old church had no electricity in it you know when it was originally built it had absolutely no electricity it was built in the 1870s it was not till 1940s that electricity came into the rural Louisiana you know what they did in for that church I want you to listen to their vision for electricity they held up they put up six light bulbs and one plugin one receptacle that was the all all that they knew to do with that power and when we arrived in 1972 that was just not enough for us we wanted more than one receptacle we wanted more than six light bulbs is somebody with me amen we want him running water we wanted flushing toilets you know all of this is provided by electricity we wanted air conditioners we wanted we wanted heat you know we were we were had an old old Barrel um uh 50-gallon drums set on the side with on a stand my Dad and brothers made a pipe out the door and you know burn wood in it and that was you know that was a Primitive Baptist building and we were primitive our it was no Nursery there was no nothing but an outdoor toilet that we made hole in the ground build a seat over the top of it close it in for privacy boy sides and girl side hole out the up top you know for for the ventilation yeah for other things too you know little Brian Middleton was our one of our first babies born and dedicated there after gai died and it was always something you know with our open Windows our open doors I preached and it was like an outdoor meeting the big doors open on each side they every window open no screens you know oh yeah so you actually ate a lot of bugs when you preached no no amplifier no nothing no PA here you are no Nursery sisa goes out with misbehaving Brian Wags him outside picks a switch off the off the off the tree and that window for ventilation next time becomes a Escape Route for all the leaves that's right we had entertainment at our church but you know when we we got there you know we we decided we wanted more than what we had we knew there was more available and more use for this power amen so we wanted elect we wanted we wanted 220 we want to be able to run a air conditioner we wanted we wanted heat in the building we wanted all all kinds of light and things and and PA equipment and things like that we wanted we wanted it all we had a greater vision and we built on that primitive situation I'm trying to make a point here but we do it backwards we say old brother Brandon found the wires to healing but we better not Venture into his field we better not use what he had you know that was for another season we we have the word now and I tell you what instead of the word many people got dead theology that won't work remember the words that brother Brandon preached worked it had power with it amen I would say that brother Brandon would say build on what I brought amen there should be more healing more Deliverance more Angelic visitation more power of God not less well we got the full word now then with it should come to full power it's like when I went to Uganda I went to Uganda and I went to well we preached way out in the country in The Boondocks for sure but I went to what was a beautiful Resort it was once a beautiful resort with beautiful oak trees or trees around it I'm not sure what all they were the varieties some of them had flowers and bl blossoms kind of like a mimosa tree but they be larger than that there was a park around it and and this it had a shell of a vision the of a building I mean the infrastructure was from way back in the day when the English ruled the country it had phones in every room oh it's modern but it would only call the office it would buz the office but it wouldn't call out of the hotel when we had to when we got a message with somebody driving miles over the mountain from Kenya coming across to tell us that somebody had died in our church then brother hilderbrandt and another brother drove like six hours down to another city to get to a phone booth that could call America and here we were in this beautiful Resort what once was a beautiful Resort and here I call I want to flush the toilet and I have to get a bucket to flush the toilet and I want a bath and they bring it in a Jerry jug the water for me to pour in my bathtub why why because you see they they had allowed things to deteriorate instead of going forward and having running water flushing toilet oh it was all there the plumbing was there the toilets was there the water pipes was there but you see they didn't have electricity no more to the pump and somebody had robbed the pump and now the thing has got all the structure and it looks like a nice resort but everything is broken what am I trying to say when brother Brenham left us amen if I can do it in the type of that we had a place that worked amen there was flesh and toilets there was lights there was bath water there was showers there was everything it worked it was beautiful but men have got along and some have stolen the liines some have robbed it out and blocked it up with theology until many times it don't work but I'm here to tell you friends amen God didn't intend for it to be that way and us to go backward Hallelujah God intends us to go forward if it worked once it'll work again if you healed once he'll heal again if you delivered one then he'll delivered now if be saved oh Hallelujah it be filled once with the Holy Ghost then he'll fill him with the Holy Ghost now like the Church of the Church of Sardis thou Hast a name that you live but you're dead listen we have found salvation that will save us from sin take the violence drunken prostitute and make him a child of God do you know that's being lost I had a brother called me this week and he said brother him I'm dealing with a brother that he's got some issues in his life he went to a message preacher that you know sat down with him and he took a book of psychology and he said there he's reading this book of psychology to him Page by Page and trying to pin his problems on his mom and his dad and other people and bringing all kinds of division and hurt in the family and said what should I do I said tell him to be born
