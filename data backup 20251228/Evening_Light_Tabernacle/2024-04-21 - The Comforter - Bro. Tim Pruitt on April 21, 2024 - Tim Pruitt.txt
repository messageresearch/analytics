both physically and spiritually delivered thank you for Redemption Lord thank you for Redemption thank you for forgiveness of sin whereby we have been set free to serve the Living God I pray Lord today you'll bless us with your presence that the word that we read that you will anoint it make it real and live among us Lord step out of the pages of the Bible by your Holy Spirit today and walk these AIS and speak to Hearts quick The Word of Promise to hearts and lives I pray that you will bless your children we've assembled together in your presence Lord and we're asking for your grace now your favor upon this service upon every person here there are those that are sick and with pain and with situations in their lives and need a touch from you I'm asking God that you'll just bring that touch to them today May their faith just rise up to accept the promise of God for theirselves Lord I just Commit This service into your hands I give myself to you Lord to serve you and ask that you would anoint the word as we would read it and then you would anoint us Lord as we would speak may it just not be man that speaks but may we speak today as an oracle of God someone you just take over his vessel and speak through Lord to know that he would have to to be more than something mechanical it would take the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit and without that there's really not any preaching Lord because it's only when you come and anoint a vessel is there really prophesying of the word and I pray that the word will go forth today prophetically touching hearts and lives changing them in your presence Lord I pray for those that are not here and Lord those that are in convalescence homes or nursing homes or or rehabilitation places or maybe in in their in their own home but can assemble I pray that you would you would bless them from on high today May that you you visit them oh God that they feel your presence that they know that you're real that you care that you understand human suffering and human needs and that you'll be their consoler and comforter to today I pray father every need Supply as we ask it in jesus' name amen amen God bless you isin't it good to be in the house of the Lord today Amen to Worship the Lord together we appreciate God for his goodness to us nice to see brother Gary Sister Barbara and Sandra today that's so nice to have you back in service again and each one of you that um are assembled together with us this morning we're just glad that you're here those of you that are listening in God bless you too and may He just provide for you supplying every need amen let's turn to John chap 14 and verse 16 and there's um so many things that we could speak about this morning as as uh we think about U you know we have spoke about the token and it being the sign and and so on like that and I I'm thankful for the the the outdoor sign that we have we see it's been finished it's different Brothers have worked on it and and different Crews and I I so appreciate it seeing the finishing stones that just got put in there by brother Tim wiers and those that helped him and I think brother uh the other brothers you know had already done quite a bit of the of the work and putting it together brother James Pilger and the different ones that helped I'm not sure every person that helped but whatever was done you know we our sign that got blew down is back up but you know you're our best sign amen you are the best sign and when we see Christ Living in you you're the greatest sign this church could have amen so God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord John 14 verse 16 and I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall I know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you may God bless you you can be seated amen a't God's word good amen just a realize the promises that he made to us and that he would be our comforter amen we're going to speak today on the comforter as he as he said I'm I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter no doubt when Jesus was here walking with his disciples he was a great comfort to them amen and for him to go away and then to ascend into glory and leave us as orphans I'm glad he didn't do that but he promised to be our comforter and our strength Giver as our thoughts go back to a comforter and we go back to the first Exodus when Israel was anticipating the destroyer and knowing that that he was on his way having been warned by the prophet of God that death was going to strike every home and they had killed the lamb and put his blood on the door and as they ate the lamb that no doubt the children asked Daddy what what you got your shoes on for what you got to staff in your hand and why do you have a got a piece of bread in one hand and a lamb in the other why is it bitter herbs and things and why you're eating it and and what's that sweat that's running off your face what is all of this about you know it's the the little boy would the little girl would get an answer from the father son death is fixing to strike you see it was a time of desperation and if we ever been in a desperate hour it is now you know seeing the Destroyer with those black wings um dropping down from the sky like smoke settling down over Egypt and their screams were coming from every house what a horrible moment that was but they could take comfort as they looked upon the post and the lentil and say but we have done according to the word amen maybe the oldest child would would say but Daddy are you positive are you sure this is going to keep the Destroyer away I'm positive we've done exactly what the word told us to do and the prophet told us and he has the word of the Lord and when I see the blood I'll pass over you take a lamb for the house and I I brought all you children in and you're you're my my oldest my firstborn and it's the firstborn out there that is dying but but there is the blood of a firstborn lamb that has been applied to the doorpost and to the lentil and we have done according to the word we to what thus sayith the Lord was so you can rest at ease son amen because God has made a promise my what a word of comfort that message must have been to Israel as they were led by a pillar of fire and they could look up and they could see that Pillar of Fire by night and A Cloud by day and hear the prophet speaks words that were true and see God come along and and Vindicated you see that was their comfort and but today each one of us have the Holy Ghost that and we when we received it we received a portion of that Pillar of Fire and the it is within us it is the holy spirit leading us to the promised land and and of course to the promised Rapture of the church and and to the promised land of the Millennium ahead and we are expecting like they were as they as they were eating of the lamb and and they were taking the Passover and and um they were doing what they were told and and there under the shelter of the blood they were expecting any moment to hear the trumpet sound and when the trumpet would sound they would know that they were going to go out of Egypt on their way into Freedom oh you know that was only a type of what has been promised for our day because we too have been gathered under a word from God God sending a pillar of fire and God vindicating his word and given us a word of comfort and we are expecting to change from the voice of the Archangel to the Trump of God and for the dead in Christ to rise for our Exodus and and so we we have words of comfort that are specific for our hour now psalms 27 um will will be the words of the for the Rapture and it'll be the Psalm of the Rapture and it is a it is an exuberant Declaration of faith and I think if there's anybody that should have an exuberant Declaration of faith it ought to be the bride of Christ who has been owed with rapturing faith in this hour and so psalms 27 says the Lord is my light I you know I like to look upon upon it as it says the Lord there he is ruler over all and he is not was or will be but is present he is my light and he is my salvation what else can you look for in this day when you need comforting anytime you leave listen to the news it leaves you with confusion and and questions and ponderings and worries about the future and everything else but you know and and the hope of this politician who claims that he would save you or he was in control all of this wouldn't be taking place or you know we you know some kind of Utopia ahead that they they want to promise but for the believer the Lord is my salvation what are we looking for to save us in this hour it certainly isn't politicians amen it certainly isn't even our armies and and our our own human abilities but what we are looking to move to save us in this hour is the Lord and He is my light and he is my salvation so Whom Shall I Fear amen we have no reason to fear the lord is the strength of my life if I need strength he is the strength Giver so of whom should I be afraid all every man of Faith down through the hours and Through the Ages have stood right here and realized my strength is of god am my in myself if we could interview every one of the Hebrews of Faith they would say in myself I was not able but there was his strength that came amen the Lord is the strength of my life and of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked came up against me to eat up my flesh my enemies and foe who guess who stumbled and fell what me they stumbled and fell amen you can declare in the face of any enemy any Goliath it will be you that will stumble and you will fall but my strength is of God he is my salvation he is my life he is my help he is my comfort I have that Comfort to know that when I meet an enemy or a v it'll be them that stumbles and falls amen and though it be an army Satan can bring the best he's got amen and may though it may encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War may rise against me and this I will be confident what is it what is it I'm confident in that the Lord is that he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the Lord Our God who changes not that he's the ever present help in the time of trouble that no matter where you go or what you do the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go what a word of comfort amen though an army may be encamp me though the war may rise against me but here's one thing I'm going to do here's my desire and this is what I'll seek after one thing I've desired of the Lord that will I seek that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he will hide me in his shelter Amen in the secret place of his Tabernacle he shall hide me he shall set me high upon a rock Oh What A Word of Promise and now my head shall be lifted up above all my enemies over around me therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in his Tabernacle I will sing yes I will sing praises to the Lord here it is again David telling us where worship and praise belongs in the house of the Lord It's never out of order it's always in order when we when we here and we look at look where we're at and realize the blessings that we have from God and we know that he here we can offer sacrifices of joy in his Tabernacle now so you see in this hour where the Destroyer is going and we hear the screams the Cries From everywhere and we know that the story is in the land and we have this comfort and the prophet Isaiah would prophesy words of comfort that are also pertinent to our hour you remember when we're looking in the scripture you want to see the words that are actually identified for the day that we're living in so that we're walking in our script in the scripture that has spoken of us remember this is what Jesus did how many remembers that in the Bible Jesus always would go to the scripture and he says it's written of me you know if you could do that with psalms 27 this morning and say that is written me I am in this Rapture hour amen I am that person of Faith exuberant faith of rapturous faith and and here I I have the right to this scripture it's written of me my enemies will fall before me I have nothing to fear the war comes against me in this will I be confident in the Lord is my light and he is my strength so we go to other scriptures that speak of this hour that speaks of this time you know God has promised and and fulfilled his promise of sending a forerunner in this day we know he coming and is IM imminent because the Forerunner is now off the scene long time amen but yet at the same time we we have been introduced to the phases of his coming his word coming his bride coming and soon the meeting in the air so as we as we look at this for a moment we we know that a forerunner it goes to prepare the way and remember God promised a forerunner before his first coming and he promised again a forerunner that and he that he would be a voice of comfort to God's people and the message starts out you know with with with emphasizing comfort and saying it twice and I we're going to Isaiah 4 in verse one because as as John would identify himself as a forerunner he says here I am in the scripture because they were asking him are you that Elijah amen are you are you that Elijah and he said no not the one you're looking for that's going to restore all things so he knew what they were looking for so he denied being Elijah though he was Elijah he come with the spirit and the power of Elijah but he knew what Elijah they were talking about no I'm not that Elijah so but if you want to see where I'm at as a forerunner I'm in Isaiah chapter 40 here is the word that spoke of me now I'm going to just say this if it spoke of the first Forerunner it speaks of the second Forerunner so if it's a word given to the first it's a word given to the last amen because we are in the second coming of the Lord right and so again as we look at this he says he says these words Comfort ye Comfort ye my people saith your God you so I'm going to send you a message and this message will be a message of comfort you know a lot of times people will look at it well it's a message of judgment and it judges here and it's really judgmental no it's only just judging sin but for you it is a word of comfort for you it is a word of strength so he says Comfort ye Comfort ye my people sayth your God so he emphasizes I can say it like this he does it for the first the first Forerunner it's the same word of comfort for the last in fact the matter is our word of comfort is even greater than there because we go back to first Thessalonians 4 and he sums it up and he says as he talks about the Rapture the res res rection and he said wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen if there's any word of comfort today it is God is not going to leave us here we're going to escape the things that are coming on the earth the plagues that are about to fall upon Egypt and the land that we are leaving will not fall upon us we will escape because we are under a blood now so he says in Isaiah 40 and verse 2 speak ye comfortly to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her Warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she has received of the Lord's hands double for all her sins now actually this was Israel coming out of Babylon and this is words of comfort given to them as they will come back to the to their Homeland and and they had been judged and but but I want you to see and he said the Warfare is accomplished war is over her iniquity is pardoned and and she has received of the Lord's hands double but what about you what about you do you want to receive of your from the Lord's hands double for what you did are you with me think of this but I I want you to understand something according to Isaiah 53 says all we like sheep have gone astray and we all deserve punishment amen and we turned every man to his own way amen and the Lord oh I'm glad that says this has laid on him the iniquity to of us all so you see the Judgment that we were due because we strayed was poured out upon our lamb somebody help me preach and our lamb died in our place so we have received devil he has received of the Lord's hand and double for all all our sins brother it's paid in full paid in full whatever you want to think about however you want to look at it it's all paid in full Amen in fact he paid double for it are you with me amen he more than he more than paid for your sins amen and your the war is over amen the war is over and you're iniquity is pardoned hallelujah oh my how could it be pardoned and you got to pay double amen but he took the payment and paid it He Paid a Debt I did not owe I owed a debt I couldn't pay I needed someone to take my sins away so the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all watch now the voice of him that crith in the wilderness verse three the voice of him that crith in the wilderness notice first of all it is it is the voice of him that crith remember remember John was not the one crying in the wilderness he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness he was the the one that was crying was God the one that was shouting was God Amen that that's exactly right it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't William brandham that God was that that was calling out it was God calling out through William brandham he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness John was outside of the religious systems of Pharisees the Sadducees and and the herodians and all the other culous things that they had in that day he was outside of that he was a voice of one that was shouting in the wilderness amen what was he doing he was saying make straight in the desert a highway for our God Amen make the path clear let's get ready for him to come amen this is what our message of comfort is prepare the way he's coming amen he's coming Amen in fact of the matter is he's he's more than just on his way he's already made major steps in this day he came in the form of his word to a prophet he comes in the form of a bride in this last day and then finally he'll come in the form of the groom where we'll meet him in the air amen so you see what was it God had to make send a messenger and say make the path straight get ready for his coming every Valley of neglect to truth will be exalted and every mountain and and Hill that man has exalted of man-made theology will be brought low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough places made plain and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed Hallelujah that's what this message is it's his glory being revealed his glory would open up Seven Seals an entire book would be open his glory will be revealed in Bride form his glory is being revealed in you this morning the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and His glory shall be revealed when we meet him in the air and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it we're all going to see it amen now that day with the with that Forerunner the glory the lord was revealed in Groom form today his glory is being revealed in Bride form amen soon we will meet him in the air he will be revealed in that form now the voice said shout verse six the voice said cry or shout you see the message is a shout this is 1 Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout so you see the the message of the Forerunner is a shout it's Gathering the people together it's making ready for the Lord to come amen is preparing a people for his coming so again as we see the he says the voice said cry and he said what shall I cry well all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is the flower of the field the grass withered the flower fadeth because the spirit of the Lord bloweth up upon it surely the people is grass the grass withth and the flower fadeth but the word of our God shall stand forever what in the world is he saying there he said everything of man and everything of the flesh all of his schools and his Halls of theology it's like grass it's going to fade it's temporary it's going to go away but I'm giving you something greater than man-made ideas you will be established on the word of God and the word of my God shall stand forever Hallelujah let me just tell you friend this message is not a temporary message it's an eternal message oh Zion that that represents the bride that bringeth good tidings get thee up to the high mountains of Jerusalem that bringeth good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up Be not Afraid and say unto the city of Judah behold your god look here he is he's revealing himself through a prophet look here he is it's the word that has been brought look who he is it's the word made flesh in bright form look he's here this is God hallelujah we got to understand who this is Among Us and it's him manifested in bright form we are his church we are his body continuing his ministry because she is him amen behold your God behold the Lord God will come with a strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work is before him what is his reward for us a Rapture amen a new body you you want a crown a great crown I'll tell you what I'll just take a new body let me be crowned amen may may I be crowned with life amen behold the Lord your God will come with a strong hand we saw him come as he prepared for the shout and with healings with Miracles with signs and wonders you see it was him with a strong hand was him his arm was not short that it could not heal amen his arm was not short that he could not save his arm reached out remember he says who have believed I report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed When You Believe his report the strength of God will be revealed when you believe the word when you accept his message come on somebody when you do that what happened then you'll see his arm revealed amen the moment you believe that's when All Things become possible amen I love this verse he shall feed his flock Like a Shepherd He Shall Gather his Lambs with his arms he shall carry them in his bosom and he shall gently lead those that are with young you talking about a caring God Jes a comforter feeding his flock Like a Shepherd seeing the every need that you have look at him in Psalms 23 he leads me to side Still Water he restoreth my soul goodness and mercy not not evil and wrong but goodness and mercy is going to follow me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever he shall feed his flock like a shepherd He Shall Gather the Lambs with his arms he shall carry them in his bosom sometimes we seem like just can't make another step that's right but that's when he carries us amen you know you you're walking along with a five six year- old child and and you know Daddy gets to you know is holding his hand and they're going down and you know you want that child to run and do as long as he can especially if the journey is long but when he can't go no more there's Daddy to pick him up and carry him and that's the way it is with you you see God wants you to run and Skip and do everything you can and when you can but when you can't go another step when the doctor's report says it's all over when the news is the worst it can be this is when he just Scoops you up in his arms and he carries you Hallelujah he carries you and he gently leads those that are with young amen if you would read down from verse 12 to verse 27 he goes into the whole discourse about telling how that our God is greater than Idols of wood and gold and silver or stone he tells us there's no comfort in them that's right this is what even says in Jeremiah 10 don't learn the way of the Heathen that goes and cuts down a a tree and and then cuts it and carves faces in it and and decks it with gold and silver and makes an idle out of it and you Bow Down and Worship something said you have to support it or it would fall over you have to carry it if it goes anywhere it's it's just it's just an idol but he he talks about our God our God is not an idol he's a living God he's at everpresent help in the time of trouble amen amen so so he tells over and again he just goes through example after an example in the in verses 12- 27 and tells how our God is greater amen I'm glad to be serving a god that is greater than these Idols that make out of sports can you imagine that being the god that you serve you know in adultery and filth and all the all the the rotten life Styles it to live what did they ever do for you amen what did they ever do for you what could they ever do for you nothing amen so they'll make them out of Hollywood or this or that and the other God's out of money whatever it is you know you see none of them are do our worship but we have a living God and so he says in verse 28 now he changes again and and he and after talking about all the idols and idolatry and he hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary and there's no searching of his understanding he ain't run out of strength he ain't run out of power he ain't run out of saving he ain't run out of healing he ain't run out of Deliverance amen our God is the ever strong never weary one and he loves to help the weak and he loves to help the weary [Applause] people I'm glad he loves to help he doesn't look down at you and scoff at you and say you weakling he knows you weak he understands your flesh that's right he sees your inability he knows he knows listen even even a hundredy old brother Brandon would talk about that Abraham being 100 year old he said in comparison to God he's a baby so he said here I'm El shat I just nurse from me amen you know I I you know you you you have that with with with God God is El Shad I just ner strength from me you're just a baby you know in comparison to me you're 100 years old is nothing oh you know I think sometimes sometimes we we get up aged and we think oh we're just all washed up no we're not God appeared un Moses when he was 80 amen he he appears to Abraham when he's hundred and says I'm Eli and I'm going to give you a child he waits until Sarah is 90 God loves and cares for the old we never get too old to be Out Of Reach of God's mercies he's still our healer our still deliverer we just get more needy and more dependent on him and say God we can't depend on our own strength anymore we need you and if you're not there you'll get there one day time goes on but again hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth he fth not he neither is weary there's no searching of his understanding he doesn't he doesn't run out of understanding he understands he don't get weary he don't get tired of your prayers he don't get tired of you knocking on his door he don't he he doesn't get listen we we get we get tired of somebody coming to us and say will you help me will you help me come on I helped you last time yeah we get weary of that but not God come to me you that are heavy laden come to me you that are weary I will give you rest this is his word he's a comforter yes oh people want to know God oh the mighty judge the lion I don't ever want to see him as judge and lion amen I want to every time I look at him I want to I want to see him as a lamb that's where he was with with with with when John was approaching there with the book remember and the book that was held in the hand of of of one who was on the throne yes and he said we've not John the lion of the tribe of Judah he had prevailed and and opened the book amen think of that remember Esther she she was in the Bible she knew about her husband being King and to go into his presence without permission and had to be dressed right and everything and she could if wasn't accepted she would be destroyed she knew he was a lion amen she knew he her husband was a lion we know our husband the bridegroom is a lion we saw him take hold to death squeeze him until he had to let go and took away the keys to his kingdom where he doesn't even have a key to his own house we know he is the one that is and and was and is to come we know he is one of power but you see he's not only a lion but because he's a priest after the order of MDC he is also lamb thank you Lord you see mzc was a king of Salem and the priest of the most high God he was both priest and King and so when they saw him you know he would he was he could he could be our high priest now you know Paul had to explain this in the book of Hebrews because Jesus was not of the tribe of levit so how could he be the high priest so he says but you're a high priest he's a high priest after the order of MDC that's you see in Israel God divided there the the the Priestly lineage for for for Levi and the King lineage for Judah the scepter will never leave the hand of Judah till Shiloh comes so they knew the king lion was Judah whever they call they picked a man out of out of Benjamin I don't know he had to come from he had to come from Judah to be the king and you remember in the Bible that a king of Judah wanted to offer incense in the Tabernacle and the priest said no that's only for the priest and he said oh oh you know he he said I'm doing it anyway I'm the king and he goes on in and leprosy strikes him why why because he was as a king even though he was a great man and and had Authority had no Authority there but Jesus was of the lineage of MDC yes so he was the lion of Judah and yet he was the priest of the most high God lamb so when John hears that the lion of the tribe of Judah have prevailed he looks to see a lion and he sees a lamb hallelujah amen do you hear what I'm trying to say to you this morning amen he is a king and he will destroy those who who contaminate and destroy the Earth come on he will bring Vengeance he's a mighty lion he'll rule his King over the Earth in the Millennium but right now when we look at him what do we see l a high priest that can be touched he's a lamb so Esther walks in the presence of this lion and he changes to lamb what do you want ask anything I'll give you even half the kingdom amen you'll reign with me whatever whatever you want whatever you desire Esther it's for you reach out and get it holding out the scepter he didn't she didn't see a king she saw a lamb Hallelujah she didn't see a judge she saw a lamb the King the lion just melted became a lamb Esther my queen yes and when we look at him even though he is lying we will never see him as our judge cuz he took our judgment for us our sins were laid upon him Hallelujah and he took it for us and he will never judge you come on read Romans 8 will he judge you not Christ who is he that condemn you not Jesus amen he'll never give up loving you no no no he'll never give up loving you goodness and mercy will get on your Trail and will bring you back no matter if you stray his Mercy endur forever that's why we can look for him to reach out and save our prodical cuz he's a god rich in Mercy lion and lamb the Bible said hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting lasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fth not neither is weary and there is no searching of his understanding this is him the ever strong and never weary one that loves to help weary and weak people how true this is of our comforter for he said for you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost the comforter has coming upon you it's that hidden power that rises up when you can't go no further and there are times that you get so weak you cannot go any further amen you reach the end of your rope as it were and in that moment there is a hidden power that rises up within you that gives you strength for the journey to take another step to believe one more time to accept his promise once again a hidden power is called the holy ghost that hidden power was in Samson it wasn't Samson he was you know when the lion roared against him he was just a curly-headed little shrimp little seven little locks hanging around his shoulders he was a weaking a a dwarf that's how brother brandom expl called him a a he was a shrimp a weakling a a dwarf he said if he was 9 foot tall and you know had muscles the size of basketballs you know if he was like that he said it' been nothing you know oh a strong man to go up and lift up the gates or defeat this or fight and win he said that that's wasn't it at all it wasn't his strength it was his Covenant with God Amen it was his Covenant with God and that was shown identified in his Seven Locks you see he was a a dwarf like every man is without God you little midgets little bitty nothings little Dwarfs little nobody little weaklings that's who we are I'll go out I'll go out and fight the enemy you'll get blinded Samson if you go out without God Amen but here the lion came you know came to get him but in that moment the hidden power came out amen the Holy Spirit came on him and he grabbed that lion and slew it like it was nothing you see you see because there was a an anointing that went with the Covenant and remember His was external and showed by external sign yours is eternal and it's internal and it can never be taken away from you Samson's could be cut off but really yours cannot ever be separated but nothing can separate you come on the Bible say nothing can separate you from the love of God Amen somewhere hidden in you this morning is a hero of Faith it's that Holy Ghost down on the inside of you is a David there's a giant roaring against him but greater a giant was in David that's right you see you couldn't see the giant in David but there was a giant in David there was a hidden power when David slung a stone amen it was God that got in that arm you see there was hidden power in the three Hebrew children and you know someone bigger and greater and stronger than them he you know he was the Fourth Man In The Fire And he just come and showed up all of a sudden he's there in the fire and he's there but I want you to know when you get in the fire you don't have to wait for him to come he's already inside you amen you got a greater comforter than what they had there was law and it was external but this is this is a new covenant and it's internal he's going to abide with you forever you see there's a fire that is in you that is greater than the gates of hell so you're looking at the Destroyer there's a greater destroyer in you than the Destroyer out there is in the world come on what did he do he destroyed drinking and smoking and adultery and pornography and every kind of evil and come on he's a destroyer and before the destroying Angel could come and wreck and ruin your life he came and destroyed that in your life verse 30 tells us about the youth the youth shall faint they shall lose heart and they shall be weary they'll give up because of their weariness and the young men shall utterly fall or they'll be exhausted but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength amen waiting of the Lord means to fix your Gaze on him amen refusing to look at anything else but him amen just him and his word that's all you're going to look at I consider not my body now dead Abraham said you see that's what waiting on God means they that wait wait on the Lord those that fix their Gaze on him those that refuse to let circumstances drag them down they that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength what shall they do you see waiting on the Lord is an act of faith and a trust in him an attitude of expectancy that he's he will surely show off in our in our lives so we can experience him with his presence and his Loving Care think of that they that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength 1 Corinthians 4:16 says for which cause we faint not now here he's talking about Christians and the troubles and the tribulations that we call and he says and he says for this cause we faint not for but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day you may be getting weak in your flesh but the inward man is renewed day by day look what they will do they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles hey I I I am trying to tell you of of the promise of the word for your hour this is the message of comfort that our gods are not gods of Idols but our God is a real and living God and those who serve him that wait upon him that keep their gaze upon him they shall Mount up amen with wings as an eagle I don't care how many stores might have blowed you down I don't care how decrepid you feel and how weary you've been the word of the Lord to you this morning is you will Mount up with wings as Eagles you are under an anointing to overcome in this hour they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary we're talking about a supernatural renewed strength a strength that would compare to mounting up where as an eagle or running without fatigue amen so you see they shall walk and not faint this isn't about showing God how strong we are and asking him to give us a bit more no it's here we admit we don't have the strength we need that's we acknowledge we need the strength that only he can give and we wait for him and that's more than just passing time Amen in Hebrews it it means it means a a a hopeful expectation Amen in the midst of hardship we look to him as the one who's going to work everything out for our good now when Jesus was here he carried so much for the people that he healed the sick he comforted their hearts he gave words these words of comfort he said let not your hearts be troubled as you believed in God believe in me in my father's house are me Mansions I go to prepare a place for you I I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also so you see these are words of comfort we can look at at our bodies and theyve getting decrepit and we know we got a mansion we're going to this is only temporary but there's a mansion there's a mansion waiting Yonder that the Savior have prepared prepared me he told us this before he went away he said that he would come someday and you know bring us to our home and glory and I'm waiting I'm waiting for that day aren't you waiting for it that is our hopeful expectation when all the world gives way around us we know we have a mansion waiting Yonder it's important was very important that he go away Jesus had to leave you know why he was the fullness of the godhead and a body as long as he stayed here it would always be God With Us that's right and US unchanged that's unchanged a lion cussing Peter with a determination I'll never deny you don't need to do it that's right as long as he's just with us we're still in trouble cuz there's times we get away from Jesus come on Amen if he was if he was here in physical body he could you know then then what if he goes to Africa well I'm left alone what if he goes visits the Saints and Canada I'm left alone what if he goes home with you and I don't have him amen you see he says he makes it clear it's important that I go away because if I don't go away the comforter can't come the only way that the spirit of God can come is for me to leave because in me dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily and so I'll comfort no no doubt it was comforting think about it yeah it was comforting that on a stormy sea didn't know that Jesus could walk on Troubled Waters to get to you or that Jesus was in the boat with you but God wanted the comforter who was with them then to be in them he cared so much that when he knew that he knew he must leave in order that the comforter could come amen for he says he will give you another comforter and this comforter will not be temporary but it be the spirit of truth that he may abide with you forever you see it would not be a another person but it would be the spirit of Truth which would be the spirit of Jesus wouldn't be a second or third person in the godhead it would be the same God the spirit of truth would be the spirit of Jesus I will not leave you comfortless John 14:18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you amen and when the comforter comes the world would see him no more but he said you will see me in that day you will know I'm in you that it would no longer be God with us but it would now be God in us amen so he said yet a little while the world see me no more but you see me because I live you live also and at that day you will know that I am in my father and you are in me and I'm in you he made no question left no question about it when he says I am going to be in you I'm moving from this state of with you to coming in you verse 26 but the comforter which the H which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you this is the evidence of the Holy Ghost According To Jesus Christ himself is not tongues is not long hair it's not long dresses is not the forms of Holiness this is the evidence of the Holy Ghost According To Jesus Christ for he said he will teach you all things he will be the inside teacher no longer external you know if you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you really won't need a much more sermon on Holiness you you really won't have to get some some Pastor to PR you to go to church amen you will love to be in the house of God it will be your custom as it was Jesus come on when you get the Holy Ghost on the inside of you he will be the inside teacher notice what he do he will teach you all things and then he will bring all things you remembrance whatever I said unto you in the very moment where you would do wrong the word will come to you he will Quicken the word right to your heart he'll bring that word to your memory he'll be your memory amen amen look at this John 16:7 for he says he tells us I go away I'm going to return in the form of the Holy Ghost as a comforter and the comfor in you will testify and bear witness of me look at verse 7 John 16 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you it is necessary it it's absolutely of utmost importance that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come to you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he is coming he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment he will reprove the world of sin he will teach righteousness and he will show you things to come amen he'll take the things I've taught you and reveal them to you you see no man can understand the word outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when a man says he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and disputes the word of God being right you know there's something wrong somewhere cuz he cannot deny himself the Bible says that about him he cannot deny himself this is why brother bradam said how could you say you have the Holy Ghost and you're cutting your hair and you're painting your face and you're doing things contrary to the word and all cuz he cannot deny himself so in John 16 and9 he will convinced them of sin because they believe not on me you see the ultimate sin is to not believe on Jesus Christ of righteousness because I go to my father and you see in me no more so the Holy Ghost is here dwelling in you to show the righteousness of God Amen by right living by holy life a lot of times we talk about the works that I do shall you do also and we think of it only as signs wonders and miracles but also but what about the miracle of righteous living amen that that is it the Holy Ghost is here to show the righteousness of God he can take a man or woman so steeped in sin that it show nothing but the world and sin and evil and take it so transforming till he shows the world the righteousness of God hallelujah that's a exactly what you're doing I mean they you know our sisters it ain't modeling an oldfashioned dress that we're talking about it is displaying the righteousness of God Amen Brothers it's not when you when you have when you when you live decent and holy and righteous and refuse to walk according to the the the the Cults of the world and I'm talking about their dress their behavior and all that they are when you refuse that he is showing he his righteousness through you amen righteousness and daddies righteousness and Mama righteousness and sisters brothers when he has come he will show the world righteousness he took sinful men as I said a denying Lyon cussing Peter and made him a righteous Son of God come on he'll take a Prejudice hateful man like Saul come on with man-made Holiness and man-made righteousness and show through him the real righteousness of God when he comes he will convince the world of judgment because the prince of this world is judged Jed he will show sin has been judged in your life that old porn demon that once held you is judged is dead is kicked out has no more control over you and another king is sitting on your throne he will convince the world of judgment amen because the prince of the world is judged don't you remember when it was judged in your life amen When sin was judged sin is more than a than an actx sin is a spirit and when that Spirit was judged and cast out of your life amen listen listen what happened he then Christ becomes our mediator is all judgment is given to him and all power in Heaven and Earth and he is the judge of this world and no one else so Esther knew you know if she could get in the presence that's right and she could tell the king who was a lamb to her amen but if she could tell him what Wicked hmon was doing she knew the lion would rise up in him you ever get the lion to Rise Up in Jesus tell him about your sickness tell him about what the devil's been doing to you tell him tell him how he's attacked her family tell him how he to pull you into poverty tell him go tell the king Hallelujah that's what the bride of Christ ought to be doing this morning Esther go tell the king you're the queen go tell him what's happening to you and your people see if there won't be a word released see if he won't hand you the pen see if he won't let you right to EDI see see if you want come on see if he won't let you release a word against your enemy and your enemy will come crashing down see if he [Applause] won't you can bring the lion out in him tell him all about your trouble he will hear your famous cry and he will answer amen he will answer Christ says judgment committed to him as mediator all power in Heaven and Earth Is His he is a judge of this world no one else as brother Bram spoke about this in the sermon he cares do you care it's a wonderful sermon you should listen to it he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I'll send the Holy Spirit and he will continue my care for you thank until he returns and he says there's no one cares like Jesus this ought to make you run to the aisle speaking in tongu shouting and dancing no one cares like Jesus knowing that his body is high priest and a mediatorial work that he's doing now that body must be in the presence of God at all time for intercession that God cannot see the sinner's sin he sees only the blood of his own son and knowing that he sent back the Holy Spirit to continue to comfort his people oh Hallelujah does he care certainly he cares now he was continue to care for his people here on Earth in the same manner he cared for them when he was here did he care about sickness did he care about Sin did he care about the maniac did he care about those who nobody cared for there's nobody car like Jesus amen and then the Rapture when he comes again he will leave the father's Throne intercession will then be over that's amen now don't be like fitus and hus who said the resurrection was passed because they had a spiritual application of you know we we uh are raised again in Christ we're resurrected and ascended into heaven took Paul's words of being in the Heavenly place and say well the resurrection's passed and we're always and and began to overthrow the faith of some and Satan would use these things to try to overthrow your faith to get you to believe things that are not yet yet to happen you see if you you cannot mislocate the word of God brother Bram talked about three things we must not do and mislocate is one of them and and that is to apply it when it's when it's not time to be applied right so you see it'll be in the Rapture when he comes again I'm talking about the meeting in the there he will leave the father's throne and intercession will then be over that's right now some say because they're fitus and hus that got a damnable doctrine that that takes away faith and overthrows Faith of some they say that intercession is all over oh no if that's so then the coming is over and we missed it you know I I've had somebody write me here some time ago and said we're already in glorified bodies I said I'm sorry I said I missed it some oh yeah yeah you already got yours brother Tim I'm disappoint pointed in it not the Mansion I thought amen this one's got rust on the door handles this's got wrinkles this's got a lot of troubles amen I I don't know where people come up with this oh well he's he's already left the mercy seed and intercession is over oh no that's so the com's over and we missed it amen but when he comes he will leave the heavens no longer will he intercede on behalf of men and he will come for his bride and we will meet him in the air amen amen and not only not not only is he within us working out for our good but he's presently in the heavens amen as our Advocate our champion that's you see our supporter our backer standing Before the Throne the Bible said he's our advocate he is our high priest who can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities When you pray he backs it up yes Father I paid for their healing come on you you see he he pictured it like this where that you know because he he showed himself as a man you see as an intercessor or a mediator between God and man so he came as as El gior the Mighty God spoke of in the in Isaiah's prophecy where he would come as the Everlasting father the Mighty God the prince of Beast he would be elabore which means the mighty l or the hero God or the warrior God because he would come to take on human battles amen Jesus was tempted in all points like we are yet without sin so whatever you're tempted by and Trouble by he was already tempted by it and overcome it so it's already defeated and if he defeated it in Jesus when Jesus comes in you by the Holy Ghost it'll defeated [Applause] again so well I got the Holy Ghost but them but I can't stay out of P porn let me tell you if Jesus is in there he don't do porn amen he doesn't do that he doesn't smoke he doesn't drink he doesn't amen so when we come before the throne of grace we can find a helper help a helper an advocate a champion a supporter our backer you you stand on the earth and you bind it and I'll bind it in [Music] heaven amen you loose it and I'll Loose It come on I'm talking about what a comfort it is to know know that we have a God in heaven who is our friend now there was once there was once that man could not approach the presence of God because of sin but Jesus came and dealt with sin question and then he ascends on high in order that he might be the advocate the helper the supporter yes and your only approach to Spirit God is through the man Christ Jesus that's why we ask anything in his name because that's the only way approach we have to God you cannot approach him without Jesus amen only in him is redemption of sins so you must approach him through Jesus the man Christ Jesus so you see he is our Advocate our champion our supporter our backer and he's standing Before the Throne as our Advocate and he is our high priest who can feel our infirmities When you pray he backs it up and said yes Father I paid it all there sin is paid for their sickness is paid for their need is supplied I know he's going to supply cuz he said my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory somebody help me preach I paid for it so therefore I'm their backer do you realize in heaven you've got a supporter amen Jesus is your supporter amen I will support you whatever you ask for I'm going to support it I'm going to stand behind it do anything ask anything amen it is the word amen you might think well but brother Tim the seals are open so he's taken the book and that means he's left the throne and he's no more intercessor well that will be true one day when he physically takes the book you see this happened in three first symbolically to John amen man so it could be written second by Revelation to the seventh angel so that which was written symbolically could be revealed and then it will happen literally in physical when he takes his bride into glory for they were what the book was representing symbolically so when you're look at the whole picture there that there when you see a lamb Jesus is no hooked animal with seven heads are seven horns and seven eyes that's not what he looks like you you're not going to see him like that that was symbolic of his Redemption work when he took the book he was claiming the redeemed for they are the names in the book amen so what did God do he revealed this symbolically to John Revelation to brother brandham but one day he's going to physically take the book he's going to take the bride the people the redeemed and take them to his possession for himself as the bridegroom Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen so and Awakening Jesus brother Brandon said we want to see Jesus I want to see him we know his body will not return to the Earth until he comes for the church chur it must remain there for a sacrifice is that right it must be on the altar he sits on the throne of God tonight it must remain here therefore for by his stripes he is the sacrifice and the sacrifice is on the Altar and his body cannot come but his life returned that was in Christ came back on the church in the form of the Holy Spirit and and the Holy Spirit it wasn't that body that did it anyhow it's not me me that doth the work it's my father that dwelleth in me that doeth the works so you see it was it's the spirit we needed Amen in the in the message the trial brother Brandon said the Corporal body is sitting at the right hand of God to make intercessions but the Holy Ghost has come to carry on his work I want you to know in John 14 Jesus said he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also so where is the body it's there on the throne it is the sacrifice it is the mediator it is the advocate it is our backer amen so when you when you approach the throne he doesn't see you he sees your sacrifice he doesn't see your failures your past he sees your sacrifice he do look to see if you are without blemish he looks to see the lamb without blemish therefore you can both approach the throne of God knowing you will find Grace favor in the your time of need oh I'm glad for a comforter like that that I can be comforted knowing that when I pray amen I've got a backer there a supporter who's standing in my place amen the body of Jesus is on the throne of God he uses our body to manifest himself through just like he promised to do the works that I do shall you do also that's a testimony on the sea you see it's the hour for his power to be displayed in in the his bride and when we apply the token on the earth that hidden power he backs it up in heaven and when does Satan falls like lightning crashing downward but because he he there as the accuser of the Brethren and he every every time that his lies or what he says is said before the throne he is defeated and cast down now so the Holy Ghost must be displayed for the bride and Christ are one notice you have the same spirit that was in Jesus not a different Spirit the same Holy Ghost Jesus had you have same anointing he had which is the Holy Ghost you have was more than anointing it was an indwelling spirit so he dwells in you so the token is the Holy Ghost upon the church that they see Christ it has to be because a woman and her husband become one and so does the bride and Christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same amen remember these this former treaties o theopus I've written to you that Jesus began and brother Bradon would add and continues to do his death didn't stop him no sir he returned again not a third person but the same person returned again in the form of the Holy Ghost to continue the work on and continues on said the book of Acts Jesus Christ the same yesterday to day and forever that's the token that's the sign and when Peter and John and and passed through the gate called Beautiful there laid a man who was crippled from his and lame from his mother's womb he said Silver and Gold Have I None but such I have I give to you in the name of Jesus of Nazareth rise up and walk and they talked to him and knew that they were ignorant and unlearned men but they took notice they had been with Jesus see the token the Holy Ghost was their display amen see such as I have oh God thank you Lord that we don't have to draw insufficient funds Hallelujah that such as I have I give amen you you got to realize what's on the inside of you you have something to give seeing a poor crippled Fallen brother laying there disfigured everything and the same life that was in Christ was in them and said such as I have Amen in my name you will cast out devils not I will you will if you say to this mountain not if I say if you say I want see I want you to see Jesus transferred it to you amen you will cast out devils not I will you will amen you will speak with new tongues amen you will say to this mountain not me I I you will do it oh brother the hour is here that the token must be displayed we're know we're near the end now we brought up all kinds of messages show signs and wonders and now here we come back for what the church has got to do the token the Holy Ghost has got to be displayed notice this it's got to be on display it's got to be on display with a righteous life judgment against sin bring into remembrance what he said to us an inside teacher amen but also with signs and wonders amen because what Jesus began to do in Galilee he continues to do now through the display of the token of the Holy Spirit back in the church for you see it was never ever the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy holy ghost in the apostles amen that was the token sign then that's the sign now amen the holy ghost in the people the book of Acts continued not men doing works it's God working in the people amen when Peter and John saw the blind beggar they used the power and they had to take heed they had been with Jesus why they had displayed the token the sign the Holy Ghost the spirit was upon him before his crucifixion was now upon them after his resurrection and Ascension then that makes him Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's how we know he lives amen because we live and because we're like him that's how we know he lives how do you know he lives you've never seen his personage you've never seen his human form he's never walked down these aisles how do you know he lives cuz he lives in you and because the works that you couldn't do you now do the life you now live in the flesh you live by the faith of the Son of God that's how we know he lives amen we know he lives when he takes a sinner and makes a saint out of him we know he lives when he takes someone bound with habits of sin and changes their lives and radically transforms them we know that he lives amen he shows himself alive amen it displays it makes him the same yesterday today and forever now let's go to John 15 and verse 26 but when the comforter is come whom I will send to you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning so no notice he told us the spirit would come who the father would send in his name he would testify in him in other words he would do the same things that he did the Holy Spirit working through the Tabernacle that he Sanctified would do the same things that he did oh that ought to do something for us today that we know that right among us we have the same comforting Lord Jesus in the form of the Holy Ghost amen another office that God is working him through amen working in now because it's more than through you it's in you now Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also I'm going to the father I'm going to send back the Holy Spirit which will be me in spirit form be the same Jesus the spirit of Jesus just prove it the Bible said if you have not the spirit of Christ you're none of his so you have to have the spirit of Jesus the spirit of Christ and I'll be with you and I'll dwell in you and the Very things I've done here the holy spirit will do again in my nameen it'll be the acts of the Holy Spirit and he will he will be doing the work watch and he cares for you he said he made this directly sure he will speak in my name the works that I do shall you do also when he's upon you see he would comfort in the same way by forgiving all our sins healing all our sickness speaking to us of all of comfort of a kingdom that is to come and and proving himself among us as God proved himself Among Us by Jesus Christ First Timothy 3:16 it's written to know about God without controversy we realize great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh see he was manifested in the flesh God not another person God himself revealed manifested in the flesh and then to make it another step closer he sends the Holy Spirit to care for our comfort and he abides in us notice here the the token the Holy Ghost is no good unless it's displayed I don't care what kind of giant was in David if it wasn't displayed he would have done it no good if he just sat back and just coward it like the rest of Israel come on or just remain silent but it had to be on display the Holy Ghost is there to be displayed not a sympathizer but the token must be applied now you know that's why you know sometimes I you know sometimes we we we hear of little arguments I don't agree with brother Tim on this you know you know I I I believe I can have the Holy Ghost and and still still be in pornography and and all kinds of other things like that so wait a minute how can you say you have the token and your comfort is pornography your gratification is porn here's my comfort my comfort is that sin no longer Reigns its power has been broken hallelujah amen yes sir that's where our comfort is is sin no longer Reigns and its power has been broken you see that the Holy Ghost and its works are our identification now I I I just want to say this as we've coming to a close here in just a few more minutes perhaps we might hear emphasized the scripture but many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have not we done many mighty wondrous Works in thy name and he will say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you and I want to say amen I want to say that scripture is very true that there will absolutely be impersonators but that doesn't take away from the fact that we're to continue his ministry that the works that he did we are to do also that we must manifest the promised word of his day and its signs are our identification now it's more than one sign sure a sign of a Believer is I I confess Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior if you won't confess him as Lord and Savior you're not a believer but that's not all the signs you can make a confession with your mouth and not believe from the heart and there's many that do it because why their confession is not sincere it's his words but it's part of our identification you see we wanted one identification if we speak in tongues we got it and God says it's not one thing so you know unless there's something wrong with them like some disease or sickness or something like that chemical thing humans all humans have hair but everything that has hair is not a human but it's one of the identifications of human so you see yes we there there again Holy Ghost people speak with in other tongues it's one of identifications of Believers this is what will be among believers they will speak with tongues but not everything that speaks with tongues is a believer amen I you know you hear some people come along that that are in Witchcraft and demon possession and say I can speak in tongues I believe in speaking in tongues well sure they do and they speak in tongues but it's not the Holy Ghost you see it's a it's demonic demonic influence that people can come under but the real Holy Ghost will speak with tongues it will convince you of sin it will it will it has many identifications it's more than hair on the head to be a human or hair on the body to be a human it's more than that it's more than just everything you know human gives live birth it don't hatch from eggs but everything that doesn't hat from an egg that gives Liv's birth is not a human so I want you to understand it but it doesn't that that many will come in that day and say have not I done many mighty Works in thy name and and have not we cast out Devils have not we done Mighty works and he said depart from me you you worker of iniquity I never knew you but that doesn't take away from the fact that signs will identify Believers in my name they will cast out devils in my name they will speak with new tongues amen these signs of violence and believe not just professors but identifi Believers amen they may not follow they probably will perhaps they will Jesus said they shall follow them that believe it's just impossible for it not to happen the works that I do shall you do also that's the identification Jesus identification was to manifest the word of God which he was and the church's identification today is to manifest the promised word of this day by The Same Spirit that manifested and quickened the word then the Same Spirit quickens the word to the believer today and manifests the same thing showing that the token is on this person which is the resurrected life of Jesus Christ Living in his believer oh that ought to set the Church of fire amen and he said it's just as true as true can be so what is it you see it is it is exactly sign follow them the Believers amen what they will the sin will be judged amen you will be identified as a Son of God by works by life the life you live amen all of this will be it's not just one thing that makes a human many things make up a human not one thing makes up the Holy Ghost many things make up the Holy Ghost there are things the Holy Ghost does the devil impersonates but that don't make it untrue it's still the truth amen the signs still follow them that Believers believe amen and your character is God's character amen your life is God's life that's the comforter how comforting it is to know that in an hour like this that we possess the same spirit that was in Jesus and if it raised Jesus up from the dead and Quicken his mortal body it also will transform you not only just in the transformation in the future but right now you who were in sins and dead Works hath he made alive Hallelujah I'm talking to a living bride and that's why we have comfort this morning he said he'll abide with you forever he doesn't come and go he doesn't depart from you he seals you to the day of redemption he's not your God in good times and not your God in bad times he's your God all the time the comforter has come you have him and and one day that Spirit of Jesus that is in you and you and you and you and you and around the world one day one day that spirit that he sent back his own Spirit he will rise up from the throne taking the book are you with me taking the book taking the people taking a Rapture and He will draw to himself everyone that has that spirit and it'll all come back into him we're not at the initiating of this we're at the ending of it and I tell you he's about to gather his spirit and everyone who who has that Holy Spirit will be gathered to meet him in the air that's what Believers believe and if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal body oh yes it will Quicken it and you'll speak perhaps in other languages it will Quicken it and you will be with identified works it will Quicken your mortal body and you'll move away from the Hollywood ideas of the world and live and act like a a a holy man or a holy woman righteousness will be displayed amen it will Quicken your mortal body but one day it's going to make alive your mortal body so much that you're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Hallelujah your hair will come back the right color again amen the wrinkles will just fall right off of you Eternal youth will come upon you and you'll be changed from the creature that you are oh my what a day that will be amen what a comforter that we have the comforter has come I'll never leave you or forsake you I want you to go with me me to the book of Hebrews to a very familiar scripture as a musicians come and I want just to look at these words together Hebrews chapter 13 you say brother Tim you're going to go you're going to go to Hebrews 13 and8 yeah I'm going to read that he says in verse five let the way you live be without covetousness be content with the things such things as you have for he has said will you say it with me I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me verse seven remember them which have the rule over you which have spoken to you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their way of life the way they live Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's right in that promise where he says I'm God and and I won't change that he says don't be Covetous of what others have be content with what you have for he said I will never leave you or forsake you I'm going to read it again when I do I want you to quote Hebrews 13 and8 he says I will never leave thee nor forsake thee Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever look what he says again so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper I will not fear what men or any devil can do to me Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is he that to you today what a comfort what a comfort he ain't left you
