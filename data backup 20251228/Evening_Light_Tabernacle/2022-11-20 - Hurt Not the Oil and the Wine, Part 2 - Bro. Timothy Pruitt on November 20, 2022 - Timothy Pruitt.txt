and you see our need today Lord you sing the needs that was listed behind represented by ever lifted hand we ask Lord that you would come and you would move and you would take control you see the need in my own body Lord we just give it to you today Lord Lord just take this service what you want to do with it have thy own way we pray we give it to you in Jesus name amen let's turn to Revelations chapter 6. amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen had a wonderful time yesterday of fellowship and I just want to thank everyone that was involved every person no matter how little or how much you brought and put your shoulder to the wheel to we want to say we appreciate that amen I know our young people and our children really appreciated that time just of enjoyment and to have a little fun and that's what it's all about amen God bless you today Revelations chapter 6 and verse 5 and says when he had opened up the third seal he heard the third Beast say come and see and beheld and low a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and he heard a voice in the midst of the four B saying a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine amen we let you be seated today spoke on this few Services ago and actually was going to continue this this last Wednesday Lord wanted had had solved that we was to speak something else but today I want to pick up on this again on hurt not the oil and the wine amen and I it must be very important because it was the lamb who spoke it it was a voice that was in the midst of the four beasts it wasn't even one of the anointings that spoke it but a voice in the midst and I believe that voice is still in our midst today and he's still moving and he's still touching and he's still speaking in that voice amen still speaks with power and authority amen and so we we look at this brother Branham took this question in the in the question and answers on the seals and he says what does see thou hurt not the oil and the wine mean in Revelation 6 and verse 6. he said it's the Holy Spirit see we just got through that probably somebody came in a little late for the message he said but what does the oil and wine mean the oil as we look in it in symbols that all represents the Holy Spirit and the wine and oil is connected together in Bible in the Bible Always In Worship they're always connected the wine as we know amen he said well I get the idea of stimulation wine stimulates amen wine is the answer type of is natural from stimulation comes the Revelation or from the Revelation comes of stimulation he said what stimulates the church Revelations amen so wine the new wine amen the oil and the wine went together in sacrifice and went together in church worship and so if it went together then it still goes together now amen maybe you don't understand how these come together but maybe you came a little bit late to the message amen but God spoke it at these may he said he put it in his word hurt not the oh he didn't just say hurt not the oil or hurt not the wine he said hurt not the oil and the wine because it takes both it takes spirit and it takes truth amen you can't have one or the other or one by itself but you have must have both of them working together he said but see you you see a whole stream all the way through the Bible of oil and wine always meeting together in worship he said if you follow it through the Bible it's always meeting together he said you can look at it in in Ezekiel you can find it in the Old Testament you can find it in the New Testament he says why do we anoint the sick with oil we anoint the sick with oil because it symbolizes him is symbolizing the pouring out of the Holy Spirit amen so that so the reason why we put oil upon people's forehead is representing the holy spirit that the holy spirit will be placed between you and that disease that is against you amen so we know that that works we've seen it work amen because we know his spirit is more powerful than any disease any problem any situation and so if you place it there amen between you and that there is a protection not of your own strength or your own ability but a protection of the Holy Ghost and we also see that the wise virgins had oil and the wise and The unwise Virgins did not have no oil amen so it always comes together and so he said the wine is a revelation that reveals the interpretation of the word which stimulates the believer he said he said well I you never seen that before he said my glory he said I I didn't see it either until the god opened it to me he said stimulation of Revelation it's the oil and the wine and I got to looking at this word stimulate amen because as a whole lot of words that comes behind that I like to follow those Trails sometimes stimulate synonyms of stimulate it means to encourage to inspire to prompt to Quicken to spark to Spur to trigger to vitalize to activate to animate Amen to move I thought what does that word come move it means to move one to the point of being violent amen that's in the scripture Jesus said the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent taketh by force amen so the word the Revelation when you begin to reveal to you that it's for you and his promises of God are yours and it's not just for somebody else or Mom and Daddy amen it begins to cause something to rise up on the inside of you Amen to where you can grab the promise of God for yourself and sometimes you're gonna have to fight tooth hand and nail with everything you got amen but you're going to stand there upon the word of God and not let Satan back you off of it therefore it's going to come move you it's going to move you to the point of becoming angry and violent and enlightening not allowing that devil to ever one more time talk you out of the promises of God but you're going to stand there and you're going to hold to it it's also to dynamize to elect to energize to enliven Amen to Exhilarate to Fan the fire I love a good service it ain't a bunch of water poured on and putting out the fire but I love it when the fan begins to move and you grab a hold I believe any god-called Son of God preacher of God preacher this message ought to be a fan in the hand of God to blow and to move and to Enlighten into and to and to build up demand to to make it move forward in the house of God it's to go just to grab you is to hook you it's to incite you amen I know this ain't good for Baptist but this is good for believers inflame you it's to instigate you it's to motivate you it's to move you it's to produce you amen sometimes that prod and don't feel too good amen but it moves you out of your comfort zone and moves you into another realm it's broadening you and saying look there's more steps for you to take there's more Mountains for you to climb up there's more valleys for you to conquer there's more enemies out there that we got to deal with and we gotta fight with and if I fight let me fight with all that I got amen is to prod you is to support you is to urge you it's to build a fire under you amen amen it's to fire you up it's to get you going it's to get you started it's to key you up to set you up to steam you up to stir you up to wake you up to work you up I like that really good right there amen God is not interested in you sitting in your doldrums and your bad attitudes and you can't do it in your wild see wowzy woofs he wants you to push past all your limitations push past the things that are trying to hinder you and to hold you he wants to kill you up let the master come and put his key in you and get that fire started okay amen bless you what is that brother Timothy it's wine revelation no that's some good old tea hot tea and I don't even like it but I got to drink it this morning but it's to steam you up is to stir you up is to wake you up it's to work you up this is the dictionary all right and then you may say well you're just trying to work them up well that's stimulation and it ain't me doing this the word is doing see that's the problem people think that it's a minister up there and he's trying to do something no he's preaching the word and the word is taking effect in lives and they begin to realize that Old Devil is not above me or whooping he's under my feet and it begins to move them to another round it's a way they can say oh things are possible Hallelujah it begins to stir something up on the inside of them amen it ain't just a work up in the you know that's that's the problem with the Enemy he wants to make it all just man's doings amen I'm getting used to my new voice for a minute too so just bear with me amen he's trying to get he's trying to make it all just man's abilities or it's all about just the man no it's the voice that's in the midst amen come on now it ain't just the man it's the voice that's behind the man amen it's the word is to work one up is to get one started it's a it's to move forward it's to it's to set you up set me up for what for victory not defeat it ain't setting you up for defeat it's setting you up that you arise above it it's to set you up in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be over emphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you know or realize he said I'm not talking about just the Book of Revelation I'm talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church we remember in Matthew chapter 16 where Jesus asked the disciples he said whom the men say that I the son of a son of man am he said some say that thou are John some say your lies some say you're Jeremiah's or one of the prophets he said but who do you say let me stimulate your faith for a minute who do you say that it is if this ain't nothing but a bunch of work up and some man's Kingdom and some man's idea amen it'll never do nothing for you but if you'll look beyond the fails of humanity that's exactly what they had to do that's what Peter had to do he had to look Beyond the Veil of humanity that was standing there before him and others were saying this some were not saying good things some were saying bad things some were calling him an illegitimate child some were saying he was you know he was born out of wedlock and all he was you know all these other ill-fame names they're trying to put on him but Peter looked beyond all of that and he said I believe Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood had not oh this wasn't passed down by intellectual reasoning and intellectual abilities and intellectual TED talks and teaching somebody well we got to have more teaching to get people established I agree Holy Ghost teaching not man's intellects not man's ideas but the spirit of God moving and touching it and changing hearts [Applause] but he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against him so the Roman Catholics take that and they build the church on Peter a man again it's all Peter sounded like it's being repeated in our generation too amen it's all William Branham it's all just a man he said that's really carnal how could God build a church Upon A man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while he's doing it God can't build his church upon any man any man any man born in sin he cannot build his church on any man born in sin it wasn't some rockly in there though God had howled the ground at that spot it isn't the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was built upon revelation flesh and blood is not revealed it but my father hath revealed it to you and Upon This Rock This Revelation I'll build my church what Revelation who Jesus was [Applause] how did Abel offer a better sacrifice than Cain did by revelation that's how your offering is going to be accepted is because of by Revelation it won't be because you got a certain head knowledge or certain abilities or are certain you're you you're going to out think or outsmart know anything about that or what you've done Cain brought all that he had done he brought his Altar and he built it up just pretty he had it all straightened out he didn't want nobody dancing around and nobody having a good time in the Lord nobody he wanted to show God his best and all of a sudden all of a sudden I can hear some noise as Abel decided it comes to that moment in his life to go off her sacrifice and he don't go and find something he'd done he goes find what God required and he finds a lamb out there and he puts a string around his neck he wasn't no good quiet nice little communion with God there was a lot of noise that took place there was a lot of blood that was shed it looked unhealthy it looked it looked like there wasn't it shouldn't be done it looked impossible amen that the God would accept this blood everywhere he said he got him a rock he laid that lamb upon that Altar and he began to hack at it let me tell you something that ain't no fun that is not no fun I did it not out of necessity not out not that I wanted to but it was out of necessity is actually right there in front of sister Angie's mom's house a deer run out of out in front of me was coming home late one night and it ran out in front of me and hit the side of that big old truck I used to have with that flatbed and it I knew I said man that deer is hurting or maybe dead I'll go back and see it's after midnight and uh I pull up turn around pull up there's deers in the in the middle of the road and and it ain't good shape his legs are broken but it's still trying to live and I thought man I go dig into my truck and I ain't got anything and I hear this voice out there at the house hey you hit a deer I said yeah I hit a deer you need a knife yeah I need a knife you got a knife sure went down there and Bobby brought me a knife it was a it was duller than a butter knife I didn't know that but I walked back out that deer and I started right there that ain't no fun and I'm like oh God help me you know I I'm like what am I gonna he said hey you need a sharper knife I said yeah that would be awesome he got one he said sure do I mean you've been good if you gave me that one the first time look it looked like a murder scene when it was over it wasn't fun Adam or Abel he he coming his blood was flying everywhere it was getting all over him [Applause] it didn't look like it was a good thing surely God would like what was pretty and God would like what was more thought out and placed just right no God wanted worship and Abel was worshiping by revelation [Applause] and it was getting all over him amen if your worship isn't getting all over you you're not worshiping by revelation you're worshiping by Creeds and dog missing intellectual ability God wants true worship you know amen Cain he couldn't offer the right sacrifice because it was a revelation from God that made the difference and it gave Abel eternal life and sound like it's worth worshiping by revelation if eternal life is on on the is what's available I'll do it amen he said you might take what the pastor says what the Seminary teaches though it might be taught with you with eloquence God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that God is your savior or you will never have eternal life it is spiritual Revelation that does it amen now I said that this book of Revelation is a revelation of Jesus and what he's doing in the churches for The Seven Ages it is a revelation because the disciples themselves didn't know these recorded truths it had been previously it had not been previously revealed to them you remember they came to Jesus in the book of Acts and said are you at this time going to restore the Kingdom of Israel he said it's not for you to know the time or the seasons but it's been given to you it wasn't given to them but it's been given to you Hallelujah the revelation of where we're at and who we are it has been given to us they didn't realize there was going to be seven more Church ages God allowed it to be that way because you know what would happen with men and women and if they realize well it's going to be 2 000 more years before Jesus returns there wouldn't have been no going out and preaching the gospel they wouldn't have been ready that had just been doing their own thing amen but for you it's been given the revelation of we are not in the first age or the second or third fourth fifth we are in the last stage therefore at the last stage we're not going back down to be planted we're coming up to be harvested amen so it's a revelation so he said see it was a spiritual Kingdom that he was going to build even he could not tell them about the pla about his place in it for the father had not revealed to them but now after his death and resurrection and at this particular time his meditorial ministry he is able to set forth here in the revelations of himself to John what is glory and his presence in the church would mean and do did you catch that what his glory in the church would mean and do so his glory has something for us so it shows you there's still a voice in the midst he's still in the midst of them amen in this Revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is man that ought to cause some stimulation right there when you begin to think about it that Satan has an end amen the sicknesses that are bothering you the problems that you've been facing the trials that you've been going through the devil that's been tormenting you he has an end [Applause] Hallelujah but turn it all the way around the other way when you begin to realize I don't have an end Glory good God Amen they're shouting to begins to take place there's something that begins to move up into another atmosphere when you begin to realize ma amen my I bet my where I'm going is not down it's not into hell it's not into problems and situations and drowning all of that but I'm gonna rise I'm gonna rise and I'm gonna rise until I leave this whole world Hallelujah have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible more than any others it's the beginning and the end he's always attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelations so he also attacks the he of course he he worked very murderously through the Dark Ages but he's really coming against amen the first of the life and the last of the life to try to hinder it he thought the first church was going to try to go up in a Rapture he didn't know either that it was going to be 2 000 years so when it began to move on and on he tried to stamp it out and put it out and put it out and put it out and put it out and put it up and he's come to the seventh age and it still ain't out he's come to this moment and he still can't do nothing about it Hallelujah he's always attacking both of these books we find Satan's origin in his awful ways and then we also find his destruction I wouldn't like them two books either but I like them because I find my origin and I find my Redemption I find my body change I find me leaving this whole world glory and it causes something on the inside of me to rise up [Applause] oh he hates it he hates to be exposed Satan said he has no part in me or Jesus said it's about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot for he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word so that's where he starts he tries to start destroying the confidence in the word so where how how does he how does he start trying to destroy the ministry well what the word said about them so he tries to start destroying confidence in the word what did he do to Eve when he when he finally got her to fall he started by trying to destroy the confidence she had in what God Said so the devil is always there to try to destroy the confidence of the ministry or what God has said and he's trying to destroy why because if he can destroy that he can destroy you know I don't believe well ask Eve when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirits revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her does that stimulate or kind of he said let me let me just put a word here for my own Ministry he says you know all this that this gift in my life is Supernatural it's a gift whereby the holy spirit is able to discern diseases and thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God can know and then reveal to me I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed amen so now it isn't the people that I'm talking about it's that Satan has got a hold of their lives through sin and difference and disease hello sin indifference and disease but you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed in the most peculiar change comes over people's countenance Satan is afraid he knows that the spirit of God is about to let the people know of his works that's why he hates he's meeting so much what names are called and diseases are revealed Satan hates that he said it ain't Now by mind reading or telepathy or witchcraft it's a revelation by the Holy Ghost the oil Hallelujah then all of a sudden it becomes revealed to them he's talking about me and he's telling me what my address is he's telling me what I'm going through he's telling me of the diseases that are attacking me he's not exposing me he's exposing what's against me amen if people were beginning to realize that's what the word does it isn't that the ministry wants to expose you they want to expose the disease that is against you so don't get it mad at the ministry get mad at the disease [Applause] Hallelujah so let me show you another reason why Satan hates This Book of Revelation he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not so if he wanted oil and wine he still wants oil and wine well I don't know about that what either that or he's not Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever let's just rip that one out of the book too but the problem is people want to try to interject their ideas of how they think God ought to operate and how he responds and how somebody ought to respond when he comes by and they want to start dictating what the oil and the wine and how much can be released and how much you can drink and how much you can amen how much of the effect can be lived out in your life foreign so he knows he said he knows that a whole lot more than 90 percent of theologians he knows that God is immutable in his nature then he's just as Mu and if he's immutable in his nature then he's just as immutable in his ways so if he still wants blood sacrifice if he wanted it then he wants it now if he wants oil and wine then he wants it now amen thus Satan knows assuredly that the original Church in Pentecost with the power of God March 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be he said but now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows that that Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it what lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works as tempted destruction of God's people and the decre discredited of God's word right down to the time he's cast in the Lake of Fire so that word is still exposing him because as far as I know he's not in the Lake of Fire much as I'd want him to be he ain't there yet but he does have his day coming I like to think of the devil just like this when you go to the grocery store and you see like you're going to get a gallon of milk and there's a date up there and just say it says 10 or no yeah let's go a little further 112 2023 there's a date there that says this is no good no more after this date don't drink it the devil has an expiration date he has a predetermined day God knows when it is I don't know no man knows but God has put a date on his life oh my well Hallelujah that when it comes to this moment past that it's over pass that he's finished you say well that's the Lake of Fire well also amen the devil has been tormenting you has an expiration date that one day you'll be walking and you'll be dealing with trials and the next day it'll all be over with it causes a stimulation to rise up Hallelujah one day he's tormenting you and then that stays gone one days made you sick in the body and the next day he's finished [Music] one day he's got your son and the next day your son's free he has an expiration date let's just rejoice in that this morning the devil has an end the devil has an end shake this has an end depression has an end fair and anxiety and every David of hell has an end what you need to do is look at your devil and say devil you have an end [Applause] Hallelujah hey man he fights that [Applause] he can't stand against it he knows that if the people all right he knows that if the people get the revelation of what the true church and not just a church not just an assembly of people not just a gathering not just singing a few songs and having a few good words and walking out and saying I've done my religion for the week no the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she how many is she this morning how many's got a direct Revelation I'm she [Applause] I'm she she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand not just oh I see it over there withstand it put something in you though come move you make you violent time will get a little bit not just a little bit let me rephrase that it's time we get a lot mad at the Devil and withstanding Satan will be powerless before her how many is the her he will be definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his ever effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it yeah with true Revelation Our Lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them it don't say that the Gates of Hell won't be against you if they're not going to Prevail that means they're trying to prevail they're trying to tear you down they're trying to bring you down but the word says they will not you know Moses by intellectual knowledge been passed down he tried to deliver Israel he had the word he had the promise he had been taught it from a young man he knew it by intellectual knowledge he was going to be a deliverer he was told that over and over over he had tried it in his own works and his own deeds and failed he didn't deliver him he killed one Egyptian but what he was lacking what he what what he was lacking he met on the back side of the desert the pillar of Fire the spirit the all amen and he'd be getting first he began to question well why me I don't even talk why me I stutter why me but the spirit began to move past all of his questions and all of his reasonings and all the why Nots he'd been out there and got a 40 Years of why not a bunch of why not why why why why why and here but all of a sudden he sees a bush that's on fire but it ain't burning though well I'm gonna go check this out and out of that Bush was what a voice I don't know your voice and began to speak and said Moses take off your shoes you're on Holy Ground and through that communication they're beginning to be a revelation that was transferred to him as it began to look and he sees his hand going to his breast and come out white and go back in and come out clean he sees his Rod turn into a snake and he runs and the voice says come back and pick it up I'm showing you that you've got dominion over it and he comes back and he picks it up and it brought it back to A rod again amen Revelations struck him and apparently it has stimulated him so much that he ran back to the house he packed his cow or his mule had his wife and his child grabbed his staff and went down to Egypt to what take over he said Moses took this stick and he went there and took that Nation took a nation out of a Nation when it came with a stick in his hand he told Pharaoh let my people go Pharaoh seen in Moses The Works that he had faith in what he was doing he had faith in the promise of God that it made the promise and he went down and to take it over no other man would have done it no other man would have thought it was possible listen we ain't talking about taking a gun and going taking over a restaurant Mike can do that we're not talking about taking a machine gun and going getting your car off a car lot Mike can do that he was taking a donkey a wife and a child and a rod and going down to the most powerful Nation at that moment everybody like you going up to the White House with a plum limb I'm here to take over well you better have a revelation are you gonna get kicked out probably won't even make it up there but if God told you to go do it you'll go do it that's the problem with a lot of people they blame a lot of stuff on God they're so spiritual and high-minded with God I have not there's some people that God lies to more than anybody ever seen in my life come on now [Laughter] God told me this and God told me that and God showed me this and God said and not one of them has ever come to pass I know who he was it was God human abilities and human mind and what you thought what you thought was should be done Moses tried to do it when he thought it should be done and it didn't work but when God said it's time to do it it worked Hallelujah about to turn this over brother Aaron laughs so when the time of the promise Drew now there was a little boy born Fairchild his parents amram and Jacob was not afraid of the king's commandment and there was something grounds were already being prepared he said go God I hope I'm speaking to people that are prepared that seeds can fall right into the right place and bring forth fruit they say what brother Brandon what kind what kind of text it takes what what about this what about Moses that would do something like this he said Moses expressed faith in the promise of God that he believed and Pharaoh the man could see what it was he couldn't see how Moses was going to do it but you know Moses believed and what he was talking about he wouldn't be standing in that palace with a stick in his hand but the stick I'll take he said buy this stick I'll take them out from you an old man 80 years old not an athlete an old man stoop shoulders Whiskers hanging down his probably down to his waistline gray hair looked impossible but I'm going to take them out let them go that's thus saith the Lord now if it had been Moses saith it wouldn't happen but it was thus saith the Lord I mean thinking one Spirit could have ended it one little shot from a bow could have finished it but he stood there Fearless because he knew God spoke to me and it became a revelation to where he was so stimulated by it he would lose his mind and go down there until Pharaoh face to face let him go if you don't let them go I'm going to torment you you and what army I don't need an army I've got thus saith the Lord Hallelujah for God told him you'll come back here to this mountain again and worship me oh Hallelujah he said when things are revealed to you you are fearless you don't care what anybody says or what they doubts and they're you could care less you become Fearless this is the truth coming from God then then you become Fearless David became Fearless David got up that morning his dad come to him and said you know I need you to go down I need you to go down there and take some cakes and some figs and some some nice nourishment to your brothers they got a war going on I can see David as he began to go and I wish I had the voice this morning he wasn't going fearful he didn't get out of his beds like oh man do I really got to go down there he couldn't hardly wait he wanted to go he's like okay go ahead load them up load them up come on let's go I'm ready to go I I got something in my heart that I I got to be there it was something that was moving him something that was that was firing him up something that was come over in him something that was overtaking him and listen it didn't just start when he got to the Battleground it started way before he got to the Battleground he said got out of his bed and put that one foot on it he said wow it feels good to be a son of Abraham amen I'm I'm blessed to be able to stand right here in the same land Abraham walked in Abraham talked in the same land that the angels of God visited Abraham the same place that they changed their bodies and gave them a son it feels good to be a son of Abraham whoa I don't change it a little bit when you get up on a Sunday morning and you put one foot down so wow I'm in the land I'm in the same land Peter talked about and he said repent and be baptizing me filled with the Holy Ghost I'm in that land I'm in the land of the routine I'm in the land of shouting hallelujahs and praising God I'm in the land to overcome every enemy because this is my land all right Hallelujah he began to sing his way all the way down there I'm no doubt he would have sang that song we heard this morning Mercy mercy and goodness has brought me to this place I'm here because of his Mercy I'm not here because why why was David doing this why was David so happy why was David moving like this because David had already been in the anointing oil he had been anointed for King hello somebody I'm looking at a people why are you stimulated why are they why do you hear the word it makes you shout and dance and move around because you've been in the anointing more amen the anointing oil has been poured over your life and not just to be a peoner or just a pond somewhere but you have been anointed Kings and Priests of the most high God and he's placed you in a place of authority so David woke up in his place of authority he went down to that service on a Sunday morning he walked out there he'd cut around that last corner just got him a comfortable spot on a rock he's looking for his brothers and he found him a real comfy spot it was about it was Green about that thick little place of his back can lean up against it's like man this is a good spot I found a good spot all of a sudden he hears a voice send me a man I defile the armies of the Living God send me a man that'll fight me and if he wins we'll serve you but if I win you'll serve me well you know what you need to do is look that devil in an eye and say you know what I may not win every battle but if I lose I'm still not serving you a bunch of nonsense amen but he he said brother brother Bradham said you know he said that giant I didn't said these things before but that giant had come out there that morning he says 40 days 40 church services and he sat there and he made his Challenge and he made his Challenge and he went back in his tent said boy a bunch of chickens they won't do nothing about it they're just going on like they always went on they just still stay send me a man but on this day it happened to be the day of his expiration date he didn't know it the children of Israel didn't know it even David didn't even know it but God had put it on his life said this day you're going to die this day your head's coming off this day you're gonna fall and you ain't gonna fall before great Harmony you're gonna fall before a little Ruddy boy I wish I had the voice to preach right now Hallelujah you may not feel like much you may feel soaking insignificant but what if today was the day that devil had his expiration date all it takes is a man let's fit in the anointing oil and say you know what devil I ain't going to hear it another time I'm not going to listen to your challenge no more this day your head's coming off Hallelujah do we got any Davis this morning says devil your head's coming off devil I'm not going there no more I'm not going down that path no more this is your end time he became Fearless they say you know he danced right out in the aisle and he went right down to a little Brook and then that Brook was five stones [Applause] everything he already needed was already laying in the land it just needed somebody had to get down to where that Revelation is and say here it is here it is here it is here it is five Stones g-e-s-u-s f-a-i-t-h where is that devil at now this day I'm going to take your head off this day is my winning day this day is my Victory Day this day is my moment yeah some of you that's been bound by lukewarmness but this day it has an expiration date some of you've been bound by fear and past mistakes but this day it has an expiration date some of you've been bound by sickness but this day it has an expiration date give me a David that'll believe that'll become fearless and say this day this scripture is fulfilled all right come on now I ain't got much but you got a sling I ain't got much of it you got a revelation [Applause] reach down in that Valley right there and pick it up let me look at it right here right quick right here in this Valley I'm looking for one oh I'm getting close I Will Bless The Lord at all times that's the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boasts in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be good oh magnify the Lord with me [Applause] father Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me oh is there any delivered in the house of the Lord come on and he delivered me and he delivered me from all all my fears High feared cancer in the deliver me I fear depression and he delivered me I filled every kind of thing and he delivered me of all of them [Applause] this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him how many saved here this morning and saved him out of our all his troubles the angel of the Lord and camping about them that fear them and deliver them oh taste and see oh my taste oh that's good stuff right there and blessed is a man that trusted him all fear the lord all you Saints for there is no want if you need some provision there's no won't from them that fear Him can we just lift our hands for a moment and just bless the Lord then [Applause] taste it taste it get a revelation this morning I'm not going down I'm going up I'm not going to repeat what my mom and daddy did but God is a chain breaker what my dad done is not my same destination what my mom I'm a son I'm a I'm a daughter of the living king of God and I'm from another kingdom get Fearless I ain't done get Fearless get Fearless you I don't care there's more if you want to stand up or you want to sit down I don't really care just whatever you do grab a promise [Applause] but I will say this if David would have stayed in his seat he'd have never got a promise [Applause] hey man let me go back over here David wasn't a match for this giant this man had shoulders that were would almost bust the door open probably when he walked his head would hit up the duck maybe crawl through he wasn't no joke looked impossible but David wasn't looking at it impossible he was looking past impossible Revelation struck him he said see I've already been here God's delivered me out of the Paul the bear and he delivered me out of the Paw of the line how much more well he delivered me from that uncircumcised devil come on somebody he delivered me from a car wreck he's going to save my soul he brought me to this place how much more he deliver me from the spirit that's been haunting my life it's uncircumcised devil that has no right being in this land brothers that were probably more able they've been in the Army longer than he had ever he ain't even been in the Army so I mean they've been they've been trained I never forget hearing brother Danny steaming preach on this and he says John that giant would come out and make his boast and all that Army run back in them tents whoop out their laptops and see if they could find a quote about it foreign that's all right if you find a quote but do something with it if the quote just stays in the tent it ain't going to be anything if it just stays in the tent and it don't become an expression well I love the Lord well if it just stays in the tent and it don't become an expression he don't even know if you love him or not he wants expression amen if it's absolutely revealed to you that God's going to heal you you're going to get it if it's absolute a reveal I said I don't care what's wrong with you what the odds are the doctor may have come and said the odds are no good well what he ain't putting into the equation in his impossible math is there an equalizer there I really wish I'd have paid him attention to math now because there's probably something really good in that there's an equalizer there can take any odds any odds they may be a hundred percent against you any odds and make it possible so it really doesn't matter if the doctor says 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 percent chance you're not going to have or you're not going to be or you're going to die it don't matter what does that mean that's the best he can do that's his abilities he learned he done he's applied itself great but there's an odd equalizer and he's in the building this morning he's here to give life he's here to give stimulation he's here to invoke something whenever it was revealed to him he became Fearless he just would tell that devil anything today I'm going to cut your head off well I'm sure that made you Goliath real happy well that was that was a thank you for being so kind he said well who in the world sent this little boy out here this is nonsense is it wasn't there a man but you sent this little squirt and he's laughing and he's making fun and he he's making fun of the he don't know that he's not really making fun of David he's making fun of the oil that was poured over him by a prophet that's really what he's making fun of he's trying to make fun of David but what he don't see is the voice that's in the midst [Music] and there's a voice that is speaking and when it was I'm going to take your head off it wasn't a little four and a half foot boy that said that it was the anointing the holy ghost that said that it was a revelation that said that it was the voice that spoke sure to use David's voice but there was a voice that spoke because it happened if David would have said that and that giant went and killed David then it wouldn't have been The Voice or the oil that said it had been David getting worked up but there was more than that David became Fearless because he had a true revelation he didn't care what anybody else said his brothers can make fun of him and they did other churches make fun of you and they have bam they'll make fun of your singing they'll make fun of your worship they'll make fun of your response they'll they'll make fun and they'll make fun and make fun but you don't got to pay no attention to that David's brother's like you're making yourself into somebody who do you think you are you're supposed to be back with a sheep you're supposed to be back there well fine but why don't you do something about this voice that is speaking over here but David said no I'm here for a purpose I'm here to take his head off amen he said see I don't know brother Brown caught a little Hunchback looking boy seeing his heart the same God in that crucial moment he said it moved upon him he's the same God in this crucial moment that could take that woman from a wheelchair that man if you can believe with all your trouble God will reveal it to you then you won't be able to say there foreign amen you believe that he says the Giant didn't believe it he said neither will the cancer he'll laugh at you and say oh my dog you sent a kid here to fight with me that didn't Shake David all he had a faith in what he was doing he knew he was going to do it because God had put it there already he would go on so many others Samson was called out with a thousand Philistines and all he had he have nothing and he looked down he seen this old dried up mule and died it's like Mueller died and he's picked up his old dry Jawbone just as dry as it could be and he took after those Philistines beating him over the head with this old dry drop Jawbone of a mule he said it was something amazing because it would break through metal and breakthrough helmets and kill all up to a thousand I've said this before but it's worth repeating how stupid is the Philistines I mean I've got 10. you're the 11th and you keep fighting but you're 990 and you're still trying to kill this guy it don't make no sense that's how stupid the devil is he's trying with it and he knows he has an end he don't know when it is but he knows he has he he knows he has a short time but he's fighting and he's fighting and he's fighting well I mean if a God knowing he has an end we'll fight that hard how much more should we fight who has no wind spoke that to the young people up there in Ohio we have something worth fighting for Amen brother man will say it he said I have a seat sitting at a table that's over a thousand miles long it's got my name on it he said I want to sit there and I'm going to begin to talk to others and no Heroes of Faith and he said tears will come down our eyes he said but about that moment he'll walk out of the glory and he'll reach down and he'll wipe those tears away he said so we got something worth fighting for so if we're going to fight let's make it a good fight let's fight with everything that we have within us every service is a fight I don't care who you are it's a fight it was a fight to be here this morning I got up this morning and I couldn't even hardly whisper amen but it was a fight I knew I had something on my heart you got up and that many of you didn't feel your best tired but Joe was wore out from running up down that that thing last yesterday him brother Jackson got inspired and they run the three-legged race and the sack right listen these old bodies can't take that you young fellas that won yesterday you're crowing just don't worry don't worry your Crow's gonna turn into it yeah it's coming one day you're gonna get up and try to Crow it's coming hey I didn't realize I'd be here 46 years old that's crazy he says tell me about it because you know why every year that I get older he

now here I'm 46 and you think whoa brother Timothy you got a brother Brown said he was 50 years old and he said he hadn't done nothing for the Lord Mercy 50 years old and all the things that he'd done and he ain't done nothing for the Lord what are we 46 years old ain't nothing for the Lord 17 years old ain't done nothing but if we're going to fight let's make it a good one oh I got to stick around

way through depression you gotta Cloud your way through anxiety and you got to jump over that devil and kick him while he's down but you're gonna win suicide steps up in your way it's time you run suicide right over so I'm done with your torment thoughts I'm done with what you're doing to my mind I'm done let's win this race hey man there's a cloud of witnesses I can hear them this morning there's Karen Pruitt there's Jerry Sean that says keep pressing on [Applause] it's worth it it's worth it if you only knew what was over here you would fight with everything you got to fight with [Applause] I'm going to win work on that pulsation when God speaks to you and he says get out of your seat and worship me you ought to move don't let nothing hinder you don't let your past hinder you don't let the problems hinder you don't let the present hinder you God said I'm going to win [Applause] he grabbed that Jawbone and he took off towards them thousand Philistines I'm gonna win I'm

there's a Samson in the building there's a David in the building that says I'm gonna win I'm gonna ride to be victorious [Applause] Hallelujah oh my let's just praise him again he's worthy we're in the season of Thanksgiving we're in the season of Thanksgiving there's a people here that know how to praise him because they know what he done for him and they see where they was and where they are today and what he wanted he brought them out of he reached way down so he could bring me way up [Applause] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord part three now this is no Exodus 29 verse 38 7. now this is which that which Thou shalt offer upon the altar two lambs of the first year and day by day continually oh my excuse me one lamb Thou shalt offer in the morning the other lamb Thou shalt offer in the evening so he's good to me in the morning he good to me in the evening he good to me all day long and with the one lamb lamb a tenth deal of flower mingled with a fourth part of him of beaten oh this is Exodus 29 and verse 40. of beaten oh and the fourth part of him of a hen of wine for a drink offering oh there's all and wine and the other lamb that's so offered evening and shall do unto there unto according to the great offering of the morning so do it all over again and according to the drink thousand thereof for a sweet saber oh and now see what the Wine's for so a sweet savior could come up in this nostrils could it be this morning he just waited oh isn't that one she's been through so much oh that praise it smells so good that one's been down through hell and it's been through every kind of dark spirit and it's still fighting and still got their hands up at Thanksgiving don't you smell that angels that smells so good amen is a sweet savior an offering made by fire unto the Lord and thou shall be a continual burn offering throughout your Generations at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord where I will meet you and speak there unto thee and there I will meet with the children of Israel and the Tabernacle shall be Sanctified by my glory hey you want his glory then bring the oil and wine don't leave it out if you leave any part of what he's asking out you're not going to see his glory you might see your intellectual ability you might see is that your intellectual understanding but you will not see his glory and I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the congregation and the Altar and I will sanctify also both Aaron and my son some minister to me in the priest's office and I would dwell among the children of Israel and be their God and they so know that I am the Lord their God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt then I may dwell among them I am the Lord their God and daily morning and evening on the behalf of the whole Congregation of Israel the priest to offer a lamb with the accompanying meal of and drink offerings thus day by day the dedication of all the people was renewed it's not just a Sunday morning sacrifice is not just a Wednesday night sacrifice but it's a continual offering unto the Lord this amplifies a continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make yet that one offering thus becomes a continual offering this teaches us to offer up to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise every day every morning every evening in Humble acknowledgment of our dependence upon him and also of our obligations to him our daily devotions must be looked upon as the most needful of our daily works and the most Pleasant of our daily comforts wow whatever business we have this must never be omitted either morning or evening prayer time must be kept up as a duty as me time the daily sacrifices were his daily meals in God's house and therefore they were always attended with Bread and Wine with oil and wine these those Stars those starve their own Souls that kept not a constant attendance on the throne of grace but Satan has tried to take the oil and wine the lifeline out of the body through the Dark Ages and would have done it and would have done it except the voice said don't hurt it because there had to be a restoration not a replacement hello somebody he was going to restore the restoration of the Bride tree not the replacement of it he wasn't going to just start all over again but he was going to bring the same one up that went down in the beginning back up at the end therefore to be able to do that the life had to travel through so the voice said don't you touch that and that voice is still saying that today so to have a restoration there has to be something left to restore so let's turn to Joel 1 and verse 1 the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pathwell hear this you old men I guess that means me this morning and give here all your inhabitants of the land had this been in your days or even in the days of your father tell you of your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation excuse me that which the palm of worm has left has the locus eaten that was the Locust has left has the canker worm eaten and that which the kinky worm is left has the caterpillar eaten wakey junk drunkards and weep and howl all you drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth for a nation has come up before my land strong and without number whose teeth or the teeth of a lion his cheek teeth of a great line and he's laid my Vine waste and barked my fig tree and he's made it clean bare and cast it away the branches thereof are made white lament Like a Virgin girl it was cyclos for the husband of her youth the meat offering of the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord the priests and the Lord's ministers mourn field is wasted the land way it mourneth for the corn is wasted and the new wine just dried up and the oil languisheth so there it is wine and oil be ashamed oh your husband how oh you Vine dressers for the wheat and for the barley because the Harvest of the field is perished the vine is dried up in the Fig Tree language with and the pomegranate and the palm and the apple and all the trees of the field are withered because Joy is withered away from the sons of man what because Joy is with why why is Joy gone because Revelation is gone and Revelation brings stimulation Revelation left during the Dark Age sure Parts I'm going to grab a certain part Wesley regard Lutheran grab a part in West Liberty but the full round of Revelation was ate away therefore stimulation was gone because the joy is withered away from the sons of men gird yourself and lament you priests how you Ministers of the altar come lie all night in cycloff that's what ministers should be doing if they don't see the oil and wine in their Church not making excuses for why it ain't there but saying God we need it loud night in cyclophy ministers and my God for the meat offering to drink office withholder from the house of your God sanctify your fast call us all the assembly gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land of the house the Lord your God and cry into them so this must be important a last for the day for the day of the Lord is a hand and destruction from Almighty shall it come this is not the meat cut off before our eyes yay joy and gladness from the house of our God the seed is rotten under their clods and the Garners are laid desolate and the barns are broken down they don't have no faith to move anything anymore they've allowed their altars to be moved into the basement they don't believe in prayer lines no more things have become very desolate why because there's no oil and there's no wine it isn't in his fullness to bring stimulation to bring growth to bring movement how the Beast grown and the herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture people are becoming very perplexed in this age they can't find anything good to eat listen children brother I'm talking about he said children you've got to eat out of a garbage can if they have to say but they don't have to he said the skies were full of the Pentecostal blessings but why are people don't have something to eat why are they languishing why so Lord today will I Cry for the fires divide the pastures of the Wilderness and the flame has burned all the trees of the field and the Beast of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers and Waters are dried up and fire had to fire the pastors of the wilderness pictures of bleak seems impossible seems like there's no hope left seemed like nothing is left but Blackness and Ashes desolation Joel chapter 2 1 says blow ye the trumpet and Zion sound alarm on my Holy Mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord cometh for it is not hand a day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and of thick Darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and strong there hath not been ever like neither shall there be any more of it even into the years of many generations a fire Delight Divine behind them a flame burners the land is as a Garden of Eden before them but behind them is a desolate wilderness Mercy nothing shall Escape them the Empire the appearance of them is as appearance of horses oh and I saw another horse and I saw another horse and I saw a white horse and a and a red horse and a black horse and a Pale Horse the appearance of them as of horses as a Horseman so shall they run like the noise of Chariots on the tops of mountains so they leave like the noise of a flame of fire that devireth the stubble as a strong people said in battle array before their faces the people shall be much pain all their faces Shall Gather blackness they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War they shall March every one in his own ways and they shall not break their ranks neither shall one thrust another they shall walk everyone in his path and when they fall upon the sword they shall not be wounded they shall run to and fro they shall run upon the wall they shall Clump on the house they shall enter into the Windows like a thief the Earth shall Quake before them the heavens shall tremble and the sun and the moon shall be dark and the Stars shall withdraw their shine in the Lord shall utter his voice before his army for his Camp is very great for he's strong that executeth his word for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible and who can abide in it but therefore also now saith the Lord turn you even to me with all your heart and with fasting with weeping with mourning and rins your heart and not your garments and turn unto the Lord your God for he is gracious he is merciful he is slow to anger of great kindness and repentance of him of the evil who knoweth he if he shall return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering a drink offered unto the Lord your God what turn and repent and bring back the drink offer it and the meat offering bring back the wine and the all blow the trumpet in Zion and sanctify fast gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children those who suck the breast let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet let the priests and the ministers weep before between the porch and the altar let them say spare thy people O Lord and give not thine Heritage to reproach that the heathens shall rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their God then will the Lord be jealous for his land and piteous people yea the Lord will answer and say behold I will send you corn and wine and all and ye shall be satisfied therewith and I will no more make your approach among the Heathen but I will move remove far off of from you the northern Army and I will drive him into the land Barren and desolate and his face toward the EC and his hinder Parts toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come up in his ill savior shall come up because he had done great things fear not old land be glad and rejoice for the Lord we'll do great things be afraid you Beasts of the field for the pastors of the Wilderness do spring up they're going to be restored for the tree Bears or fruit and the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former Reign moderately but he'll also come down with you the rain the farmer and the latter the Harvest rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of we and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will replace I will restore so there had to be still life laying down there there had to be even all that desolation and all that Pro the Army had eaten all up and it seemed impossible but it's down below there it was a little rotten seed and it began to pop up amen it began to come out of the ground it laid there through a dark age but it came out of the ground and Luther said the just shall live by faith and it came up a little higher Wesley said amen to begin to preach the message of sanctification and then there was a restoration of the gifts whether you want to acknowledge it or not is still part of the life amen it brings it right on up amen all the way till seed time again I will restore to you the years that the Locust is Eve and the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer were my great Army in other words the one I allowed to do this and you shall eat in plenty you shall Worship in plenty you will have something to worship about and praise the name of the Lord your God who has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and upon the servants upon the handmaid in those days I will pour out my oil my spirit I'll pour it out and I'll show wonders in the heaven and the earth and the blood and firing pillars of smoke and the sun shall be turned the darkness and the Moon in the blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered shall be delivered for in the Mount Zion and Jerusalem shall be deliverance and the Lord has said in the remnant whom the Lord shall call so is not a replacement it's not something new well we got something new no we got how we got what Paul preached it's a restoration it's a restoring back to the church what was in the beginning therefore it'll have exactly what the first church had the same power it'll have the same passion it'll have the same Glory it'll have the same love this was the lamb that said I will restore not start something new well it just started this is playing a new plan no he said I'm going to restore what that Army did but the same life the same oil the same wine in the first church will be the same oil the same life the same wine in the last Church don't hurt the oil in the wine the wine that brings stimulation not just revelation but stimulation of Revelation if you get just Revelation and it's just a bunch of head knowledge and it does nothing for you it's nothing but head knowledge but if it begins to stimulate you to the point that you begin to realize I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God this is my Heritage this is my home this is my place this is my promise I don't have to bow down to what the devil says anymore I can worship Him in spirit and Truth Mercy how about other one what's happened here I'm on a different time I think it's my birthday let me preach amen he says the only way you're going to see your way out did you hear that it's an old-fashioned spiritual Revival where the hallelujahs of God is ringing from the bottom of your heart an old-fashioned Holy Ghost sent Revival hit the place then you'll begin to see things as somebody really got stimulated by some drink they see things you can't see right that's Naturally Speaking they see things they can see a pink elephant walk to this room and they can see all kinds of stuff I ain't talking about a pink elephant I ain't talking about some imagination but I'm talking about getting stimulated enough to where you can leave this old pest house this old world and set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and rise above your old filthy rotten attitudes and things of this life and the devil trying to push things down you rise above it he said wow what a Revival then when God starts beginning to reveal things you wonder why these real Christians are hanging on it's because of Revival they got in the spirit that's the reason that people have dances that they don't get have a dance so they could get in the spirit of dancing you can't have a ball game unless you get in the spirit of a ball game you got to get in the spirit of you can't never have a Revival in Shreveport or anywhere else unto the church gets in the spirit of Revival God can come and perform Miracles he can show wonders he can stretch forth his hand to heal the sick and The Afflicted and the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but there'll never be a Revival until the church gets in the spirit of it he says what makes men Gamble I just got a few more minutes what makes men gamble what makes men carry on what makes these little girls and boys out there do the little boogie woogie and rock and roll and ungodly things he said because Sunday school was let down and no home was let down and parents have let down the Nations let down but men sing songs that Inspire him it says that's the reason Elvis Presley saying All Shook Up they didn't they didn't teach them Rock of Ages for me that's the reason the reason that people don't believe in shouting tonight but was scream at a ball game is because they haven't been taught such things and kept away from the Glorious presence of Jesus Christ that gives them that satisfying portion John was in the spirit on the Lord's Day get in the spirit however he got the how are you ever going to get in the Holy Ghost get in the spirit how are you going to get something from God get in the spirit when you're with a sinner you went to a dance you got in the spirit you started Clapping Your Hands started patting your feet started Shin digging throwing your hat on the floor and going around around acting silly he was in the spirit of it could you imagine a fellow with a dance fiend going to a dance saying well you all having a pretty good time I suppose all they'd say well you wall flower get out of here wow you Wallflower get out of here amen you go to a ball game somebody knock a home run or something another sat and look and say well I guess that's pretty good you ain't a baseball fan but if you're a baseball fan somebody hits a home run you'll knock somebody else's hat off shouting and screaming he said the church gets in the spirit and begins to raise up and holler Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord somebody had turned around and say you're a Holy Roller he said I'm going to ask you a question if we are Unholy rollers because our holy roses cause we do that then them are Unholy rollers out there he said I'd rather be a Holy Roller than an Unholy one Hallelujah amen the Bible will talk about when Aaron was going to the holy of holies they would pour the oil over him he says you know he said I know you think we're an awful noisy bunch he said but I can prove to you if there ain't no no ain't noisy there ain't no God there wow people don't people that likes the other side they don't like these quotes rip them out but in the Old Testament when Aaron was anointed with the rose of Sharon the oil of God and he had the anointing run down his beard to the hems of his skirt and he took the sacrifice and he went into the holy of holies and he went behind that curtain across the Garment and he had a pomegranate and a bell and they'd hit together and then when he walked he played holy holy holy unto the Lord that's the anointed Church of God moving into the holy of holies look here brother that's the reason they did that that's the only reason they could tell that he was alive they had to listen to see if there was any noise he said if there's no noise he's dead that's what's today the church is Born Again going into the holy of holies Anointed with gods of pomegranate Baal Hallelujah you know they're alive there's a bell ringing oh I wish I had me a bill holy holy holy unto the Lord scoffers say just look at them would you holy holy unto the Lord just look at them would you holy holy unto the Lord foreign to lay a foundation what that incense meant and speaking of Christ and everything the instance now is his blood the rose of sharing the lily of the valley and how the high priest before he went into the holy of holies had to be Anointed with the oil from the top of his head and it run all the way down his beard and over to over his hems of his skirt it wasn't just a little bit of a war it was a lot of War he said somebody happens to tell you that these Full Gospel people are just a little noisy here's something for them Aaron when he went to the holy so holies once a year he had to wear that kind of garment had to be anointed amen what was it that was screaming out he said well brother Branham it's just emotional it's just emotion he said oh I can scientifically prove to you anything without emotion is dead so if your religion hasn't got any emotion in it bury it bury it because it ain't no good anyhow it's dead but there is a life there is a life that's moving through the body hallelujah it's the life if it moves through you and it comes into your life and you go down in the grave one day it's going to stimulate all those old ashes laying there all those old skull fragments is maybe laid in there for 40 50 years whatever it is Grandma's been gone a long time one day the holy spirit that move is going to move over that body son of man will these bones live again thou knowest Lord amen the spirit begin to move over those bodies and it began to call back out of that dust and to begin to move what was it doing it was moving them up to a higher place again back to they were again out of that eye out of that graveyard out of that broken bones and broken situations oh God that's why we got to have the spirit of God moving in our churches we've got to have the oil and the wine and the Revelation amen the stimulation of it moving because it's moving people out of their doldrums it's moving people out of their Brokenness it's moving them out of the broken situations it's moving them out of their hopeless situation into the life of God hurt not the oil and the wine when you come to offer sacrifice of praise bring both of them you can shout all you want to you can holler all you want to you can dance all you want to but if you ain't got both of them you can sit on your seat all you want to but if you ain't got both of them it's not doing anything for him it's nothing but human work up it's funny how people want to say Well they're just getting worked up well what is people sitting on the seat doing getting worked down I mean seriously what what it's it's it's the humanity you got to get past what you think and just make sure that if it's in your seat with tears coming down your face make sure you're offering him the all and the wine Wise by our hands how about you today I can't look at you and say well you got old you don't have oil you got wine you don't have wine but this is a personal moment with him maybe maybe somebody just want to say fill my cup Lord I lift it up refilling move me to a heart deeper depths into the
