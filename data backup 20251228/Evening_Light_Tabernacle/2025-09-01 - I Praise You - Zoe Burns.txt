========================================

There is no place where you're not there. I'll never drift from your love and care. There's not a thing about me that you don't know. The wings of the morning will take me to you. the blackness of night. Your love will shine through. You're already there. No matter where I may go, [Music] even before I came to be, your loving eyes were looking at me. You're even closer than the very breath that I take. Mother and father, more than a friend to me, beginning and ending, and living a life to me. The song I find myself singing when I awake. [Music] Oh, I will praise you, Lord. I praise you now. I praise you for bearing me up and giving me wings. For lifting my sight to heavenly things. For being a song I can't help but sing. Praise you. [Music] Look at me, Lord. I'm open to you. do anything that you want to do. Cuz you know me better than I know myself. [Music] I'll not be afraid of what you can see. Cuz you know the inside of me. Don't even try to hide when you know so well. [Music] Now be patient with my mistakes. I want to be yours. Whatever it takes. I learned that life without you is no life at all. Failures and talents and teams I bring to you. Aspirations and dreams I sing to you. I'll just be here ready whenever you hold. Oh, I will praise you, Lord. I praise you now. I praise you for bearing me up and giving me wings. For lifting my sigh to heavenly things. For being a song I can't help but sing. Praise you. So I will praise you. You praise you [Music] now. I praise you. For bearing me up and giving me wings. For lifting my eyes to heavenly things. for being a song I can't help but sing. Praise you.
