tell you why don't you quit sin why don't you quit unbelief why don't you quit your doubting why you quit your fears what you put all of that aside and believe amen why be stuck there amen let's move on in the gospel of Christ I'm not ashamed of this gospel I believe it is the power of God and his salvation we had a prayer line last night because we are a people is called to fulfill the Great Commission we happen to believe all the word not part of it we believe in the open book we believe the seals have been taken off the Mysteries revealed we believe in the coming of Christ not just the meeting in the air but the word coming yes sir amen we have received Christ coming in the form of a message however there's got to be a people that reads the book and prophesies again that means that the word the message brought must take on flesh so we not only believe he's here in the form of his word we believe he's here in the form of his bride so he's here this morning Amen in the form of his bride and yeah we believe in the Grim coming again in the meeting in the air that's what Believers believe we believe in a literal Lord Jesus who's coming again we're going to be changed and meet him in the air but right now here's where he's at you want to know where he's at he's right here he's dwelling in his people amen producing Overcomers in this age you ask where is he well I just want to say he's not just in some theology but he's the word made flesh in Bride form so he's here in a people that'll do the same works that he did and we have a full course menu for all the Seven Seals are open therefore we believe in miracles because it's in the book therefore we believe in healing signs wonders because it's in the book certainly we believe all the Mysteries have concerning the bride of Christ have been revealed cuz it's in the book we Rejoice over those truths and yet we believe in every gift that God has because it's in the book therefore we will finish the Great Commission we will preach we will demonstrate the gospel we will lay hands on the sick we will cast out Devils we will speak with new tongues and if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover brother brandham tells us in the message turn on the light he said today we find people with somewhere what like in that day they're trying to live in a glare the church should ripen as a wheat ripens that man shall not live but by bread alone but by every word of God the bread of life not just parts of the word every word of God every age just don't stay there and eat beans and potatoes all the time there's other things go with it as we go in this full course of God's great dinner that's set before his people the power of the Holy Ghost rejoicing of it the power and the spirit that has been given the works that I do shall you do also because I live you shall live also the promises Jesus made to his church so we identified this morning with the gospel we're not ashamed of we identify as a book of Acts church we are continuation of that book where they went down in the ground amen down to up through Luther Wesley up to isua street now it's back to grain again what was planted there in the beginning is now here on the scene again we have a different Destiny they had a Destiny for the ground to go down into death bring forth more because if the if the corn eat just abides there it will abide alone but if it's planted it'll bring forth many and so we're here now in the very fulfillment of the scripture where what was there at the beginning the bride that was there at the beginning we are now come back to that very same spot to continue the book of Acts you say brother Tim book of Acts what are you talking about we're talking about the acts of the holy spirit amen it's not a it's not a different book of Acts it's not a new book of Acts it's the same Holy Ghost working in the same way in the same manner doing the same things here Among Us the same yesterday today and forever as brother bradam told us and the Mighty God in veiled before us said I was with John the Baptist before them critics I seen the spirit of God descending I heard the voice of God say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in I was sure identified with him I was identified there at the grave of Lazarus when he raised up Lazarus I was identified the woman at the well when he told her her sins I surely was identified with him in his death and I was identified on the first Easter I raised with him from Death I I'm identified with him in his death I was with the 120 in the upper room have you been there have you had your own experience I was identified up there with them I feel religious he says oh my I was identified there I I'm one of them I I got the same experience they had I was there when it happened to be a true Christian I witnessed the mighty Russian wind coming I witnessed that I felt the power of God as it shook I was with them that spoke with in tongues I felt the anointing come in there I was with them I was identified with them when the Holy Ghost began to speak through tongues with them I was was with Peter before the critics in Acts 2 when he preached the great sermon that he did and I was identified with him and he said in Acts for when they assembled together I was with them when the building shook you say well brother Tim you know I've had that experience I just say you can have it again Amen in Acts 4 here it came again when they got again began to praise God and got in one Accord believing the word what the house was Chuck with the power God Amen you can have it over and over again so he says I was with John on the aisle of patmas Seena second coming I was with Luther in the Reformation Wesley and he said I'm here tonight identified with the same kind of people with the same kind of an experience I must be to be a Christian I must stay identified where the word of God is being manifested I'm identified with a group that feels the spirit of God I'm identified with that group that knows he's unveiled that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever that this is not a fanaticism that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm identified with that group yet they're called a bunch of Heretics yet a bunch of fanaticism on account of the word of God so I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God into salvation and I'm one I'm with them a living epistle I spoke of and Vindicated God veiled in human for form in men and women that's what God wants to do he wants to use your Veil this morning he wants to come down into your life and you manifest deity wherever you are in your workplace as a teenager as a married person as a family man or woman as a Workman God wants to manifest himself in you God's manifest himself in a people today we want to turn our hearts toward the [Music] lord I want you to play this song Lord I need you right now I want all my life now in your keeping that's what I want I want all my life we've had meeting after meeting now we started on Thursday night we've heard wonderful Ministries brother Tom began brother Tom Ray began with the

white people get the Holy Ghost too and they can worship like that too it's not limited it's not limited to nationalities to colors to races it's a god race amen and when you get filled with the Holy

the redeemed yeah a part of the Bride I would never abuse that we want to encourage you in the faith provoke you in love and challenge you by the word of the Lord and to have a special friend like these two brothers that are here brother Ron brother Tim you might not know but they are my heroes I know we all got our heroes so we might as well just let down the bars okay we probably went through one of the toughest times in our lives at our little church few years back and there came a man riding on a plane there was only one seat left is that right brother Tim and he came and preached the word and he helped our church so much I can't thank your pastor enough for holding the torch preaching the word and holding the banner High that's the kind of man I will stand behind and so God bless

I pray that we can keep it there just keep it there I don't know what you're expecting but I'm expecting God to do great and wonderful things this morning want to keep the devil on the Run he's got no place around us no place at all so I want to greet you I'm a great man that I've been privileged to assist and help in any manner I could brother bisc sister bisc dad always has said wherever you go would you greet the people for me I certainly will he's been a real real real man of God to me so we want to greet them back because they'll be seeing this people at our church Saints at our church will be watching they love you much I get to church and I got them meeting me in the hallway say we got brother Ron we got brother Tim what are you going to preach I said' man you should be a superhero if you're listening to three services back to back back to back but I said you cannot hear any more wonderful preaching than what you've already heard just the last few Services the one of the brothers came up to me and he said you know he said this is incredible he said brother Ron preached on this text brother Tim preached on this text and you preached on this text what do you do compare notes no I said it's the same Holy Spirit that's right same Holy Spirit and to God be the glory great things he has done John Marie God bless you all old friends nice to see your your faces so greetings from Cloverdale Bible Way many Saints said to give your love their Ling greetings I can't say them all because there is too many but from our little work to your work God bless you at evening light Tabernacle God bless you well somebody was saying back there get preaching I think you know is with this these young men I mean I love Andrew very much I love brother Timothy who who has been a part of and they come up and theyve ministered to our young men and our church phenomenal men Michael they' just been outstanding you know I was brother Tim I think you said we we're driving H if something happens to me the church is going to go on yes sir yes sir brother Derek it's going on you know you see different Works where they you know they have a certain person and they're there's nothing there and there's many churches around the world right now without pastors but I believe that in the vision of raising young men up and preach this gospel and listen to listen to me these men are eclipsing us well I say me the student has eclipsed the teachers that's me not but I love it I not intimidated by it because everybody has to be who they are and that's the wonderful part of resting in Christ you are what you are and you don't have to try and be anybody else sorry for the Preamble but I have to quiet my heart my would you mind if you would stand and we'll take our Bibles you know it's always dangerous after you preach and then every brother preaches after Michael and brother Ron I said they didn't leave anything for me then brother Ron has to do a rain dance so I'm just changing a little bit of the notes so you don't think I copied notes I did not I didn't takee notes last night because I didn't want you to think oh yeah brother Tom just got off his nose no it's amazing to me it's amazing and you should be as a people buil that men of God can get into a channel and it's for you it's not for us the gifts are never for ourselves the gift is for the body and you should have such a rest and glorify God that men of God can just get in a channel and the word of God can feed you am so I'd like to preach a little subject on it it's a time when the Kings go to war amen yes it's a time when kings go to war turn to Revelation one please Revelation chapter 1 Revelation 1 verse 4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us can we read this together please and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen let's bow our heads in word of prayer one more time father we've read your word now would you come Lord and open it to us in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may have your seats as you're seating go to please 2 Samuel 2 Samuel 11 and verse one 2 Samuel 11 verse one and it came to pass that after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent joab and his servants unto him and all Israel and they destroyed I want to ask you last night how many destroyed Satan amen how many actually took God at his word and those spirits and demons left you and I want to say again he's the same yesterday today and for forever and we are the Kings and Priests unto God that's right amen and we are going to battle and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth if you look it up it says that the the Kings when they went to battle would go at a certain time of year year they would go either in the spring when it when it was still the ground was still hard and the Chariots wouldn't get bogged down the horses would run and they had a purpose they had a purpose and I trust you came to these meetings with a purpose that you said I'm going there not just to hear men preach but I'm going to support what they preach and I'm going to put an amen behind them and I'm going to deal with that demon that has bothered me am Hall I feel we need to put some gloves on now and do some battle not just to leave it to last night but get up this morning and say Satan you are defeated never to bother me again amen I want to say to you Saints I've been delivered from drugs from smoking drinking parties and everything else but I never gone back you never go back so if you left them there I want you to leave here and say I will not go back say it I will not go [Applause] back can't go back I canot go back how many have been delivered from smoking okay we got a few here more over here than here I did I got delivered I hated it but every time I determined in myself before I got saved I'm going to quit this filthy habit it's a filthy habit it's a demon and I would throw it out the window as I was driving down the road but I would count the fence post you know and that's a lot of times we come to church I want to get delivered but no butts Satan you're crushed no butts no fence folks no looking back no going back I can't go back this is better than anything that Satan wants to give you this [Applause] morning it is indeed no questions about it that's right no questions about it that's right you know a lot of times we appease the enemy rather than do battle with the Enemy you know and I've dealt with as it been I'm sure these men of God have much more than I may be but you would you can have deal with a homosexual demon you can deal with a demon demon a frothy demon frothy man I dealt with one one year guy was foing at the mouth foaming at the mouth and he come running towards the church and I stepped outside and I said you're not going to this church and he says I'm going to tear you apart spitting and sputtering and foaming and everything I remember a thing brother Bisal said a long time ago he says the reason people don't get delivered is because they love that [Applause] demon and so I saidou not coming here and I was just a young deacon at the time and and uh I was praying for you deacons by the way the other night you never get into a service you're always serving the people but may the Holy Spirit just calm everybody down and may the deacons get some from the word so he comes running around the corner he's fro at his mouth and and I'm looking at him and he says I'm going in there I said no you're not no you're not he said I'm going to tear you from limb to limb I said no you're not and he gets back his f fist like this and he's ready to plow me and I only thing that I could say is Satan I bind you come on Satan I bind you and that fellow turned around about three or four times and split the other direction and I said to myself it works come on it works what happened last night works pray for your family in Works receive the token it works let the Holy Spirit fall it works [Applause] glory god as Ministers of the Gospel we don't just want a one-time thing we don't want to just see that thing go and you go back home and it comes back again I want you to keep that devil on the run I want to see these young men actually stand in the word say Satan you can't have me God's got a work for me to do I've made my decision and I can't go back for a sub title Kings go to war and I can't go back there's a lot of turn coats there's a lot of people that come for a blessing Oh Come To Be Touched but after a while all they're living on is emotion I don't mind emotion but when God is behind the emotion you will never be the same and I find out that more people that preach either against it is that they don't have any so they got to they got to prop themselves up but Saints if God says it in the word I'm going to have a joy unspeakable I'm going to take it if he said I'm going to have Victory I'll take it if his word is open I'll take it sir take it I've decided to take a stand take it take it I don't care how old you are brothers I really don't care I was preaching the other day I was 70 years old and a little boy come up in the in in the the foyer grabs my leg and said how old are you brother Tom I said oh I'm really old he says I don't think so hey I don't think so so they said you're 70 what's 70 how are you supposed to feel it 7 I don't know how to feel I don't know what that was I've never been here before well you're supposed to act 70 I don't know what 70 how you supposed to act that's not me that's not me and saints of God like when we had a brother in our church he said I'd rather burn out than rust out come on especially you young fellas find a purpose get in the vision walk in the word slay the enemy I cannot go back sir brother Ron preached last night quit never I said oh my goodness I can't go back quit never what is the holy spirit trying to say to us they saved the best to last in a in a relay you know the fastest are the last I have to convince you some more so we save the best the last and you look at my flesh and your flesh you say really this is the best look beyond the flesh look at the fight in the dog and determine I'm going to run with everything that's in me wimp out no fight it yeah yes amen there is a war taking place in judges Jee he went to war he said Lord if you give us a win in this battle I'll sacrifice what comes out my tent and never realized and this is another subject we can preach on later but didn't realize that his daughter I I want you to hear this point he didn't realize he thought maybe I don't know what's going to come out the tent chicken I don't know a lamb I don't know I don't know what people have in their tents but he his daughter came out and this is what he said I have opened my mouth in a vow he vowed it to the Lord yeah and he opened his mouth and he said to the Lord I cannot go back and if he could sacrifice the dearest thing to him surely you have sacrificed many things last night I want you to say I canot go back can't go back I can't be what I was last night I'm a changed person I got delivered I'm set [Applause] free AOW in the Bible if vow and O are treated with profound seriousness contracts promises and Covenants before God are a very serious matter you've given your life to Christ I can't go back I've been Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost I can't go back are you going to have battles yes you are but you're not just an ordinary person you're a king and you're a priest and we got praise in our lips amen and we're Kings I heard about that King the other night find me somebody amen can ask something worthy of a king I thought the continuity in the word is just amazing what is the holy spirit trying to do within our lives Peter said to whom can we go disciples left and people have left and people will go but those that are truly born again see genes of God they are now a prisoner to the Revelation that God has given them and will you also go what do you say where would we go only this message I'm sorry I I'm a message believer I'm a message believer I know this church is a message believer I can't go anywhere else this message is life it's token life it's the life of Jesus Christ and he's the mighty conqueror and that conquer in me and that conquers in you don't allow the enemy ever to get you [Applause] again Hallelujah Hallelujah don't you ever let the enemy trap you again brother Bram said in the message look there's something in us that's compelling us it's a pulsation in our heart that says stay with it stay with it so if you got a sickness you got a disease and you never got delivered last night you're going to get delivered right in your seat clean house let's clean house let's go on we can't go back sir mothers I know you had children and babies and maybe you're just married and you don't have a family you got a husband oh boy I got a yes right no Amen on that sisters I'm talking to you you got a husband oh come on I better preach over here then maybe a little bit latter on the meter here sisters you have husbands there you go they one notop we have husbands I have a wife I adore her I adore her we have children I adore them that's their responsibility they're the Fifth Gospel don't water it down by looking at the things that are trinkets that are around you I got to have this I got to have that be content in what the Lord's given you we're Kings we're Queens we're priests and now those things are just don't matter I saw the I don't know if you remember there was a a a big earthquake and big tidle wave in uh at Fukushima in Japan beautiful homes and I saw those water waves they came in they swept hold Villages beautiful homes and I started to think what are in those beautiful homes I'm sure they saved up and got beautiful pictures beautiful things scripture talks about stuff and we shrimp and we save and we do this and we do that but in a moment it can be taken away so we have to hold these things that we have very Loosely don't set your heart for those things set your heart for the things of God because we can't go back to what Leo deia likes that's right increased with Goods sir if God blesses you praise the Lord give him all the the glory if you don't have anything I Paul says I know what it is to B and how to be a base one day you've got everything the next day you got nothing praise the Lord that's we need to walk forward I we have you have a lovely Saint here brother Tim I don't know whether sister Kathy has ever told her testimony she's had a profound effect on me I won't tell you her age but I'll tell you when she was a young lady she moved out of the colony a had toate Colony she moved for the word right Kathy you move for the word how many years ago is that 45 45 years ago when you walk out of the colony you walk with nothing they give you the home they give you your Furnishings they make it all but when you walk out of the colony past that fence you're going into hell you're going into the abyss and for a young teenage girl to leave that it takes something within that's stronger than the natural man she walked out out of there she came to Cloverdale and they sent their preachers they found out where Kathy was at and they brought a because in the colony they hardly pay them anything if anything and they took a lot of cash out of their pocket is that right K you can correct me and anytime you like they took a water of cash out of his pocket and he says Kathy it's yours if you want it huh hey got a church for converted I love them Henry was her brother was one of my best friends they held that little bundle of cash that a young teenage girl would love to have had he said you just deny this what you're believing and I'll give you this and no you know what her remark is Kathy I'm wrong again you say me she says I'm not a Judas God bless you Cathy I can't go back Hallelujah and here she is today a queen in this church amen I can't go back young man I can't go back ladies I can't go back Glory it's not a mental idea it's a revelation Glory you get it down to oh I play an Oregon or I play a piano that's my position oh my goodness who do you you think you are I'm the guitar player and brother Tim Brook you always have to put that last at Tim pro to give you position sorry I'm just being myself temp hey you can be removed that's not a permanent post you come prayed up you come cherishing the gift that God gave you Satan could have used that gift and used it in the world but God said you're mine I'll never go back I can't do that I hate that music I I'm sorry but I'm this way at home I guess aren't I Sam come on Sam give me an [Laughter] amen Joel Michael yes sir there you go amen what a time we're living in when all hell is against this Revelation MH all hell Christ of mystery God revealed all hell is against this Revelation but let me give you a a great exhortation he can't have [Applause] youall that's why he he starts ending now Christ is Mystery of God revealed Christ is the mystery of God revealed in you you got to figure out who you use is I'm a you yeah that's right and so then he goes on to say now we are the sons of God not we'll be but now so listen we don't want to lower that when a prophet preached that in 1963 after the opening of the seals because that was part of the mystery that was being revealed under the seals right so we read on Friday night or Thursday night Jesus had to believe who he was you have to believe who you are so now we're moving it a notch at a time a notch at a time because it's one thing to say to these wonderful men that we just cherish the gift of God within their lives but it's not just for them it's for you it's for you we're not Catholics here oh father bless me we left that behind and we won't go back but we'll go back to be Sons and Daughters of God realizing who we are in this day that's right and the Kings at a time at this Junction are going out to battle but the Bram says this he goes listen it can batter against you but it can't get you when Satan walked up to Eve and said you know the fruit's pleasant she stopped for a moment oh that's when she made her mistake she stopped for a moment when she stop for a moment and brother brandom you should hear it he said don't stop for nothing did you hear me don't stop for nothing add to your faith virtue virtue and they make a whole Doctrine to that the adding as we're fellowshipping the other day is not that you can add anything to your stature you can't Jesus said I'm 5'6 yes I as we said and they made fun of me one of my sons want to be 6'2 you can't add to your stature you are what you are but if you look at the word add in the Greek it says that add is to lay in the presence of the Sun and so that sun would bring out the life that's in the seed so the secret isn't that you add to it the secret is laying the presence that's right laying God lay in Christ amen ah but we're too busy brother did you vow a vow here some said Lord if you will deliver me of this I'll serve you stronger and harder than I've ever served you before maybe you said it maybe you didn't but if you vowed that vow or you promis that promise then you have to make a determination I cannot go back to what I was before the brothers laid hands on me and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna really we'll just start digging now how many got delivered sir okay okay I'll even make it better than that stand up if you were delivered Isaiah God bless you God bless you amen this is nothing but the truth so now you've been delivered I'm a king and I will not go [Music] back Hallelujah so now we start to understand it came to pass after the year was expired so they said there either be in winter when the heart's ground or coming in the spring or fall when there's a harvest so they can feed their soldiers so it's it's planned you sit down and a as as Jesus said when a king decides to go to war he weighs out weighs it out that King's got 40,000 men and we got 25,000 can we do it our men are mightier they're stronger God does not care for the number never has a never will be we can read in Chronicles we can read in in Genesis with Abraham they were out numbered but with God on your side if the scripture says greater is he that's in than he that's in the world and we realize that at that river Euphrates 200,000,000 Supernatural demons just added added more thereafter brother Bri said only one thing you the bride so you say Where's God in my life you're here come come on come on you're here and Supernatural demons have been loosed on you and so you have been defeating Satan day after day after [Applause] day you are victorious that's how important it is to get the Holy Ghost yes sir if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're miserable yeah you're defeatable but once you get him and that word is living in you you're the one that conquers that devil amen you can't always go to the pastors you have to go to God yourself say Satan I bind you I'm a son of the god of of the Lord I'm a Son of God I'm a king believe who you are believe what you are believe the promise of God it was a time when kings went out to battle so now I'm just taking a little slower for you brother Brown went to a road uh a ranch I think it was and BR always thought he was a cowboy sat on the rail of the Corral where they're breaking a horse these guys are getting bucked off and flipped out and got on the ground and you know dust flying everywhere the one Cowboy says to brother Brown are you a cowboy so not no way Jose when I got these men behind me I go are you a preacher but I know that I've been redeemed I know know that I've been bought with a price I know I have been changed and I know that I have been delivered and I can not go back can't go back I don't want to be a miserable wretch I want to have victory in my life get the Holy Ghost get Christ in you the hope of glory and it's more than just me saying it it's you doing it oh come in maybe it'll be Wednesday night or next Sunday get it now get it now I want power power wonderwork power not by might not by power that's men's power not God power not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord you want Victory just open up your heart and say Lord come and give me Victory give me more of Jesus give me more of the Holy Ghost and power if I haven't been baptized with the Holy Ghost let it be this morning so I can go out those doors a different person determined I can't go back to what I was before these [Applause] meetings Oneness of unity brother Bram said you Satan Satan that's right you are aware that you're whipped so now a prophet is addressing Satan letting you know the devil's whipped so what's your problem all right what is your problem it's so hard really get God oh I can just make it make it I'm running I got the Finish Line I'm looking forward I'm Not Looking Backward I left that old man and now I'm running to the price before me Hallelujah didn't he say didn't he say he says when you look in the mirror see a completely whole person come on and step towards it as I said to our children probably 40 years ago Mirror Mirror of God's word are you becoming what you've heard I gave they made a little plaque for me and I had it in my office for years and years and years and I I can look into that mirror and they got the whole thing on there Mirror Mirror of his word are you reflecting what you've heard you've heard wonderful preaching you're sitting under wonderful Ministries but are we becoming what we here or is this a service we're coming into and going out coming in you should be more charged coming here this morning than you were last night I saw you dancing amen I don't mind that I just don't have the job like again and that's not the right word forgive me I it's the move that's right Joel has the move huh but you know you say as Canadians are starchy huh that's good Tom man that's good Tom we're excited when you're excited but we're you know when you're just going slow Amazing Grace Hallelujah victory is mine victory is mine no we do it by the pace of a song you should be able to do it in a slow or in a fast victory is mine Amazing Grace is mine it doesn't matter what song is singing rejoice and I say to you again this morning rejoice the king is in the town hallelujah king MDC King MDC after the battle mthc came on the scene come on and he had for Abraham Bread and Wine but that was a theophany so Abraham being a prophet saw God in morphe in a theophany so that you and I can know after the battle after last night King MDC is leading his people home thank you Lord hallelujah you know where the Devil Makes a mistake I'll tell you where he makes a mistake he took the wrong person yeah God promised Abraham look North look South yeah look east west east look that way all that's in yours so Abraham didn't move when Sodom and Gomorrah were getting rampaged didn't move but you know when he moved when Satan took something that was his come on I think we got to get moved uhhuh and he didn't just say in his neighborhood he went from Dan to Barba and he didn't just get lot he got everything 38 men versus four kingdoms that's God I want you to understand you're

Royal Seed of Abraham do you have children that need a holy ghost experience go after them go after them don't wait for the Deacon don't wait for the trustee don't wait for the Elder you go after them

mouth God will do it how do you know brother Tom cuz he did it for me he did it for brother Ron he did it for brother Tim and God's no respector of persons all we are is help you in your testimony that you can say if you did it for brother Tom you'll do it for me you did it for brother Tim you'll do it for me you did it for brother Ron you'll do it for me amen I believe it oh yeah yes sir we

the girls and all that stuff well I'm not going to let that influence come in now I'm not going to let it happen so I thought the only way you can deal with this is confront it so I went over to their house we had a family meeting and I looked at the girls I said you're not saved you're only pretending in your brain that you're saved you might come to church the odd time and I said to the boys boys you need an experience with God we got two girls and two boys right now we're going after the last God be the glory it's a time when kings go to battle and the King of Kings is with you in this battle with the captain of The Lord of host before us we cannot [Applause] lose praise the Lord Satan are you aware you're whipped you have no legal right that's right Jesus Christ my Lord stripped you of every Authority you had when he died at Calvary to take every sin and sickness away you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff you know that when our Lord came to the tree he cursed the tree the next day it withered and our lord said to his disciples have faith faith in God for if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart amen but believe what you've said to come to pass Satan know the scriptures on that and I've just taught the people that God is in them and if God is in them and they speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt in their heart right then that disease is gone right then right then right now Satan you're a blst I'm a king I'm a son of the king I got double kingship M you were stripped at Calvary you have No Authority but I Take God at his word Satan I've been taught right leave my [Applause] [Music] children that night that camp that brother the first one that came in was the same night brother Ron preached that Andrew got saved my son got saved and brother Dan who is our accountant in the church got saved you want to know how cool he is I'll tell you how cool he is he's a black man he's got a Jane jacket with fur on his collar at 85 degre I said to the brother next to me I said he's so cool that even heat doesn't bother him but then the King come on the scene come on the king came on the scene the king came on the scene all and he's never been the same since and from him his sisters got saved and from him his brother got saved you say it's impossible it's impossible possible what are you what are you doubting that for you say well my my child listen I Gabe God saved he came he came and this God so blessed sister Angelica God gave her a wonderful man he's a preacher in the message now and they were having their baby dedicated and a baxin boy in the church was having a stag party for his wedding and his sister was having a baby dedication on the Sunday I had a whole message all done out on the Saturday night I got up morning early praying and the Lord said you're not going to pray you're not going to preach that message I'm giving you another message doesn't happen often but it happens and I get nervous is that me or is that you Lord is that me or you're she is a twin and I took out of Genesis do as your brother able and you'll do well and she looked at her sister and the brother looked at the sister and they said look at Angelica and look at me okay he said brother Thomas preached that message not for anybody in the church but me and what does he do he willingly comes to the Altar and he gives his life to Christ why because a daddy and a mommy applied the token in their living room and said I will not be denied and today they have fellowship with their children let me ask you do you want to go back to the world no guess what you can't not that you've got a will in this whatsoever because if you're a c Gene of God you can't especially under the opening of the word that is now it's impossible I know in whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I committed right there I commit it and I won't go [Applause] back it's good for the young people it's good for the adults say well that's not a very deep message okay somebody yeah but you preach deep and it goes over your head wasn't that a good service brother bisco says yeah some of the brothers preach and they get you on the on the runway yeah brother yeah brother and all of a sudden the tires lift and they go up in the clouds and people are just sitting there days for about an hour and a half then they come down to Landing oh yeah we're with you again I'd like to take you all away for the whole plane ride cuz we're not in an airplane age we're in an astronaut age and when we take off saintes we're in Heavenly places and it's not church anymore this is not church this is Heavenly [Applause] places always he said we're in Heavenly places always not the the preacher has to preach you happy you're happy every day do you have trials absolutely one brother came to me one time he says do you ever have a trial I've lived with them for over 30 some odd years at the church do you ever have a trial no no hospital 7 months ankle one amputate take it off do this do that no trial at all it's been sweet roses right honey we've never had a problem but I'm never going to let the devil get a satisfaction to let my countenance go to his glory I'll put a smile on my face I'll put a step I'll put my shoulders back and say I'm a son of the king in the good times in the bad times we do the same Glory Glory I've had car wreck car wreck car wreck car wreck not one my problem not one I ca smashed up hit by big humongous trucks in a nice little sports car whack they trying to get me whack trying to get me again you can't get me can't get me until God's finished with me he can't have me then it's just the buggy taking me into the presence of the [Applause] king [Applause] amen can't go back sorry and then yet I'm not that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I've already attained either or already perfect but I follow after that that I might prehend that for which I've been apprehended for so why did God apprehend you to show Satan this eve this eve more than a quote it's a revelation this Eve will not fall is that right brother Tim I think you preached one time see you know we get old but we still have a memory huh and and when these brothers preach I take it in I take it in I don't know when he preached I know it was a long time ago and I've used it many times he said in in God's Eden Satan came in if you haven't heard it well you're going to hear it from me if you have heard it say praise the Lord amen so he says Satan came in God's Eden and got Eve but now in Satan's Eden heyen we destroy that serpent Glory yes sir it's nothing but the truth I will apprehend that which God apprehended me for to be his victory to be triumphant in Christ and to destroy the works of the devil amen he say you're excited brother Tom you bet I am you bet is that a good expression or bad that's okay I'll put money on it yes sir you get this Holy Spirit come on you'll be yourself but

I was before I came that's what meetings are all about brother R said said in things that are to be the man of God the pastor will call certain men to come at a certain season and have them Minister the word because they know what their body needs and he types it to a woman being pregnant and have cantaloup or whatever it is the husband will do anything it can to see the need met within his wife cuz she's going to bring forth a child so a pastor has a church and he sees the body bringing forth Christ and so they have special meetings throughout the here God knows who's going to speak and you should come with such great expectation you should be leaving this church you know this is excuse me this was my dad before when I was a little boy son shake my hand he goes when you shake a hand he says you put it there just give me your hand let's agree together huh take a firm hold I met uh somebody the other day that he was coming to the school and he wanted to to meet us to go over some of

can't even get our people to lift their hands they're waving I said look at those people they're having a Revival in their den of iniquity Saints they should never outshine us they should never make us looks our children would should see that peace of God within daddy's heart going through a hard time can hardly put the end of the month to the paycheck Our God's able to supply all our needs according to his riches and Glory then all of a sudden a check comes in the mail a rebate comes back and you got enough money at the end of the month who put that rebate there who put that check there my God put that check there I've seen it in my life I've seen in my son's life and I believe it's in your life don't doubt God he's a god of the impossible so now here's a son of elzar and they they got it in the scripture and I don't know it says dodo dodo it's a Dodo word but you know when you get a problem with a word just go look it up don't just glaze over it but look up the word they put dodo but in the Hebrew it's do do day and do Day means the son of the lovely one I love that I love that title I almost want to be Tom Ray dodo do day huh I am I'm son of the lovely one and he's coming in plain [Applause] view so here is doe one of the three mighty men with David and he he defied the Philistines we're going to be closing so I want you to stay with me right now am man he defied the devil and I want you to end these meetings with defying Satan uh-huh amen he defied the Philistines that's what your Bible says he defied the Philistines amen son of do day the aites one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were gathered there to battle and the man of Israel were gone away and he arose now think about it the men of Israel had gone away but he arose oh yeah come on he arose and he smokee the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clav unto the sword I said that's what I want to do brother Tim that's what I want to do the king's sword has come in your generation it fits it fits and the Bible says the Israelites ran away but the son of do eleazer he fought with the sword in his hand and the Lord won a great victory that that day and then the people returned that's they wanted to Rejoice with him that had the victory that's miserable I want you all to Rejoice you've taken the sword this weekend you've taken it in your hand and that sword is n thee even in thy mouth it fits now perhaps elaser he grew tired but my Bible says that Gideon also grew tired the Bible says he was weary yet kept pursuing you might be weary but I want you to keep pursuing when you leave this building today I want you to keep pursuing get up in the morning have a little prayer read your Bible listen to one of the messages read one of the message book fortify yourself in Christ amen they said there was do aler the son of do nobody helping him hey I've come to the realization over these 40 some odd years 47 years that i' say more people left us and stayed with us I say I and I I don't want to count what the devil's taken away but if there was God they can't get taken away period so do day son of Alazar nobody was helping him it is a good assistance of the word to say good cheer he didn't have anybody to say good cheer he didn't have anybody saying way to go Tommy way to go keep fighting boy he had nobody he had a revelation of who he was under the kingship Kings go to battle he knew he's under the king David he knew King David was coming to his position and I know my word my God is coming to his position I'll fight like

co-pilot says to control tower to control tower we have an emergency our pilot just got blown out we'll need a helicopter to do a grid search for him he's somewhere in the and he gave the coordinates so he got down real quickly to the nearest airport and when they landed there was the pilot holding on to the stairs holding on to the stairs flying at 200 miles an hour and when he went to loose his hand it took them about half an hour to get his fingers off in the railing now that was a tight grip and the fellow said to him how did you hold on he saids the option wasn't good amen hold on hold on
