us and put us on right footing Lord Solid Ground father and we're here tonight to receive of your Direction Lord we're here tonight to receive of your spirit God you would tell us in your word that

need you to lead us we need you to guide us we humble ourselves before you father and we just invite you to have the preeminence tonight Lord we love you and we just Commit This service now to you in Jesus name if you have your Bibles tonight you turn to acts 12 we're gonna I was studying earlier this week looking at part six of the series that I've been under taken here and just never really felt the leadership to go that direction the Lord kind of changed my thought on Saturday and so brother Timothy kind of touched on this phase here of Peter on Sunday service so you that were there you understood it you understand where we're going but Lord changed my thoughts so I just ask one thing tonight let's be honest with ourselves so there'll be things that may be spoken that may be very personal and I'm speaking to this from a very personal standpoint tonight things that I've had to battle things that I've overcome things that I've faced and I know that I can guarantee you you face the same things so don't think well I'm just picking you out and I'm just using you an example and I'm just preaching at you tonight that's not the case because if that's the case if that's my heart then I don't need to be standing behind here tonight but I believe God laid this on my heart to help all of us and I'm asking that you'll just be be honest with yourself and I want to speak to you on a message that I want to call walk out and we look here and we find here in Acts 12 and verse 3 and because he saw that it pleased the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also then were the days of unleavened bread and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and he delivered him to four quadrians of soldiers to keep him intending after eat after Easter to bring him forth to the people Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him and when Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept to prison and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him and a light shine in a prison and he smoked Peter on the side and he raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off of his hands and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he saith unto him cast I garment about thee and follow me God bless you I'll let you have your seats tonight so we recognize just here and we're going to kind of jump off we'll come back to this passage of scripture here in just a little bit but I want you to recognize tonight where Peter was at because all of us at some point in our in our life in our Christian Journey we find ourselves in the same place now Peter had been to Pentecost Peter has received the Holy Ghost Peter was a spokesman for the church and yet because Peter was all those things the devil knew exactly what he was going to try to do and after his Pentecostal experience after him becoming the spokesman after him having that Holy Ghost experience yet the enemy came in through Peter into a prison and I want you to know just because you have the Holy Ghost tonight just because you're a Son of God and a daughter of God it doesn't mean that the devil doesn't come and attack us and try to shut you into a prison because that's his tactic that's his desire that's what his effort that's what he's trying to do and we look in Isaiah 59 the Bible tells us behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save neither is his ear heavy that he cannot hear and in verse 14 of the same passage and judgment is turned away backward and Justice standeth far off for a truth has fallen in the street and Equity cannot enter yea truths faileth and he that departed from Evil maketh himself a prey and the Lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no one there was no one there was no judgment excuse me and he saw that there was no man and he wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arms brought salvation unto him and his righteousness and it sustained him for he put on a Vengeance as a breastplate a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for her clothing and he clad with zealed as a cloak and according to their deeds according as he will repay Fury to your adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the son so when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard now many of us here and I ask you be honest with yourself tonight many of us here at some point in our Christian journey and our walk with the Lord we have felt the overwhelming flood of the enemy we have felt his constant attacks his bombardments we have encountered his accusations we've endured his sickness and all his evil schemes and sometimes we've even stumbled at some of his tactics we even entertain his lies we've even entertained his lives but you know the best way to win a battle now I've done a lot of World War II reading I've done a lot of reading on the Native American Indians but I've realized the number one way to win a battle is to surround your enemy on all sides you you take them from the front you attack their Left Flank you attack their right flank you Ambush them from the rear so they have no retreat and that's exactly what the enemy tries to do to us as Believers he attacks your mind he attacks your body he attacks your family he attacks your children he attacks your marriage he'll attack your church he'll attack everything that you stand for to get you to to surrender because his focus and his goal is to shut you into a prison I want you to understand that that's his Focus that's his goal nobody here tonight is against you not one brother not one sister not one mom not one dad not one believer is against any other person here tonight those present those on the stream nobody is here against you the only one that's against you tonight is your adversary the enemy and the bibles are declared he would be an adversary to your adversary he will pour out vengeance upon your adversary tonight recognize what we're fighting recognize who we're fighting and quit fighting one another and let's turn our efforts on the enemy tonight because his focus and his goal is to shut you into a prison we find the Bible tells us for when the enemy shall come in and we know that there is a there's a comma there when he comes in like a flood comma but I want us to read it like the way as a Believer we should read it when the enemy comes in comma like a flood think about that like a flood the power God has poured out upon your adversary because your sons and daughters of God see the Lord would not allow your enemy to get away with attacking his children he will repay Fury to the adversary recompense to the enemy so like a flood he said he's going to lift up a standard now you know the thing about water water can change its state it can be a solid it could be a gas and it can be a liquid pretty powerful source and you yet you find have you ever been to the Grand Canyon that wasn't created by a sandstorm that was created by water and it may have started as a trickle but that trickle picked up steam and that water came in and cut deep Canyons into some rocky soil and what am I telling you tonight the power of the Holy Ghost has enough power and authority behind it tonight that it can cut deep Canyons into your life and it can go down into the D the things that you have suppressed the things that you had put down you put out of your thought and it can go down to the depths of your soul and begin to discern and withstand and pull up things so that you can get deliverance and it can wash all those sediments out of your life and make you a son and make you a daughter of God the Bible would tell us in Hebrews that the word of God is sharper it's quick and it's powerful and it's sharper than any two-edged sword the word of God is still a discerner but yet we are so human humanistic that we will walk out of church and say somebody told them you're exactly right that's somebody being the power of the Holy Ghost he told me on Saturday night to preach this message so if you get offended tonight take it up with my God but we look here and I want to share some things from my heart tonight so we find that there's things that we put out of our mind things that maybe things that maybe you were you hurt when you was a child and it influenced your thinking it influenced your behavior it influenced your attitude and it influence your actions and some of you tonight are still trying to overcome those influences come on I ask you to be honest with yourself let me tell you I didn't have the greatest upbringing okay I've shared my testimony with some of you it wasn't the most flowery bed of ease but I'm overcoming still yet today things that I endured as a child things that I endured and you know what and when you're a child you don't have a mature mind so you perceive things that are not as though they may actually have been so you br you you perceive them with an immature mind and it may not be as bad and devastating as you perceive it but yet because it's so influenced you in that area and so it moved in your life in that area now there's a wall up you had built yourself a wall that you can't get over maybe somebody said something hurt you as a child better yet maybe somebody said some about somebody else and now your perception of that person is Tainted you'll never see them Through The Eyes Of God with that in your mind you will only see them with the taintness of that negativity that they put on it and you know how hard it is as an individual to overcome the negative thought maybe you had never met somebody and somebody said something and that what they said so impressed upon you you never give that individual the benefit of the doubt you put a wall and say you're not coming into my life you're not coming into my family look church I've been guilty we're all guilty I ask you to be honest be honest with yourself because if we're going to get out of prison we got to be honest if we're planning to get free tonight we got to be honest brother Aaron did a wonderful job last week speaking on one mind one Accord that's what it's going to take tonight and we heard a fabulous message again on Sunday about the change the light the change I'm entertaining he's able to change your situation tonight if you'll be honest with yourself and not be under false pretense that I don't need this kind of preacher so we find now listen to what brother Brown says here notice notice now he says something may have impacted you as a child it could be laying there for years listen to this quote here and this is whatever he saith unto you do it he says you have a nervous trouble sitting there don't you lady only you have spells of nervousness that makes you feel like you're going to lose your mind and you thought she was all alone in that he says now Satan sometimes tells you that you cross the line and nobody ever heard that tonight have you oh you practically you've been nervous all your life notice what he says you had a scary sort that when you were a child just a little girl and now here he goes here is you're trying to do something make beds or something and you get so nervous that you have to sit down but you've been praying you've been trying to be healed he goes when this lady was being prayed for just now you felt something strange come over you if that is right raise your hand if that's true I've told you the truth I've never seen you you're he goes you're just a lady that's walked up there and sat down and I tell you in the name of Jesus you are healed go home your well notice it happened to her when she was a child maybe a negative thought maybe a scare maybe something so impacted her in her youth but yet now as a young Christian or as a Christian mother or a Christian woman or a Christian father now you're fighting against something that is so deep and so far removed from your conscience but the word of God is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and he's able to come down with the anointing of the Holy Spirit through a five-fold gifted Ministry and cut those things right out of your life so that you can rise up and do exactly what the prophet of God said go home you're healed in the name of Jesus maybe somebody hurt you and I know none of y'all here tonight's been hurt but let's just be honest with ourselves there's not one of you here tonight that has not been hurt by the Maybe by your neighbor and I'm not talking about the one that lives at the physical address that you live at I'm talking about the neighbor that's sitting on the Pew with you it's part of humanity church it's part of overcoming it's part of recognizing the enemy and all of his tactics and recognizing that your brother is not your enemy but the devil will try to use your brother and maybe use a curse word maybe use a ugly look or maybe they just completely ignored you all together and now you're offended see some of these things happen to us and we have to be careful see but the word has the ability to reach down into your life on a Wednesday night and begin to cut and begin to perform surgery he's got a steady hand he knows exactly where he's going see the word of God can diagnose the condition way better than any surgeon and notice he can go down and he can cut those things and he he exposes your human weaknesses things that you didn't know laid there because they were so far removed from your conscience but they hindered you from moving with God they hindered you from growing they hindered you from really being born again or taking that next step from walking with a God and giving up your past things that you didn't know laid there they're there but he's still a discerner of the thoughts and in the intents of the heart notice now brother Brandon would tell us this and I know I preached this several times before but we recognize the greatest battle that's ever been fought is the Battle of your gray matter you know you could have great big muscles brother Daryl but that little bit of great matter man it could really it could throw your world your life for a loop so the greatest battle that you'll ever face you may never face an enemy and physically be in confrontation but you fight a battle in your mind on a daily basis and notice he said there has to be a place selected a mutual ground no man's land that they fight here at this place he said they just don't fight over here and and one down here and one run over there he says that there's a Battlefront where they meet and they test their powers so Satan is trying to test his powers against yours he's trying to test his powers his reasoning his doubt his unbelief against your faith and what you claim to be the mess of the hour he's going to attack your faith oh you believe God's in a prophet and he's going to attack the message and make you stand or or run away from it because it comes under attack or maybe it be well you know if you've prayed for healing and he attacks your body he may strike you with cancer and you prayed and you prayed and you prayed and you're on chemo you lost your hair and you lost this and you lost that and yet Satan is there to see whether you truly believe that I am the Lord thy God that heals all thy diseases so he's testing his powers against your powers but I want you to know tonight when you receive the Holy Ghost that's the power that he can't overcome that's a test and he can't defeat and I want to encourage you tonight don't give up just recognize seek that tonight more than anything I need the Holy Ghost though because when he comes with his test then you've got the tester to be able to withstand every accusation and trial of the enemy he said when this battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin for the battle to rage that the Battleground begins in the human mind why because decisions are made from that gray matter so we realize tonight whether you're young and whether you're old Satan is attacking your mind young people you face a completely different battle in the mind than what I will or some of the older grandparents will see the battle is different when I I may look at something I may have a battle and you may look at me like man would you please just get over yourself but see it's my battle it's not yours it's not something you contend with and I may look at your about I'm like man come on pull yourself out of your bootstraps and get with it but that's your battle I don't understand it I'm not in your battle but I know that we still all face the same adversary and we have our own battle and if we could just step back for a minute and just have enough compassion for our human brothers and sisters and recognize we all everyone here tonight are facing a battle and if you're here and I said well I'm not having a battle of my mind brother Joe I'm a good Christian I'm a righteous man and I'm just you're just a liar oh you're just a big fat lie I'm here to tell you I'll call you out tonight because we all face it because that's the Battleground but I'm here to tell you God doesn't want to leave you there he don't want to leave you fighting alone he has come to you on a Wednesday night to declare that he can take you from where you are in the battle of the mind and place you where he desires you to be so our battles are different we struggle different things different ways but yet we struggle and the Bible says encourage one another all the more man if we really put that into action what about elt I'm not saying we're not a lovely church I'm not saying we're not a church that encourages us but I'm just saying if we would really put that in action instead of turning your finger on them and and told them about them and talking about this when well so and so did this and so and so did that and I didn't like the way the pastor did this and I didn't like the way brother Joe did that and I didn't like the way the song leader did this and I didn't like the way the singers did this and I didn't I didn't I did not if we would just encourage one another how much further down the road would we be how much more sincere would we be as a local church body see Satan he knows that you're going to make decisions there's not one person hitting here tonight that hasn't made a decision making a decision or going to make a decision because we make decisions but he knows if he can influence your decisions by the Battle of your mind the decision you make will also bring forth the actions and the words from your tongue the Bible tells us from the abundance of the heart speaketh the mouth so the things you're dwelling on things you're thinking on those things that begin going to be lived out in your life and confessed out of your mouth so Satan tries to influence your decision-making by putting thoughts in your head some of you even here tonight have contemplate leaving this church because you've been hurt contemplate I'm gonna move I'm gonna go to another state I'm gonna go to brother Donnie's I'm gonna go to brother Roz I'm gonna die I'm gonna hear and it's just got to be better no it ain't gonna be better because you're gonna show up and you're going to show up with your own human failures your own human weaknesses your own human desires your own complexes when you show up it's downhill from there what am I telling you work through the thing today we got to begin to work through issues and work through situations and let God get the glory when Satan tries to come in and separate God is here he's not a separator in that regard he wants to bind us closer together when you recognize the devil and every one of his attacks then you can recognize who's trying to weasel his way into the midst and split the church and divide the people and kill the fellowship and stop the influence from a Godly Ministry and yet God is sin and other people to move in here because they're blessed by the ministry they're blessed by the church they're blessed by the fellowship and all you can see is the negative all you can see is the faults all you can see is what the devil wants you to see take your stinking eyeglasses off tonight and look through the eyeglasses of the Holy Spirit and see what God sees I've been preaching to you about the seed of God God sees sons and daughters that are maturing in the faith sons and daughters that are displaying his life sons and daughters that is in his own image quit using or quit allowing yourself to be used by the enemy the Bible tells us that we're to cast down imaginations now I ain't know I know nobody here tonight had any kind of crazy imaginations have you man we are good at Building Bridges everybody here tonight is an engineer brother Mark not by yourself man we can we can fabricate some stories in our mind man we can build this and build that and that brother I remember one time years ago brother Andrew I'm sorry but I'm gonna use you tonight many years ago before he got married before he got to Holy Ghost I took him to Iowa with me I was doing up there preaching a lot and I took him on a trip and on the way back he was brother Joe I didn't even think you like me like why would you think that because the devil got in his mind and he thought well because you looked at me at one time on a Sunday I think it was you looked at me funny and I thought well he don't like me I never said it I said man if I didn't like you you wouldn't be in this car with me right now on a 13-hour trip there 13-hour trip back spending all night in a hotel room if I didn't like you you wouldn't be here but that's how the enemy works he plays on your weakness he he battles your mind but the Bible says we have to cast down those things you got a part to play in this cast those things down Satan trying to tell you he'll never be healed cast it down trying to tell you you'll never make it cast it down trying to tell you you can't have your children cast those things down to rise up and recognize Who You Are so he brought the program tells now the mind accepts the life which is the word of God and there it brings life just your thought doesn't do it it's not mind over matter he says but what is your mind controlled by it's controlled by your spirit and the spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that has life in it and it brings life into you so here tonight the spirit of God is here moving in the service and you're a spirit that's control your mind is controlled by your spirit and if your spirit can reach up and understand what I'm preaching tonight that is not my voice but it's his voice trying to tell you you can be free tonight and grab hold of that and it'll bring freedom inside of it it'll break the shackles off of your life and you can walk out of this place free tonight no longer bound no longer in prison no longer in shackles but you've got to realize who's trying to speak to you and receive it and let it come inside of you you have to doubt your doubts he says it must be accepted into mind then believe with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every sense of the soul and body is just scoured out by the Holy Ghost so you got to believe that it's for you you got to believe that Deliverance is for you you got to believe that salvation is for you you got to believe that the Holy Ghost is for you you got to believe that healing is for you you've got to believe that every person in this church is here for you I go a lot of places I'm gonna tell you I've not found a better Church and when I say church I'm talking about the character of the people that's not all brother Tim is that all brother Timothy but it's the body we are if you just understood what is sitting next to you tonight as I told y'all last week what a great people we have here but you know all we see sometimes is their faults we see their failures because we see their faces and they didn't make a pretty face at me and we get caught up in all the church politics who said she said this one said we get all worried about all that frivolous stuff that doesn't matter nothing doesn't matter and what is he trying to do trying to influence your decisions trying to influence your thought process program says this and now if he can get you to stop for a minute if he can get you to stop for a minute he can make you reason it out notice he can make you think with your mind but God doesn't use man's head God chose to Heart so here Satan uses the head and the Bible tells us in Proverbs 23 7 for as he thinketh in his heart so he said God chose your heart so when Satan attacks your mind to imprison you to pass failures to imprison you to regret to imprison you to doubts and unbelief he will make you think that you're lost because you make a mistake that you never had the Holy Ghost because you stumbled and failed he makes you think that you've crossed a line and there's no hope for you because of things that you did in your past he tries to get you to reason the word to make you think it's not for me now no I'm just preaching to myself but let me preach to myself tonight if that's okay see Satan tries to get you the to say oh well healing everybody's getting healed but it's not for me and the Holy Ghost is for everybody else and I see people running and Shout like we did last Wednesday but it's not for me I see people you know they believe this message but I'm still on the fence whether it's not for me he wants you to think everything negative makes you feel that you're not accepted in the local body that you're not accepted nobody likes you oh my so Satan's attack is to what disbelieve God's word so he wants you to disbelieve the word so what does he do he attacks the ministry he attacks to officials of the church he attacks the church and you walk through those doors with those devil glasses on and all you see is failure and faults all you see is negativity oh I ask you to be honest with yourself you walk through that door and he crowns you with a critical spirit all that running and shenanigans up in the house of God we need to get some order see that's how the devil talks so I'm asking you to recognize who's doing the talking recognize that that's not of God so notice what he says here now so we found out the the Battle Ground is the mind that little bit of gray matter houses a whole lot of power think it with your mind it's a powerful organ it's a powerful weapon because notice man with a powerful mind has created automobiles created uh created airplanes and and spaceships and they've landed on the moon man with that gray matter created an iPad that you can FaceTime your brother or sister or crossover sees a family member so the mind is a powerful weapon just think about if you can turn your weapon against your enemy versus allowing him access all the time see the thoughts that pass through your mind they are responsible for a lot of things that happen if not everything that happens in your life the things that you're dwelling on even here tonight as I'm preaching notice see not all thoughts are equal your predominant thoughts the ones that repeat often they will influence your behavior they will influence your attitude they will affect your actions and your reactions and they will shape your reality so when you come into the house of God on a Wednesday night and your attitude ain't in check and your actions ain't in check because your mind ain't in shape because you've been dwelling on the negative and you're expecting to get something from the house of God I'm asking you to be honest with yourself tonight and just recognize who it is that you're at war with brother Roger you're not at war with any of us brother Mark we're not at war with you but the devil is at war with all of us he's got one purpose one goal to destroy destroy destroy destroy destroy destroy family destroy marriages destroy children destroy homes to destroy this church and to destroy this ministry and if we could recognize who it is that's attacking maybe we'll pull our own guns up pull them back for a little bit and encourage one another notice what the Bible says here in Philippians 4 8 finally brother whatsoever things are true so let's start with the truth first whatever things are true whatsoever things of honest honesty is a great place to start as well whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things Paul the first messenger is telling you tonight quit thinking about the devil's things quit looking at his lies quit entertaining all the negativity and look on these things that are true that are honest that are just that are pure that are lovely that have virtue and strength in it and praise in it he's telling you dwell on these things because if you dwell on these things you won't pile on the other things and what you dwell on influences your actions it influences your tongue it influences your behavior then you wonder why those can jump and Shout because they're dwelling on the things of God it puts something inside of them it makes them on a shout it makes them want to jump it makes them respond to the word but as long as you're beat down and you're dwelling on the negative you take your eyes up let me just say you will not rise up so dwell on the things of God tonight put your focus put your focus on this we must make sure that the things that we're dwelling on they're Godly things pure things honest things notice let me say this tonight and you can't stand between two opinions okay you can't be on that fence the devil built it and he owns it okay well I'm on the fifth let me just say this you can't support the word of God and still entertain lives of the enemy you understand what I'm telling you tonight I'm not telling you this to beat you down and draw you in a corner but I'm telling you you can't stand between two opinions you can't say oh I want the Holy Ghost but yet you got a loose tongue and you're running everybody down no when you stand between two opinions you get spiritual Amnesia and the prophet of God said and you don't know who you are and I've been preaching to you over and over time declared to you that you are a son of God that you are a daughter of God you're not the devil's whipping post you're not the Devil's Child you belong to God you've always belonged to God you always will belong to God and draw yourself hold the word of God don't stand between two opinions and for this word stand for righteousness stand for godliness stand for truth and honesty tonight don't allow the enemy to flood your mind well I'm just going to turn out like my mama I'm just going to turn out like my daddy I'm just going to turn out like a failure because it runs in my family no somebody's gonna break the cycle let me tell you I know all too well about breaking Cycles I stand before you tonight as a cycle breaker you've got to make a choice you may have to stand against those that you truly love but I'm gonna tell you when you do God will stand for you God will place you he will establish your feet but as long as you're entertaining whole family matters here and this issue here and this issue here you got to make a stand somebody's got to break the cycle and It Ain't Easy there's a lot of tears that I have shed because of choices I had to make because I was going to stand for this truth I got a lovely family because I stood for this truth because I wasn't going to allow influences from others to influence and impact my childhood or a attack or attach yourself to my family tree and influence in a negative way cycle Breakers chain Breakers tonight notice the Bible says in First Peter 1 13 and I hope you're patient tonight because I'm not worried about time I'm sorry I'm just going to get this off my heart tonight First Peter 1 13 says wherefore gird up the loins of your mind so you got to protect your mind you just think well that's just great matter my IQ is one it ain't even in the hundreds big deal but the Bible says gird up the loins of your mind but see be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ see the mind is the bedding ground to the soul otherwise it's the place where things come to life your mind brother Mark if you thought I had something against you guess what it'll come to life and you see me in the hallway you just turn because you brought it to life because it's in a betting ground of your mind you young girls oh my girls they have a worse time with this than anybody dear Jesus man they didn't like my post they didn't like my locket or it's what's that be real nobody clicked on my be real today nobody likes me we get so caught up we're in a world that's so caught up well what everybody else thinks I'm gonna tell you if you want to get caught on what other people think think about these people sitting next to you what do they think about you they're here to support you young people they're here to encourage you they're here to have Bible studies with you they're here to pray with you they're here to to shed tears with you we're here for you don't worry about what the world thinks about you what the politics think about you and and what this woke generation is trying to do to you and the transgender movement trying to come after your kids you think about what God has done for you where God has placed you in a solid Church in a solid family that loves the Lord that loves this message you are a blessed people tonight so quit looking at the negative in everybody and everything see the mind is a Betty ground and what you allow in your mind is what you're going to believe and what you're going to believe is what you're going to produce and it's going to influence your actions it's going to influence how you speak to people how you respond to people how you respond in church notice Luke 6 45 says a good man out of a good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart speaketh the mouth now I'm just going to tell a story on myself many of my close friends that are here tonight they know when I had that hospital job oh I was a little tear to be around brother Aaron told me he says we took bets in the parking lot at your house we like we don't know what kind of joke we getting tonight I guess we're going to see I'm glad you said that after I quit the hospital but see because some of us we're not able to hide our emotions we're not able to suppress our feelings and you let's just be honest some of you knew when you came to my house and I wasn't up for company I wanted to introvert and I had to suck it up you knew it it was all over my face but that's that's our Humanity we have to bear with one another we're not all created extroverts not everybody look my my fellowship meter pegs out it reaches a spot during the week I mean man when our I retired the hospital we Fellowship so much now think hey I got to take a break on Sunday evening but you young kids it's like y'all like to energize a bunny you just keep on going fellowship tonight tomorrow night the next night we're going to just keep on we're going to Sonic after church tonight my high word run out of gas please but we find sometimes out of the treasure or out of the abundance of our heart and sometimes we don't mean to be that way look I don't intentionally look I ha I do not like when I become that person okay let me just be honest with you so you don't think well brother Joe just loves being ugly like that when I come to his house keeps his air on 78 no we we started cutting it down thank you very much put it on 74. it's probably why I got a cold tonight we don't like going over his house he don't know what you're going to get with brother Joe he's like man I hope you just flipping a coin and you may get ugly Joe or good Joe you don't really know what you're gonna get but see from the abundance of a heart the things we dwell on when you dwell on stress you dwell on negativity that's all it's going to come forth when you think oh I can't make it I can't rise up I'm never gonna overcome I'm never going to achieve you will never overcome with that confession and the prophet of God said never let a negative testimony enter your mind you can help it but he says if they do what did he tell us about the former he said don't let them Roost there see that's the thing you got something to do and it takes a lot of effort to shoot down the negative to cast down imagination and all the lives of the enemy see Satan presses in your mind to destroy you notice what the Bible says in John 10 and verse 10 the thief cometh not but to kill or to steal to kill to destroy but I've come that that they may have life and that they might have it more abundantly so Satan tries to destroy your fellowship with believers Pit Brother against brother and we're all striving for the same goal brother Tim we're all striving for a body change if our hearts as Ministers of the Gospel if our hearts are not to help you shame on us we need to be at the altar but we give our lives we give our time and our efforts to study so God can use us and put words in our mouth in a spirit in our heart to be able to speak things to the body of Christ to edify and to Build You Up we're not here to destroy you that's the devil recognize who he is so he just tries to destroy Fellowship he tries to destroy your own self-esteem how you view yourself because maybe your past failures destroy your relationship with God destroy your confidence in God's word destroy your confidence in the fifo ministry destroy your confidence in a god called Pastor and A God Called Ministry see say That's what Satan tries to do I'm asking you to be honest tonight with yourself remember makes this statement here in Hebrews chapter 7. you people with these saw blade tempers I know there ain't a person in here with a saw blade Timber tonight you people here with these saw blade tempers that's always spouting Alf in the mouth that somebody can't put up things like that he said be careful he says you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right so all these dinner conversations because you got hurt you know I've been hurt a bunch of times and I'm sure you have too I've been hurt by the ministry not on purpose but you can ask one of my kids any of my kids we never speak about the hurt around the dinner table you never speak about those things you learn to overcome your hurt and you recognize that's the enemy that's not your brother he didn't intentionally do that that was not on purpose but see Satan's trying to get in your mind bring that thing down to you to cause Division and to destroy so notice what the prophet of God says here because to me this is a very powerful quote he goes if he goes you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right let me just say it like this whether it even it has a 98 truth to it if it's spoken in the wrong attitude you've done done the damage because what you have done you've influenced that child sitting around that table and so now they're going to have a hard time receiving from the ministry now they're going to question whether or I feel like going up but I don't know if I can I don't have confidence in them he says go around and tear it down he says you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well have shot him that's a powerful quote because there ain't one person in this building tonight that has not never said a negative word against another person shame on us I'm telling you I'm speaking to myself tonight because I want to be right with God I want to move on so we got to be careful but I asked you parents and grandparents you got to be extraordinarily careful around the dinner table yeah you're going to be hurt that's part of living but how you respond to that hurt is a part of Christ how you overcome in the face of adversity is a true character of a real golly man and godly daughter God but when you go running it down brother Joe looked at me he was in his little attitude he didn't want me around yeah you're probably right I feel like introvertent and you just brought the extrovert devil out of me and then you go run me down to everybody and then we have a youth service and your kids won't even show up because you don't kill brother Joe's character you destroyed my influence to help your children and when you do that against your pastor you do that against the ministry that ain't a man on this platform can help you or help your children because they don't have confidence you've killed it and you want to blame the ministry you want to blame the church you want to blame somebody else look when you point one finger you got three pointing back at you I'm asking us to do a self-assessment this church is going to get in one mind and one Accord and let the light change our dimensions that we've been hearing about church we got to have a reality check these things ain't gonna happen without effort but notice now so Satan will get you to see your failures and he will get you to see everybody else's failures he will Crown you with a critical spirit you won't move you won't raise your hand however as soon as you get out of that parking lot you just spatting It Off see your attitude says it all but it shows what you're dwelling on so we find now he'll never see the blessings of belonging to a local body I'm glad that my family and I get to be a part of your lives I'm so honored to be a part of this ministry team I'm honored to be a part of this church have we all we've been hurt absolutely but it's still an honor because when I sit and I rub shoulders with you and I have conversations with you and I've seen you struggling I've seen you overcome and I've seen you whether the attack of the enemy it gives me Faith because you failed to give up because you're not giving up but yet when Satan can Crown you with a crowded spirit and a critical spirit you will not see the good in those that you fellowship with those that you worship with all you will see is a Humanity and let me tell you our Humanity stinks it stinks it gets into a way a lot of times thankfully we have short-term memory loss and you know somebody offended you you don't see them and you don't get around them you may have purpose not to go to the house for three or four months you let that thing die down a little bit and you you try again that's who we are and I don't say those things in just to be joking but I'm saying it because the reality is Satan is against you and he's against your family he's against your church and he's against everything that we stand for notice now let me let me speed up I told you I'm just gonna if y'all don't mind I'm just going to take my time a little bit tonight so Satan would try to do something and I'm that that we're all familiar with and let's put a complex on you now this complex here is an emotionally significant ideas that are completely or partly repressed that cause psychic conflict leading to abnormal mental States boy that just sounds wonderful don't y'all want to sign up for a complex abnormal mental state tie me up but yet we can believe God for healing we can believe God for deliverance we can believe God for you know Deliverance over smoke and drinking line cussing or depression nervousness and fear but some of y'all most of us walk in the doors of this church over and over and over and we pack our complex in here won't you just pack that thing on up to the altar because all it is is a demonic Spirit trying to Crown your life with the reality that's false and it's a lie of the enemy so you find complexes we all have them don't act like you don't like I told you be honest with yourself so what causes complexes parental attitudes and upbringing things I just spoke about having that dinner table conversation around your kids cause a complex maybe negative remarks about somebody some brother some sister in a church negative comments about the ministry how they handle the situation or situations as a child remember you like mental maturity to be able to truly decipher and filter exactly the conversation and what it does it impairs your judgment of that individual for a lifetime for a lifetime it takes a lot of effort to look past that and get to know that person for who they are takes a lot of effort causes physical defects disproportional facial features weight height speech the effects vision things like that mental limitations and we find notice the manifestation of a complex withdrawal from social contact you turn introvert excessive seeking for attention criticism of others over overly dutiful obedience somebody's got to do everything for everything everything here they just constant fear and worry are manifestations of a complex in the most renowned one is the inferiority complex or the Napoleon complex you know he's got the short man syndrome overcompensating for something but see we all hear tonight if you're honest if you're honest you'd raise your hand say yes brother Joe whether you're a child whether you're a mother whether you're a father whether you're a grandparent whether you're single or not we all have face complexes all of us you're not alone you say well brother Joe you need to back that up with a quote I'm glad you asked me to I got it right here brother bam in the flashing red light the sound of his company he says I was making My Confession this is your Prophet I was making My Confession of having a complex now your Prophet wasn't too much of a man that he couldn't share his heart and expose his own self and his humanity and say I was making a confession of having a complex and I guess if I'd asked tonight in this audience of people how many here knows you have a complex he said practically every hand would go up he said there was a handsome young man sitting there this is in he cares that you care just in the peak of Life a leader of young men sitting there Satan bound him he never noticed but I took him took my hand left to shake his hands with his right hand to see if some disease had plagued him but there was no sign of vibration coming right out of the room from praying and fasting and waiting on the Lord the anointing of the Holy Spirit was there and that's why it led me let that's why it led us he goes then sing the shadow of Darkness over him notice a complex brings a shadow of Darkness that's ain't that's not life it's trying to destroy you and kill you he says I never said what I was doing but in less than a couple moments time it was all gone the coldness the coldness of his hands had left and he was shouting and praising God see how Satan was trying to upset that young man by referring him to some complex to be built back which the Holy Spirit knew and I seen it by a vision of the Lord see but God care for that man and God cared for that young boy and I want you to know God cares for you tonight that's why he changed my thought for tonight to come and speak to you and walk out notice what brother Brown says here he says you don't get a complex by the blood of Jesus you get love you get love not a complex I'm a little bigger than somebody else a little better than somebody else a little no better than somebody else he goes you got to get your arms around everybody it's on the basis of love now brother bear I'm in the message standing in the gap he says will you do this one favor for me both here and on tapes also you brethren pray that God will place in my heart that something that I lost out there in a complex wow what a man of God can come to reality with himself and recognize he lost feeling for the people because of a complex and if we're not careful we can lose feeling for one another because of a complex he says notice it's easy to build a complex because I had an interview the other day where brother way sitting here sitting here in the front in front of us a good man but he built himself around the complex another kind of complex did the same thing by the way you can easily do it he goes you just get to a little something in your mind and you keep thinking on it Well everybody's against me you're not good enough seems like I can't do anything right I don't feel accepted and even like Tabernacle I'm gonna find me another church nobody likes to have me around well you take that sour look off your face people want to have you around just seems that I'm always in the way I don't fit in with anybody any group if I'm gonna have any Fellowship I gotta invite them to my house nobody invites me over I never get invited I don't have a gift like sister Jessica or brother Timothy sure King priest like brother Tim all this Satan's there just working on you having you compare yourself with somebody else he loves to do that oh I'm Too Tall I'm too fat I'm too short my breath stinks well brush it I'm socially awkward see that's all the attack of the enemy comparing yourself to others you know God placed in every one of us his attributes his attributes your attribute may never stand behind this desk you may never stand over there and saying you may never play an instrument but what God placed in you is essential for the body some of you are wonderful hosts your wonderful host you invite people at your house all the time for y'all that don't get invited well you missed invitation because some people here open the doors to anybody and everybody but the Satan will tell you well I don't ever get invited I got to do all the inviting and some of us don't really know the legwork that goes into hosting a family or hosting the young people or hosting people period they do it because they love you because it's an attribute of God that he deposited in there but Satan will have you look at somebody else's gift and compare and then you sell yourself short because you can't sing like Sister Laura or you can't play the piano like brother Andrew you don't run like Sister Laura over here her sister Lana like a gazelle I mean oh I better not do that huh but I want you to know tonight we are all essential we are all essential there would be no Ministry at evening like Tabernacle if you wasn't in that chair with your peculiarities and with your attributes of God but that's placed here so that the ministry can develop those attributes to help you through hard times to help you through those complex moments when you're dead on yourself and you're dead on everybody else we're here to encourage you to lift you up to help you find a place that you can really have an experience with him see I can tell you my experience but my experience doesn't do you any good but you got to have your own experience you got to meet him for yourself in this church in these people have been very conducive and conductive to the spirit to call him and to pull him down in our midst and to allow him to penetrate beyond all that Humanity on all those mind battles and Pierce into the depths of your heart so that you can truly respond to the word of God so you can live the life that you want to live but Satan has imprisoned some of you tonight and I'm gonna bring this down here shortly Satan's in prison some of you with a false reality he's imprisoned you of reality of his own choosing his own making and even though you're a Christian even though you have the Holy Ghost yet you still battle things from your past from negative thoughts others may have put on you or maybe even hurt feelings has happened from people even here in this church tonight maybe you even battle your own self you know the genetics that you were born with some of us are hot tempered God can use it but you got to make sure we channel that in the right way but Satan is there and brother bam tells us kill him at the beginning it's not how long we can let the battle linger those negative thoughts come in your mind maybe you're not able enough when you're on strength you got a Ministry team here at this church call us up call your brother call your sister call those that you have confidence in and ask them to pray with you my wife can tell you there's been many a nights and I laid in bed and I said honey I need you to pray with me because I'm in a battle can I just share a personal testimony and maybe this may show my own weakness in my own Humanity several months ago a year ago I was called full-time in a Ministry I thought the doors are going to bust wide open and for the most part they did for a while I was out two or three times a month for the first seven eight months but things started slowing down and Satan began to work on me and work on my my drive because I'm a very driven person I got to be busy I spend four or five hours a day studying in the mornings and I go do something else in the evening and then I have nowhere to preach I'm like man the doors were not opening and I've allowed a complex to set over me and wanted to do it it it just clamped off shut me down for who I really wanted to be in that Easter camp brother Timothy called me to the back he text me come back here to the back and I'm just being personal because I told you I'm honest with myself and I went to the back and my brother Aaron were back there I was like man what's wrong with you what's going on with you you don't seem right and I'll say you know what I'm not right I was honest brother Derek I was honest every little thing infuriated me at camp I sat normally in the middle I got moved I was upset I got booted and then I got booted and nobody that was supposed to sit there sat there and I got Buddha for no reason but see that's how the devil works that's how the devil works now brother Daryl that's no hey YouTube is doing your job good job you booted me out I never sat back there again but that's how the devil works so because of that that was not it was not influenced by Brother Daryl it was not influenced by the ministry it was influenced by myself and my humanity and my makeup and because I came with that and didn't push that off every little thing that I saw rubbed me the wrong way and I allowed myself to be cheated out of a wonderful Youth Camp but in the back room brother Timothy called me back to he says what's going on with you and I just opened up my heart I didn't want to I'll be honest with you I didn't want to say nothing but I did because I knew I needed relief I needed to get out of that prison that I was in I was shut in there and it was only killing me it was only hurting me it was only hindering me and he said brother Joe what's wrong with you I said man I've been getting up at four o'clock in the morning I can't sleep I'm dwelling on this I said you guys are going all over the world preaching I ain't got an invitation and it's just by and he stopped he said brother the problem with you is you're so driven you're you have to be busy and Satan has anointed your drive and caused you to get to this point see the spirit of the Lord is still a discerner of the very thoughts and intents of the heart and he cut there just like that that's how quick it was brother Timothy and it point he pinpointed it right there and then him and brother Aaron prayed with me and that thing began to lift off now I could have held that I could have harpered that I could have just kept that to myself and brother Aaron's like did I do something I said no it's not about you or anybody well brother Timothy Lord used him to pinpoint what it was so I had to make a choice do you walk out or do you keep it do you walk out and be free and enjoy the freedom of the Lord that he brings because where the presence of the Lord is there is liberty or do you just hold that to yourself because you know what you don't want nobody to know what you're battling with her you don't want the Victory and you just want to pet this thing remember the maniac that came to brother Branham in Oregon when he fell over the prophet's feet they asked him is he delivered he said no is he dead he said no he said what then he said he worships that thing and as long as you worship that complex and you worship that Grudge and you worship that little feeling and you worship that depression and you worship that anxiety and you worship your failures you will never get free so I had to make a choice do you walk out or do you stay bound you know Harriet Tubman made a good comment she said I've freed a lot of slaves she goes I would have freed a thousand more if they would have only known they were slaves and I'm telling you tonight church if you be honest with yourself and know that you yourself had battle mind battles struggles in your mind struggles in your home struggles in your marriage struggle in your with your children if you would just be honest with yourself we can get free tonight we can get free tonight we can get into one mind one Accord and let that powerful light of the Holy Spirit Come and change our disposition see when I walked out of that back room at Easter camp there was a smile that came upon my face because it wasn't brother Timothy he's a smart man but he ain't that good God intervened God dropped down in that back room on a Sunday morning and spoke words of life words of life see the devil hit me at my weakness I was very vulnerable and so are you if you're honest with yourself if you're truly honest with yourself that's why the Bible tells us in Hebrews 12 seeing that we're in compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight you know we think about that great cloud of witnesses and we think about the cloud of witnesses up here I'm talking about the cloud of witnesses right here look at this cloud of witnesses I'm looking at devil defeaters I'm looking at men and women who have overcome pornography overcome depression overcome fear I'm looking at those that have overcome addictions to to drugs and to alcohol I'm looking at those that have overcome fear and and Ambitions and and their own selfish desires oh you're talking about being compassed about with a throng of Holy Ghost Field Devils stomping no compromising tongues speaking praise worship Supernatural believing Victory dancing Believers that's what we're crowned about that's what's stoned around us tonight don't worry about The Throne of heaven I'm talking about your brothers and sisters here that are supporting you in your journey lay all the things aside every heart feeling every negative thought lay it aside and run this race it's time that you run quit thinking about quitting quit thinking about giving up and push out to the battle push on to the mark of the hot calling keep pressing on keep running don't give up don't back down don't quit God is on your side we are for you tonight we're not against you we're not against one another but we gotta lay aside every weight every complex every doubt every guilt every failure you gotta lay it all aside and I'm going to tell you it's hard but Christ wants you to be free I want you to live free want you to walk free want you to worship free he wants you to be free now let me bring this down go back to our scripture 12. Acts 12. before we get there as you before we turn there God's provided way Los Angeles Bob said don't make any difference what your past has been some of us say praise God don't make a difference don't make a difference what my past has been when you've got an invitation to come you're ready to come if you've been bad I know some of you cherubs out there don't know what I'm talking about but if you've been bad if you've been a street walker if you've been a gambler if you've been a drunkard if you've been a murderer no matter what you've been if God gives you an invitation knocking at your heart he will take care of the rest of it he said don't be weary well you say I'm a lukewarm Church remember he will take care of that some of you old house out there then got a little bit cold and got a little bit of lukewarm he'll take care of that you don't got to remain that condition you don't have to remain in that critical spirit no he'll take care of that notice acts 12 and verse 4 we're going to bring this home when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and these prisons were designed to psychologically and physically torture the prisoner prisons often had poor circulation the lack hygienic facilities they had rats and Vermin most prisons were in Chains they had chains on their feet shackles around their hands sometimes around their neck their movements were restricted prisons would be designed to strip the prisoner of his dignity and Satan throws you into a prison of his own choosing to strip your dignity strip your dignity and if you think I'm talking to you you're absolutely right because I've been behind those bars abandoned behind that lie I believed it myself sometimes I thought some of y'all were against me I'm just being honest sometimes you wonder do you have a friend in the world so yeah this is coming home I'm speaking to you tonight under the anointing of the Holy Spirit putting the words in my mouth to tell you you don't have to be that see he throws you into a prison of his own chosen to strip you of all your godliness notice now and Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bounding with chains and the keepers before the door kept in prison notice now here he was Peter was bound with chains one hand he had a chain chained to his right hand chained to the left hand of a PR of a guard his left hand chained to the right hand of a guard he was held in bondage he was held in chained he had 16 men watching over him and what they did they put guards at the front door the second door and the in the the gate they had men and they could and it was a felony it was a crime for the guards to go to sleep they had to be on duty so I'm here to tell you tonight as brother Timothy alluded to on Sunday and I thought it was a great job he said it doesn't matter how many guards they got around you when God wants to step in and God's ready to break those prison bars and God's ready to rescue a son and daughter God it don't matter what you chained to it don't matter who's holding your captain tonight he's able to break you loose and free you and liberate you from those chains he's willing even tonight Church to forgo your past and say yes you're my son you always must my son Satan can't hold you when God's coming for you here he is is held bondage guards holding them back but the angel of the Lord came upon Him notice who came the angel of the Lord came upon him in a light shined in the prison and he smote Peter on the side and that word smoke means a gentle stroke to arouse him from his sleep and the Bible would tell us saying to rise up quickly and it's changed on a Wednesday night fell off his chains of humanity fell off his chains of past failures fell off his chains oh come on I said it's changed tonight they said you can't have your children Satan's got him he was a poor parent he should have done a better job or they'd be in the house of God those chains fell off those chains saying well what did I do to lose respect what did I do to you to cause his heart or cause his hardship those chains fell off and no matter what's holding you tonight I'm here to tell you the change that Satan has changed with they can't hold you because the angel of the Lord came in that room he came in that prison cell and he's come for you
