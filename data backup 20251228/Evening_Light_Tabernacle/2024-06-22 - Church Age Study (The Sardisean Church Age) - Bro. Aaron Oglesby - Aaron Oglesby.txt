right let's see before we start no never mind there it is I've got it right there awesome if you have your Bibles and you'd like to turn with me we're going to read from Revelation 3 and one Revelation 3 and one amen it's good to see y'all thankful to see y'all gathered here in the house of God on a on a Friday evening and I just pray that it'll be a good time in his presence amen Revelations 3 verse1 we'll read through verse 6 it says and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found th works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen you may take your seats we just pray that the Lord will add his Blessings Now to the reading of the word and and as we start here um we're looking into the beginning of of the sardan church age I just want to tell take a moment and and say some of the things that I say most times that we gather and is that you know these these services and what I do are really just to supposed to add to or help you with what I hope you're doing on your own with your own reading and and reading these you know this was probably about a 45 50 minutes worth of reading that we ask you to do so hopefully you did that I know several of you have have already come and told me that you're ahead of me and you've already finished the church age book and I'm so thankful for that but but we just really believe that there's so much in this church age book that that will help you understand why we believe what we believe and why we preach what we preach that it's not just man's ideas but it bases everything in the word of God and that's where we want to base everything that we believe amen so as we begin looking at this tonight you know we're looking and I've I've gone over this before but we're looking at a city which is Sardis but we're studying an age and what it is is the holy spirit identifies things in certain cities that he knows will become manifested in a in a later age and he identifies those things and those traits and and and he puts this this age with this certain city and the fifth age is identified with Sardis and Sardis was uh the age lasted between 1520 and 1750 and and you see it there on the map just in between thara and Philadelphia Sardis was the ancient capital of of of Lydia and um in the days of of the emperor Tiberius it was desolated by earthquakes and by plagues and and Roman and Greek historians actually record these earthquakes and and they recorded it and said it was the greatest earthquake in all human history it affected 15 different cities included some of the ones that we have studied and will study like Philadelphia and pergamon and Ephesus they were they were impacted greatly but the city of Sardis was the most effective and history would show that even though it was rebuilt and a lot of funds was given to help rebuild it it never would recover from this earthquake that that hit and and so destroyed the city and as we look here it was a very important uh City commercially for for a period of time it was it was a center of wool dying it was a center for carpet weaving it was the first place that gold coins were were ever Meed and and the ruins that you see there are actually ruins from the temple where they worshiped the goddess cybel now as we've talked about before in other ages going back even into Babylonian religion the concept of mother son worship is carried over from the time of Babylon and it's found found in the city of Sardis in the form of Cel the mother and her son theosis now the religion in Sardis I'm going to go over this just briefly you had Cel who's the mother and dioses who is the son she was the moon goddess and he was the Sun God she was the Queen of Heaven he was the Lord of Heaven she's the revealer of Mercy he the revealer of Truth she holds a key to the invisible world and he also holds this exact same key and and so once again the reason we show this and the reason we talk about this so much is so that you can clearly see where the Pagan ideas of Rome come from we can tie it back to to the ancient world and to paganism and we want you to see that the things they teach and the things they believe are not even tied to Christianity they're not based on Christianity they're not based in the Bible but they're literally just Pagan traditions and Pagan ideas that were that were blended with Christianity by by these polytheistic Romans amen and and so when you look at these two things here you can see how it was an easy progression for them to just take their Pagan worship of mother and son in the form of CBO and and diois and plug in the names Mary and Jesus you can see how that progression was so easy and they can they could carry on worshiping the way they always had they could tie in these little Christian aspects but keep believing and worshiping the Pagan ways the way that they always had done and just like you find in in ancient Babylon over time the focus begins to shift from the worship of mother and son to just the worship of the mother and more and more Focus gets shifted away from the authority of the son and more and more focus is put on worship of the mother and and what we see in the Sardis religion is it gets to a place where it's cybal alone and they don't even worship the son anymore but cyal alone who gets praise and who gets the glory and brother brandham says all one needs to do is go over her various titles and recall the lovely attributes accorded to Mary by the Roman Church to understand where the religion of this age comes from so I want to ask you a question as we go back into things that we've discussed and that we've talked about in the church I mean in the Bible the church is always identified as a can May finish that for me woman the church is always identified as a it's a woman and it's a woman who's supposed to be subject to her head it's a woman who's supposed to be subject to her to her head who is Christ the word amen and we've covered this and we've shown how this woman though the false Vine the Roman Catholic Church is a dominating female who does not want to be subject to the word and doesn't want his leadership she doesn't want his headship and what we find is it's directly reflected in them elevating a woman to the position of authority and a position of worship you can see their attitude ude about not wanting the woman to be subject by taking the woman and elevating her to a place of authority so because of this they teach what brother brandham calls mariolatry or the worship of Mary elevating the woman to a place with power elevating the woman to a place with authority and a place to be worshiped and even prayed to as if she's deity why why do they do this because it correlates directly with the desire of the Catholic Church her desires are reflected in her elevation of the woman Mary because she the church wants to worship she the church wants the power she wants the authority She Wants to Rule she wants the authority that belongs to him she even wants to control who can have salvation and who can be excommunicated and who can be put out and she says I'm going to be the one worshiped I'm not going to be subject to the head and give him the worship I'm going to be the one worship and it's reflected with what they do with the woman Mary but who is it that they're reflecting in all this I want the worship I want the worship we find what she's reflecting there in Isaiah 14 and13 for thou H has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north she's reflecting her true husband Satan brother brandham calls her the Bride of Satan and she's reflecting his desires by elevating herself and not coming subject to the word what I find so amazing about this is that the woman who does submit the true bride of Christ who does come underneath his headship and who does become subject to to the people that surrender all their will to him they actually receive all the things that the false Vine craves they think about it what do we hear Wednesday night who has his authority you have his authority who has his power you have his power but how do we get it we get it from him and through him and by him and for him we have it for the right reason and he gives us everything that the false fine wants why does she hate you so much why does Satan hate the position you have it's the very thing he's tried to assert down Through the Ages and try to steal by deceit and try to come in and take over and over again and Jesus says oh little bride here you can have my authority you have the rights you have the power of course he hates you the very thing that they want you have brother brandom says it right here don't fear Little Flock all that I am you are air to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and I will perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail how wonderful is that church it can never fail what are you facing tonight speak the word it can never fail what situation are you in speak the word it can never fail all power and all authority he gives unto you it's during this age that that we see the first real break away from the Catholic church and those who break away from from the church will will turn their worship away from from Mary and and from the church itself and towards faith in the Son of God and all the while the Catholics will increase their their deification of Mary and they'll continue their persecution of all that stand against her and that's one thing that we're not really going to have time to go into tonight is necessarily is the persecution but but just because we don't understand that the persecution is still going on just as heavy as in other other times that we've talked about there's great persecution but during this age God raises up a messenger and we know that brother brandham talked about it over and over again he uses the key he calls it the Keystone of the Bible and that is that God cannot change and that his ways are unchangeable and he uses that and he says if he chose this type of man for the first messenger he'll use that same type of man and same type of ministry as every messenger and he uses that to determine who The Messengers are and during this time God raises up a man to be the messenger of the age and that man is Martin Luther and Luther would live from 1483 to 1546 he was German very well educated he abandoned the study of Law and entered Monastery in 1505 and he's considered to be one of the most influential figures in the history of Christianity now Luther was raised in a in a town called Mansfield Germany where his father flourished in the in the copper refining business and who was also a politician he was a town counselor and involved in politics there and and and so Luther was educated in at a very young age he was educated in Latin at a very young age um he would leave and go to the university of efort which was the most prestigious University in all of Germany here he receives a master's degree so this a a very affluent person up and coming with lots of opportunity and and lots of career options in front of him and he enters law school and he seems on his way to a very prestigious career in law and it was during this time that several situations and several events rose up in his life that led him to begin searching his own heart and searching his own life concerning his spiritual condition you know I think that's good for all of us all the time I I realize that we believe that once you're sealed with the you know with the token life that that that that you've got the seal and and you're going to be there and I believe that but by the same time I believe that uh one true sign of having that is that you always want more that you're always hungering for more and that you want to please God and you want to grow in God God and so I feel like we should all take a moment tonight and consider our spiritual condition you know maybe it doesn't even mean lost or saved maybe it does but maybe it means you know where am I at today where am I yes I was saved and yes things are wonderful but how have things been in the last week how how are things going to be next week am I am I determined to press on am I determined to know more of God and this is where Luther finds himself you know searching his life for where he's at and what spiritual condition he's in and and so he leaves law school after only 6 weeks and he enters into Monastery and he enters into a life devoted to to an interweaving of daily work and and worship to God and Luther lived a life of of extreme discipline a a life completely dedicated to God a life of penance and if you don't know what Penance is penance is a voluntary self-punishment inflicted as an outward expression of repentance for having done wrong and so he lives like this constantly trying to make sure he's right constantly checking up constantly you know tearing himself down for every little flaw and every little failure and he devotes his whole self to doing works that might satisfy his conscience and yet he says this he says I tormented myself to death to make peace with God but I was in darkness and found it not listen he was trying to do everything exactly right and yet that burden of sin that burden of guilt still stayed upon him he he couldn't find Freedom from that he couldn't find the Peace of Salvation he was playing the part he was in the monastery you probably couldn't hardly put a finger on him listen young people you can dress the part you can play the part you can act the part you can never miss a service you can line up to all the standards or even go above and beyond and have stricter standards than anybody else around you and yet that's never going to do it until you recognize that it's an inner work and it's a work of Grace that God Saves Us by grace and it's an inner work just like Luther comes to understand salvation starts on the inside not what you can do outwardly and Luther comes to this and he realizes it's a work of Grace it's an experience that changes you from the inside sure we sure we teach proper dress sure we're going to preach you know that you should talk right and and act right and live in a way that brings glory to Jesus and and and Christians should live a certain way and present themselves a certain way but you can do all of those things and never be changed on the inside you can do all of those things but listen once you meet him once you come in contact with the pillar of fire once you have your backside of the desert experience then all of that stuff will begin to come out of your life as fruits of Salvation fruits that there's been a change you won't have to put it on you won't have to work it up but it'll be an inward work coming out of your life fruits of that inward work will begin to be obvious to those around you and Luther's just trying to find his way and by by doing these all these works and he becomes a priest and he becomes so respected for his knowledge of the word he becomes sought out to that people want him to preach in their church and they they want him to speak and and they want him to come and teach and he's so respected and rever and revered and yet he still didn't have the peace of Salvation listen if you don't have that peace of Salvation tonight you can have it maybe you've been sitting in a message Church your whole life and you've lined up and you've lined up and you've lined up listen there's so much more to it than just lining up lay that burden down and just get in Christ quit Towing it around as some kind of anchor some kind of judgy well I have to I have to I have to listen there's a peace and a freedom that comes with real salvation he says though I lived as a monk without reproach without reproach I felt that I was a sinner before God with an extremely Disturbed conscience and I was studying and reading some of Luther's biography and I came across this article and he wrote about at the very beginning he talks about the fact that he was teaching from The Book of Romans and Galatians and Hebrews those three now notice what we find in those three books look at these three verses Romans 1:17 for therein is the righteousness of God revealed and we're going to come back to that statement in just a minute but it says from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith Galatians 3:11 but no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith Hebrews 10:38 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul hath no pleasure in him and in this article he talks about how there in Romans 1 how it speaks about the righteousness God of God being revealed and Luther at this point is actually very angry with God because he's done all he can do and he realizes I don't measure up he's done everything and he's saying you're going to talk to me about your righteousness and and hold that over me and he says you know man's already been kicked out of the garden and lost eternal life and we're doing all we can and you just want to point to your righteousness and hold that over my our heads and he says I did not love this is quoting Luther he wrote this yes I hated the righteous God who punishes Sinners and secretly if not blasphemously certainly murmuring greatly I was angry with God and said as if indeed it is not enough that miserable Sinners eternally lost through the original sin are crushed by every kind of Calamity by the law of the decalogue without having God add pain to Pain by the gospel and also by the gospel threatening us with his righteousness and Wrath what was it all the rule following all the Penance all the self sacrifice and yet Luther realizes I still fall short he knew he wasn't righteous and his heart's crying out his start saying Lord what what else can we do what else can I do where else can I turn I know this isn't what you want from me I know you want more but but can I ever measure up can any man ever ever measure up but then this is his account of his conversion it comes from that same article he says but At Last by the mercy of God I think we can all say that tonight meditating day and night I gave heed to the context of the words namely in it the righteousness of God is revealed as it is written now this is how he words it but this is how we would say the just shall live by faith he says he who through faith is righteous shall live there I began to understand that the righteousness of God is that by which the righteous lives by a gift of God namely by Faith by the righteous lives by a gift of God namely by faith and this is the meaning the righteousness of God is revealed by the gospel namely the passive righteousness with which merciful god justifies Us by faith as it is written he through who through faith faith is righteous shall live here I felt that I was all together born again and had entered Paradise itself through open Gates there a totally other face of the entire scripture showed itself to me listen just reading that you can tell there's been a weight lifted off his shoulders suddenly there's a lightness recognizing I'm saved and it I don't have to work for it I don't have to do this I don't I don't have to beat myself to death I'm saved by faith in the son of God by the grace of almighty god listen if you're trying to work it up tonight if you're trying to be good enough you're never going to do it but if you'll just come to this Revelation right here that by faith and by Grace you are saved lay your burdens down and accept the gift of faith the gift of Salvation brother brandham says the Evangelical truth of the scripture flooded his mind and he was set free from sin and Born Into the kingdom of God and Luther goes and he begins to preach and he begins to defend the scriptures with a with a burning passion and with Incredible results he focuses on the word of God and and and he focused on that because it was that alone that had set him free and he begins to turn the focus of all those around him to the word not to the church and to this Pope and to this Creed he begins to turn people to the word it's the word look into the gospel faith is in the gospel salvation is in the gospel and he begins to turn them to the gospel but what he finds is soon the word comes in open conflict with the abuses of the church Creeds and doctrines he was still in the church matter of fact at the time he wasn't looking to leave the church he just starts preaching the word but what you find is the word's going to come in conflict with the denomination it's going to come in conflict with the false Vine and he comes and he writes what becomes very famous and and most people who who know much history or religious history know about what's called the 95 thesis and brother brandham says thus when Leo the 10th became Pope and John tetel came to sell indulgences for sin Luther had no choice but to rise up against this antis scriptural teaching first he thundered from the pull pit against it and then he wrote his famous 95 thesis which on October 31st 1517 he nailed to the door of the castle church this was a great Act of Courage you got to understand this is a time where you can still be put to death for heresy you're you're going to be put out of the church and and the Catholics taught if you were put out of the church you didn't have a way to heaven and he goes and he makes a public Proclamation this is where I stand this is what I believe I'm going to stand with the word regardless of what the church says regardless of what people say I'm going to stand with the word and he Nails this to the church door and what the thesis was is it it detailed Luther's opposition to what he saw as the Catholic Church's abuse and Corruption by the clergy or by the priest who were selling indulgences now for those of you who don't know what that is an indulgent was was a certificate that you paid money for That was supposed to reduce your punishment in purgatory for sins committed by the purchaser or by their loved ones so you could actually go and pay for a certificate and that certificate said when you die this is going to make it to where you don't have to be punished as much or punished at all so imagine how convenient this was for rich people they could just buy all the indulgences they wanted now where where is that in the word where is that in the scripture what is that other than a moneymaking scheme and it says it got to the point where they were selling future indulgences where you could buy it in case you send later there's a get out of jail free card and they come around selling it listen I'm going to tell you something we have a get out of jail free card it's the blood of Jesus Christ it's the new birth whatever you've done wherever you've fallen short I'm offering you a get out of free jail get out of jail free card tonight just accept his his offering tonight repent be baptized be filled with the Holy Ghost get the new birth you don't need a church to tell you the gospel tells you you can be free tonight and he rises up and he Nails this to the door and he begins to preach that that the repentance that is actually required was an inner spiritual repentance that came with real Godly sorrow and he says that selling these indulgences says LED Christians to avoid true repentance they weren't sorry they just had a oh well here I got one of these indulgences you have to remember at this time Luther's a professor at the at the University of Wittenberg he holds a priesthood he's a man with a position he's sought after he's revered and with this one action he turns all the hatred and all the vitri all of that false Vine right on his Direction it was a man with a backbone it was a man who whose eyes had come open it was a man just like Peter who maybe one day was a coward but he came out of the upper room and the man that had denied that tells everybody listen up this is the prescription and he begins to preach boldly you see a man listen you come in contact with Jesus Christ you won't be a coward no more you won't be afraid to testify anymore you won't be ashamed of the standards anymore you'll be proud to declare I know a living God there is Mercy there is Grace there is a new birth you'll be willing to Proclaim that there's a God that can save you from the destruction coming on the earth and he does this and he sells out to God and he sells out no matter the cost young people whatever it is holding you back you got to sell out no matter the cost no matter if every friend turns away from you no matter if if it cost you jobs if it cost you relationships if it cost cost your positions whatever it costs it gained you a lot more than it'll ever cost you you got to sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and Luther sails out completely and history tells us that immediately Rome perceived him as a threat that tells me he was doing something right there were calls for him to be excommunicated there was calls for him to be burned at the Stak and what you'll find if you study it is he goes on the Run he even hides and and and lives in castles and hides in different places for years because they're literally after him but one of my favorite quotes of his that I love so much Luther said Peace if possible but Truth at all cost peace if POS yes we want peace if it's possible but I'm not going to compromise on Truth for the sake of peace peace if possible but Truth at all costs I'm thankful that we live in a time and a day and a generation where God sent a prophet who wasn't worried about dollar signs he wasn't worried about denominations but his attitude reflected what Luther said Truth at all cost and because he was willing to do that church we have the revealed word of the hour we have a message that's going to get us out of here we're not wander around in blindness and in darkness but there was a prophet who came in this day who said Truth at all costs 10,000 may walk away from me when I preach this denominations are going to shut the doors but I'm going to preach truth I'm so grateful for that Prophet we had in this day and in this time Luther his Fame and his teachings begin to spread like wildfire and with it so does the Protestant Reformation so the Reformation says in a short time Germany was Ablaze and the Reformation was on what is the Reformation somehow another I got the end down there what is the Reformation it was a movement in which Christians protested the Catholic church that's where the word Protestant comes from Protestants they were protesters all right and so they protested the Catholic church and they began trying to reform the Church away from the things that they saw as wrong I want you to key in on that word there this is called the Reformation what were they trying to do reform they began to challenge the authority of the Pope and the Catholic church and it resulted in the beginning of what we call protestantism brother brandham says God's time was ripe for a definite move that would be the beginning of the restoration of the church now notice this wasn't everything brother brandham says it was the beginning and we're not going to go into it all tonight but we know how brother Brandon would would use the the the wheat or the corn coming up and how to go through the different stages of life and he says this was that first blade coming up through the ground this was that first shoot it was it was the beginning and brother Brown makes it very clear that in this movement that that there were failures in this movement there were great shortcomings not just in the movement but even in Luther himself but he says it was the move of God and it was the message of the hour for that day and he points at some of the places and some of the shortcomings but he comes back around and says but this was the move of God this was the message of the hour and there were great things done in this movement and there were shortcomings and we'll get into some of that here in a minute but some of the things that helped during this time there there was advancements and the printing press comes out and it helps fuel the reformation and it had a huge role in the spread of pamphlets and sermons and and essays and the Bible itself while hiding in the wartberg castle Luther translated the New Testament into German what was he had a passion because for years and years and years the word of God had been withheld from the common people it was all in Latin and only the priest had access to it so you had to believe what I told you it's no wonder had gotten so far away there was nobody there was no checks and balances there was nobody to check what the priest said there was nobody to check the authority of Rome but Luther had this desire to put it back in the hands of the common people because he recognized it's not you and the church it's a relationship with you and God so you need to know what the word says listen don't take for granted the blood that has been spilled so that you can have this in your hands read this digest this live by this people have given their life for the opportunity to open up one of these books don't ever take that for granted that you can go to a bookstore and buy it or look at it on your phone or pull it up on the computer there were years and years and decades and generations who never had the opportunity to read one word of it never one word of it and Luther was determined to put it back in the hands of the to the of the common people and he he published his German Bible and it quickly became a bestseller and it became the model for other vernacular translations including tindale's English Bible he began to teach the med mediation of Christ apart from man that you're saved because of what Christ did for you he began to teach salvation by grace apart from Works he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith but this was a reformation and not a restoration we talk about the restoration we talk about how the Bible says I will restore sayeth the Lord so we know that that's coming and brother brandham says this is the beginning of it but this move in and of itself is just a Reformation Luther was not a prophet but he was a reformer brother brandham says so he was not able because he's not a prophet he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like the Apostle Paul who was both Apostle and a prophet so he's he's led by God he's anointed by God but he's still not a prophet but he's one that God has opened his eyes to the truth that the just shall live by faith and and the erors of the church so he begins to try to reform the Church that is there and that's one of the errors that we're going to delve into because they didn't build new they didn't start from scratch and build on the foundation of the word instead of starting over on the foundation of the word they kept the form of the same old Catholic church and they tried to reform it but you can't reform something that's dead that church was dead and gone and they're trying to reform it and and and bring it up instead of building on a on a New Foundation yes they were closer to the truth of the word yes they had more of the word but but if that and if they would have looked to the word instead of the old Catholic teachings that still lingered in their mind they would have been in a better place it was a powerful time as anointed men rose up and began to reform what they saw as wrong but the prophet tells us it was an unfulfilled age he says because they could have and should have pressed further into restoration instead of settling for just Reformation so we begin to look at this the salutation Revelation 3 And1 it says and unto the angel of the church and Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead now we we learned earlier and all you got to do is be able to read it doesn't even take Revelation what the Seven Stars are because it tells us exactly what they are in Revelation one Revelation 1 says the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches that's Revelation 120 it's cut and dry we we know what the Seven Stars are but let's take a look here at the seven spirits of God these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God now now after all that we've learned and all that we've talked about down through this study and all that you've been taught from this pull pit about the godhead and different things I hope that you read that and that you know there's got to be more to it than just God is seven different Spirits because we've established that God is one God that he is one Holy Spirit then then how can there be seven spirits of God I want to linger on this just for a minute brother brandham does in that reading so we're going to to make sure we get this clearly it's mentioned four times in Revelation Revelation 1 and4 says there's seven spirits Before the Throne Revelation 3 and one he that hath the seven spirits that's the one we just read Revelation 4:5 says the seven spirits equal the seven lamps Revelation 5 and six the seven eyes equal seven spirits all right so let's start by by saying that we know that the word teaches that God is a spirit and that God is one that's established God is one but we do see there in Corinthians it teaches us that the Holy Spirit manifest itself in nine different ways one Spirit nine different manifestations okay and so brother Bram says thus we know that the seven spirits of God mean it is the one one and Same Spirit coming forth in a Sevenfold way I want us to start here by looking at the lamps it says there let's see which one was it Revelation 45 seven spirits equals seven lamps let's look at this the seven spirits of God Seven lamps Proverbs 20:27 says the spirit of man is the candle of the the Lord now we talked about earlier in one of our earlier studies that candlesticks and lampstands were the same thing all right so Proverbs 20 here is saying the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord Spirit of man is the candle of the Lord Spirit of the man is the lamp of the Lord and that's actually how brother brandham puts it in the church age book is as the lamp of the Lord John the Baptist in John 5:35 was called a burning light which should actually be translated this is Brother Bram quoting not me which should actually be translated as burning lamp he was a light talking about John the Baptist or a burning lamp to the people so what Revelation 4 tells us is is that Spirits equal lamps we got that Spirits equal lamps and we just found out that lamps equal what man Spirits equal lamps lamps equal man we're doing a little basic algebraic equation here so if we do it backwards men equals lamps equals seven spirits okay I'm gonna move on to the the seven spir uh to to the seven eyes the seven eyes it says are the seven spirits we read in Zechariah 4:10 for who hath despised the day of SM things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with those seven for they are the eyes of the Lord what is it here brother brandham says this it is very evident that the word they refers to men so once again men equal eyes equal Spirit we're breaking this down easy to make it easy for us and we already know what the Seven Stars are so let's go back I'm going to go back here seven spirits Before the Throne he that hath um the seven spirits equals seven lamps and what are those seven lamps they equal what men seven eyes equal seven spirits and those seven eyes equal what men and we already know what the Seven Stars are they're what men so if we take I I if we take what we found here in our search of the scriptures brother brandham says putting our scriptural discoveries together it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous Ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven men with whom God identifies himself with very closely they are his eyes and they are his lamps who these seven men are can easily be seen because the next phrase calls them the Seven Stars which are already known to us as the seven Messengers to The Seven Ages how beautiful that is so what we're seeing here is actually one Holy Spirit working in seven different men revealing himself as the same yesterday today and forever down through seven different ages but it's the same Holy Spirit doing it all the time that's why Paul comes and says if any man teaches anything different if any man why because it should all be coming from the same same exact Source he tells us in Galatians 1:8 but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be ACC cursed so there may be different Messengers but they will all be anointed by The Same Spirit the one true Living God that's anointing them and working through their Ministries they're all anointed by the same Holy Ghost given the same light of the Gospel with signs following that's what they're going to be each and every one of them because remember we already said this but what is the Keystone of the Bible the Revelation that God does not change so if the messenger is from God and and God cannot change then the messenger from one to the next is not going to change because it's the continuation of the same Ministry it's the continu ation of the ministry of the Holy Spirit that's what's so great about this these Messengers were not appointed by men they weren't called by Churches they weren't placed by popes but they're seen in the hand of God God called God appointed God equipped with the authority of God not in the hand of organization not bound by The Squeeze and the the influence of denomination but here they are with the authority of the word in the hand of God authorized by God sent by God for what purpose for you that you could see clearly that you could be restored back the Seven Stars in the hands of God free from organization free from the influence of man and free to move according to how the spirit would lead them and what we find is just as each true Messenger was free from bondage and each messenger was anointed by the same Holy Spirit down Through the Ages then so too will the True Vine be the true church is going to be anointed by the same holy spirit that fell in the book of Acts The Same Spirit anoints the messenger then the same spirit that was there is the Same Spirit on the true church today in the last Age The Same Spirit Through the Ages these are quotes from from our reading brother brandham says and anybody that is truly the body of Jesus Christ the true church WIll manifest the same works as did Jesus and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them any other church that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have to account to God he says and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be a Pentecostal church and there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healings God will be in the midst of her and God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has Hallelujah and she will be unorganized don't forget that listen as we read those things young people I want you to understand that that that we preach the Supernatural and we preach the gifts not to elevate them out to some unbalanced position but we preach them because the word preaches them the word declares them it's not just us because we want some emotions and we want our church to stand out no that the church is going to have those things and I don't want to be one that gives account for why we don't if anything I would rather be found guilty of trying my best to set up before the congregation all the promises of God and saying over and over and over again it's got to be there it's it's got to be there it's got to be there why are you focusing on that cuz it's got to be there that's what the word says it's going to be the same the signs will be there the manifestations will be there the gifts will be there I don't want to be lacking any of that I don't want to place it in some place here and I don't want to place it some place there I place it in its rightful place it's in the word what's your focus the word and the gifts and the manifestations are part of that word and it says you will be have to give account to God listen if it says that's what the true church is going to have then let's have it we don't have to work it up we don't all we got to do is let it operate it's his promise it's his promise we just accept his promise I don't want to stand and give account for the lack of it we're going to wrap this section up on the Same Spirit brother Brown says for in each age the church goes astray and it is not just the leoty but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheep then God brings himself on the scene as the chief Shepherd in the ministry of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the Abundant power of of that truth I love that it's not just truth but with that truth it's a restored word and with that comes a restored power a restored Authority he says the seven Spirit-filled Messengers are the Lords they may be repudiated they may be questioned indeed to human minds they may not even seem to qualify nevertheless they are The Messengers for their age amen moving on now to the denunciation once again my ends are not cooperating Revelation 3 and one I Know Thy works and he takes a portion of each of these scriptures this isn't all of one or all of two but these are two different portions here he says I Know Thy works that thou has a name that thou livest and art dead and then in verse two for I have not found thy works perfect before God now what we find is that in most ages the spirit has praised the true church he's he praise upon the true church and then turn and denounce the false church every time he he'll have all this praise and then he'll say nevertheless I have somewhat against thee but here the entire message to the fifth age is one of condemnation there isn't no you've done this good you've done this good he just goes straight and and entire message is one of condemnation and we're going to see that why that is as we go a little further first of all we know that ages overlap and we find that the that the some continuation of some of the same things from the fourth age that so displeased God continuing on in this age and in fact growing worse here's some of the things one the leadership of the holy spirit is superseded by human hierarchy two the pure word of God and its free benefit to all men was put aside for Creeds and dogmas and politics three Worship in spirit and gifts of the Spirit were cast aside four Mar olry was assuming a greater place in the Christian worship so during this time period in history we we've said just a little bit about this but there were great advancements in technology and along with that came great things like we said the printing press and and travel increased and ideas began to spread and and with that brother brandham says Scholars began to come from the East Who had who had the Greek manuscripts and of the word and its Purity and and and these things combined with the printing press began to allow the word of God to spread amongst the Believers and that's what began to push the the Reformation so strongly and books and and tracks were spreading with great fervency and and the Bible was being put into the hands of the common people and because of that many great men got inspired and got anointed and began to rise up during this time men like Calvin and and men like ziggly and yet as great as they were and as great a move as it was their minds were still tainted by the hierarchy of Catholicism they were so used to Bishops and Arch archbishops and people that were supposed to rule over them that they just didn't see the need to get away from it totally to 100% break free from all that and yes they had more word but they began to patter themselves after their mother their Catholic church and because of this they were still Shackled says for one thing brother brand says they did not oppose the church State marriage of the nine Council but actually fostered that union he says in spite of Luther's constant teaching against outside interference in local church matters he was not able to clear men's minds of the bishop Archbishop concept of church government thus the church took one step in the right direction but still remained Shackled he says if there ever was a time of denominational Zeal it was at this tragic time what's happening here that God's moving and the Reformation on but a Propet of God looks at it and says it's a tragic time something's going on because we're like yes it's a move of God yes that's the messenger of God and yet our Prophet says it was a tragic time it's because of the denominational Zeal and what it is is what happening here is it it's a breakaway time it's a freedom time it it seems like restoration time but as they begin to recognize the the errors of Rome and then the teachings of Rome and it seems like a return to truth and power of that first church age is is the next step it seems like they're right there but in the midst of all that they get snared in the snare of denomination and organization they get snared in that as each one begins to jockey for who's got the greater Ministry wh which church is the is the church that's right which group of reformers in right is right and who's the most influential who's going to be the one wh which church and they began fighting over members and and splitting hairs and not recognizing they had a common enemy young people listen to me we have a common enemy regardless of what Strife or hurt feelings or little thing Rises up or drama that comes up in a youth group you are not each other's enemies your mom and daddy is not your enemy the ministry of this church is not your enemy the young people of other churches and Ministers of other churches those are not your enemy whether we see things exactly the same or don't we have one common enemy and that Satan that is the Antichrist that's going around blinding eyes but we have a common enemy I say let's train our guns on the common enemy in order to attain Victory quit firing at one another quit fighting one another quit getting caught up in little nitpicky stuff that one day will not matter one day you're going to be walking on the streets of gold and I promise what that sister said won't matter that hurt that hurts so bad right now won't matter let those things go and let's get refocused on what matters it is during this time that commenius wrote and I'm going do three slides of this it's lengthy but I think it will help explain to us what God what Jesus here is saying in Revelation why he's so unhappy commenius wrote in in his essay one thing needful each Church reckons itself as the true one or at least as the purest truest part of it while among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred what a shame these people have just come out together and now their persecution is right back on each other out of the Bible they Forge their different Creeds these are their Fortress and bullworks behind they which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks in Divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God each one Chatters as he pleases or kills Time by learn disquisitions and disproving the views of others listen if your experience or your ministry or whatever is based on disproving other people and attacking others you don't have one it says of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Christ to become a partaker of the divine nature scarcely anything is said May that never be said of evening like Tabernacle that that the new birth is never spoke of that what it takes to be to be changed into the likeness of Christ is never spoke of but may that always always always be the focus here brother Brandon would tell us that after the Seven Seals that the token was the highlight of his ministry the token what's the token the new birth what's the message about brother and well it's about it's about the doctrine there's a lot of people that'll be able to explain to you every single Doctrine way better than anybody else can that are going to go to hell because they don't get the new birth never lose sight of the importance of that what' Jesus tell Nicodemus well you're good because you know all the Scrolls you know all the doctrines of the prophets why I know all the doctrines of the prophets so did Nicodemus and Jesus said you must be born again he goes on to say the faith has been split into a thousand little Parts listen we of all people know all about that how many different people can take a message and split it into how many different ways from a thousand different views and and then disfellowship because you see it a little different way let me reate our brothers and sisters are not our enemies they're our allies you say well I don't get along with them they see things different they talk different they preach this listen I'm just going to say this we didn't really like Russia but we were allies with them in order to defeat Germany we had a common enemy and it may have been an uneasy Alliance but it was an alliance and it got the job done quit nitpicking every little thing that everybody else does and let's recognize that we need one another to defeat the common enemy he says the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and you are made a heretic if there is one of them you do not accept what can help only the one thing needful listen what is your situation how tore up is your life I got a million things going wrong I tell you what let's look right here what can help only the one thing needful return to Christ looking to Christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal and have come to the Unity of the faith the one common goal brother Aaron what do I need what do I need there's only one thing for you needful tonight and that's Jesus Christ that's the one thing needful but what it is is just the the Corinthian attitude of well I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos I'm of sephus that was coming out in the people and it it caused the body to be fragmented and because of this the spirit of God finds it deplorable brother Brown says here they were living a name but were dead certainly they were dead they died the minute they organized we're talking about Luther's great movement we're talking about the Reformation we're talking about the first shoot of Life the beginning of the restoration oh how wonderful they died the minute they organized the great groups organized and tied themselves in matrimony to the state that did it they were finished here were those lutherans who had criticized the Roman Church they knew the unrighteousness of political and spiritual unions yet Luther as when Peter was overbalanced by the J judaizers went right ahead and made the state instead of God the defender of the faith this is the first denomination of repute that came out of the Harlot but when Luther died it was not long until it had a hierarchy like the one it had fault and this is why God is so unhappy by the second generation they're right back under the wing of the Catholic Church gone back and didn't even know it turned right back to where it came out of and didn't even know it how how did they do this and how did it happen so quick the second generation how did it happen so quick because instead of living the name of Jesus instead of making his name and his word great they took the name of their new churches they begin to say we're lutherans and we're of Calvin and we're of this one and and we're of that one a name that said we're alive we're the lutherans we're alive we're the calvinist but God was looking for Christians list that's the same thing he's looking for today well I'm in the message I think God you're in the message but he's looking to people sold out to Jesus Christ dedicated to Jesus Christ Christ not sold out to evening light Tabernacle or whatever church but your life is in Jesus it's dedicated to Jesus your will is surrendered to Jesus you're living every day for Jesus that's what he's looking for today not just part of a movement we would call the message well it's it's a movement different from others and and we have different dress codes and different doctrines and that's not it I hope we recognize that's not it it's about being surrendered to Jesus being born again and God rebukes this age because he made a way of Escape now we're going to start bringing this down pretty quick here and I want you to really key in why is he displeased because he made a way of Escape he opened the door to their freedom and instead of taking it they begin to sew seeds of denomination and they begin to organize right back into the system that they came out out of instead of patterning after the word patterning after the new re the Revelation that had come in that age they patterned after their mother just like Jezebel's daughter athelia had done there in Israel and that's why God doesn't praise the church at all even the ones who had experienced Freedom he doesn't praise them look great things were done it was a mighty move of God the the Yoke of Rome partially was broken and and men could now receive the word again and a door even was opened up for the great missionary age that was to come after this but they weren't taking his name just like Rome had done before they're taking the name of the woman they're taking the name of the church instead of the name of Jesus they were living a name that wasn't his he said you're living a name but you're dead comes with a warning in Revelation 3 and2 Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God brother Bram here says the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it a Reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been another Pentecostal age but it was not the best that could be said of it was strengthen that which remains that is ready to die sure the age had justification but it missed sanctification it missed the baptism of the Holy Ghost look what brother bandam says that is what God's original plan was that is what they had at Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified and they were filled with the Holy Ghost young people that's the very reason for justification that's the very reason reason for sanctification we thank God for those works if you are Justified tonight I thank God for that I I if you're Sanctified tonight I thank God for that but God never allowed justification for the sake of justification he never allows you know sanctification for the sake of sanctification those are steps to the to the end of what God really wants us to fill you with the spirit of God is to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what it's all for and that's what they stopped short of don't don't be like those in the Reformation don't be like those in the Reformation young people that God comes by your way and opens the prison door and gives you an opportunity at complete freedom and you walk out about this far and say thank God I'm free but you're still chained inside that wall free but Shackled it's like a SL a slave in in the old days if a slave ran away and and escaped from their slave master and ran off the Master's property and said oh I'm free thank God I'm free but they didn't go to a land of Freedom they was fit to be caught again they was fit to be trapped again I'm not telling you God didn't come by your way I'm not telling you you hadn't had a mighty move of God in your life I'm saying go all the way to the New Birth cuz if you stop just outside the jail cell they're going to get you throwed right back in it you're begin to build your foundation on your old ways instead of starting from scratch and building on the new experience and building on the foundation of the word and letting the Holy Ghost have preeminence in your life and you begin to realize I'm kind of doing the same things I did before I met Jesus I'm kind of doing the same things I did before I had that altar experience why because you got set free he came by your way and he loosed you but you didn't go all the way to the New Birth you stopped close enough for those things to get a hold of you you got rid of some of you said I'm free but there was a chain of Music still on your life there was a chain of entertainment still on your life there was less things that you didn't deal with and before long just like this age of reformation you're right back under the wing of the Taskmaster that had you prior to the move of God but brother Aaron I thought it was a move of God it was I thought I got something you did but I'm saying don't stop where you're at go all the way to the New Birth get to the land of Freedom get to the Holy Ghost get to a place where the slave owners can come and the hounds can track you but they can't never bring you back get into a place of safety tonight God was unhappy that he' opened the prison door and they'd only gone so far so he doesn't even give them any praise for that don't just clean up some don't reform your life clean up some and yet you're still chained well I do this and I do this and I'm way better than I was that's a Reformation you've been reformed I'm thankful that's great but we're not called to be reformed we're called to be restored he wants to restore you back to the image he had of you in the his mind before the foundation of the world was sin had no chain on your life he wants to overcome through your life he wants to lift you up as a trophy of his grace and his Mercy not one that's just barely right outside still chained to a few things my God's able to break every chain and when he opens the prison door you run and you go and you don't look back the hounds of Hell may be on your Trail don't stop don't listen don't entertain it just keep going till you get to safety did you break loose and then build fresh on the word or did you reform because just like the reformers if you stop short you're going to find yourself right back in the same situation they escaped that's what Sardis means to escape but they never made it to Freedom they just escaped and that's as far as they went brother Brown says that is the reason that there is a church it is the temple of God filled with God he's talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he says that's the reason the church even exist it is the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do the mighty Works which he did came back upon the church at Pentecost so that they did the works that he did this age did not have those works but fear not little flock God said I will restore and this reform was going to be the the start of it he was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depth of Satan in the dark ages to the depth of God that they had at Pentecost to the depth of God that they had at Pentecost I love what he says here I'm going to circle back to what I just said to you maybe you did just reform maybe you hadn't been restored but he says right here that this Reformation was going to be the beginning of the restoration I'm not telling you to go back and say well I didn't get nothing I'm saying quit SL back towards that prison cell drive a steak in the ground white where you're at tonight and say from this day forward I'm going forward to Restoration I'm going forward to the next step I'm going forward to where every fiber of this being is filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not going to stop short I'm not going to be happy just cuz I'm doing a little bit better and I've overcome this and I overcome that I'm going all the way to a complete restoration you want to Rapture you got to go all the way you want to overcome you got to go all the way you cannot stop short you can't stop short and don't hang your head in shame because you realize you have I'm saying tonight tonight to say I'm going to drive a state down and go forward go forward tonight in verse two it says I have not found thy works perfect before God that means they're unfulfilled when it says not perfect brother Brown says it means unfulfilled it was a start but it was not the complete restoration so they now had access to the written word but it wasn't the revealed word aren't you glad it's been revealed in this day listen here think of it they had access to it again they could read it again they could look at it again such a mighty start such a great thing but they didn't have a total revelation of what they were actually reading remember it was a Reformation they under their understanding wasn't complete they could read it but their understanding hadn't completely been restored so so they could read it and do their best but what God really wanted what he really wanted restored was not yet revealed but brother Bram says it was the start of something great it was the start of something great it was the growth coming up out of the ground it was it was the beginning of something that God was going to do in the future ages because God was going to send a messenger to the last day in the spirit of Elijah and all the mysteries of God was going to be finished listen you're living in an age where you don't have to guess you don't have to wonder you don't have to beat yourself up like Luther did it's all open it's all revealed access to the throne access to his Mercy access to his grace access to the Holy Ghost it's all there for you tonight you don't have to wonder and hope and guess and it's all open it's all right there and he's saying come and drink freely and whoever that's thirsty come and drink from the Water of Life tonight I love how brother brandham talks about when he says when Adam and Eve left the garden that the cherubs were put there to guard the way so nobody could go to the tree of life he says but now those same angels are driving people back to the tree of life and he's calling you tonight if you hadn't eaten from it go to the tree of life tonight if you hadn't drank from it go to the tree of life tonight don't just reform tonight but be restored tonight Hallelujah he says Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die it means to be alert and to establish what you do have permanently it's referencing what truth they do have what Freedom they do have in other words it's broken down like this he's saying you hadn't gone all the way back in the prison yet but you're in danger of it you haven't gone all the way back to where you started yet but you're in danger of it You Better Be watchful because even what you have is ready to die that little flame that you still got burning Satan's coming to Snuff it out he's coming to kill the one thing you got he's saying be mindful Be watchful protect what you do have don't go all the way back that right there is showing you that whatever you do have is worth fighting for brother and I don't really have much I know I didn't get it all what you've got it's worth fighting for he says strengthen that thing which remains yeah you've lost a lot you've given up a lot you hadn't held on to everything you had but whatever you've got left fight for it tonight fight for it and build on it and turn around and go the other direction tonight he says you haven't escaped totally but you're in danger of going all the way back and maybe you find yourself in this spot tonight maybe you escaped the devil and God moved for you and yet you found yourself slipping back towards what you came out of strengthen yourself strengthen yourself in the word tonight wake up tonight be aware tonight of the position you find yourself in and don't go all the way back don't let him lie to you and tell you it's not worth fighting for just drive a Stak down right now I may have stumbled I may have struggled but tonight I want to break loose into total freedom that's what you you can have tonight that's the opportunity given to you tonight because after the warning comes judgment remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee brother Bram says it's very evident from this verse that God had given them truth as a permanent deposit it was received and it is irrevocably theirs it now re remains to be seen what they will do with it whether they will regard it or not they had heard the truth in that age the just shall live by faith brother Brown said there never was an age with so many men with so much light to shed but he says apparently the word was being heard in an academic matter manner in other words it was just head knowledge it was just something to lift themselves up and I know more than this one and I see this a little different from this one and it became something that they debated over and and argued over and I ask you tonight what good is truth if we aren't Changed by it what what good is I know God sent a prophet what good is the message if you don't let it change your life what good is it if we just reform a little bit these men were aware of the move of God they were aware of the errors of all the others that they were aware of Luther's message but what were they doing with that awareness brother Bram says vigilance and preparation alone will suffice to be ready for for his coming he says the eight saved he's talking about Noah's day and we're closing right now the eight saved were all aware of the impending flood and being aware they were prepared and saved there were many that were aware of Noah's message but it was those that were prepared that were saved we're all aware everybody sitting here is aware of the message of Malachi 4 you're all aware of the message of the hour you're aware that you're in the last days you're aware that he's coming soon you're aware that you got to have the token what are you doing with that awareness are you using your awareness for preparedness are you making sure that you're ready because he says I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee you bow your heads with me this evening young people as I prepared this and studied this and looked over it I had no intention of it going this way but this afternoon as I just began to see it and I began to recognize how many of us I was guilty of at one time more than once have reformed I I just want you to know that a Reformation may be the start of something but a Reformation in and of itself will never hold you a Reformation in and of itself will never get you in a Rapture it'll never get you in a body change it'll never make you miss tribulation and that great day of judgment this message didn't come to reform us Jesus didn't die and send back his holy spirit to reform us he came to change us how many tonight would sayl I don't just want to be reformed I need a real change in my heart how many be willing to just lift the hand to God and say God I got to be changed I want to be restored I I want to go beyond Reformation I want to go beyond rules I want to go beyond I can and can't and I want to go to a place to where the Life of Christ lives out of me and the fruits of that life lives out of me and I'm completely totally changed changed oh [Music] God God that's our desire lord it's our desire tonight Lord that we be changed what good is it if we're not changed what good is is it if it's rules and regulations what good is it if it's just another Doctrine Lord I thank God for what you did in Luther's day but Lord may we not be guilty of doing with this message the same thing they did and only com in a little ways with it but let us go all the way Lord you called a people out for your name's sake you called a bride out you you called a people Lord a people that aren't going to take the name of a church but a people that just long to be called Miss Jesus Christ Lord we lay our will down we don't just want to reform tonight we want you to have complete [Music] control Lord you see the hands across this place Lord you know the hearts of these young people you know the battles they fight you know the struggle Lord I don't even pretend Lord to know how difficult it is things change so rapidly every 5 years every year every day every month is changing and the attacks are changing but what I do know is that the Holy Ghost works the Holy Spirit works the token works it is a power that will overcome everything the devil can ever come with Lord you said that this bride was predestined not to fall and I believe I'm preaching to a portion of that bride tonight Lord I pray that everyone that has struggled has beat themselves up and tried to attain it may they recognize tonight like Luther did by Faith Lord in a finished work by Grace Lord what you did may they accept that forgiveness may they walk into that justification may they not stop there but may they go into that sanctification and not stop there but go into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and may I say it not stop there but go from glory to glory to glory and continually be changed until one day these mortal bodies will put on immortality Lord that's my desire Lord I love these young people they come week after week Lord every service that these doors open there's such a huge support Wednesday and Sunday Time After Time Lord they're so wonderful Lord they supported these Services now for months Lord be their portion Lord reward their faithfulness Lord may they know you in a reality not daddy's God Mama's God God not because there was a prophet 50 60 years ago but met
