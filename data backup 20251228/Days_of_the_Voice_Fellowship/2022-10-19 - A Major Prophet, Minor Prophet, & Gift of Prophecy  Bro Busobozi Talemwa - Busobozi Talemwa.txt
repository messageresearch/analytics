peace joy and love Lord we commit this service into your hands I pray that you'll come down and speak to us today father may we be in Heavenly blessing may we walk out of here tonight saying you know our hearts God that our hearts were burning within us foreign [Music] [Music] foreign almost the smaller book I'm gonna see around after it's okay I must get this concerning signing the pattern of God that's what we want us yeah agree I must see is for the sake of our reading tonight we shall just read verse 7 and visit yeah surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets amen Amina Lord Jesus we permit this scripture that we have read the preaching over tonight we go into a little bible study tonight for each and every one of us here we may visit so I will just I want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ of marriage tonight and so I I have a lot to cover and I'll just go straight into the scripture I'm requesting the people decide if you can check this site for at least 30 minutes amen Amina and so tonight I'm going to speak on a Major Prophets and a gift of prophets did you hear that I don't know I don't know okay we will understand as we go along I know someone is so there are many interpretations to eat but uh I like Brother Martin said we want to look at a major prophet or a prophet of the age why are you kidding the drugs not explain it yet because that would be wrong in Spanish I'm just a prophet that is better I'm a gift to Professor would not be the prophetic or prophecy is a wonderful thing to the church a wonderful gift to the church in general and brother Ken spoken spoke about a voice and he he spoke about the the voice of the Prophet that we should hear the voice whenever God sends a prophet he expects us to hear his voice has been used and misused in our generation that we do not uh understand its meaning anymore [Music] they do not want to hear it because to them a prophet is somebody who deceives others and takes their money in the name of speaking in the name of the Lord [Music] especially in our generation and also here in Uganda Uganda we have a lot of people calling themselves prophets and others even call themselves Major Prophets and so then you do not understand but I want us to look at this in a scriptural point of view does God still use prophets that's prophecy still happened today what is prophecy anyway but I would like us to see that in the Book of Amos he begins by saying surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets so now in every generation and I would like you to follow me closely because you will be doing some quotes and scriptures on Wednesday we usually have a Bible study whatever you want to call it but I hope that we all have our spiritual antennas tuned tonight amen are you all right brother amen foreign [Music] they reached that time and they wanted that King like the people of the land the promised land what were they said and they said we want a king to rule us just like in other kingdoms initially the plan and the pattern of God was to lead his people by a prophet is a prophet whatever you want to call it a prophet is a compound word one argument [Music] just like sanctification is a compound word it means cleaned and set aside and so there's many words and especially in English the words that are compounds [Music] so you see that is and the inspiration but also a prophecy could mean or a prophet is somebody that foresee something and also in another message here the identification of Christ in all ages he says in the beginning he spoke to the prophets and the word of the Lord came to the prophets and the prophet being able to foretell Divine things and it happened just like that was his identification means one who forth tells or Tales forth is a Divine interpreter of the written word anybody knows anybody that knows that knows what a prophet means now the English word Prophet is just anybody preaching is which was referred to as a prophet he was the one that forced things he said if there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet I the Lord will make myself known unto him and what he says shall come to pass and what it says if it comes to pass then hear him actually in the Old Testament if somebody came up and said I am a prophet and I'm not and I'm speaking in the name of the Lord and he said something and it never came to pass they stunned him to death because the prophet had to be Asia the word of the Lord came to him a lot of what he said was touted or supposed to be doubted everything he said was that say it alone [Music] is born in the world he is ordained for ordained of God to do that because gifts and callings are without repentance how we are going to look and address this tonight we are going to cut it into three phases first of all look at our prophet then we look at a minor prophet and then we look at the gift of prophets then we see the differences and what works when and what we have in our generation and what we must have in our time how can I expect them tonight hey man this is a good subject for us as Believers of the message to look at foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] that Jesus there is no profit but the Bible I read tells me now that our God is the same and he never changes Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the god of the Jehovah of the Old Testament again is the Jesus of the new yes and he will do tomorrow if we use the prophet he will always use because whatever he thinks is perfect the first time he thought it was that's why the Bible the Bible does not have another Edition the Bible is there is the one true word of God people can write many versions of it according to their understanding of this Bible is one it's the word of God that does not change whatever it requires today so we see that God uses Major Prophets there is a Moses Jeremiah Elijah you can go on and on are you and these were all prophets in our generation but God did not use a Daniel and an Isaiah in the same generation he did not use a Samuel and a Moses at the same time in one generation you know what the other people are saying it's not popular opinion [Music] with one one purpose I noticed if you we can look at one by one anybody tried to run away from that calling oh we'll do your name and even after that they had to go until uh because they were born prophets Anointed with the spirit of prophet they were born to prophesy speak the word of God it is foreign [Applause] he couldn't help being a Moses God sent him down and gave him life on Earth and all the Pharaohs in the world couldn't have killed him anymore and whenever God sends this man when their work is no matter how they die he gave his message his voice was the voice of God when the man you know what happened they killed him foreign are you here guys people say oh so and so was not a prophet because of the way they died that is not how you vindicate a prophet you must know your Bible or you don't manage people to you hallelujah amen Jeremiah chapter one you know Jeremiah was one of the Major Prophets before I formed thee in the belly I knew this is hallelujah amen the prophets did not need the ordination of the council the process did not need you know the crowning of the society or the denominations foreign unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto him um [Applause] hmm remember that God told Moses he will not be only a prophet with them but you will be gone and so he was a prophet god cartoon and now here he was giving a Prophets The Lord God will raise up another Prophet gods of your medicine they come to us and when he came in John 14 11 he said believe that I am in the father else believe me for the very Works did you see how Vindicated how prophets have Vindicated [Applause] Hallelujah Amina I need to try to show them he was the god yeah but again he told them he was the son of mine he was mine too so what was he trying to say yeah but did they understand did they believe it but they did not understand it again they did not understand him in the Book of John chapter one but his own received him but to as many as received here hallelujah [Applause] at least if you can't believe what I'm saying let me show you you know Hallelujah man a prophet a true prophet of God comes to fulfill that which was written of him and that's the Vindication identify him I mean Hallelujah Matthew 11 2. now when John had her yeah when Jonah because I wanted to get it in the Bible have a very big Bible in in in your in your place it says Matthew 11 2 says now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him after thou he that should come oh do we look for another Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which ye do here and see yes [Music] find receive their site [Music] the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me what did the scripture say that when the Messiah comes if you know your Bible very well in the book of Isaiah chapter 61. we will not stand there but you can read it later he says you know and he talked about setting free the captions it talks about you know uh you know giving the sight to the Blind and now hear Jesus when when John was in the prison he sent the people to go and ask whether Jesus was that Prophet which he expected to come yeah I wanted to really think about this for a moment a man who declared that this is Jesus and he's telling his followers but just go and ask him directly [Music] it seems as though he has now become like a Pharisee because he had things that made him doubt it was if he was the one how come I'm in prison can you let me try here I believe if the Messiah was to come the Messiah would would open the prison to those who are in prison he would he would set them free [Music] how can I be in prison go and find out boys that I announced to the people so that if it's not the right one then I can apologize I've given a public apology [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] we must manifest Christ to renew God exactly we must bring forth his nature his life praise the name of the Lord and Jesus was standing there yes he went to the lamb prayed for themselves foreign called himself Elijah Williams show me any Scripture where William run up or in a court because all the messages of William Panama are recorded foreign foreign [Music] [Music] the only way to vindicate a major prophet is whether or not he fulfills what is written of him let me ask you a question how many of you were in the denominations hallelujah amen there is too late the word of God comes to him there are repercussions if you do not listen to him but before God does anything in a generation does it mean that because there is a major prophet in our generation God does not use others as prophets in the message proving is what it says to watch when they go to Kardashians sent out one of the of each tribes to go spy out the land see which way they was to enter foreign Honda during the time even if it did it's not recorded what is important is the message of the major prophet the message of the Minor Prophets to individuals certain things but the message of the major prophet is a message to the whole world the whole world the whole world has to hear that message the whole world has to believe and if they don't believe it there is repercussions whether the others don't even get to hear about it it doesn't matter maybe God can use me or God can use somebody else to give a message to Uganda Uganda such and such will happen they don't even need to be Believers of the message gifts and callings of God without repentance and so don't think that this idea of prophets is is supposed to be those in your circles or those that believe what you believe that's why many people did not believe William Brothers the Oneness we are saying the Oneness we are saying are you one of us really if you're one of us what are you doing we have accepted you as a prophet of God choice that both of you are wrong and I am right beside you to Italian you you want to make God like as if he's a bunch of great people you you want to say that is a there is a separate God who is the father God who is the son and a separate God who is the Holy ghosts you want to baptize calling the name of each of those three gods and you are mistaken to think that father son Holy Ghost are his names to you my Oneness Brothers you understand that God is [Music] that but you are wrong when it comes to baptism because you simply baptized in the name of Jesus he said Jesus is the man but we know that Jesus was more than a man he had the title God himself so he was the Lord Jesus yes and he was also created and so he says I I don't believe your baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ and that is the interpretation of father son Holy Ghost and all the Oneness we are scratching their heads and he's still associated with all of them because he was a prophet he was sent to all of them a prophet comes from no denomination and the prophet is sent to all you know [Music] that's why I let them come foreign [Applause] foreign from around him tied his hand and said thus saith the Lord yep the man that he the man and here he was his prophecy the man that this has bound will be bound in Chains when he gets to Jerusalem um seeing the visions of the people then to read of Paul storms he told them said don't lose from this place and go because it will be to your harm now we all know that when Paul reached in Jerusalem he was bound in Chains and here is a foreign so his message is not even implicative it's not rather it's not uh there's no repercussions to his message you know it was just like informing Paul yeah but Paul already had seen it in a vision so you understand so these Prophets uh Prophets who are anointed to give the prophets in Acts chapter 21 it says and as we turn it there many days there came down from Judea a certain Prophet named and when he was come unto us he took Paul's garden and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the Holy Ghost so shall the Jews of Jerusalem bind the man that owned this garden and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles to it's your Acts 20 21 10 21 10 which one is [Music] was a new testament Prophet look at the Spirit of Prophecy falling down there and telling Paul about it from Jerusalem and found Paul and tie this God around him and turn over and say thus saith the Lord the man that all this will be by chains when he gets to Jerusalem who stood up and told foretold what would take place he was a prophets not a man with a gift of prophets foreign just like we have pastors to me we also have the office and they can prophesy In The Name Of The Lord foreign do you believe it right mean we cannot have two major prophets in our generation remember this prophet of our time during the night was supposed to come yeah so before between this message and the Rapture there is no other message [Music] there is no other message and yes there are many other prophets who are real gifted men real prophets I was in Nigeria and I sat next to a brother Uganda and this brother uh kind of started to prophesy without finishing he was speaking of my still are in existence Hallelujah he is Hallelujah I mean and you are not supposed to follow his message like life and death uh why because you already have a message and that is America or some other place or even or even in in moment they will not be affected by my message [Applause] must be filtered through the major message of the major prophet yes hey man I mean so if a pastor comes and says I'm the prophet here and then he begins to preach things that are not in the message you see now this is a gift to professors it's among the nine spiritual gifts and this is what you find in many of the Pentecostals and they mistake it for Prophets so let me let us go through this then we shall conclude after that Solomon is here now there is a lot of difference between I give to prophecy and the prophet is the prophecy may be on one night on one tonight it's them nine spiritual gifts that works in the body area but a prophet is Born the prophet all done through their life someone just walk over to you [Music] foreign that means people are not yielding enough for them not believing them anymore [Music] yes now we have the word of wisdom word of knowledge this designing our Spirits diverse kinds of tongues and the production of tongues Faith healing of Miracles are you following me are you here foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] coffee that's wisdom now that's a revelation there's a word of knowledge understood what brother had and they thought they had word of knowledge foreign [Music] just think and then you give a profit if you have ever given a prophecy of the prophets you will notice oh that is also speaking in tongues and giving a prophecy this is the word of knowledge or wisdomania everybody is but one of them has a gift you understand I believe when when Solomon passed the Judgment many people must have laughed but the gift of Prophecy speaking in tongues this is inspirational it comes with inspiration you know when a preacher stands here is that being a gift to Professor it must be inspired it's not dry yeah comes with inspiration it's not from him according to your prayers and whenever it comes it also inspires you and not be a prophet um I'll give you examples here first was one of them Hallelujah I mean I wanted to hear the prophet of escape and one of them in John 11 49. and one of them named Caiaphas being the high priest that same year I said unto them you know nothing at all no consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the world nation perished foreign foreign foreign so the prophets can be given by the good and the bad that's why it has to be done that is right or wrong oh I love the Lord don't you love the Lord I'll give you another example here he wanted to kill David and hear this in first Samuel chapter 19 verse and told him that all Soul had done to him and he and so Samuel went and dwelt in Niles and it was told Saul saying behold David is at Nile in Rama and so said Messengers to David and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and uh excuse me and Samuel was standing as appointed over them the spirit of the Lord was upon the messengers of soul and they also prophesied foreign and I believe they even maybe had swords they were sent to go catch him alive or dead this boy was going to take over his kingdomeness order is given the boys like dogs I mean David was hidden question is you know Samuel was a prophet and I believe there were many other Minor Prophets we are all in one company foreign foreign thank you what were they prophets no the spirit of Prophecy that just come upon him let us continue this is amazing and when Saul was told about peace he sent other Messengers and they prophesied also likewise easy your majesty oh which team send me information I'll bring that boy here okay go ahead again this is the third time is usually the perfect time foreign hallelujah oh my God I mean whoever is today I must have said this is like a saga Williams [Applause] himself said let me go myself and the spirit of the Lord was upon him foreign foreign [Applause] was a stronger man Hallelujah [Music] hallelujah amen all the things [Laughter] hallelujah amen was it of God it works it was a man a prophet no um where there are some people who are going to judge this purpose of course why do I have one problems and the man was the enemy of David I tell you what's the whole night sorry and everybody was shocked his soul also has it become one of them that's how the Pentecostals are confused when they prophesy like that they think they're also prophets and they said they don't need William Brothers somewhere Samuel was still there somewhere else in Acts chapter 21 verse and when we had finished our course we came to uh solemis and saluted the Brethren and Abode with them one day and the next day we we that way of Paul's company departed and came unto Syria and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist which was one of the seven and aboard with him and the same man man had four daughters pageants which they professor Netflix [Music] and they did prophesy so even sisters it is of the Lord God will make it fall upon anything oh Brothers you should pray for your sister for your little daughters to be perfect let them prophesy let the boys prophesy Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord these things are ours we need to be afraid for our children and our grandchildren these gifts are not only for Pentacles actually the True Church of Jesus Christ of denomination Pentecost it can you say into foreign and these prophets have indicated in First Corinthians 14 29 where he says let them be judged with read that and let us read this as the last scripture in First Corinthians 14 29-33 let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge if anything be revealed to another that seated by let the first hold his peace and for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all and that all may be comforted and that the spirit of prophets are subject to the prophets for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all the churches of the Saints um foreign praise the Lord let us covered Prophets but we thank God for the prophet of Yahoo message without this we don't have a guiding campus foreign [Music] away [Music] who can stand against the Kings oh [Music] foreign Victory belongs to Jesus story belongs to me oh
