night and day oh for the comfort with me amen give him a clap of Praise church if you can hallelujah hallelujah amen we're reading out of Hebrews 3:1 up to two wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his [Music] [Music] house amen God bless you you may be seated so since this evening I'm speaking on priest of our confession amen now in the Old Testament there was a somebody known as a high priest now I know that different preachers will approach it different ways and each according to the gift that God has given to them but just this evening maybe a little continuation of Sunday uh just uh uh overcoming the spirit of discouragement and so I'm speaking on on the high priest of our confession amen now the Bible uh Paul writes to the Hebrews and he tells them consider the Apostle and a high priest of our profession did you know that Jesus Christ is the apostle the high priest of our profession you know there is no title you can give to anyone uh except if Jesus had has had it first you know he has had it all he's our pastor he's our Apostle he's our friend he's our father he's our husband he's everything you can think think of is our all in all how many love Jesus with all their hearts amen and so uh John would write in the Book of Revelation and he would say he's the first and he's the last and so here he then says that uh he he calls him the Apostle our apostle and our high priest of our profession as we shall see later on profession here means confession and so I was looking at the Old Testament and and the high priest had to be a man without any physical defects and he had to be a man with a holy with a holy conduct or holy in his conduct and and he was the overseer also of all the other priests so in in his physical St he had to look better than anybody else he had to look better his appearance had L calmly and now in his life he the way he conducted himself he had to be better than anybody else and also he had to be holy you can find that in Leviticus 21 and then we see that also he was the over like the overseer of all the other priests this high priest also is a man that wore the U the on his breastplate brother bam speaks of the and he says that this is the only thing that was able to tell whether someone whether people with gifts were telling the truth or not you know know whether the gift was telling the truth or not for instance if someone says I dreamt this or someone gives a prophecy that say the Lord ABCD so then they would bring you before the high priest and then they will tell you now can you please give your prophecy again and so then you would begin to give your prophecy when the high priest is standing there and with those stones now if your prophecy or your your gift was saying the truth all those stones would begin to light different [Music] colors in response to what you are saying so that would be a symbol that what the person was saying was from God and everybody would believe it and fear but if what you were saying was not true and you came before the high priest with you know you know a prophet would would tell us that some sometimes people dream because they've eaten too much and sometimes because you've heard things from some other place not all Dreams Come From The Lord but but some dreams Come From The Lord so you see those things need to be tested and in the Old Testament it was being it was tested by the Ure and and so when you came you know with your dream when it is just coming out of Glon or whatever it is and you are telling people that this is thus say the Lord and the stones would not respond to you it be quiet silent and they would get you they say you a false prophet and they would Stone you to death I believe we have another today praise the name of the Lord we have amen Jesus Christ the high priest now we know that bam says the old and the New Testament it is so everything that is said whether it is a gift someone having a gift and prophesying or dreaming a dream telling a dream or things like that so we we can now be able to test it also I just say thank God for the message of the hour that we can take everything and we give it a word test that's why in the message we don't fear anyone to preach to us we don't I remember when I was in the Anglican church we had you know lessons or sermons that is written and you know a reading that will be read and everything so everything is programmed and so you just the priest would just have to follow and it will be the same thing all over the diis in theost they beginning to do the same whereby the man on top will send sermons or sermon notes or something and then everybody will follow that because they have to ensure that the right Doctrine is preached and you know the devil is trying to attack the message to tell us that we also should not preach by inspiration that you know we should take only one book of the prophet and um and um you know read that or play it for play the sermon for the people and that that is the only way the message should be preached and they're saying that you should just press and play and preachers should not no longer preach inspiration because we they fearing wrong Doctrine no wrong Doctrine is not hindered that way we have something that tests wrong Doctrine and that is the word have been given in our so we don't any man who claims to have been sent by God let him come and preach let him come and give a message let him come and give an inspiration anybody that claims to have a gift we we don't fear gifts we love gifts we love Tes we love inspiration interpretation of Tong you know brother says Tong when interpreted is a prophecy amen so we we we love tongues we we we love prophecies we love spiritual dreams we are not scared of those things how many are scared of those things here we are not scared of those things we love the supernatural but we are given our Ure and which is going to test every one of those Inspirations don't just follow Shish or follow blindly we have something that tests whatever we hear and that is the word of God Amen thank God for that and so the high priest would wear the and so he also offered a sin offering for the sins of the whole congregation so he's a man that would do that so he also sprinkled Blood on the M seat in the holy of [Music] holies to make atonement for the people's sins so a high priest was a very important man in the Old Testament and you know in the holy of holies would enter there once a year and that place being so holy sh Glory the presence of God the high priest would not just enter there also he would have to first give an offering of blood for himself and for the people and then even entering there they will tie a chain on him that as he went there if something happened and maybe he died or because he was not accepted or because he was not perfect because of any any reason and then he died there no one would enter there to remove him because he would also die from there so then they had to just pull him because the presence of God was in the holy of Hol you know the sh Glory was in the holy of holies but I want to say tonight we have a high priest a high priest who is even greater than he that was in the Old Testament that office amen was just a shadow of the real office of a high priest the real high priest Jesus Christ the Bible says he our high priest he's our Apostle and high priest amen and in Hebrews chapter 9 vers 24 he says for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us one time someone asked me where is the Corporal body of Jesus now but here is what the Bible says that Christ our high priest for did not only enter into the holy places or into the holy of holies made with hands [Music] for then must he often have suffered since the for once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself the high priest went in there once every year once every year once every year to Aton for his sins and the sins of [Music] others but and you know that high priest had to be a good man a holy man a man without physical defects but Jesus Christ before he was sacrificed you remember what happened you know they said he is bless he was not found with any guilt the man was sinless he did not have any defect who was he he was the Lamb of God that was supposed to take away all the sins of and when he came and he died what did he do he went into the holy of holies but this time not with the blood of bulls and goats the blood of God himself the blood of Jesus was not the blood of Jesus the the book of Acts says amen the blood of God himself the blood of God that is not temporal it is permanent the blood of bus and gods did not wash away sins but it covered sins blood of Jesus does not cover sins it washes them to the exent but the BAM says that he takes them into the sea of forgetfulness once your sins are repented and they under the blood once you repent once you now we are coming to the confession once you confess your sin you repent of your sins and you confess them they have removed from you and placed under the blood anything that is under the blood cannot be remembered anymore does God ever forget God does not forget but he only forgets the sins that are you are placed under the blood he can never remember them call it the Sea of forgetful He blesses those sea under those sins under the sea of forgetfulness it can never be remembered they have gone away from you you as being a human being may remember in your mind what you did and even the devil might try to remind you but Jesus Christ does not remember amen I want you to imagine that the power of the blood tell somebody the power of the blood the blood is so powerful that it removes Sin from The Sinner the blood of of our high priest the blood of God himself and he says that for him he suffered once and for all once and for all and the message the testimony the SE says now how many teachers here know that he is a high priest right now that he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities well if he is the same yesterday today and forever and the high priest he would act the same way only his body is on the Throne of God and he says how many knows that the body of Jesus is on the throne of God but he uses our body to manifest himself through just like he promised to do he said the works that I do shall you also now we know and we can talk a lot about our high priest but in the service this evening i' rather I want to dwell on the confession our confession we know who our high priest is is Jesus Christ but now the Bible says he the high priest of our profession there is a power that we hold and uh I want to try to see if I can be able to emphasize on this this evening many times Believers are defeated not because God has failed we have already seen his part he's a high priest he is determined to accomplish it when he gave his word he he signed with his own blood to assure us that his word cannot fail his blood is all powerful his blood can wash our sins his blood can heal our diseases his blood can take us out of our conditions his blood is all powerful when we talk about his blood we are talking about his grace we're talking about his power we're talking about his love all that is powerless without our confession there is a power in confession in the Book of Proverbs chapter 18 verse 20 a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with increase of his lips shall he be filled let me read that again in case you missed a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth the fruit of your mouth what is the fruit of your mouth are the words you prophesy over yourself are the words you you speak is the fruit of your mouth what a man speaketh is just out of the abundance of his heart that's why as we shall see later on in the Book of Romans 10:10 it says for with a man for with a heart man believeth unto righteous you believe with your heart un righteousness how many believe here we all believe we believe with our heart but he he goes ahead to say and with the mouth with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so in other words you may believe in your heart but you can never be saved if you do not confess it on your mouth that is why from the Old Testament when the word of God was brought for for it to apply the people had to answer by saying amen meaning so be it what he said is true we agree Moses would bring it from the Lord and then he would ask the people do you believe it they would say Amen we all agree that's why even in church we say amen that's even when the the word of God is being preached to you don't just sit and relax don't just be quiet but many times say that a gift is a man taking himself out of the place and then God using him and now that is for a minister but even for the people when the word of God comes it takes you to take yourself out of the place and to accept that word to say Amen to that word now a minister allows God to use his mouth and then the late the people they must also allow God to to to to to accept that word in by saying amen when you say Amen you are receiving the word are you are you following me now so with a man with a heart a man believeth unto righteousness but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation and here we see that a man is Bell shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled death and life are in the power of the tongue tell your neighbor the power of the tongue so there is a power that is hidden in your [Music] T praise God praise God God gives you that power to speak and if a man can speak speak a man can be saved one of the last things to leave the man is the power of speech the thief on the cross was a sinner he was going to hell but this man had the power of speech he could not be baptized no opportunity for that anymore he could not do anything but one thing he had the power to do was to say something was to speak the only thing that saved the thief on the cross was the power of his tongue he only spoke and he said remember me when you get into your kingdom and the thing that killed the other was the power in his Tong he did not speak well he did not speak the right thing and when he spoke the wrong thing it brought the wrath of God remember brother dramatizes it that on the cross went to hell and you know when brother when when Jesus reached hell and and and he went to this place where this man was there were many others like him and when he he opened the door they were all shouting all shouting help us open for us help they were shouting different voices but the power of their tongue in Hell could not save them [Music] anymore time for Mery was over and brother bam says when Jesus opened he told them why didn't you believe Saints we are still on Earth let us believe let us use the power of our time let us speak the word let us agree with the word let us Speak Life instead of and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love is shall eat the fruit thereof hallelujah amen I believe it sister the power of the time by saying amen I believe it brother God was moved she said the right thing brother sister said the right words when you said the right words it will bring the power of the Holy Ghost to come and make it come to pass when you say the right words it will provoke the power of the Holy Ghost come and cause them to happen in your life praise God I'll read the same scripture in the Amplified will be satisfied the fruit of his mouth he will be satisfied with the consequence of his words which words do you speak in your life which words do you speak in your situation in your home at your job which words do you speak to your children your parents which words do you prophesy over your life did you know that whatever you prophesy over your life whatever you speak whether because of less Revelation or because of situation or because of problem that is what will happen the words you speak if you say I'm strong you'll be strong if you say I'm an overcomer you'll be an overcomer there are consequences to the words we speak you know the Believers are not expected to speak Idol words may God help each and every one of us that our mouth I think it's it's a scripture that David David was praying he says let the words of my mouth and let the meditations of my heart be acceptable unto you oh Lord the words of my mouth and here he says there there is consequences in in your words I'm talking about words anything you use your mouth to speak death and life are in the power of the tongue and those love it and indulge it will eat its fruit oh my those who love those words those who love words and indul it and use it will eat his fruit and bear the consequences of their words those who love the tongue and and and indulge it and use it do you know you can have a weapon and you choose not to use it but you you can also have a weapon and you choose to use it how do you pray you pray with your tongue how do you speak you speak with your T you know you can listen to someone speaking after they have spoken you'll be so heavy you'll be so Disturbed is that not true and others will speak and you'll be excited you'll be happy someone spoke of brother Bram and he said when you were with him he made you to feel like a great man but there are some people you speak to and you feel like it was even a mistake to speak to them some people that will speak death to you will speak defeat to you they will speak c words to you so it's not about only what you speak but also what you hear what you speak and what others speak to you that's why as Believers there are words we should not hear but when we hear them they they bring a wrong spe in our life that these movies with C Words If you be watching those movies as a young person you're going to be filled with that kind of life you know the devil will bring you down to that level whereby you are looking at life that way when you are speaking to a fornicator and is your best friend and to him fornication is not a problem it is all right so when you speak to them the more you speak to them the more you realize they are right and you are wrong because they speaking more and you're speaking less preach on influences know either your friend is influencing you or you're influencing them I don't know about you but I want to be the one to influence people I don't want to be influenced by demons I want to be the one to influence this world I want to live in this world that wherever I go the devil will know that I passed that when Jesus was coming approaching this man at the TOs of Gad this man the demons in him realized who Jesus was before he even arrived before he even said a word those demons were so fearful of the words Jesus was going to the devil knows the power of the word the devil knows the power of the especially coming out of a child of God and as Jesus was approaching you know those demons started trembling in please it's not our time don't kill us don't finish us and Jesus spoke Hallelujah and Jesus spoke and he cast out those demons let me tell you when if you have Jesus Christ in your life wherever you go demons will tremble because they will know you have arrived because they will know you are arriving Hallelujah don't be like those who are possessed by the devil whereby you fear the people who have God in them how do we do we know that you fear them your associations your friends your best friends we now have WhatsApp who do you WhatsApp we can also see that by what you stat us are you statusing which words are you writing which language are you using remember whatever words you speak it is prophesying it is powerful there is a consequence on every word you speak whether in secret or in public words are powerful words create and words destroy what are you going to as far as I'm concerned I want to be an influence in this world that my voice shall be hard my voice will influence the people of the people of the children of God to come closer to God come closer to God how in the words I speak even now as I'm speaking to you I'm influencing your life how by the power of the time how has God ordained the gospel to be preached not by sign language not by books not by anything but by Tong the power of a tongue because the gospel has to be preached by the Tongue by speaking because as you speak as words come they bring they create something within so there is death and life in the power of the tong I I hope we all shall get this after I'm done praise God there's a lot I could say but there's a one long quote I want to read and then I will finish with that it's just a long a long quote out of the message accept God gift I'll just go through that quote and just to encourage you and then I I'll finish [Music] with don't have a negative testimony tell your neighbor don't have a negative testimony you see this is why many times while I'm preaching I ask you to speak because there is power in in the tongue while you speak those words you are creating don't have a negative testimony every time when you confess when I still uh feel bad today well I still feel bad today I guess you go right straight back in the same rat that you was in the beginning there is not a man or a woman in here that is baptized with the Holy SP Spirit but what would start your confession I believe I've lost the Holy Spirit you say I believe it's gone from me then you will go right down I still feel bad then you'll go right back again how you are listen close you will never live above your confession I'm going to pass exam it is going to be very difficult you just prophesied how the time will go to the students you just prophesied I don't think I can make it life is very difficult you just you just determined money it's very difficult everybody is poor even it is very difficult for us that's all you will see around your life that's why brother sister stay away from negative [Music] people run away from them don't make them your friends anyone who is negative their stay away from them stay away from them you will live you will never live above your confession Jesus is the high priest of all confession Hebrews 31 now any scholar knows that that same word profession is confession now sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercession upon what our confession so Jesus has power he's a high priest just like the high priest in the Old Testament was the one you know atoning the sins of the people he was like the middle man between God and man but in the same in the same way today we have Jesus the Bible says he the only mediator between between man and God the man Christ Jesus who is is the high priest our high priest but the high priest only has one thing to you our confession he hears what we we spoke and then that is how he he executes he can't do any he cannot do nothing for you until first you confess him has done it everything he promised to do he cannot do it for you until you have confessed that he has done it for you when you accepted I'm not Sav tonight because I get happy and Shout that is not it I am not saved because the gift of God works through me I am saved because I have met the conditions that Jesus Christ required for me I am saved according to the Bible can weep you around the samp on your feelings but he he cannot when it is th say the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah now many times how many of you have ever felt like you are not saved the ones who are not raising up your hands are hypoc all of us have felt it at one point as if you are not saved how I even go to heaven are feeling but don't say it on your mouth the devil wants you to profess a negative feeling it's not about what you're feeling it is about what the word says and if it is that sayth the Lord you are saved it doesn't matter how you feel just confess it I am saved and many of us oh since we we accepted Jesus Christ we cannot as much as we feel sometimes as if we are not saved but we can't accept to confess we are not saved because we know according to the word we are sa the devil can't change that no demon can change that because of that we are saved Hallelujah because about confession but that one is okay but in many other areas of our Liv we become defeated because we accept to confess negatively on healing education needs this and that we always confess negativ he says theil can weep you on your feelings he will weep you the way you're feeling but he cannot when is that say the Lord he can't do that he can't we across that that will defeat him thank God we have a high priest Hallelujah and he has saved he has saved us he has given us his word the word for the Salvation of our souls we believe it we confess it and the devil can do nothing about now when you believed you were saved sitting in your seat out in the wherever you was you accepted it and begin to confess until people that you were safe well you kept saying I am safe I am safe the people say there is no difference in you but you believed there was someone will tell you you are saved and I'm not when I see you see myself we are the same there's no difference but you still believe I'm safe about what you feeling what you see and you kept with your confession and after a while it worked right all your neighbors and everybody knows you are saved now because you believed it and you confessed it and it happened what happened what changed you he is the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father making good what you are confessing tell somebody he is going to make good what you confess what we are saying is not Idol as children of God what we say is not Idol there is a high priest somewhere who is going to make it good every word we say will make it good every word we confess he will make it go he is our high PR [Music] Hallelujah now that's the same thing it is by healing you accept him as your healer renounce your feelings hey Hallelujah if you are sick and your feeling so down renounce your feelings rounce your feelings it is not by feelings it is by faith say you are healed believe you are healed act like you are heal associate with those who believe in healing hey hallelujah oh my I love this one now you accept you are healed believe you are healed say you are healed renounce your feeling even act like you are healed and here is the now the game changer associate with those who believe in healing now this is not about healing only without any and every situation hallelujah hallelujah there's this young man here brother you know he was telling me what the devil was telling him is getting married is it this weekend the other weekend the other weekend next week but one I told him brother matter what the devil say your wedding will happen you going to get your wife said the right things and brother in a few days you going to marry now theil has told you before that it will not happen but since you have kept on believing it your your family was telling you why do you have to go through all those things just get a woman and and just those ones were trying to take you away from the word but you said no I will stick with the word he decided to associate with those who believed in it and now it is going to happen and so is every one of our issues in our homes in our families you know me myself I had a a few friends who are not Believers of this message years ago I was still young and because I married young and they were seeing that they were seeing that they were not going to that they cannot get mared at that age they thought I had run crazy and that I'm just excited and one one of them told me I'm giving you two years so I told Rebecca that she one of my friends gave me two years and when I met two years I I I stopped associating with him I stopped but after two years I WR him again I said I'm still married he said I give you three [Music] years I don't know what he will say now but I permanently stopped associating myself even if you're married you can associate with people who will make you become unmarried some people many of you do wrong things because of your associations you believe the wrong things because of your associations people some people started looking for jobs instead of of believing the word doing what God tells them to do they calling people relatives and Friends tell me what what can I do my friend the system is very difficult you have to Bri you have to then you call another friend I called the other one but have you applied anywhere any connection my friend things are not difficult don't you know Uganda you have to give something now you will become clouded with that when you come here will tell you God is able to give you a job you will not even say Amen because in your mind there is unbelief because of your Association some of you are unbelievers by association you see young people the devil tells you you cannot leave a chest life it is difficult it is impossible some of them will even laugh they will sit in the seat of the scord you thought you can and then you look at yourself as a fool sincerely what was I thinking I cannot live holy let me tell you that those are associations that want you to profess negative things dis associate yourself from them for God is what to be accomplished in your life you have to have good associations associate yourself with those that believe in the promise of God for your life God told Abraham go to a land that I will show you and I'm going to give you a son look at the stars your generation shall be like Abraham was excited Abraham believed it but along the way he carried his cousin God has given him promises let us go and while he was associating himself with Lord God became quiet did you ever ask yourself why God was quiet maybe lot was always you know telling him about his own things Abraham do you know I I am dreaming of this city where there is this and that you know these kind of games that and this and that Abraham do you you know that we can find that City rumors that there's a city called Sodom and there is even another called you can have a good time Abraham do you know that we can have we can be you know really great men can achieve a lot now with you God has even given you a promise if he went there you don't know what can happen the time abrah maybe was bring because Abraham loved lot so much lot was a cousin and he loved him so much the devil will not tempt you with people you don't love sometimes you will come in friends that you love so dear and then you begin associating but whereas they are leading you away from the promises of but time came Abraham made up his mind he said from today I don't care what I feel I disregard it I'm only going to regard what God's word saying there my brother today choose if you go south I go if you go west I go choose where you going to go you go fast and me I will go where God has told and Lord said abrah you remember the one the place I was telling I feel the Accord to the rumors I had if I go this side I may arrive and inde he went that side and he arrived and he was so happy the things of the world don't make the children of God happy we have another Joy our joy is in the house of God our joy is in the word of God not in the things that of the world when Abraham stayed alone he looked as if he was lonely but because he had disassociated himself with un God came again and God spoke to him again and Abraham be went into a very poor land the voice of God led him into a poor land the voice of God Le him into a very lonely place but no matter where the voice of God leads you too brother sister there is going to be joy unspeakable and full of Glory no matter where the word of God leads you too it may be different from what others called joy and happiness but I tell you what he will make you rich he will make you happy he will make you strong that's what Abraham became abrah became a very rich man a strong man he became increased oh let me tell you you will increase if you follow the word of God you will be rich is this the word of God you will be rich if you follow the word of God you will be happy if you follow the word of God you will be fulf bu in your heart if you follow the word just follow the voice of God and you will have everything that the world cannot give this joy that I have the devil cannot give it to me this joy that I have the devil never gave it to me this joy that I have the devil never gave it to me the devil never gave to me and devil cannot take it away Hallelujah we should refuse the devil from taking away our joy our peace our love in our our love for the word of God our love for Fellowship our love for the brothers and sisters our love for singing We should not allow the devil to come in that area where we are we are standing on that say the Lord we are standing on the word of God standing on the Rock of Ages hallelujah hallelujah that is why we say Amen because we are confessing positive things and we are disassociating ourselves with anybody and anything that will take us away from the word of God and God will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of health will not fail if you are sick begin to say I am heal by his stri I am healed maybe God has been dealing with you for a few days about healing just believe it and confess it just an illustration I'm trying to get Faith moving so I can see what the holy spirit will do here for us in a few minutes don't never look at symptoms and he looks at a woman in a wheelchair and he says lady don't you look because you're sitting in a wheelchair oh this fellow young here that's not uh that's no more to God than to heal a tooth AE that's no more to God than to heal a tooth a Toth what is your problem what is your big problem to God it's just like healing a truth amen I believe it Hallelujah but now look he is the high priest confession now if there is any fellow that ought to had a bad a bad case of symptoms would have been Jonah when he was going down to n he was back sleep he was going to he was going to instead of n on the wrong ship going to the wrong way maybe you are also here or you are streaming this service and you have been in the wrong ship says Fellowship is two fellows in a ship maybe you've been having a wrong fellowship with some people and going to n back running from God in a stormy sea they TI his hands and and fit thrown him out of the ship he went down into the sea and a whale swallowed him and went Plum to the bottom of the seity to rest his swimmers as all fish does there he was tied hands and feet back a stormy sea many Phantoms deep in the sea the Belles of a well if there is anybody should have heart symptoms it was Jonah if he looked this way it was a Wells B every way around he looked was a well belly but I love this he refused to look at it brother sister you may be in your own weals B everywhere you looking there is no hope to get out of your situation I don't know who I'm talking to this evening you in a Wells B when when you look here no hope no hope no no hope what

finished I'm finished no hope I'm dead in we have that phrase mother finished Jonah did not use those words Jonah refused to accept tell your neighbor refuse to accept your situation refuse to believe it Jonah said they are leave lying vanities he said once more I will look to your Holy Temple praise the name of the Lord because when Solomon dedicated that Temple he said If thy people now listen to me now he said If thy people be in trouble anywhere and look to this holy place and pray then you will hear from heaven so he believed Jonah believed that God heard Solomon's Prayer and so he started saying I will not look at this world's Bell I will not I will not think my about my backl condition I'm looking towards your Holy Temple and making My Confession and God sent oxygen down there and he kept him alive for three days and nights hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you my brother my sister while you are in your situation very difficult for you in that condition let me tell you what happens before God takes you out he gives you life he gives you strength he enables you not to to scatter the fact that you are still strong is a sign that God is answering your prayer the fact that you are alive you will not die but you will live to declare the goodness of the Lord the fact that you are alive the word and the promises of God shall be accomplished in your life amen I believe that for me amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we have a reason to rejoice and and say amen I Believe In Lord amen you know the condition that Jonah was in very desolate let me tell you let me tell you what I'm preaching today is the strength of every believer that no matter what situation comes no matter what condition comes you remain steast confessing positively saying I know who I believe I am persuaded he is able to keep his promises Hallelujah Jonah was in that condition hallelujah hallelujah he said God said oxygen and delivered him right in N where he belong so right now to some of you

discouragement comes on you and begin talking to you and then you begin saying for sure I'm finished the spirit of discouragement begins [Music] smiling that's where I want you but when now when he heard me preaching about the high priest of our confession the devil became so sad but now when he sees you realizing your place the devil is completely finished in the church Ed by says if the Church of God will know who she is and what she stands for amen she will be an invisible Army an army which the devil cannot defeat an army which the devil will attack but the devil cannot defeat it once we understand this now we can go into the deep Mysteries of the world but before we go into the Mysteries let us get this basics of where we should put our Roots where we should put our anchor where we should be as Believers whereby we are unshakeable amen whereby we are holding on onto the Rock of Ages let me finish this qut now our son brother please well if Solomon prayed that prayer there is no one here that's in the condition halfway like Jonah was you ain't got no nothing like the symptoms he had well if he in that condition could look at the temple where it was built by hand of a man and Earthly being a man Solomon sitting and praying and could have faith in Solomon's Prayer how much more you and I tonight sitting here look to the throne of God where Jesus stands at the right hand with the blood there to make intercessions on your confession we have more than Solomon's Prayer we have Jesus himself the high priest on the right hand of the Throne of the maest amen ready ready to take our confession just and he says our Prophet says just refuse you have the symptoms Hallelujah if you all believe this in the next few moments we can have a Pentecostal service here in the next few moments whereby all of us can accept the word of God imagine Jonah Pentecost in the wom of what about us the Believers of this message we can have our own Pentecost symptoms is something like

when he tried to gather the firewood again was beaten by a snake until his captors until those who looked at him those who observed him they had imaginations they say for sure this man was a murderer this man was wicked this man has sinned against his God this man is backsliding this man is no longer Christian but wait a moment when they looked a little at him expecting him to collapse accept him to faint accept him to die he just shook the Beast into the water into the into the fire and lived like any other person and they changed their opinion they changed their minds and they said this man
