14. amen are you there if you're there Say Amen yes that is the oldest book in the world so we are going to hear some of the oldest Words which God spoke to humanity amen may the Lord bless the

one of these days God is going to open your eyes Rapture is not going to find you blind and you're going to read these scriptures once again foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word Brothers okay I mean Mina J Henry I'm I'm by the names [Music] I have a wife and many children I mean if you want to know the number you see me of course the truth is a prophet God sent in this place what spoke through that Prophet is [Music] the words God gave the prophet are the ones we are going to speak and I believe that God wants to talk to someone through those words 1958. here his voice he preached a sermon called here his voice amen amen hear his voice amen but never didn't take a take When I Was preparing this someone my wife told me foreign but at least to the preach and encouraging someone amen and then I told her the Lord will speak to us when the Lord wants us to hear today is foreign you get up brother Marvin Good speaks what speaks Brothers amen amen let's open the book of Samuel chapter 3 is and I pray as we are reading this scripture may God speak to you nowhere foreign guarantee [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] PC Eddie not again someone is foreign message says hear the voice of God [Music] ladies and gentlemen when gold called us from the world I remember there are certain words that you use we used to confess they told us say go today um [Music] I ask you to be the Lord of my life and my savior amen amen every time in those two words there is a word which says the Lord Of My Life [Music] foreign [Music] praise God they have enough money to make the right decisions foreign [Music] to pray at night they say that these preachers money answers everything is so the Lord become peace their savior but not the Lord of their life that's why in this Christian Journey we have encountered troubles strongholds that were announcements when we are not meant to pass through it we are in the message hear his voice um on paragraph 50. I want you to put it there so that we follow through I'm not going to speak but I want the voice of this the prophet to speak to us tonight amen man amen the voice of God the prophet says here hearing his voice in that day was a rare thing to um there was no open vision and it was a rare thing the real voice of God because the people had gotten away they had a church they had a church and they used to pray as us we come and pray amen amen ladies and gentlemen being saved and coming to church that is only not enough foreign because the church takes no one to Heaven amen amen let's go on they had a church in that day but they just didn't follow the Commandments of the Lord they had a minister by the name of Ellie brother the message is 58 10 05 m 58 10 0 5 and 5m hear his voice hear his voice they hired the minister by the name of Ellie um and he had got away from God I mean ladies and gentlemen it is easy for someone to be a minister when he left God it is possible for someone to be saved yet they they left God lives not his people the people of God are the ones who leave him come on Amen because God does not leave his place it's the people who leave their place service and people used to come in services but in those days the voice of God was limited Amina amen and it just became a place where the offering was the main thing is the church had become that sowing a seed offering had become the main important thing in the city amen I mean the Church of today and somewhere just careless about the way that he handled the Commandments of the Lord and cut it somewhere today we go to church and we find the people going on and having a great time together they sing they jump God has done great things my Miracle is here [Music] they go back home services foreign hearing the voice of God is not one of the major things but it is the major thing in the life of a Christian okay foreign men and women used to pray all night and their homes were set in order by the book of the Lord and the God was fast in their home see never foreign let me tell you Brethren God is interested in Every Beat Of Our Lives foreign [Music] you can't have the prayer meeting because Mr Godfrey is on tonight foreign we talk to God too much but we never give him time to talk back to us prayer is a two-way traffic you talk to God and he answers you back foreign that is if your prayer life is talk talk talk and there is no answer answer because some of us will think answers are God giving us what we prayed for 201 is very many times we pray and we put we we put together so many times we complain and they say God doesn't answer but God answers but we don't listen again [Music] foreign God answers every prayer but his way again foreign but he answers the prayers easy way the prophet says we don't wait long enough foreign because when the word comes and the spirit has come and the services over it is there is a time you need to to sit back a little and Ponder and think or lose foreign the prophet was saying hear the voice of God what you're praying for have you taken time after speak speak have you taken time to listen listen listen listen foreign now listen to the prophet the prophet is saying that we are always rushing and actually he's calling these things a bit to papier no sense [Music] tomorrow they may not be going to work but at least after this I've give it some few moments kneel down stay in your chair close your eyes think about the world think about the word but you finish the service three out in the compounds yes right that takes up time and we don't have time to hear the voice of the Lord and those who claim to be Christians brother told him those who claim to be what Christians just kneel down a little prayer like this kind of homemade Lord bless me and my family and take care of us good night foreign we should wait on the Lord one of the things which helped me grow in my Christian Life in my areas I was told that a Christian should have quiet time alone with the Lord when you wake up in the morning after prayer get some time and keep quiet and and just sway out there I want to hear what I've what do you have in store for me tonight [Music] God is so concerned even to the smallest things in our lives be on time we would wait on the Lord we are running lives so fast um the world has parted us apart into pieces that we don't have anymore God speaks katonda yogira foreign if we would pray pray until our souls come out into the presence of God um if we would pray until our souls comes into the presence of God and then after just relax and listen to his voice foreign how can you go to hell to inquire about your marriage how can I make my husband happy how can I grow my business business how can I be successful in life can you imagine but have you taken time to ask God how can I make my husband happy how can I find a wife have you done that have you asked God what is going on in my life have you asked God what am I supposed to do now and when you asked have you taken time to listen you see our pastor was talking to me the other day let us give the Lord a hand of praise for a pastor [Applause] foreign to silica foreign foreign [Music] but so we take our troubles but we must also take them to to our pastors Amina hey foreign the prophet says in the paragraph 62 but there are so many voices today and that takes the voice of the Lord away from us now this is the problem obviously America is [Music] there are very many voices shouting foreign foreign [Music] foreign foreign there are very many voices but every time he would speak the Bible says they would run away and hide the voice of Goliath made them fear and and they are even today Goliath is still speaking yes [Music] foreign foreign foreign so what voices are you listening to my brother my sister is foreign let me ask you said foreign [Music] foreign before you choose to take your children to a school before what are you saying Lord bless meaning they are strange voices the bible say that they don't listen to voices of strangers when I had just married my wife I told her never ever give your ears to any man for two minutes to do you know what happened in the Garden of Eden School Adam foreign [Music] there are two doors to our souls our ears and our eyes I mean [Music] do you take some time if you can move in number seven um I'm speaking to you as the Lord is speaking to my heart do we take some time to listen to what the Lord is saying [Music] by you okay the the scriptures in Revelation where the Bible says he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches [Music] but he just said about seven never wanted a woman every time in every situation every day every moment that was the day I had my young brother here brother who called brother Paulie he was giving a testimony of the challenges at school I just wanted to fall down and die I said in senior one these brothers getting these challenges the challenges of our day there's somewhere where brother Branham was saying you cannot stand to the challenges of the hour foreign foreign you can't find a job amen you can't find a wife you will find very many women but you will not find a wife how well how tell me where you need to hear there is a song which are saying I hear uh [Music] he's always calling even tonight even tonight his calling I believe that verse is somewhere in Isaiah come and we reason together that's what God wants a family don't just come to prayer meetings God is not a dingo man we are the bride let me tell you the Church of this age the bride we have the greatest honor of being called The Bride of Jesus [Music] Amina God is calling us God is calling take some time together there was a picture I posted one day they were showing a man he was chasing money and then he chased it and then he grabbed it and then after getting all of it he fell foreign that are depriving you time to spend time with your maker there is a man who made a statement he said no one is crying today who was not given what would not have made him cry today yesterday foreign foreign God is in the business of helping his children but we are so busy for him the land you are chasing that land there might be like 40 people who owned it and today they are dead and you're going to get it and you're going to die foreign can we stand on our feet [Music] I don't know but God has been speaking to my soul today why don't you close your eyes what are those things that are shouting so loud that is why Believers we don't watch TV because when you watch TV that was here there was here they have killed this one so they have or whatever yeah that's why we don't watch that when he was those voices will discourage you those are voices of Delilah those are voices of Goliath they will discourage you they will pull you down and and they will take away the spirit of God from you overdose in you marvelous day foreign Believers don't ask Google everything they asked God everything ended and God is always willing and waiting to answer his children back the prophet one day said is there no bomb in Gilead the bomb is there but how will you hear the directions to go where the bomb is too community the Lord is never too busy for his children for his beloved wife but the Beloved wife is too busy for the Beloved husband are you sure you are the bride [Music] and if you're sure you are the bride do you get time alone with your husband some of us we have started calling our husband me calling our husband all sorts of names calling our husband Jesus this and that but have you taken time to go at the feet of Boaz and just rest there and listen oh you are listening to the voices of disappointment the voices of discouragement the voices of pleasure the voices of the world the voices of tick tock the voices on those videos in your phone mukama um [Music] I wanted to play that song I hear a savior [Music] just

and I want you all to believe that the holy spirit is here and spoken to you concerning your life if you've asked him to speak to you say Lord speak to me he is faithful he never fails he knows what every one of us needs he knows your desires he knows your needs [Music] and if you continue to consecrate you are he has only spoken to you because he loves you it is unusual for it to be this way but you see he said my word will not return unto me void if God speaks then Vindication will always follow it's not planned but alwanga was not supposed to preach today Brother Martin was supposed to be the one to preach tonight but because he was not able to even come to the fellowship because he's sick somehow the Holy Spirit just spoke to me say ask brother luanga to speak I know he was not ready also to speak he said I'm not ready but I'll try and the Holy Spirit will have his way this was the Holy Spirit speaking to us Beyond Reasonable Doubt it's not about me it's not about badawanga it is God vindicating his word god confirming his presence with us establishing his presence confirming that he's with us and if we had it not our hearts friends he wants to do much more in our lives he wants to move our mountains he wants to confirm his presence he wants to okay but shall We Believe shall we open our hearts shall we accept his presence shall we believe when he speaks to us [Music] that's the challenge so the service tonight has been God speaking to us oh praise God not as speaking to him but him speak to us and what a fellowship what a fellowship with the Holy Spirit I don't know about you but I'm just swimming in his presence his presence is just so intense tonight from the very beginning of the service oh Hallelujah foreign what need do you have I will ask brother
