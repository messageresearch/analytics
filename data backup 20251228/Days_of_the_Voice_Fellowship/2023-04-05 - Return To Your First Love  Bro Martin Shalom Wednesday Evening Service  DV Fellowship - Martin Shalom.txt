[Music] and I saw when the lamb opened one of the sails that I had as it were the noise of thunder wow it's chapter two sorry chapter two out of the angel just write this thing says he that hold the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in The Madness of the seven golden Candlestick I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cannot bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars and has borne and has passed and his passions and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy fast love remember there for from when stars falling and repent and do the fast works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove the Candlestick out of the place except thou repent ance is remember there are four again says nevertheless I have somewhat against because thou has left thy fast amen Amina here God is speaking to the church the church of emphasis so the first church amen amen he is rebuking them is commanding them to go back to their first love [Applause] he said repent and go back the first line blessed me the name of the Lord amen remember the first love that was Christ himself because Love Is God if you look at the book of Acts amen how they loved serving God the Bible says they could they used to gather they gathered on daily basis praise be to God and God and somehow these people relaxed amen man and God came down and it's reminding them where they have relaxed from and it's telling them here go back to your first love blessed with the name of the Lord and the prophet tells us that the book of Acts it is taking us back to that church and that is the church which is going to be ruptured the church were exposed where sin could not hide in the church blessed be the name of the Lord was walking in the full power of God in the manifestation and demonstration of the Holy ghosts our first love is blessed be the name of the Lord nevertheless because that was left the first love remember and repent ing praise the Lord yeah we are all to remember to take it out the things we used to do for God and we are no longer doing them praise be to God come here when we used to pray many times a day and nowadays we are so busy you are think of this that that rules when we used to come early at church and we kneel before the altar time before God he says repent amen it's the rebuking kind of preaching blessed in the name of the Lord we must know where we have fallen from today where we have relaxed what were two more day praise be to God because where we have read in Matthew Jesus says we must endure Until the End Community meaning things want to be easy because if things are okay you can bear [Applause] you can easily endure good things praise you to God Amen but it means there are some other things that must happen when you look at the context of our patience most times what you are being patient is not easy amen man I've been so patient with be having a lot of money um but most time you hear people say I've been patient about this right now I can no longer make it but Jesus is the one that shall be saved praise the Lord man it's knowing what is right and we don't do it foreign what is right to do ag2 for children what you're supposed to do blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen but in Revelation he tells us to repent uh remember there are four ways Thou Art fallen and repent amen amen and do the fast works okay we know those first Works [Applause] desire to please God okay to live a righteous life amen that is the first work amen I remember when I just believed all of us we have that point if it was genuine encounter with the Lord where you could spend the whole night in prayer amen when you hardly sleep without praying you first three times and we are three days not three times [Applause] but what happened what went wrong Hallelujah amen Amina amen Amina repent and say Amen praise be to God Amen out of he's out of his place except thou repent blessed with the name of the Lord amen Amina in this message the prophet says uh this is the message enticing spirits send the Holy Ghost with such all-time convictions that it will clean a man's appetite and they will lead his soul and clean him up um praise the Lord you know when the love of God is in your heart the Bible says the joy of the Lord is yours when God is happy you are strong amen when God is happy with you that is your strength praise the Lord man is the Lord happy with me but here the prophet is saying that God sent the Holy Ghost the whole of this message it's all about the Holy Spirit you cannot talk about the Holy Ghost and you put Holiness aside praise the Lord because when the Holy Spirit is in us our test will change our lives will change amen we will desire to walk right and do things right he will put that conviction in our hearts because Jesus said when the Holy Ghost will come he will conflict the world of sin a little meriz each one of us that's what we need the Holy Ghost is the tutor um praise the Lord what happened to the appetite you used to have are you still eating what you used to eat when you had when you you were in good times with the Lord [Music] he said the holy send the Holy Ghost with such all-time convictions remember this gospel is taking us back to Zion you're a Faith of Our Fathers amen the friends of the prophets amen when man had conviction where they had conviction in their hearts until the Bible says not even people fear to join their Church praise the Lord so this word they reveal the word of the hour is restoring Us Praise me to God killing man's appetite and clean his soul and clean him up and make him heaven-bound creatures amen most of the things binding us they are not heaven they are not Heavenly gurus they are absolute things because the devil knows when he hip on us [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord amen but he say you must come under conviction in the message God sent us all the fashion Pentecostal Holy Ghost Revival cartoon that will bring sin praise the Lord when we are restored back we're to discipline you when God returned us back to that first love that's what love will bring conviction in our hearts it will increase our appetite for God praise be to God because that love is God himself and when the love of God is in us we are going to seek on things where Christ is on the right hand of God together before even we think about the rapture we must return before we talk about the Rapture I will restored but this is not only restored by the word word and word but we must be restored even in the power of God Amen that is the true restoration because say whatever it was eaten by kangaroo caterpillar in the Book of Joel he said he will restore it back but here in Matthew chapter 24 verses 12. he says because iniquity iniquity shall abound the love of man foreign the love of many has worked I think some have reached a point and I think I think the Lord has delayed to come on but remember the Bible tells us concerning his promises blessed with the name of the Lord amen the grain should mature with the light but the thing but the thing is today the church grain don't want to mature if you want to stay the way it was back but this is another hour this is another day friend this is [Applause] amen things are running very fast it is another Edge where God is doing uh he's doing a very is doing it so quick to finish his work but what place are you running blessed in the name of the Lord amen I mean this First Love Is the Love of the groom and the bride the groom is complaining amen the first love you had just like to love your heart for your wife when you are proposing to her say that um [Music] amen amen even God wants us back the first night we are the bride the Instagram and the groom is asking himself the same way praise be to God but the Bible says praise be to God and the rapture foreign to multiply like three times that the day like then the way we used to eat when he had just believed because even the Bible tells us the Bible is that in the song Amazing Grace there is near than when we first believed blessed with the name of the Lord Amina you must come under conviction you know when the love of God when the love of mother works when iniquity abounds man losses convictions Believers are no longer having convictions amen Amina and when you don't have conviction you are in the most miserable States [Music] praise be to God whereby we just do things anyhow because the love is unbelievable lies he sit and cook lies limbo [Music] trusting the world misrepresenting it will be where is your conviction where is our conviction foreign thank you many of them looks like Christian try to act like Christians body of God to have Christ on the inside of you which is the word mad manifest oh it will never mature into a real bible-believing Christians are you seeing where the problem is the grain should mashua with the light is ego but the thing is not God who doesn't want them to mature but the church if you want to stay like it was back but this is another hour praise be to God if you plant a seed today after two weeks whatever we could be okay then the city close is germinates then after two weeks once a week it's the same you come after three weeks after two months will you just praise it all these cities I think it's a unique kind of a suspicious seed s for instance Maize grows in six months all four months but if it is eight months you're waiting for Maze it has not even brought any tasso [Music] no sir foreign Hallelujah this is another hour it is coming to maturity praise be to God but if you have got to have Christ you have got to have Christ inside of you which is the word mad manifest or it will never mature what are the signs that you have Christ inside what are your likes big praise be to God for you say I have the Holy ghosts but you as cannot even you cannot push you into prayer you don't care I don't value you just speak like any other person in the world [Music] cracking jokes when you go to when you're using your phone maybe on Tick-Tock you look for only funny clips up and you laugh and you laugh and you laugh but when you come to church something is wrong return to your first love amen where the word of God Will Make You Away somebody hardly sit on his seat when you come to church running for the service you will come every day when you're free it will be delaying you blessed with the name of the Lord man amen the bright church WIll mature which was planted in Genesis now we are living in the maturing times every city spring of it is [Applause] because we are in a season of maturity foreign you are an orange you bring fruits of guava when you swear when they're seeing guava coming out of orange tree you know it is praise be to God Revelations because thou has left thy fast go back the first love and the prophet says in the regime of the ages that the true church had lost it is fast love the connection and that love was typed as the love of the bride and the [Applause] Grooms and other years of wedding life there was a cooling of the complete love and abandonment to God um amen you remember the first church foreign the church complaining against Moses complaining against God and God cut off the waters believe us don't complain ah that kid is we don't go before the Lord complaining together but for me I pray but even I don't have food for supper do you think God will say now I've given you supper the prophet says foreign but Christian we don't complain I have a Christian all things work together for good amen praise be to God even when things are not good they are okay anyhow amen even think when things have not add up the way you you wanted me things are okay because the battle is the Lord Is Ours if we believe in predestination whatever comes our way Destiny he knew that would happen you would go through that I will come out of it blessed be the name of the Lord amen don't stay home if God is in your heart return to the first in love return from where you've Fallen don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors [Music] and rest in he says here this is the message the Christ is the mystery of God foreign for them don't open out yonder again good way to go to fellowship with your body if you don't feel that way when I tell you it is time you you go to praying and she said if you don't feel that desire I believe you know what I'm talking about there is nothing that pushes you you feel you want to go an extra mileage comes from God to reach somewhere in line our Target should be yeah each one of us to be where the Lord wants us both spiritual and physical God wants us to be somewhere both spiritually and physically blessed be the name of the Lord they just had a plain little old building where they sat on slab of rocks and they spoke about uh after some godly man gave a message and they raised up their hands and praised God and they loved and they loved that okay it's okay [Music] they loved that after effect of the Holy Spirit bathing through them amen Amina you know when we believe the word when we received the word maybe in a service like this like you you've come when you are prepared you're prayed up you're waiting on God comes and speaks to you and after the Warriors and you raise your hands in worship amen amen there is that after effect of the Holy Ghost bathing through them what are
