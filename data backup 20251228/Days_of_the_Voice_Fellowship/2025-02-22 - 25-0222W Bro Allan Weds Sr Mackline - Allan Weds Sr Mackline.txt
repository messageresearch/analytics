bright Tabernacle evening light bright Tabernacle and the Lord led him to come and join here at dvf since been a part of this Fellowship but this young lady has been with me since she was how old were you about seven years so raised her and then with my wife and then we went to Ethiopia she went back to her parents so when we returned she returned continued from where we it's a honor to see someone grow and then they get to this level and all the young people that are here should so we are going into the word of God and as you know I usually don't preach for so long if you want to hear me preach more you can come on Sunday morning but for you Kon and you brother Alan I would like you to be very attentive I know you you may not get much but you will certainly listen to it after Ephesians 5: 2 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and he gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word okay you also read 26 which says that he might sanctify and cleans it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy without and without blemish [Music] so men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man can ever yet um hated his own flesh but now nourishes and cherishes it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church for may the Lord bless you I want to speak to you uh this morning on a subject I have titled Christ redeems his bride Christ redeems his bride nice to see you brother Dan is representing God bless you now um I'm speaking on Christ redeems his bride your neighbor Christ redeems his bride so now I'm dividing my thoughts today or my thought today into two parts and so I'm going to speak on what is to redeem and then I will speak also on who is the bride and then we shall go to The Vow is that amen now uh I want you to be comfortable we are a Bible believing church here we have no book but the Bible we have no but love we have no membership but fellow we have noed but Christ and the believer should be shouting amen right now and we believe the blood of Jesus wases us from all sin so let us relax amen and and and and so that we can make them also get I know they are nervous I'm trying to make them relax hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen like the singers we are singing the Lord has done it again the the message of Our Generation brother William Bram gave a very good definition to the question on what Redemption is in a book called church and I want to quote that for you while I start to try and explain to you what is to redeem now he says hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death he shed blood both back his own let me read that again God by his death the shed blood that blood bought back his own he was not looking for new one whoever he redeemed are just the ones that were lost he just B them back the devil had chained them but he bought them back that's what it means to redeem he brought back the spoken word seed [Applause] bride whoever believes the word is a spoken word seed bride you will get these things as we continue here he says my sheep hear my voice what is his voice his voice is his word and they follow me you always was a sheep God does not redeem dogs he doesn't redeem pigs and makes them sheep he only redeems the sheep that was lost that's why he says my sheep here my voice when he sends his word his word his seed word and so she's lost but you see this word when she hears this word then she gets bought back she gets redeemed back so you were always a sheep even when you were still in se you were always sheep you have never been dog snake you have always been a child of God you never wear a pig or a dog turned into a sheep have some believers who can help he says that is impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there is no change in species as we were in the thoughts of God and then we were expressed in flesh the things I'm quoting for you here are even higher than a university Professor professor's knowledge who does not know the revelation of the word so I want you to feed on it and enjoy as we were in the of God you know God he looked at Job crying as where were you where were you so in other words you were you were back in my thoughts he says as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh this is not just our beginning the marriage of your father and mother was not your beginning you started before the marriage of your father and you were in the thoughts of God you just expressed into the flesh there had to come a day when you when we would hear his voice there came a day when we heard his word and hearing that voice becomes then we become aware of our father us that is why we don't believe that our name has to be removed from a book called The Book of death have you had some preachers praying like that let me set you free today they pray and they say this oh God today remove this person's name from The Book of days and put it the B of God every up and down whoever gets saved he runs and has a big duster he cleans the name from The Book of and he writes it with a in The Book of Life their God is busy doing that our God once when did he write our names in The Book of Life before the foundation of the world before you did any bad or before you did any good your name was on the book so when you came here and you heard the word you only had your father's calling and then you recognized that you were a Son of God you were always a son of we heard his voice and we cried out as that prodal son me oh my father I am returning home we were just returning home we were alone Our Father redeemed us our father B us back that is what Redemption is our father bought us Christ redeems his bride today Alan is redeeming his bride she has always been your wife before you were even born God knew it pled before the foundation of the world even if you did anything you could not Escape you could not Escape him even if you wanted and let me tell you this also those that are redeemed cannot be lost ameny I'm enjoying why I preach they cannot be lost the reason why I'm happy because also me I know I cannot be lost amen amen even when you SE what happen that is something that he did he shed his blood on the that blood serves today yesterday and forever that blood is still powerful if he redeemed you once he will always redeem you you cannot be lost the Bible in the book of Ephesians 523 says for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body Christ is the savior of the body that's follow me as bring it down to these two people in Genesis 2:15 maybe today you may hear some new things but I want you to open your heart and be ready for what God has for you as you are celebrating their ceremony in Genesis 2:15 God put man in the garden to dress it and to keep it in vers 16 and 17 of Genesis he would go ahead to instruct the man not to eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil after God gave this instruction to the man and you know whenever I'm having weddings I write my notes because I don't want to over preach I want to stay within the time so I'll be reading but I want to follow meos after God gave this instruction to the man the scripture says the following Genesis 2:8 says and the Lord God said is not good now remember God had already created man and gave him the garden to keep and dress and he would go ahead to instruct him don't eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil after this instruction to to the man are you following me church then God in vers 18 he said it is not good that man should dwell or should be alone after he gave him the instruction of not eating from the tree so that instruction came from God to Adam after that then he said ah man it's not good for him to do to leave alone to be alone I will make Alan help meet when God gives you a wife gives you someone for you and let me let me put I always say this if a man chooses a woman and a woman accepts the way that man is is also the way that woman is if a man is a thief and a woman accepts him likely she's also if a man is an even if the woman may say I'm fine there is a problem somewhere so you can never at any time say you a bad woman if she's bad you are bad whatever she is you are whatever you are she is she's a part of you listen now I'm I'm not talking my mind I'm talking scripture he says I'll make him a help suitable makes for you the one who God consequently made a Woman by fashioning her out of the man's ribs this woman was the Bor of Bones and flesh of Flesh of this man but later in Genesis 3 and according to First Timothy 2:4 the woman was in the transgression the man would have made a choice to stay away from the woman's transgression but there was something called love love bound him to her well knowing he to Savi decided to give himself for her for her for for for for for the Adam the man to of the same sin he died because says he that sins the that s the that same Soul shall die so accepted to die so that he can save his wife this was an act of Redemption on his what have you done the word came to me God told me we should never eat now what have you done you have eaten of it now go and die in your sins I'm still righteous but Adam knew that he is the Redeemer of his a man in all situation might redeem the wife even if you see a man trying to make signs to her you must come in maybe if you see any situation enter you the savior of your wife the bible say that Christ is the Redeemer of the body the body of Christ is the church it is the bride and the wife your body is your wife my brother and you are the Redeemer of his body when the wife of Adam sinned Adam quickly he came first and he saved the wife but listen to this this is very good how did he save her he himself I don't know I don't have sound he himself he came and entered in the situation he part and shared in the [Music] Sin when he became one with that sin listen he knew that because even me I have a Savi Hallelujah when my savior comes to save me he will save me with all my belongings knew what he was doing amen I hope Alan you know what you're doing when a man chooses a woman all the woman's issues you must work upon them the scripture in Genesis 3:9 and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou God did not call the when he but he called a man the Bible in First Corinthians 13 but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is [Music] so if the head of if the if the head of the man is Christ it means who is the what who is the body of Christ the man if the head of the woman is the man it means who is the body of the woman the woman and the Bible says Christ is the savior of his so when God came down CHR he came down to save his body when Adam came down and he found even sin he came down to serve his to redeem his brother and now when God came down come and say if if where are you but he came looking for his body a part of himesh of Flesh of Adam Adam where are you and then when Adam answered Eve was also taken care of Adam saved his body and Christ saved his body this is Redemption is Adam was always a part of God he was predestinated unto adop by [Music] redeeming he redeemed all his Fallen estate with it let me tell youen before I continue here I am Adam's rest I am Adam's estate I believe I am redeemed let me tell you if you a child of God and you are redeemed God must redeem every part of you must redeem your finances must redeem your your family he must redeem your marriage he must redeem your children I believe everything in your life he is in control tell your neighbor God is in control he's in control my brother Alan it is God who redeemed you when God Saves you the Devil comes to do what he comes to kill he comes to destroy he comes to wipe away everything about you see God has something called Mercy something called Grace something called that is so powerful that is what God uses when the devil wants to snatch somebody God comes down and he says through his Mercy can sayy say no when you are saved brother when God gives you a saved woman to begin a family that will have children that will serve the Lord Brother when God redeemed you he had mine in mind here very well the words I'm speaking on every wedding I am LED I want to make you happy or to just do for the ceremony now listen very carefully even after the wedding go back and relisten I'm not here to make comedy I've been LED Romans 8:29 says for whom he did for he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many moreover oh my moreover whom he did predestin them he also called and them who he called he also justifi and whom he justified also [Applause] glorified I am glorified because I'm Justified amen because I'm Justified am called by the Lord and my precious brother because you were called it means you were predestinated before you were even born by the way when you get this Revelation understanding nothing in this world worries you predestination is like knowing your destination at your beginning before you end before you even started God knew God end you start end sister there were voices Oh The Wedding shall not hold God knew it would hold why because he had it in his mind let me tell you when God wants to do something he confounds the wisdom of the wise he goes beyond what anyone thought because God can do what man cannot do sometimes he want sometimes his children to look like they cannot be able to do something end God will do it and then God will boast and say I have done so that they will not say man did it but they will say our god did it it is God who is all in all amen he was with you before you were born he was with you after you were born with you right now and he will be with you in the fut he has your future in his hands Roman Catholics they had something which they say that if you you buy it it was called an Indulgence said if P am money your sins of the past will be forgiven your sins of the present will be forgiven and your sin of the future will be forgiven that's a lie but I tell you what the Bible tells us when you accept Christ as your savior brother when you accepted Christ your past sins your and your future SE are taken care can I ask a question what does justification means oh my I left my notes let me say this justification means you have never done it in the first place it means you have been set free you are free you are free to go you didn't do anything it is different that's why Redemption is different from forgiveness forgiveness is when you do something and you being forgiven but Redemption you were never even a sinner to begin with you were a Son of God to beginning and when he shed his blood he paid a price to buy you back so because you were a son before the SE when he pays the price for the sin he does not redeem you as a sinner he redeems you as someone who has never seen begin he says you are Justified you have never seen in the that's what the blood of Jesus chist the true salvation that's why we are so crazy about that's what Jesus did for us hallelujah amen that's why when a man is choosing a woman for a wife it is like as if he's redeeming before he takes her she will confess her life and then man will say I don't care I don't see one blinded them it is called l o v l Love is Blind what did you do I don't see it I know I love you so much I can't live without you you are my flesh you are my B so you see she's a part of you she's your bones she's your flesh oh without her you are nothing and without him you are nothing you a part of each other and today Alan is redeeming his bride some of you sisters you are also about to be redeemed in Jesus Hallelujah I wish I would talking about Redemption it is such a wonderful subject but I want to speak on who is the bride Revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come let him that he say come let him that is a come and whoever will come let him take the Water of Life freely there is a Water of Life there is a fountain floru all that want this come and say oh there is a fountain flowing in me come I'll give it to you for free I'll give you my love I will cherish you all I know I love you come you are my bride and you see the bride says nothing says come oh you know if you read The Song of Solomon come my I love you so I'm fasting for you you know the heart of the Bride not anywhere else the heart of the Bride is with her bride GR the heart of the Bride is not with the mother the father it is with the brid and the bridegroom the church Jesus Christ but the [Music] bridegroom is he was having thoughts maybe I do my wedding in August so the girl said I called on phone said is that your plan um because he told me I've spoken to her it seems she has agreed are you sure yes I'm sure so I called her she said yes and she kept quiet I between the [Music] lines I so have you [Music] aged but I said you told me you mis [Music] why the moment you melt her heart the only is come come come my and Jesus melted our heart the only thing we are saying Jesus we up amen hallelujah hallelujah Revelation 197 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is coming and his wife has made herself ready andto her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen Hallelujah [Music] no Believers Christians s people put on like that on their weddings not here the H out the out the back is out and you go those are wonderly things they don't have a part in the church let the Christian say Amen the bride of Christ the B that she has prepared herself and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine L is the righteousness the bride of Christ has a fin the word the bride is the Glorious Church Without spot A Wrinkle In The Blood of the word there are two churches both in the framework of Christianity there are two Vines there are two seeds one is true and another is false this has been throughout all generations you have a k you have you have you know and in Matthew 244 the Bible says these two spirits in the end time would walk so close to each other the if it were possible the El would be de but I've just told you Brethren that the elect cannot be deceived why he was redeemed how many know that song [Music] redeem I'm redeemed forever I can never be lost so it is impossible to deceive the but this false system who is not truly the bride but she's in the framework of Christi has a form ofies the power of the word she denies it you will quote scriptures to us she will refuse because a heart is not after the word of the our heart is after pleasing our but the mark of the Bride is she will be submissive to the bridegroom she will not be led by organized religion and denomination she will submit only only to the voice of the brieg she has a longing in her heart come Lord Jesus come the false Church system will not follow the word the interest is not to please the Lord but to please herself she is not the bride those who submit to such a system you will find them believing all sorts of things all other voes you know what a prostitute does she listens to this man as long as it makes her happy if there is money but a true bride a true like I've been married with my wife for this year 12 years now she has never even winked at another man never not look at and WIS a man Wings then she smiles it has never if you're a man and you here you that's a true that who are you talking toar of your bus she has never done why that's when other brothers come you just look IM you say swe look at that maning and then man will say this woman is because they led by another they are not the bride but you are the bride you are a bride other voices the Church of Jesus which the of the church and yet she is not the bride there is a difference between the church and the bride and in five minutes I'm finishing the church and the bride the church follows what makes her happy you find women dressed in pants the Bible does not allow women to dress trousers but for them they do it because it makes them happy and they in church you find them throwing saying they dancing for Jes I am dancing for Jesus that is not the the bride but it is the church not she's listen to other voes but God has a bride and that bride is all over the world she will listen to no other this other woman she will do many other things that other voices will tell her she will baptize babies the Bible doesn't allow she will allow women preachers the Bible doesn't allow will believe in three Gods Bible doesn't she will dress any way they want the Bible doesn't allow she will pay for prayers prayer as if you have gone to a doctor that you have you have to pay they pay for prayers those are not churches but to the Servants of God freely you receive freely you g without money without price you see in this in this church she will tolerate fornication the gra of God is instead of encouraging young people to they toate things to the extent today as we as I'm looking at church worldwide in many denominations they have tolerated and accepted homosexuality is offal why she is not the bride she's not the bride she has to the spirit of Jezebel to dominate over her instead of accepting the spirit of the word but there is a true church that bride will always submit to the word when the word says one God she will say Amen aen when the church when the Bible says baptism water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what will the church say the true church of the say Amen when the when the Bible says dressed in mother's clothing am you will never find one them dressed in a Min you find them dressed like that that's not the Church of the Living God a true church will dress way not only women in our generation you find men men they look like siss they begin when you see them in a is that a man woman you can't understand that's not the Bride of now the Bible says don't even it says Those Who fornicate chase them away don't even eat with them unless they repent did you know that if you knew that say Amen but our churches today they have that that's why it doesn't bother them even if they Mar when they fought after all for the True Church of Jesus not fornicate young people you are you are not the bride you are just but the true bride we do what is doing she will say Amen we are the true church and we not the only ones they all over the world I always want to sing that song There Are People almost Alan be that man that will always redeem your wife fight if you have to give yourself for her it does only mean it also means your time and your life you have become a slave today if you've been having AED you also you have to work hard make money she's been in my house she's my daughter that's why I'm very tough with you see how she looks She's beautiful because she's been eating very well you have to work hard you a very educated young man go make money the is the limit is your responsibility to provide everything she needs fight for her protect her cherish her between you and her there is no one today the parents the father gave her to you it means even he is out now she is the second most important person in your life if you have been listening to many other people today she is number one after number one she come she's a big person's a VIP before decision and then God will bless your and with money that's a very simple thing sometimes always tell these young people God can't bless you with money if you have no purpose we saw we saw brother here he was employed and he still going up same with his wife she has you graduated with Masters recently it came after marriage by the way we had several other young couples here struggling struggling stabiliz I went to my father inlaw I had nothing and I'm not ashame to say the only thing I took was a bag for my wife which also money was collected my mother helped me my father me except even the B was good news nothing friends and family of me and the cloth told me cloth for Auntie for this I colle and I was very tiny I had nothing I was poor according to world but I was rich and I knew what I could accomplish I had purpose I had vision and God has since lifted us up have been a blessing in the home of my parents in I took all the children to school I become their father and I'm saying this because you can B A Lea when you get married there is a way things move in your favor because God says you have a vision now you have a purpose now you have a Target now then he lifts you up then lifts you up ISAC spent here many years looking for job no jobs he went abroad didn't work out no job that's the truth that's wife when he came back still no jobs then he told me I want to get married I am always positive to someone who is mure and has vision and wants to get married I'm positive to that it's not money that marri it is maturity physical and spiritual because it brings ability and after he got married one two three months powerful there is a blessing in marriage because it is the will of God no it's okay for you to get a job which gives you 5 million to wait until you get to Mar it's okay okay figuring things out and that's okay but me I'm a man who is rugged and I work by Fai and I find I'm sorry I find it to be the way of God churches many young people this church is a church of young people I'm sorry I didn't have to say all this but in churches some of them are belies they living very immoral life but because they come to church and smiling and Dred well we think they parents who are here and who are hearing this because I know you are there this under the anointing of the holy spirit let us support our children to start families it is the will of God it is the way of the word now before I come to you always love her and cherish her she has always been a part of you before before the foundation of you remember when you came to me and I told you why don't you try other sister that one you scratched your head for a month you came back why there was a deep and there was a deep resp so as I want to conclude I be the woman that will be a true submissive bre when your husband says there is no in say be for submit to your husband a true wife be that that will shut yourself to all other voices and with yourey for you have always been a part of him have skills use them some people they here maybe they not will prove the be a woman of prayer without prayer you cannot man manage a home you are going to support his vision without your support he cannot manage he needs you more than he needs his father Pastor friends he needs you support him as much as you can with your hands with encouragement sometimes when he comes back tired I'm going to give you a magic bring some and feed him when you doing this everything will change and you see stressed begin smil and then he will go back again and align with his if I say anything after this it was not inspired I'm done God bless you both we are now going to go to the can I have both of you stand
