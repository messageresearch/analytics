father we want to permit ourselves into your hands as we go into your holy word we are going to take a portion of it and read it we ask that you will come and bless us tonight as we are gathered to today in your house Lord may you bless the propagation people that are in this place and even those on the internet Lord may this service be a blessing to each of us I pray your moment we are going to

hands in Jesus name amen [Music] amen why don't you turn with me to your Bibles [Music] I want to welcome everyone of you in the name of our Lord Jesus may God bless you amen so today I just want to speak on the subject of When Love is projected Sovereign Grace steps in and we will take first John chapter 4 verses 16. first John is near the Book of Revelation you are there we say Amen so we are reading uh chapter 4 of 1st John verses 16 to 19. and we have known and believed the love that God has to us God is love and he has and he that dwelleth in love dwareth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear has torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us amen you may be seated I see everyone here tonight learn the English that a man so we will do without interpretation for tonight um I have this more subject on my heart share with you all and I pray that you give me your undivided attention and we as we see what the holy spirit will speak to us according to the desire of our heart you have something you need from the Lord tonight amen you just open your heart and see what the Lord will speak to you now those of you who have been in the message and have read uh the message when love is projected I I think you know where we are headed tonight it's a wonderful message it's one of those first messages I read years ago and the some brothers who printed it and on the on the cover of the message they put the 11th commandment I forgot to bring a copy for you uh the 11th commandment so I I was so curious I wanted to find out what is this 11th commandment because the Bible speaks of 10. then I found that you you brother Barnum was speaking of love and of course this is one of the Jesus he he told us to love one another so it's the Commandment from God to us to love one another amen and so uh in first John it says that we have known and believed the love that God has to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him so now if you dwell in love you are in God and God is in you why because you dwell in love herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment so we do not have boldness to stand on the day of judgment if we are not in love but if we are in love and our love is made perfect then we have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in the war in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love that's what perfect love everybody cuts out fear because fear has torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love for we love him because he first loved us and in the message when love is projected uh just begin with this little line sentence that I I that really struck me in that whole message when the prophet said and when love has been projected then it's time for Sovereign Grace to step in it will do it every time are you following me when love has been projected when you manifest love is when you manifest love when you project love in your life then it is time for Sovereign Grace to step in and here he says it will do it every time so in other words there is no time that this is going to fail whenever you manifest love in your life through your life to someone Sovereign Grace must always step in Sovereign Grace is always around where love is Sovereign Grace always loves or likes the smell of Love whenever love is filled there is Grace and I should say where there is no love there is no Grace Hallelujah and now when we talk about love we can talk about several minutes different types of love there is what people call family love for the love you have for your family members for your mother for your father for your brothers and sisters but also there is two especially two types of love that brother talks about and one of them he calls it Agape or agape love that's the love of God and then Pharaoh love which is the love that you have for your wife or the love that you have for your friend now in this old uh these types of Love really most of them all of them are a perversion of the real love now there is only one real love are you following me there is only one real love and that is agape love all the other is really a perversion of agape love but really the pure perfect love that we know that the Bible is speaking over here in the book of First John is not Philo he's not family love
