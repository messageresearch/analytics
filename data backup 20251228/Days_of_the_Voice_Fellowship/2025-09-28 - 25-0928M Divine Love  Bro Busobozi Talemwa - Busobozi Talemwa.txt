Oh, there's no place for rightet does not stop him. I don't care how much the world unbelieves, it's still going to happen. Unbelief does not condemns the unbeliever. The unbelief will send the unbeliever to hell. It will rob him of every blessing. But it does not hinder God from going right on with the believer. See, unbelief does not stop God. It only stops unbelief. Oh, you God by your God. You are God from beginning to the end. There's no place for right. You made you go. Oh, you are good. You are God from beginning to the end.

God bless you all. Just asking that you turn to your Bibles. I greet every one of you in the precious name of Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are reading in the book of first John chapter 3 and we are reading from verses 11. [Music] Amen. Amen. For this, for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother, and whereof slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous. Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you, we know that we have passed from death. Listen to this script verses vers 14. We know that we have passed from death unto life. How do we know? How do we know? Because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. That is a very strong word, is it not? He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. You see, he says, "We know that we have passed from death unto life the brethren. He that he that loveth not his brother abideth in death." And then he continues on to say, we read up to 17. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But who so has this world is good and seeth his brother have need and shutth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God [Music] Uganda. Uganda. [Music] [Music] Uganda. [Music] Amen. You may be seated. I have a few notes here for you, a few announcements. Before we go into the word, this is from sister Martha. Ma, I believe this is from our reading to you. God bless you, DVA family. As we prepare to relocate to Zambia this Tuesday, we wanted to express our heartfelt gratitude for the love, support, and spiritual nourishment. [Music] time we've been together but we will be away for a while your memories and your love with us coming every after 3 to four months that is from sister from the family I know uh I I people are feeling sad already when they had that but she you know came and told me that they'll be relocating there for a while. They are not leaving the church. They're just relocating there for so they'll be coming every 3 to four months. We will certainly miss you so much. We will be always praying for you and um uh we trust that you also keep us in prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then uh there's uh I think um maybe the one or two who clapped are not going to be. Yeah, this is from um uh Kiji Kiji Christian Tabernacle Tabernacle from Sori. &gt;&gt; It is too lengthy. I will not read everything. I just want to go to the word is from brother deer &gt;&gt; and they're inviting us for the end of year convention in &gt;&gt; Sori um located at um I believe high school and it will be um on 22nd to 26th December and uh the contribution is 10,000 per person. [Music] Yeah. If you want more details, you can come and let us know and we'll give you the information. Amen. Amen. Um also uh this next Sunday I would like to announce that I'll be speaking at uh Budo Christian F. It's very hard for me to leave the Sunday morning here and go to another place. Usually whenever I went to budo to dedicate those students, I rush the time but it has always been very difficult. So and also difficult for them because I have to just rush but this time I I I have felt led to just go and be with them. Uh it's an opportunity to not all those students are believers of the message. Um you know but it's an opportunity to to minister to hundreds of young people and not only dedicate them when they're doing exams also reach reach out so the seed of the word in those young hearts. I think it is a very noble opportunity. &gt;&gt; So um I on Sunday I will be fully with them and by God's grace all the candidates we have dedicated there fully passed. So so I believe that the Lord will do it again this year. remember us as we are with them on Sunday on Sunday next week. Then on the on I announced here already on Wednesday that we are going to have visitors on the 15th of October uh from from Bible way pastor Tom Ray and our very own brother Michael Ray. they'll be passing by us and um we're going to have a service that evening with them. So if you have a program, please look at your time table and if you have a job get an off that that day or come or leave early. We are going to leave. We are going to have an early service. The Lord willing 5 p.m. to be able to have enough time with the visitors. So um there's also many coming in from different uh places. Some will come from Kamoja. You know these brothers have been sponsoring the work there. the uh translation of the of the message the Bible and other things. So a delegation will come from and also from TESO and also some some brethren from West N. So we I believe we're going to be packed up. So come early and receive those visitors not only the ones coming from abroad but also the ones coming from As a member of this church, I expect you to come early and let us receive those visitors. We are going to have a special service that once again it is October 15. It is a Wednesday evening 5 p.m. So please plan on being here. Ask your neighbor whether they remember the name. You remember it, brother? Yes. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; Maybe I pick someone randomly. &gt;&gt; Ask them if they remember the day. And also this October is going to be quite a busy month. Um we are I would like you to pray. We are planning to have a brother Isaac and from Nairobi on one of the weekends. We've not yet confirmed which one but most most likely the 12th. If not then the last one. I'll confirm that to you maybe on Wednesday or so. uh you know the brethren in Nairobi are planning to come quite many of them I understand almost 70 are planning to come for our youth camp so if you are not planning I don't know what you're waiting if you are a member here and you are not registered I don't know what you're waiting so please get registered and um let us uh be able to uh receive those visitors. There are so many coming from all over the world. The youth camp is always a time of gathering for not only young people but believers from all over the world. They're coming from Australia. They coming from Zimbabwe. They coming from Kenya. They coming from Ethiopia. They're coming from. So please be in preparation and give your contributions on time and uh let us plan for January uh and let us see what the Lord will do. Amen. Amen. I don't know whether if you're a youth or any brother and you really not a partaker of the church programs and you call yourself a believer, it is really a shaming. various you should be partaker and contribute to all the arrangements that have been planned because you are the church. I am the church. You are the church. The church is not the person who is coming but the church you are the one who is available. Is that amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's now quickly get into the word. This morning we are going to speak about divine love. Tell your neighbor divine love. Amen. If you love someone close to you, tell them I love you. I love you. I want to ask you a question. How did you feel when you were told those words? In your heart, how did you feel? Let's be honest. Can we try it again? Tell your neighbor, "I love you." There's a sister here. Nobody's telling her I love you. You see, this is the reason why we're going to talk about love because the brothers are fearing. What if I tell that sister I love you? &gt;&gt; And then she begins to think praise God. &gt;&gt; So love is a wonderful force you know when you talk about love you know and someone tells you I love you feel different you you cannot feel the same. Is that is that true? Yeah, you feel different and and and so it's a powerful word, but also it's a powerful thing. But there are many different kinds of love and you can love for wrong reasons as well because you are loving with a different kind of love. But we today we are not talking about any kind of love. We are talking about divine love. I have a lot of scriptures and quotes, but I told you I am committed that in every sermon I preach that it will mature you that you will get somewhere spiritual in your Christian walk with God in your experience and I trust that this will be one of those divine love. There's a lot of things I felt I can talk about but you pray for me and the Holy Spirit will lead and guide me to speak only which you need. Amen. For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another. And then immediately after he said that, okay, before actually he said that He he had talked about righteousness and um he he was saying that uh he was talking about a new birth. Please put your mind together with me. I'm going to speak for an hour and a half. And you know whenever I announce the time I'm going to speak, I keep it. So I don't and the reason why I give you the time is because I don't expect you to be moving. And maybe you don't know how long the preacher is going to speak for. I remember when I just believed something of the preachers would preach and you don't know how long he will talk to you. It might be two hours, three or four, sometimes five or six. You're not too sure. Even when you feel pressed, you you you're not too sure. Should I wait or should I go? My preacher would say, "I'm about to finish. I'm finishing with this quote. I'm finishing in the next five minutes." Keep going on and on. I don't like that. And I don't like a preacher who does that. Praise God. I think we ought to be honest. And also, you know, a man, a person can only sit for so long. Praise God. And so when I give you the time, please, if you are new here, just know I'll keep it. So stay focused. Tell your neighbor, stay focused. I want us to get what I'm talking about. So whoever is born of God does not commit sin. Does not commit sin. If you are born of God, you cannot commit sin. You cannot forget about what your mind is telling you. Listen to what the word is telling you. You cannot commit sin. Okay? You can do wrong things, but you cannot commit sin. Now, we know sin is unbelief of the word, but you cannot unbelieve the word. If you are born again, you will always believe the word. Amen. Amen. And also he says because the seed remains in you and you cannot sin because you are born of God. It is this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil. Whosoever doeth not righteousness. [Music] Amen. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Now when he talks about this righteousness, remember he says he cannot sin that is born of God. Now if it means you if you're born of God, you will automatically do righteousness. So the righteousness is talking about is not your works of righteousness. [Music] It is the righteousness of him in whom you are born. When you are born again, God stops looking at you. He starts looking at him in whom you are in. Hallelujah. you you are dead but you are alive or born again in Christ. So if you are in Christ you cannot sin and then he says in this we are able to know the children of God are the children of the devil. Amen. Why? Because when we are in him, we are righteous. Actually, the Bible even says we are his righteousness. [Music] Amen. And so when we are born again, we are righteous, righteous by declaration that righteous. Amen. In him. So it means a person that is born again has to stop looking at himself. You need to begin looking at him in whom you are in because that's what also Christ looks at and we are able to know the children of God by that. The children of God will have the righteousness of God. The children of the devil will try to have their own works of righteousness and they will not seek the righteousness of him that comes by the word, but they will seek or or they will desire for God to accept their righteousness [Music] which comes by their works. And if you go back in the beginning, there was Cain and Abel. God required a sacrifice. But Cain gave a sacrifice according to his own way of thinking. It was fruits, apples and all those things. You know, Cain was like, "God, you should accept what I have done. I have done the best. This is the best I can deliver." And Cain expected God to accept him or receive him the way he is. God does not receive any man the way they are. God does not receive you on the basis of your tongue. God receives you on the basis of his word. And you know, you cannot receive or do the word of God in your own knowledge and wisdom because God is higher than us. The Bible says his ways are higher than our ways. His thoughts are higher than our thoughts. And so he says, "Repent of your sins. Repent of your ways. Walk in my ways. But how can you walk in your in his way? And how can a man forsake his way is only by one thing which we already talked about spiritual revelation without revelation. You will hear the word but you will misunderstand it. You will misunderstand it for legalism instead of revelation. Amen. When Cain heard the word, he thought all God required was a sacrifice. He thought God wants me to do something and to do it according to my best. So that was legalism. As long as I dress well, as long as I go to church, as long as I pay my tithe, I am a believer. That's legalism. You are doing those things according to your own way [Music] and God will not receive that. But you see Abel came when he heard it, he did not only hear a sacrifice. Oh hallelujah. He had another word which was attached to the word sacrifice. He had a blood sacrifice. God never said blood sacrifice. So where did Abel receive that word? He downloaded it from the cloud of God by revelation. That is why we need spiritual revelation. When we hear the word, we shall not just see what is written. We will receive more from God. He will understand what he is trying to mean. And Cain and and Cain never understood. He did the works of the Lord. But Abel by spiritual revelation he was able to give a blood sacrifice and Cain could not understand why his sacrifice was rejected and why Abel's sacrifice was accepted. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't have spiritual revelation, &gt;&gt; you will never be able to understand why somebody else will be blessed by God and you will not. You will never be able to understand why someone believes something and for you you feel it is legalism. You will not understand because you are not in the realm. You are not walking in the realm of revelation. You are walking in the realm of legalism. The Bible says, you know, um I'm talking of works. It says that the the letter kleth but the spirit gives life. Praise God. Praise God. So when you talk about women dressing Many people who are not having revelation will think we have laws that permit women not to wear trousers. We do not have such laws. To them who don't have revelation, it is a law, legalism, a work that a person must do. But when you have revelation, you go beyond the law. You go to the level of revelation. You go to the level of intent. What God intended for you to do. You will look it as a at it as a law. You have to give 10%. That's why you would even count and make sure even the coins you count them. Not less, not more. But if you have revelation and you're not walking by law, you will understand that all my blessings come from God for me to give 10%. Is even too small. I will give much more than that because I have a revelation that he that gave me this is more than able to give me much more. That's how believers that walk by revelation. And you don't do it out of pain. You do it out of joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why in the Old Testament, you know, it was by pain, sorrow. But in the New Testament, by grace through revelation, it is by joy. Amen. Oh my. There's much I can talk about. And so after he has now explained the righteousness of God, Then he says, "Whosoever does not do righteousness is not of God. [Music] Neither he that loveth not." Praise God. Now I can say right. The righteousness of God is equals to love. Today you're going to see love in a different way. Open your heart. Just help me and open your heart. For this is the message that he had from the beginning that we would love we should love one another. Amen. And then immediately after he he begins to pronounce love, he begins to talk about Cain. Cain who was of the wicked one he killed his brother and then he asks a question why did he kill his brother because Kane's works were evil but his brothers were righteous. Amen. And he says don't be shocked if the world hate you. Amen. Meaning when you receive the love of God and you love the word of God, you will love everybody. But the world, the seed, &gt;&gt; I almost titled this the proof of seed. [Music] Amen. Because the line, the seed will never be able to love. Listen church, there are people in this world that do not have ability to love. They will behave as if they're loving, but they cannot truly genuinely love. And that example is Cain. He never had love in his heart. He loved Cain in life. He loved Cain in death. And yet Cain was serpent. And someone told me, "Pastor, the Bible says, love your brother. So I should love a fellow believer. I should love a person who we agree with." No. When the Bible is speaking about Cain Ab loving his brother, and Kane hating his brother. Listen, these were two different seedlines. Kane was not a believer. He was a makebeliever but not a genuine believer. Cain was the seed of the serpent. But Abel had love for Cain. What kind of love is that? and can only be divine love. The love of God, the love which can never be defeated. The love which goes to heaven. The love which comes on earth. The love which goes to hell. The love which is permanent in every situation. Love which is not changed by situation. Love which is not moved. Love which is strong, love which is permanent, that is divine. God is love. That's what Abel had. But Kane never had he could not have it because he was not born of God. He was born of a son but not born of God. And if you are here this morning and you are born of God, you must have this Lord. But if you do not have, there is a problem with your experience. Amen. If you have someone in the world today that you dislike or rather you may dislike them, that's okay. But you hate them. &gt;&gt; You hurt them. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I'm coming to your address. If you have someone you hat in your heart and you have even said that one even when they should never come on my barrier I cannot sit in the same room with them I cannot tell them I love you then brother sister you are not a Christian yet you realize why this is a narrow It is not easy to love your enemy. So when I talk about love, look at it in the context of enemy, not loving your friend. Love your enemy. Praise God. This one is going to design you. Oh, praise God. As I was studying, I was being designed. By the time we are done with the service today, you will be discerned. You will know where you're falling. So please sit, relax and let us enjoy this flight. Praise God. Amen. It might not be a whole excitement thing, but we are going to feed on the world. Not as Cain who was of that wicked one and he killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous. Marvel not my brethren. If the world hates you, so the world will hate you. I speak to you right now, the world will hate you. As long as you have the love of God, the world will hate you. When Jesus came in the world, he was hated by the world. The Bible says they love the darkness. And they hated the light. But you see the light always loved the darkness. He loved us and he came in the darkness of the world. The Bible says God dwells in the thickest of darkness. Amen. But light will always dwell in darkness. But darkness can never dwell in the light. You can never have hatred. But he will always have love. Even to those that hate you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise God. We know. How do you know? The Bible says we are passed from death to life. We are born again. We are a new creation in Christ Jesus. But how do you know? How do you know that you have passed from death to life? Let us stop singing scriptures when we don't mean them. When we don't have them, the Bible says we know that we are passed from death to life because we love the brethren. And the brethren here is not only those who believe like you. We have seen the context. Amen. When you love your brethren. Amen. Then you know you have passed from death. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. If there is someone you don't love, someone you blacklisted, someone you hate with a passion, I know why you do that. Because they did something to you. But I want to tell you this morning, you are abiding in death yourself. You must forgive them and you must love them because the love of God is unconditional. Hallelujah. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no mother has eternal life abiding in him. So if you don't love your brother, you mother. And we here how do we perceive the love of God? Because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, in a message, it is I be not afraid. So, he's got other men on the field, the great men, and I'm one of the and and I'm one of the small. And this is brother Brham's declaration. Yet, he was one of the greatest. But the way he spoke but my little part I like to do for him to show him my expression about my love for him. I love him with all of my heart. How many can say I love Jesus with all of my heart but I don't love my brother? I love him but not with all my heart. Okay. &gt;&gt; But you said you love Jesus with all your heart. Listen. And I cannot love him without loving you all. You you cannot love God. My brothers and sisters, stop pretending. You cannot love God with all your heart and you don't love your brother with all your heart. For he would rather I would love you all and love him. [Music] I would rather you would love my children instead of loving me. And me being a parent I think that that's what about him the same thing. If you say you love me But then you go behind me and do something to one of my children. I know you don't love me. So if you say you love God, what about his children? Amen. Let's come back in the camp now. Amen. What about his children? Some of you have brothers you can never hug. Sisters you can never hug. Amen. People you can never talk to. Amen. You go to the same church, but you're filled with hatred. You're filled with anger. You're filled with anguish. You believe the same message. But you cannot even look at each other and say, "I love you." You lie and the love of God is not in you. There's no way you can love God. If you don't love every brother, every sister, you have to have love for them. Praise God. Don't you worry. We're just taking off here. What is love? Let us all of us go to first Corinthians chapter 13. Oh God, may you help us this morning. 1 Corinthians 13. We are going to begin from vers one. Quickly now. Though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and uh I have no charity, I am become a sounding brass or a tinkerling symbol. All right, just listen now. And though I have gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor. And though I give my body to be banned, and have not charity, it profitth me nothing. Charity serveth long and is kind. Charity envth not. Charity forth not itself. Is not puffed up. We will get to all that. Does not behave itself and seemly seeketh not our own. Is not easily provoked. Thinkketh no evil. Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth. Beareth all things, believeth all things, hope all things, endureth all things. Now what love is not Let us begin with that according to what Apostle Paul laid down here in Corinthians. He says love, let us go slowly and get love is not tongues of men and of angels. Okay. Love is not prophecy. Oh, you can prophesy. That means you have the love of God. Oh, because you can speak in tongues and prophesy of men and of angels. That means you have loving heart. Love is not understanding mysteries. Oh, I understand all the mysteries of the seventh and all this and that. No, love is not knowledge. Love is not faith. Love is not even helping the poor. So you can help the poor but not have life. &gt;&gt; So that's not charity. M love is not self-sacrifice and sincerity. You can sacrifice yourself. Give yourself for others. You are so sincere. Don't sincere. But when you do not have love, praise God. We've seen men who have done that and they can give themselves for others. They have lived selfless. Some of them we we even talk about them in history. Others they were even canonized by Rome to become saints. But that's not what true love is. Amen. I'm talking about divine love. You can do all that but yet not have love. So let us look at the characteristics of love. Love. And while I'm talking, you check yourself. Love is longsuffering. Love is kind. Love has no envy. Love has no busting. And now it's not one of these. It's not one of these. It's not one of these. I'm I'm saying a long list of things, &gt;&gt; okay? But it's not one of them. It's all of them together. Yes. So you say, "Oh, I have longsuffering. Jesus have love." As as I'm going down, you will see that love is another commandment. The Old Testament gives gives 11 ten commandments. Jesus then comes and says another commandment again. because this one fulfills all of all the requirements of the law. Praise God. So when you and and and the law the principle of the law is if you break one you have broken all. So so you have to keep all but in this case you are not keeping these things by yourself. It is what you have when you have love. Praise God. So it love has longsuffering. It has no envy, no boasting, vaunting. I'm the one who did that. I'm the one who did that. No, love has no boasting. Love is not puffed up, selfinflated pride. You know, brother, just just just interpret what I'm saying here. Love, you know, is not self-inflated pride. You know, being puffed up is when you have you you you lift up yourself in your own pride. Love doesn't have or behave unsemly or improper behavior. Love is not selfseeking. Love is not easily provoked. You know, we have a word called people who can someone can come and really try to make you flare up and say enough is enough. I will show you. You don't have love. You don't have love. You don't have love. Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of you who are dozing, I'm going to ask you to come and sit on the front seat. It will be polite so it will not. Don't worry. So don't don't doze. Praise God. I want you to have love. Just just follow me. Love thinkketh no evil, is not easily provoked, [Music] doesn't rejoice in sin, iniquity. When when something wrong is happening, you cannot rejoice in your heart. You will not have peace. That's how you know you have love. Love rejoices in the truth. It beareth all things. Covering over. Now bearing all things means covering over the imperfections and shortcomings of others. Acting as a shield against harm and wrongdoing rather than exposing fault. Praise God. Have you seen married couples who claim they love each other and then they begin fighting? Many years ago, we used to have a neighbor like that. Neighbors. So when they begin fighting, that's when you will know everything that happens in their house. They will speak everything there. better than you. You are you are witches in you do this in your family even yesterday you did this now even you and and later on okay continue it's not love that's why oh my my my may God help us that's why the prophet said under no circumstance can I believe now here are certain circumstances that you can get married wi with some certain group of people. We know brother advises us not to mix marriages you know white black mar in your race but he never said under no circumstance. So he said under no circumstance should a believer man believe. That's that why because if you do not have love your marriage cannot stand and the love I'm talking about is not the human love is not the feeling you're feeling like something is like electricity even when you talk about how you love someone can even cry because they have an powering of love for them. Those are feelings. Sometimes you can even feel your heart is almost coming out. If they say I no longer love you, you can even feel like you are sick. Even you feel pain on your heart. Oh my god. The way I love them. The way No brother, sister. Come on. Those are feelings. Soon you will have to grow that after some time even if they chucked you can get healed because that was a feeling you had and it left. But the kind of love I'm talking about is higher than a feeling is higher than human feeling. It is something divine make you cover someone's wrong that will make you amen their imperfection their shortcomings. You will shield them from harm. Even when it means for you to be the one to be blamed. You will shield them from harm. You will never expose their fault. Brother that is love. Amen. Love beareth all things. This one means to be trusting. Assume the best about others [Music] and give them the benefit of the doubt rather than being gullible or naive. It doesn't mean that if you bear all things or rather you believe all things doesn't mean you are gullible or naive but rather it means when a brother tells you something. Praise God. I'm seeing a lot of movements. I pray that we stay together. Listen, when a brother, if you have love in your heart and a brother does something and you don't like it and he tells you why he did it and he says, "I'm sorry. I hurt you, but I never met you. No, I don't believe you. There is something there." No, there's not something there. There is something in you. The Bible says to the pure all things are pure. &gt;&gt; If you're pure in your heart, your brother will tell you, "I'm sorry. I never meant to do it. They may be lying or saying the truth." But if you have the love of God in your heart, you will take them at their word, you receive, you believe what they are saying. And also when the word is spoken, you will believe all the word. All the word. Love hope all things is to expect the best in people and situations. To never give up on somebody and to trust in God's ultimate plan. Have hope. You know you you you trust in God yes but expect the best in God. The reason why we we are Christians but we are divided more than the unbeliever because the attitude is much better. But the attitude of believers many times is bad. We always expect the worst in people. We always expect the worst in people. When someone does something, before you even know, the moment you receive an accusation, then then you believe it. You you believe it without even finding trying to find out. You just try to put the brother or the sister deeper in the deep. How about expecting the best in your brother? Expecting the best in your sister. How about changing your attitude? How about hoping all things are good? Love endureth all things. A steadfast unwavering form of love that does not quit but remains firm and patient through hardship through opposition. You endure. You endure. Some of you are married. If you you have this love I'm talking about, you will one one two three things. I'm going back to my father's house. Where is endurance? Through opposition through issues you have with your husband. Sister, endure. Some of you brothers, do you know men are becoming sisters these days? They are the ones running away from their homes. This sermon today is is realistic. They are the ones leaving the home. They take off. Why? Because they disagreeing with their wives. Maybe because of, you know, you find men who don't want to sleep at home. They don't even want even when they sleep at home, they don't want to go in the bedroom. They don't have any endurance in them. But true love endures all things rather have endurance. Sometimes we need to endure a little more. Some brothers we need to endure them. Some sisters we need to endure them. Endurance means some brothers are hard. Some sisters are hard. Some are difficult to deal with. But brother, if you have the love of God in your heart, you will not give up on them. Oh my, I feel like shouting twice my size. Let me tell you, you who is seated here that one I'm done with you. You don't have endurance which means you don't have this love. Oh my. May God help you. You need to repent of your ways. Have some endurance. Don't end up people. I am done with I just see them. I'm just looking at the dealings. It is a brethren go to the same church rather you are the one with to be born again. Amen. You find them in the music department and they are done with each other. You find them in a church. &gt;&gt; You find them in church. They are done with each other. So I'm done with that one. I'm done with that one. Praise God. Praise God. Sometimes when I'm preaching, I can almost point you out because the Holy Spirit reveals to me. But but then as a pastor, I said, "No, it may cause something." But you know each other. If you are done with each other, the things he has done to me, even God in heaven knows it. Even the devil, even me, I just look at him. You are the one with something wrong. You need to be born again. If God gives you the Holy Spirit to come and bring give you love, then abundant love that will cause you to love somebody you think you're done with. Praise God. Let us not be done with one another. We are only done with Satan. I want you to confess on your mouth. I am done with Satan. I am done with Satan. But I love my brother. I love my sister. Amen. No matter what they have done to me. Amen. Then we know you have God in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I hope that arrived at home. [Music] Now, what the kind of love I'm talking about, the Bible says in vers 8 of 1 Corinthians 13, charity never faileth. This kind of love, brother, it cannot fail. Amen. It cannot fail. It cannot fail. Everything else will fail. Prophecies will fail. You know, tongues will fail. They will seize. Knowledge will will vanish away. But this kind of love. It is permanent. It is like a rock. It cannot fail. When everything fails, this love cannot fail. Amen. If you have failed in your relationship, amen, that means you don't have this kind of love. But brother, if a sister has this kind of love and a brother has this kind of love, then you cannot fail. [Music] Hallelujah. And I want to declare to you, Amen. Some of us have this kind of love. Amen. I see my wife saying, "Amen." Therefore, our marriage cannot fail. Hallelujah. And I can never hate any of you. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what you do, if I if I had time, I would let to you some of the things I've been done to. But, brethren, I don't pretend. &gt;&gt; I used to hate. I used to hate. That is the truth. until one day God baptized me with his blood. &gt;&gt; From that day, he even gave me a song. When I when I needed to forgive those who hurt me, I couldn't do it. Even to those who haunt me, some people can really haunt you. But when his grace found me so wretched, poor and blind, I couldn't help it. But to say I forgive and that's what will happen to every brother because this kind of love can never be first John. We are beginning to cruise now. 1 John 4 16. And we have known and believed the love of God that he has to us. God is love. Now we have known why we cannot fail because God is love. &gt;&gt; So God is equals to love. So this kind of love I'm talking about is actually God and he that dwelleth in God and God in him rather dwelleth in love or he that in love this love you have to dwell in it meaning you don't have it. You're dwelling it. Amen. Then you are dwelling in God and God in you. First John 4:8, he that loveth not knoweth no not God. For God is love. For with and and Luke 137 says, "For with with God nothing shall be impossible. [Music] Pastor, you don't know what they did to me. They hurt me beyond repair. Oh, which means you are not repaired yet. Let me tell you brother sister. Amen. Receive this love. When you receive this love, amen, with God, nothing shall be impossible. You will be repaired with God. He will forgive them. Everything shall be possible. There is no impossibilities with God. God is love. Listen, faith is a substance. Son can copy any kind of gift, any kind of a manifestation, any kind of manifestation, any kind of gift, brother, Satan can manifest it. So if you want to see God, don't look for gifts and manifest it. Someone speaks in tongues. Someone prophesies. Someone, you know, designs somebody. This man has God. Sometimes they don't have God at all. Because Satan can manifest all those things just as God can. So we don't want to dwell on those things. Some people can manifest great gifts when they are filled with a lot of hatred. &gt;&gt; They are not born again. But you see, Satan can manifest all those things. But he cannot lie. He cannot love because God is love. Satan cannot lie. Can you allow me to say this this morning? That even his children cannot lie. But God is love and his children will always love. Hallelujah. Amen. You see a man humble and loving and good to his neighbors and a good citizen, a good fellow, a good man and a Christianity full of love and humility. You watch that man. He has love. He's a good charitable longsuffering. You can talk about him. It's all right. He forgives you. Don't make any difference to him. It doesn't make any difference to him. But some of you, you are here in this church. You You developed a disliking for somebody to the extent that you can't stand them. anything to do with them is a no go for you. &gt;&gt; You need to be born again. You see, but says this man, this Christian man or woman no matter what you do to them, Amen. He forgives you. It doesn't make a difference. That's the real man. Keep your eye on him. That man bears. He's an example. Oh, do we have examples in our church this morning of people who will have real genuine love, no matter what you do to them, they won't mark you. Say this one. If he's a preacher, you say, "Brother Marvin, come. Brother Marvin is going to minister for us this afternoon. God bless you brother Mav you know you are not yet married. So and then brother Marvin the moment he comes if you don't walk out you will not even say amen. You live in those intentionally. This one let him talk to others. But for me will suffer with you. Wake up sister. Wake up brother because that one is saying also with what he did to me. Let me tell you you are not God. Oh. But even God is love. So if you are God, then you must love. Unless you are Satan or his child, then you will hate them forever. But I believe I'm talking to children of God. Forgive them. Love them regardless. Let me tell you, love heals. When you live in love, you don't love stress. No wonder many of you have sleep problems. [Music] In this generation, many younger people sleep problems. Why? They are filled with they are getting sicknesses of old people. They take grudges every time. They never forgive. They are always bitter. They always s they always relax yourself. Forgive and see the experience. When you forgive and you genuinely love you will always live happy. When you come in church you will be happy when you go outside. You will be happy. Brother sister you don't have any reason to remain sad. when you have received this message because this messenger brought down the capstone. This messenger the cornerstone what is it is the message of the seven sons. What did it do perfect life? He has given a bright access to all of God. You have no reason to remain sad. And the devil is inflict afflicting you with the with the demons of Lady because you accepting it. Satan cannot love. But God is love. If you're a child of God, you will have love. But if you're a child of Satan, like Cain, you will never have love. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have prepared for us. Now listen, &gt;&gt; types of love. Amen. Is what I'm talking about. That's the genuine love. The only love. Yeah. Divine love. But out of that it goes reducing from aap from to to lust and filth and all the perversions but people called them love. You listen to this quote in the message he must be born again. Anything that had a beginning has an end. It is those things which have not a beginning has an end. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You said it right. Did you ever think of that? &gt;&gt; God the great master rainbow in the skies. [Music] God the master rainbow in the skies. We will say it like that with the seven spirits of God read. And then he says perfect love. After that comes love from love. That's the love that you have for your wife. Now many people think that's the love you should have for your wife. [Music] No, if you love her only with it will not only fail but you will hurt others in that in the process. I'll show you. I'll continue reading. You'll understand. If some man would insult her, you would shoot his brains out. That's f love because it creates a jealousy. Some people when they love somebody, they don't want others to love them. Oh, no one can love that person. It is me only. And we all have that kind of love. It's not the genuine love that I'm talking about. perverted. Children have it and oh you know everyone is jealousy of another daddy has done that for you. What about mine? If you don't have it there is no happiness in that household. Why? Because of jealousy and and that's what you finding in couples also. And that's what we can have as humans. It creates a jealousy but that's love secondary secondary love. Then after that comes lust but you see we always we call fellow love. Yeah, you know there are many categories family love what this and that but it's all f you know um you know the I love my mother I love I I love you I love the brothers I love the sisters I love my children I love my wife but you see we using human love but also people have another kind of love when he sees a girl that is moving this old lustful boy, you'll say, "Ah, I love that guy. I love that guy." They will not sleep that night thinking about it. What is it? Is it love? No. It is lust. It's not love. It's lust. And some sisters also can have it. And some of them cannot even rest until they tell the boys themselves. These days I can't even go say brother when are you getting married don't you see you're growing [Music] the sister is meaning something you see it's lust it's perverted love it's not genuine all right are you following me now okay then that's last for another man's wife. Then comes filth. After that, then comes filth. You've had the same sex marriages and all that kind of thing. And they say they love each other. What kind of love? Filth. It just becomes perverted. Others they say they love their animal and they love them, marry them and even be with all their wealth to them. It's just perversion in the name of love. These people can cry and they're genuine. You can see it's real. It is real. They're not faking it. Lust is real. I hope I'm not talking to rocks and angels. If you have ever had lust, you know it is real. It's not a joke. You feel it literally. I know it because I've felt it before. You feel it. It pains you so heavy. I love that person. If they refuse make it real, right? It it is not a joke. So is the love you have for your wife is real. You love you can even shoot somebody who touches I can shoot them. Why? Because you are you are jealous because of love. But you see even the the the perversion the other perversions is also called love. You find someone buying a prostitute. They don't buy any prostitute. They buy the one they love. Right? So it's a love perverted love perversion. But you see, brother Bam says it's all coming from the original. There is an original love, brother, sister. It's called divine love. It's called love. Praise God. But all of this kind of love had a beginning. But when that real genuine love of God that I've been talking about comes into the human being. How does it come into the human being? It comes by the new birth. In this we know that you are pass from death to life if you have love for one another. This kind of love can only come into your heart by the new birth. Being born again, it had no beginning, you would have no end. You are the son of God. You are the daughter of God. And your affections are on things above. Love would make you shoot a man for insulting your wife. But love would make you pray for his lost soul. That's the difference. Oh, may God give us that. Praise God. Many times filth is mistaken for love. And it says young Christian, a young Christian the other day, bunch of people. I don't say they are not Christians. But in looking at some pictures, Christian women, Christian men, all lovable one and around one another in bathing suits, in swimming. It is they said, "Oh, that's real love. That's real filth. It's not love. Love is expressed different from that. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That you know they do it in those churches. You know which song they sing before they say &gt;&gt; before they tell you argue your sister in church &gt;&gt; song leader which song do they sing bring songs bring this song then go around go around go around &gt;&gt; there is a song they bring and then they move around to look for who they and then they say okay now hug your brother hug your sister and they said one who is close to you. No, no. They said the one who is close suddenly you'll always sit next to the person that you love. That's lust. And then when the song comes, they call it free love. In many of these our churches today, audition churches. Free love. Okay. Hug your sister. Hug your brother. And then you find Brother Dixon. Say love. I love her. Is that love? That's lust. That's filth. That's why even in our church, if you've noticed, we do not hug sisters. Sisters don't hug brothers. Brother said this. He said, "No matter what you claim to be, brother, if you're filled with the Holy Ghost, you will not do that." Because you see, when you do that, as long as you are a man and you have blood in your veins, you will not feel the same way afterwards. Therefore, we don't do it. We love our sisters. Praise God. I have 20 minutes now. Let's see in Matthew 26. I I thought I will finish but I'm seeing almost I may not finish. But let let's see. Matthew 26:31. Then said Jesus unto them. Let's try to take an example of somebody who thought they had love. And all of you shall be offended because of me this night. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered. But after that, I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee." Peter answered and said unto him, though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet I will not be offended. I will never be offended. until I will follow you. Some of you brothers, you are here. You are looking at me either before or now. I don't know. You are very busy promising God like that and you never fulfilled it. When they ask you what happened, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what was on me, but But but I'm no longer feeling like that. But when they were telling you, you are saying you don't know how I'm feeling. You don't like Samson came and he told his parents daddy mommy get me that girl. Get her for me. Marry her for me. They said no my brother our son that is a Philistine you cannot marry for unbeliever I love her get off for me so if you are like that and you are loving an unbeliever and you I'm not saying it is not genuine it is genuinely taking you to hell it is a feeling which can wear off and I assure you after getting married to them then real life will happen and in real life you don't need that feeling only you need more than that feeling you need true genuine God in your life because it's the only thing that can keep your marriage together. Praise God. Samson thought he loved each other with Delila, but he was shocked to see what the was doing. I am sure we don't see him calling about Delila, talking about her afterwards. the the love he had for her disappeared the moment he was betrayed the moment she betrayed him. But if it was God is love, we would have seen Samson on the pillars saying the liar come and help me my love let us kill this Philistine. But he was there dying by himself. He didn't even remember her. He remembered God is a true love. He said, "Oh God, let me die with my enemy. Give me this one more chance once more, Lord." And maybe you are also entangled with a delina. Oh, some other unbelieving, you know, boy. Let me tell you, you will wake up when it's too late. And we see here that Peter also felt that way. Jesus said all of you will leave me. Peter said me maybe Julius and somebody but me. You are joking. Where you go I will go. Even if they take you to b you I will go. We shall be together. Jesus. Me. Me. Look at me. Trust me. Some of you want us to trust you like that. We know better not to trust you like that. Because the Bible says it has to be a man who trust in a man. Let me tell you, don't trust your fellow human being. Trust in God. He can never fail you because God is love. If you have God in your heart and the person has God in their heart, you don't love them but you love the God in them. Hallelujah. [Music] Then you get married to them. Then love will be wonderful. Amen. Amen. Jesus said unto him, "Verily, I say unto you, Peter, this night before the you will deny me three times." Peter said unto him, "Though I should die, Jesus, forget about what you're saying. Though I should die with you, &gt;&gt; I will not deny thee. And the disciples heard it. They said, "Even me, Jesus. Even me. Even me. Even me. I have a question for you." Do you think they were lying? They were not lying. They were not joking. They not playing around. They meant it. That little boy who is telling you, "I love you." And you can even shed a few tears. I told you I can't even sleep because the love I have for you, it's very genuine. Can't you see? I'm even losing weight. I love you very much. They are genuine. Like Peter was genuine. He said, "Even if others leave your own, even if I should die, He was feeling like that. That was human life. But afterward something happened. Amen. Vers 69. Now Peter sat without in the palace. And Adams came unto him, saying, "Thou also was with Jesus of Galilee. But he was now seeing how Jesus was being beatenh who &gt;&gt; you don't know what you are saying me with Jesus me Peter &gt;&gt; verse 71 &gt;&gt; and when he was gone out where is the scripture and when he was gone out into the porch. Another maid saw him and he said unto them that were there, this fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth. And again he denied with an oath. I do not know this man. I swear I've never seen this man. What happened to him? Brother Peter, God bless you. Oh, you have two Peters there. Another Peter was not responding. This is what Peter did. Don't do it. And again he denied with an oath. I do not know this man. And after a while came on him the unto him they that stood by. And they said to Peter, Surely thou also are one of them. You are one of them. Your speech betrays you. You are speaking as a believer. Even your tongue the way you are not cursing like us. If you are one of them, you used to attend DVM. You are one of them. You you you are following him. You are speaking like this. Then Peter now said, "Oh, the problem is my speech. All right. Then began he to curse and to swear saying, "I know not the man." Now I don't know how to cuss. I would cuss a little bit. But he started cursing. I don't even know how the words came. He began speaking all the vulgar words you could think of. And as soon as he said that, Peter remembered. He remembered the words of Jesus. He quickly learn to the wall. He said, "Master, father, have mercy. Remember me. Forgive me." And that's what a child of God does when you falter. Praise God. What was wrong with Peter? Peter was not the seed of of the serpent, but Peter was not born again here. Peter did not have the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost. You cannot have perfect life. Hallelujah. Praise God. You needed to see Peter. you know, Jesus, you know, rose again and died and rose again. But you see, before they met with the disciples, Peter is one of those that said, "You know what? After repenting, after everything, Jesus has now died and rose again." Peter said, "For me, I'm going to go back and fish." He went back to fish. Think about it. This is a man who is unstable without the Holy Ghost. If if you if you don't have the Holy Spirit, let let us face it. If you don't have the Holy Spirit, it will be difficult for you to be stable in your Christianity. You can never have pure love that I've talked about. It is impossible. You need to have that experience. You need to have the hunger. You go in prayer. You ask God to fill you with the Holy Ghost because it is possible. But you are not filled yet. And that's why you are the way you are. This is how Peter was. But Peter went in the presence on the day of Pentecost. You know before that Jesus comes and meets him and and and he found them fishing. Imagine and as a good shepherd he still picked him and he brought them back again started eating with them. This is after the resurrection I don't have time to read it in the book of John 21. And then at that time you know he tells them he asks them three questions. Each time he ask them the same question. Peter, Peter, lovest thou me? Lovest thou me? Lovest thou me? Because he was not filled with the Holy Ghost. He was even offended because of the way he was asked. So why are you asking me all this time? But wait until Peter received the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost. That was the defining moment. All fear left, the bad behaviors left, the old envy left, those things left. And Peter was new. He did not now have any more fear. He could preach the word without fear of favor on the day of Pentecost. And they baptized 3,000 in the name of our Lord Jesus. Think about it, friends. But yet, Peter confessed love. Give me that, brother. This is just going to be um I'm just climaxing here right now. You see, Peter confessed love to Jesus, but he didn't have it yet. So, you can confess love, but you may not have it yet. You need to come to Pentecost. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Can I try to make this a little bit bigger, bigger, bigger? Just make it bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. Okay. So, this is the stage of a perfect man. And I don't have time to go through everything. But you try and and listen to the message, the stage of a perfect man. You see, um, the prophet lays it down. This is taken out of second Peter rather second Peter chapter 1. We will not read there. But then he he gives he gives us the building uh uh uh um the the the levels of the building of the body of Christ. But you see what I wanted where I wanted to get to show you is the capstone is love. The bond of perfection. You see it says building this monument, building this sture. It starts off with the foundation stone, faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, posess, brotherly kindness. Now what does it do? Then we are waiting for the headstone which is love. For God is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things right in here, right in here. You see, I I got in between all these works in here and here these little waves come. What was that? The Holy Ghost coming down through Christ Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is above all this welding this together building a perfect church for the capstone to capital. The dynamics of this church will be revealing of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body. But when that headstone and the body unites together, the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up. That's exactly like that. Even the head, the dead, the stay in Christ for hundreds of years ago, they will rise in the beauty of his holy name. And it has lifted me now safe. My love lifted me. Lift. Love. Lifted me. Love. Lifted me. Oh love lifted me when nothing went nothing else. Oh love lifted me. Love lifted me. [Music] Oh love lifted me. Oh, and nothing went and nothing else. You have all lifted me. If you feel you do not have this love, remember the only way is that you receive the Holy Spirit. Why don't you take a moment and ask God to remember you now? [Music] This is a so moment, I always know one thing that when the word is preached, God comes behind that word to vindicate that is the truth. So, I'd like you to believe that God is here. There's no reason for you to be bitter in your heart. When a person becomes bitter in their heart, they drive away every beat of the spirit of God. Your home becomes bitter. You become toxic in your words. People begin to dislike you. People begin to feel there's an attitude around you. Because you do not have this love because where this love is not there is bitterness. There is hatred. Remember we are going into the rapture. That's our goal. But how is your heart? What is the state of your heart? What about at your workplace? Are you the salt of the earth? Have you been an example? If only God can give you love, you'll bring many souls to the kingdom because they will talk to you and they will test. they will see that salt. I wonder if each of us can have a moment of real soul prayer, talking to the Lord. I'm talking over this issue with you because you know your situation. In such moment I expect everybody to be reverent. If you could please close your eyes, kneel somewhere, lift up your hand, stand somewhere, whatever it is, but talk to the Lord with all sincerity and say, "Lord, I need you to fill me. I'm asking you to feel because I want to have this love that men shall know I am your disciple. Lord help me run in this race. While the pianist plays and the organists, let each of us go in prayer now and speak to the Lord. [Music] Oh Lord Jesus, [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] when I needed to forgive those who hurt me. [Music] I couldn't do it even to those that haunt me. [Music] But when his grace found me so wretched, poor and blind, I couldn't help him but to say I forgive when I needed to forgive all those who hurt me. me. I couldn't do it even to those that haunt me. But then his grace found me so wretched, poor, and blind. I couldn't help it but to say I forgive. I am free from the castle of tomorrow. Now I am free from the sins of my past. I have Jesus who has changed my whole life. Praise God. I am free. Praise the Lord. I am free. Oh, when I needed to forgive all those who hurt me, I couldn't do it even to those that haunt me. But then his grace just found me. so wretched and blind. I couldn't help it but to say I forgive. So now oh I am free from the cancel of tomorrow. Hallelujah. Well, I am free from the sins of the past. Well, I know I have Jesus. For he has changed my whole life. [Music] Oh, I am free. Praise the Lord. I am free. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Touching Jesus is all that really matters. Let us sing it together, saints. And your life will never be the same. There is only only one way to touch. [Music] People hurt us, but then we died. We no longer live. So we no longer hold any cry. That's the level we want to get to where Jesus, the love of Jesus can be shared abroad in our hearts where we can truly see families united, homes united, believers united, truly and genuinely loving each other with the love of God. [Music] And even here, Lord, before we go, perhaps there is somebody who has made a resolution, I'm going to let everything go, I open my heart for the love of God. that even before they leave this place, Lord, that they will be able to meet somebody that hurt them or somebody that they hurt and truly apologize as a Christian gentleman, Christian men and women, as we have heard in the world today, that love beareth all things, [Music] endureth all things, believeth all things that a brother will come and tell a brother I am sorry and a brother will take it and receive it with all their heart. Perhaps somebody that is out of here that they will call their husband or their wife and truly forgive them. Lord, we know that the world will hate us nonetheless, but that does not change who we are. We cannot allow the world to bring us to their level because their level is hatred. Their level is revenge. Their level is all these worldly kind of things. But our level is God. The Bible says we are seated in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. A place where we are walking in the realm of the supernatural, where God is love and God is in us and we are in God. A place where we will love everybody. Oh, this Holy Ghost gospel will make us love everybody. everybody if someone is not to that level Lord. My prayer Lord is that you would bring us to that to to an extent where they asked brother Billy Paul what's your greatest the greatest miracle of your father [Music] said you could not differentiate his enemies from his friends [Music] I discern and I ask myself am I at that level Yet is my brother, my sister here today at that level. Yet we realize that Lord love does not mean that we will not get angry, but that we should forgive. We should not hold things in our hearts. We should let go and let go. Father, that's my prayer that you will surely come in our hearts today. That little broken up sermon being preached today will mean a world to somebody. Granted, I pray be with us until we meet again in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, brother. Shalom. We'll meet again on Wednesday. God bless you. Get this. [Music] Love. I have love. Wonderful love. Every time I think about Jesus, I feel love, love, love. I feel love, love, love. I feel love. Oh, every time I think about Jesus, I feel love, love. Yes. I feel good, good, good. I feel good.

Oh yes, this is my command and that you love one another on your joy. Make me worship divine. Oh, what a you Jesus is a friend when she friendship be Jesus. [Music] Oh, what a blessing for you.
