hearts will be blessed we shall be encouraged and we do not know when you are coming is is here but we know it is here soon prepare to take your chemo camera granted father screw it out as we commit the reading of your word and the preaching of the same into your hands in the name of jesus christ i mean i just want to greet you all once again in the name of our lord jesus christ christian uh i know that uh some people they need to sing for two hours to get into the spirit many others but it's not so with the bride of christ the bride of christ gets into the spirit as soon as they hear the word and uh i do not know why you are keeping your videos off she videos does it mean you also wanted me to put mine off so i'm requesting if you your phone is good and your network is good network or your laptop whatever it is that you are using your computer uh switch on your video take a quick video that's the purpose of us using zoom zoom so that we can see one another pretty much servicing the twitter so that uh you know zoom is different from youtube zoom yeah yeah look youtube because youtube those are the people who don't want to be in the service youtube i gotta beat that's why you have to put on your videos and stream via youtube so i'm requesting you and someone will say maybe they are not they are not prepared but how can you go in the service when you're not prepared [Applause] actually this being our first service ingredient to get into your service i would just like to uh maybe give you a little guidance on how to do it usually wake up as if you are going preparing yourself as if you are going to church prepare yourself [Music] uh well i see that uh uh this uh we have some people who have switched on their video what do i have introverted videos are well i do not know maybe they do not use their laptop [Music] but i think they are using a phone i can see them god bless you come about well while we are while we are still standing if we can stand on our feet [Music] let us read in the description so the ones who are off i am not entirely sure whether you are following obama amen but let us uh read yes i can see you now brother peter god bless you guys amen so we are now reading the scripture together and the work of first chronicles hiv uh brother i do not know maybe brother joe well i don't know if you reached out to brother ruanga's family but the martinis family was not able to try but we were not able to get them looped but that brother martin is away he is definitely was locked up in nakasaki but he will be here maybe this week [Music] you might also want to find out what happened with that and maybe uh guide her to the youtube channel youtube so but all right god bless you uh we are reading first quran qur's chapter 14. verses uh eight olynyk amen and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel and beginning from vast age amen and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel all the philistines went up to sick david and david heard of it and went out against them brother shem and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of refine and david inquired of god saying shall i go up against the philistines and without deliver them into my hand and the lord said unto him go up for i will deliver them into the in hand so they came up to bow perism and david smote them there then david said god has broken in upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters therefore they call the name of that place baal perezm and when they had left their god there david gave a commandment and they were banned with fire all right you can read until verse 12 for now i'll have a phrase [Music] [Music] until verse 18 amen and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley i have a philosophy therefore david inquired again of god and god and god said unto him go not up after them turn away from them and come up pawn them over against the mulberry trees and it shall be when thou it shall be when thou shalt uh all right go ahead verse 14. all right verse 15 and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the multavi trees then thou shalt go out of battle for god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines amen [Music] 16 commanded him and they smote the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gaza and the fame of david went out into all the lands and the lord brought the fear of him upon all now what i'm speaking on this morning i'm speaking on inquiring of god [Applause] [Applause] our god our faith amen i mean our god our faith is not just a god seeker to understand he is the lord of hospitals and he is mighty [Applause] uganda and when the first things that david was anointed king over all of israel all day uh we had verse 14 verse 14 yeah yeah and god said that to him [Music] [Music] lost the audio there i said that we had this in our family altar and uh we found out that the enemies of david they did not attack him until the bible says and the philistines went up to sick david and and and david uh well uh the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel would have is scared of you more than you are scared of you sit on ya [Music] that sickness is more scared of you than you are scared of her your problem is more scared of you than you are scared of it [Applause] that's why the prophet said that if the true church shall know who she is and what she stands for an invisible army which cannot be defeated and it never fears that they just stand [Applause] [Applause] because remember saturn is just the feedback but first we need to know who we are we need to know what we stand for our values somewhere else here's [Applause] we found out that the philistines came went out to seek david but david had a witch hallelujah and went out against them immediately he prepared himself to go ok but look at verse 9 and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of the fame another philosophy never seen that h1 virtually fighting you know they always love fighting in the valleys so they went and spread themselves strategically in the valley of the frame back in an eraser name of a foreign and and david knowing that his enemies are out against him he knew i also have to be strategic to be a strategic fighter not just to be a fighter but i have to be strategic [Applause] how many [Applause] [Applause] because the general is the one that struck strategizes the art of war that's all connections to overcome angular you don't need to be super spiritual to overcome something the only thing you need amen is the commander uh your general i need generally who is your world captain i know you don't just go to fight because you you have a spear oh because you have a gun so we have a lot of soldiers physically speaking in our nation and in every nation [Music] they have to apply those guns strategically a moon was because of some magazines hallelujah you have to apply their guns strategically they have to wait for a commander indeed [Applause] it's not much about who is shooting [Music] he was the king anointed as the king yes remember the bible says we are kings and priests so we too we are anointed we are anointed to the name of god and inspired by our god who is the original lord amen amen so the bride of jesus christ is anointed i'm glad he is christian [Music] [Applause] we must be anointed by the word of god [Applause] just like david was anointed to take his place the devil comes out again i was standing at you when they heard that david was anointed against david going through problems amen the devil is out against you because amen do not fear this disease if it comes to you but you already who said that coffee 19 will not come to believers it will attack even the believers more than the unbelievers but god promised don't understand he will take those sicknesses of the egyptians away from us but how can he take it away from you when you're not fighting you have to be in the battle are you not bad i'm going to tell you to be [Applause] you see some people are preaching the gospel a kind of gospel that says that uh you know god loves you so much and when you become saved you you only prosper there is no problems among [Applause] i was [Applause] [Music] david he knew as a good fighter yeah you don't move until you inquire of your commands even if you feel your enemies about to finish you up is see why is it that many christians fail to live a christian life you know because we we think that faith means that you you just have to work yourself up to do something you know faith means if i don't have a car i must fight and i must do this and i must ensure that i have a kind in one day is inquiring brains they the understanding hallelujah so we know this if it goes to god and inquires of him when a problem comes to you and your family in your home in your marriage [Applause] he said shall i go up against the philistines and will will you deliver them into my hands the lord said unto him hallelujah but god answered him hallelujah amen and the lord said unto him when you say he will say we'll get up when you speak he will speak [Applause] [Music] you can just feel that you pray again so that you can people you you know you will be able to say i i prayed don't do it as a customer it is impossible to please god upon revelation [Music] bound to answer that prayer your name is based on revelation and god fails to he is of war with the turnaround the mighty god direct you and guide you so you can be able to overcome your enemies let me just go and attack my enemy like this but maybe god wants you to wait a little longer maybe you want to go to your enemy with all the spears and the machetes and the and the guns but god wants you to go empty-handed you have a [Music] [Music] go up yamboka for i will deliver them into their enhancements i said god now [Applause] as good as doing something when you know that the lord is with you don't do something because you feel right something because you're so talkative do something because somebody else has done it do something because you have been quiet of the lord god has spoken to you and i will get an hour i don't fear that when i inquire of him you'll not speak to me i don't know is [Music] [Music] [Applause] david sickness [Music] in your mind let your [Applause] oh in upon my enemies my by my hand like the breaking forth of waters they call the name of that place bioperism [Music] when you overcome your enemies you will not say my understanding is [Applause] [Applause] anointed [Applause] because the lord is and then the scripture says and when they have left their gods there the chinese and their gods remain there goats these are the gods of the philistines don't don't don't begin to worship the gods of the philistines about the bible bow down to the god of the first whatever they when god overcame his enemies [Music] [Music] is that's why when this world comes to your heart hallelujah [Music] the philistines philosophy came back again never come on that day and they spread themselves never seen that in the valley a church david did not say that only because i overcame last time you can do [Music] [Music] does it mean that when your enemies came against you you know sometimes i'm amazed you can put it for now i'm amazed sometimes you remember that woman who was always running after uh brother paul [Applause] [Applause] does it mean that god is not going to work till again sometimes god you may pray about certain things in your life and god may leave them for a while but don't forget is the almighty god he's the one that knows all things yeah he knows how to fight i'm an angry most important he knows how to win i'm a new quarantine doesn't just fight come on and find out that david [Applause] [Music] a strategy of battle in korea quran returning to because his purpose not just to fight and what does the bible say let's proceed but he said turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees you remember how god strategically defeated the gibeonites when they were attacking videos is the seal the same god of strategy i couldn't take a king this time he never wanted just to overcome the philistines but he he wanted to give them a surprise attack one the god of israel he's a living god he's the lord of hosts he's a god of battles [Applause] where is the name of the lord amen he said now to ask something and you're not willing to do what he will tell you don't even bother coming to him to encourage him give [Applause] and it shall be when thou shalt hear astound of going in the top of the mulberry trees [Applause] you may not even [Music] amen the only thing you have to do is believe me i'm telling oh [Music] oh it was not the messenger's voice [Applause] [Music] hallelujah message [Applause] come on [Applause] [Music] and they went on and it shall be when i shall hear the sound i keep listening to a different sound um i keep listening but it said i'm putting that for a different sound it's the sound of war the most it's the sound that has declared and and told us to go and match onto battle angry generically can you give it to me brother yes all right you can just project it oh you have to forgive the brother just attacked him but you you brought it properly just when you bring it just project it so you can we can uh all right can you can you help him to project the song my my my my amen it's a message of victory brother yeah just click right there yes we hear the words but i keep listening never [Music] the sound of the bride [Music] i can't believe oh [Music] the sound of [Applause] keep listening for a different side which said i played the difference can we sing this all together oh but i keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that john saw coming down with the sound of the bride being united with a group or i keep listening yes i keep listening for a different sound and when you hear the sound in the mulberry trees where you can hear the sound in the marble hallelujah of the hour [Music] [Applause] [Applause] a foreign it is great if god is in it if you go in jesus christ oh do you want to sing that cross one more [Music] [Music] if you go
