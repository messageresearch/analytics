Jesus name amen amen may give him a clap of Praise amen amen happy to see those who have met it [Music] tonight of you who may join us later on to just take our Bibles this evening amen amen I'm happy to see you my friend God bless you so we while we are standing if you can open in the Book of Joshua of course um sometimes we do minister to the Saints at evening light Tabernacle and this is one of those kind of services and when we do that they broadcast that on their Zoom service and it takes about an hour so uh we shall be one hour in the preaching today okay so I send the greetings to the Saints at evening light bright light bright on Zoom God bless you amen now we go to the Book of Joshua chapter [Music] 24 I'm going to speak on something that is uh the Holy Spirit just uh uh whispered in my ears and it was just a phrase the need of this hour and I may not explain everything on how I received it but we just we just right into it44 now there far fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord [Music] so we are looking at a time when Israel uh possessed had already promised possessed the promised land and by this time most of the battles they had already fought and they had already tested on the full F Promises of God they had left the Wilderness behind them they had left the Red Sea behind them they had possessed Jericho and other cities you know they had fought against many people and they had won most of these batt they had fought with the amorites with the parites with the canites with the Hees with the hites jeites with the gages and many other groups and you know when you read very well when you read the chapter 24 of Joshua God kept on reminding them how many battles he won for them so in other words God kept on reminding Israel that none of those battles you won because of your own making it is I that made you win it is I that brought the victory to you he had even told them that you you never build cities but I gave you cities you know God has a way of doing his own things but when it comes to Israel he promised them a land flowing with milk and honey you see at the time that he the promise was given there were already other people in that land and those people were already building those people were already owning these things they were making it greater and greater but God came down to somebody and he promis them he said I'll give you all that I'll give you everything in it praise the name of the Lord did you know that God has a way of taking the wealth of the UN and giving it to the faithful so in other words it behoves us as Christian to really be faithful to really be sincere you know there is a need in this and this is what I want to speak on the need of this house all the Jews that were not sincere God never allowed them to cross over God never allowed them to test of the good of the land but now we see those that who were sincere they got to this land but after they had you know after God had warn for them all the victories after they had overcome the Wilderness after they had crossed the Red Sea and they had possessed all the cities they now slowly started to leave their sincerity they started to walk away from truth in their service to the Lord there is something I do not know whether you will call it a preaching or an Evangelistic sermon or a pastor someone but something that God has laid on my heart to share with you this evening there is a need of this the Christians of today you the ones that profess Christ there is a great need of this amen and these people you know how they God had been there for them God had been faithful with them God had taken them through everything but at the end of it all they started thinking it was their strength it was their wisdom it was their power it was their Art of War and so God now through Joshua he comes to them and he says fear the lord and I'm speaking to you tonight fear the lord and he told them serve him in sincerity and I tell you tonight serve him in sinity we have a lot of people that are serving God Amen in the message churches amen especially our younger generation but we have very few who are serving him in sincerity we have very few singers who are sincere we have very few musicians who are sincere we have very few preachers who are sincere we have very few believers who are sincere but yet they claim to believe the message of if there is something that God really respects if there is something that really God loves it is one and it is called [Music] sincerity and today we are going to speak about it as the need of this amen many Believers after God delivers and justifies them when all enemies are now under their feet now they say we now know the message we have now left our denominations we now have received the prophet of the hour we now know the message of the hour we now have all the books we have all the T you know we now have a good church we have a good pastor you know people have reached a place where now they are no longer sincere they are in a place where they are believers by name actually now you will ask many people who is going to the Rapture and they will tell you Believers of the message but I ask you the same question tonight who is going in the Rapture who is going in the Rapture who is going in the Rapture I do not want amen I want to hear your answer who is going in the [Music] Rapture did you no it has come to a place where Believers don't actually know who is going the rupture many of you were almost telling me you or maybe you were thinking of someone perf now let me tell you you must have an answer whether or not you are going to as a matter of fact it must be you you an individual you must make your calling an election sh that hour was to come now are you ready if you are not then you not sincere because if you are a believer of the message which is supposed to prepare you for the coming of the Lord then the question is are you sure you are going if you're not sure you are going not a sincere [Music] believer we have all the message we have all the tapes we have good preachers we good churches that's all good amen the need of this amen sincity before God is serving God with sincity he serving God with truth preachers are not the only servants brother if you would give me more sound he preach not the only servants no everyone is a servant you serve God by the way you believe you serve God by the way you you you live your life and many Believers now have come to a place where they feel delivered when they F justify when all enemies are now under their feet and they they become blessed they and they become increased and when they become richer in material wealth they start to lower the bar they start to become insincere in their service to God many people have not seen them when they going through a terrible time in their life pray so much they seek after God they sincere before God and when you know they attain what they were praying for then they are no longer where they used to be I believe we do not find a time to pray because we are [Music] needy we should not make prayer as a matter of begging we don't pray because we are miserable we don't pray because we you know we need so much from God he has given us everything we need amen by his word we have everything we need why then should we pray we pray even to have a relationship with him amen we go before him amen as a habit amen of developing and building our relationship with him because he came down from heaven so that he can purchase us and therefore we belong to him our souls are his but he wants to have fellowship with us and our prayer must always be an act of Fellowship not an act of asking and so I ask then what is sincerity and I I was reading something and it really moved me said sincerity is the quality of being free from pretense deceit is a quality of being free from pretense free from deceit free from hypocrisy if you heard it say Amen sincere people represent themselves they represent themselves honestly they represent themselves in their verbal Expressions you know honestly in their verbal Expressions they are free from double talk all right say something here say something else here you know in their ver Expressions they have no gossip they are free from double talk they are free from Gossip they are also free from [Music] flattery and all embellishment decoration you know decorating you know you met many times meet people who you know can really talk so well about you and you know speak everything good about you know big words you know because they want something from you not because they're sincere so usually sincere people in their expressions you never find them you know flattering flattering is not flattery is like you find that's why you find many marriages in trouble but when you go in public especially if that man knows that he was having a problem with his wife at home when he gets a has to have a microphone that's when he will really flatter her oh she's the best of the best oh she's been with me she's powerful bam said if you really want to know if a man is Born Again ask his wife because his wife knows the real true character of this man did you say Amen to that sisters your your expression will be free of Gossip free of flattery free of double talk you will be honest you will not be having hypocrisy you know you'll be free from pretense free from deceit you will not be a hypocrite you will set the truth truth and the Bible places a high value on sincerity praise the name of the Lord sincerity cannot be overemphasized the need of this is more sincerity if Believers can be more sincere let me tell you we will have blessings beyond measure our churches will grow and grow and grow and no man can limit it or stop it you know Christians and Believers would grow spiritually you would overcome many things you know many Roman Catholics more sincere than believers Pastor what are you talking about a Roman Catholic will come before a priest Tell Him Father I have SE what have you done my daughter I've killed someone Roman Catholic will do that you tell him I have committed a father pray for me and you know the Reverend father will ask questions and you can be 100% sure that all those answers are going to be 100% correct because these people are sincere but talked about being sincere and being wrong these people are sincere but they are wrong in their ology so they sincerely wrong we the Believers of this message oh Hallelujah hallu we have the truth we have the absolute truth this let me tell you this message we believe is is not just one God it's not just baptism in Jesus name it is more than just Holiness it's more than rules of do and this message is really the truth this message is the way you cannot go to the Rapture in this generation if you have not received this message of the hour how many believe that and can this message is the way in this generation for the children of Goden to be able to be raptured and let me tell you if only we can be sincere we shall be sincerely right Hallelujah but many hold the truth insincerity stay in church they know that they need help they know they need to overcome certain things but they cannot seek for help they can even ask anyone to pray for them they cannot even go to the pastor for help they can go the deons for help because maybe they fear the deacons or maybe they fear the pastor maybe they think when I go for help then maybe they will embarrass me or tell somebody else about what I have done so you be you decide to become insincere because you fear the Deon may be insincere maybe the pastor may be insincere maybe the brother may be insincere imagine if each of us was really dead sincere the devil would not have a place Among Us the devil would not have a place and that's why I'm saying sincerity is the need of this house if we were more sincere you would have less and less battles between Ministries and ministers because we have a calling to bring light to the world where Darkness has filled the Bible says gross Darkness has covered the people gross Darkness has covered the Earth so where is the light but a prophet came and preached a sermon and he said there is a man here who can turn on the light what is this message this is is the light are shown in the darkness but people are not sincere having received this light you know if you were sincere you know you would have a good motive if you are sincere you have a good objective you never do anything to hurt your brother you never do anything to Hur your sister your objective will be One how can I help them how can I help them come closer to God how can I help them they overcome what they fighting but what do we have we have people who are not sincere God help us friends when the angel of the Lord came to our Prophet William Bram William Bram do you know the thing he told he told him how he had been commissioned how he was born for a purpose how he would take a gift of Divine Healing to the people of the world how no demon would stand before him how he would heal the sick Open the Eyes of the Blind and God would use him powerful but that commission even though it was predestinated it was based on one thing sincerity so if he did not become sincere those things will not have happen there are many potential that you have but if you're not sincere with God you will live in a life of untapped resources [Music] brother bam said in a message the angel of God a supernatural being come walking into the room an angel said he would he was sent from the presence of God he said if you get the people to believe you if you would be sincere when you pray not nothing shall stand before you nothing shall stand before your not even cancer but why do things stand before our prayer why do you have many unanswered prayers let me give you an answer you are not sincere enough before God there I will give you two instances of sincerity in brother Bam's Ministry things that you would call maybe the small things one time he had tax issues where he was asked by the you know by the tax people to pay a lot of money and he didn't have the money and so um when the tax man called he was in the house with his wife he no her they're calling brother samel he told his wife pick that call and tell them I'm not in and he went out was he in would you may say yes or no but the fact was he was not in the house but the truth is he was telling a lie because he was around so it depends on your level of sincerity on what you will think was he right or he was wrong was he in or he was out he was out yes but sincerely he was in and the wife said I'm sorry butam is not in is not in or whatever she said I said okay we'll call later and then he came back in and later on shortly after there came a mother with a dying child and he is a prophet of God with an anointing of God with a commission to pray for the sick and nothing would stand before his that was from God but remember there was a condition he would be sincere so when he came to pray for the child the spirit of God told him you cannot pray for the child you are a liar a liar a liar I lied he was condemned he was convicted I'm he did not go to return the call he took his car and drove many miles to the office of this man and he looked him in the eyes said sir I know you've you've trusted me all these years and you know me to be a faithful but I'm here to make something right what is it Mr rever Bram what is happening I know you you one of the finest I've seen he said and the man looked at him and he said Mr Bram I've trusted you all these years but what you have done today has made me have more confidence in you what is that brother bam was deadly sincere everything he did he was sincere and then he went went back and the child the mother the child was waiting and he prayed for the child and the child was he praise God he was sincere and that's why God would use him in the magnitude he used in and many places when he would be asked a question and if he didn't know he would say I do not know was sincerity he was a good example but many Believers we've lowered the bars we are not as sincere as we are supposed to be and and I'll quote you something here from the message the prophet elishah and brother that's the matter with the church today the reason we don't see Visions how many believe in seeing visions how many believe in tongues how many believe in interpretation of T I take it that those who are not lifting up their hands they don't believe in it but I'll tell you here we believe it we believe in Visions we believe in spiritual Dre we believe in speaking in Tong we believe in interpretation of Tong we believe in prophetic utterances we believe in the Supernatural we believe in Divine Healing can I hear the believer say Amen we sure believe those things and we have seen many of those in our little assembly here and he says the reason we don't see Visions have just a little narrow-minded thought is because we don't pray long enough we don't do something long enough until the spirit of God comes into our M we don't T in his in his presence we are never sincere we are in the house of God but our heart is somewhere else we are in the house of God but we are asking ourselves when the singing will stop people are not sincere enough desire to go in his presence to open their hearts and in truth to say oh God I want you to come and per through my come and burn all the DRS away spirit of God people are not sincere enough he says we use to sing the oldfashioned songs till tears run down their cheeks and seen as God say even before the preacher got to the platform people are already crying people already falling down people already shouting why because of singing but why doesn't singing move them anymore because people are no longer sincere why do we have drye prayers because people are no longer sincere why can't we sing until we are moved by the power because we are no longer sincere why do we sit and hear the word and the word doesn't move our spirit and our soul because we are not sincere we lack sincerity that's the problem of the Lan church and that's why when the angel of the Lord came down he told the prophet of God you must be sincere but today he says we have just the old ritual we have the cut and dried program you know we have to sing one song and give offerings and and you know sing another song invite one special song invite the preacher you know program is good but let me tell you we believe in church order how many can say Amen to that we believe in church order but we don't believe in closing the Holy Spirit out amen that's why even sometimes I've noticed here that the song leer may say everybody sing one song don't sing another song after that and then another person comes up and maybe sings a worship song and people go in prayer let me tell you now let me guide you whenever that thing happen songer whoever it is you are on the congregation please let the Holy Spirit move when you notice that God is moving it may take our time it may be out of our program but if it is God moving let God move because we believe in sincerity and if we are in sincere if we are sincere enough in our hearts we will desire to be carried into his presence program cannot replace the program of the Holy Spirit we got to go through this that we say and the other I'm afraid we are grieving the spirit of God away from us don't you think so he says and he says I remember the old nights of the methodists or reading of it when they first come here meaning in America as and johnley and them when they were called holy lawers themselves and he says now you Methodist in these fine big churches don't want to believe that but they were holy lawers why did they now listen why did they call them holy la is because when they would sing they begin to sing they begin to praise God they begin to hear the word power of God would come and you find women old women young just falling down rolling and crying do we still believe those kind of things or is it strange Among Us is it out of order and your pastor your founder joh wi was a great believer in Divine Healing too he even anointed his horse with oil after it broke its leg and got onto it and rode it away that is what he did that's in his own notebook I have it yes sir he was going to pray for a woman and the horse fell and broke his leg he couldn't get the horse up and he seen the horse's leg was broke he took the cruise of oil from his pocket he anointed the horse in the oil jumped on his horse and rode away preach that in the me this church today and they will throw you out of the door but that is what is going that's what's got it says but that's what's got the wrong with you you let down the bars the ship got out and the gos got in and that's where your church God says that's exactly where we are standing today Church listen the church is standing at that place again where the Sheep has got out and the gods have come praise God I'm not a God praise God I'm a sheep a sheep is a follower amen a sheep doesn't use its own head as long as the shepherd is leading the ship follows the Sheep is only blind to other things the she follows the shepher are you not so happy that we have the shepherd of our soul Jesus Christ through his word where he leads us we follow amen can I hear where he leads us we follow what he tell us to do we do whatever is in his word we believe because he a sh to our soul what we need today he says it's not a new theology what we need today amen is a good old fashion St Paul Revival Hallelujah we need a Bible Holy Ghost back in the in among the churches and he says all the churches amen we need that all Hallelujah that amen all the Holy Ghost Revival amen where young men will be talking about prayer amen where they will be meeting and singing I remember when we first believe the message we were so much in love with God so much sincere even every after service you would go down to a brother's house amen and you know open our song books we are the song books that preed by Brother Harold in Canada and would take the song books and begin to sing these H him after him after this is how we leared them we would go there and ask them brothers teachers and then everyone would bring the one they know Hallelujah I remember some of them would sing it wrongly until someone else would come later and tell us no they don't sing it that way you listen to how they sing it and then it begins at first stanza and by the time he gets to the chorus all of you are already touched all of you already charged and he begin singing along and by the time you finish the song you know people are crying amen these things used to happen it still does happen among people who are sincere you know you begin singing what will you give what will you give in EX for your soul oh if today God should call it away what would you give in for yourself oh I want to see him look upon his face am to to sing Forever sing Grace we used to sing prayer we us to sing you all these songs the love of God let me tell you church that's that Revival we still need it Hallelujah are you listening to me young people please give me your ears tonight we still need that old Holy Ghost rival where we don't me to joke around and talk about nonsense where we meet to give each other's testimonies where we meet to sing songs of Z Hallelujah where we meet to glorify God where has that gone in our midst a Revival is not bringing something new a Revival is not saving somebody who is lost Revival is taking what we have amen and we revive it again amen let me tell you what we need in our message we need that Holy Ghost Revival where young people will go and sin to church run to the pastor run to run to somewhere oh pray for me I have SE what is catching them the Holy Ghost a set of rules and laws we are not living right because we are fearing to be called by the law we are living right because we fear God hallelujah because we used to sing songs like there is an old sing I watching you watching you every day mind the cause you pursue there is an old seeing ey watching but these days things have changed people think the doctrine will take them to Heaven you want to go to heaven friends but the need of this sinity before God can you say Amen young ladies can you say Amen young men that's the need of this house what we need today is not a new theology old fashion St Paul's Revival the Bible Holy Ghost back in among all the churches which will bring back the power of the Living God to the church again amen if you feel you are dead or sinful that you can't even say Amen in church oh let me tell you you need that Revival Hallelujah you need that Revival where you can be able to say amen and it's not from your mouth but it's from your heart where you can clap your hands and it's not from your hands but it's from your that's the whole Revival talking about a Revival which will make us right with God this message of the hour amen is come with a purpose to take us to heaven to take us to heaven and this message is going to accomplish this purpose the message cannot be denominated if you feel you unworthy or feel you imperfect don't worry we used to sing songs leave your sins for the blood to come that's why we say where will you find the blood the blood is the word just come in church say Amen oh are you hearing me this evening say Amen when you feel perfect say Amen when you feel L say Amen when you feel right say Amen when you feel like a because say Amen the power of the word comes right into your soul the word of God power to change a sin if only we can be sincere dead sincere in our heart say oh Lord I'm saying amen because I want you to change me amen but we have lowered the bars it is a very sad thing but let me tell you some of us left our denominations because we saw life in this message Hallelujah we saw life in this message I said we saw life in this message we were witnessed too and we became Witnesses and I can tell you there are thousand time thousand demons that have tried to take us down but why are we standing amen because we are witnesses that this message has power this message give overcoming power Hallelujah we were sincere we are sincere when we were wrong we went for help when we fell short we saw for prayer but how can we seek for prayer if there are no prayer warriors believer's lives of prayer is dead they have replaced prayers with with words rumors talking about one another we cannot replace prayer with these things friends it used to be that if someone had against another they brought it to them said I've heard this about you brother how are you standing till the brother would say brother you are right you are moved by the Holy Ghost pray with me and you pray with them and that will be the end of that thing it will be the end of that thing what is that Revival causes that Revival fire should never die until the coming of Jesus Christ let me tell you because we came to the message it does not mean Revival has done come into the message of the hour it only means Revival has started because we are in the bride's Revival where we believe the true word of God and we live the life of the word we to and if you're failing come we pray together if you falling short amen come we fast together come we pray together can we call upon God until he will change until he cause a Revival bring up a well in your heartu if the Pentecost can live a life of overcoming a few hundred demons how much more we that have a real truth the real word let me tell you we have the real word thereby when we believe it it has real power to cause real impact it is a sin for you to believe the message and Rel defeated life and that is the sin which cannot be forgiven because you blaspheming you are saying the word has no power but let me tell you I will take it defense for the word the word of God has power power to change power to deliver to heal Hallelujah the only thing we need in this house is more sincerity because the Bible speaks about the condition of in Revelation 3:15 I Know Thy works that you are neither cold or hot I would thou C so then because thou and neither cold nor I'll spew the out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with good and I have need of nothing and knowest not that thou Ed miserable poor blind naked this is the situation the condition of they're like the Jews or Israelites when they cross over to the promised land they like now we have need of nothing yes I know that this is speaking of theia and the bride is not but has come in church and you find many believers who where they think they need nothing they know all the message they know the Bible they can quot the scriptures offhe they can even the message offhe they they know it all you are knowing everything won't make make you anything I told you if knowledge will make anybody anything iPads laptops and they know everything your knowledge is nothing but your sincity is everything because your sincity will open a channel where the power of God will be Limitless your sincity will open a channel for God to use you power your sincity will open a channel where you will function Amen in a in a in a level where you will not be defeated was told if you are sincere if you are sincere nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer not even HIV not even any disease sincerity we need sincerity would go among Believers and he would call one two three people 4 five and even then people they would still be hard-hearted and he would call others and he would call somebody he would do a prayer but he would go among unbeliever he would just call one two people design their situation and he would say it is now milky everywhere and say now everyone that is sick receive your healing you say those in the whe stand up it wasn't him it was the people sincerity that was driving the gift the people sincity and the prophet is sincerity if you are sincere we can go to deeper Heights of the spirit let me tell what God has done for you that is just the beginning that is just the beginning if you can be more sincere wait and see what God will do you there is much more but they people I look neither cold or H the age where Christians are not straight they confus they are not on fire for God but also they not outright Sinners look condition the need of this be more sincere in everything we do be more sincere Believers be more sincere preachers be more sincere mothers be more sincere father be more sincere teachers are you hearing me be more sincere business people be more sincere doctors employees and employers even the Bible itself in the Book of Romans 129 love must be sincere love say let love verse let love be without dissimilation what is dissimilation it means concealment of one's thoughts feelings of character so in other words someone can say they love you but they conceal their real thoughts they conceal their feelings they conce their character they are pretending that is not love but the Bible says love must be sincere raise god without misrepresentation without deceit without pretense without duplication without faking without concealment without masking come on better say Amen to God without dising without hiding without hypocrisy without failing without without fific without lying to get what you want without gu without bluffing Oh Glory without Double Deal [Music] without dishonesty love must be without all these things then we can say your love is sincere in 2 Corinthians 66 it must be love and faint love and Fain un love means sincere love genuine love authentic love [Music] you know that is sincere that is genuine authentic so if you feel tonight you've been faking You' been you know you've been faking you're like I don't feel likeing today but let me try I saw something and I felt so bad it was posted by one of the young people who claims to be a believer of this message I said oh God save us unto this outward generation and this person put this on their status this should not even be anywhere among a Believers and the reason why I'm bringing it on the poit because these spirits jump from one to another and we all to rebuke them from the ppose and this this sister they said sister put this up on her on our status and just some people you know scoffing or scoffing against church people but the fact that she presented it there it means she believed in it and if she believes in it it means there are many more and that's why I need to talk about it and you find that she put this up that you know this is how people be in church worshiping God how great is our God but in reality and then they put some other things dancers of the club that in reality that's how they want to dance let me address that if that speed is in any of you here anyone listening tonight oh let me tell you love must be without effect be more sincere if you are in church and you feel like you cannot amen worship God and you're fing it come and seek assistance we will pray with you if you have a club Spirit we shall kick it out of you and you will be delivered let me tell you be set free by this message because it has power I don't need to fake My Worship if it is dancing I don't want to fake my dancing for Jesus if I'm dancing I'm dancing from my heart if I'm shouting shouting from my heart if I'm standing up and shouting and cling I'm doing it from my heart I don't need to fake because I truly love Jesus I don't care about he that doesn't what they think about me I don't care because I'm genuine my soul a part of me I don't need to fake [Music] Christianity if you're faking it why wait come ask for prayer I'm telling you God answers prayer praise God if you're staying home instead of going to church
