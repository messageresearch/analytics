difficult and not easy but we know that the god of the man of the valleys is also the god of the mountain and the god of the mountain is [Music] [Music] [Music] we have come here tonight to recognize that you have given us the gift of life [Music] and we want you to speak to us we [Music] I pray much in your name Jesus Christ amen [Music] I'd like to reach you all in the name of Jesus Christi with you I'd like you to open in the Book of Psalms 34 this is we just read one verse out of there and then we also read in the Book of Matthew foreign the righteous cry and the Lord Hearth and delivereth them out of all their troubles the Lord is now unto them that are over a broken heart and seventh church as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of them all right foreign this evening by the grace of God I'd like to ask a question and I cannot see you Brother Sam so if you can come and take the city all right so um why Christians suffer afflictions maybe to make it a question I would say why do Christians suffer afflictions [Music] do Christians suffer afflictions so why do they this so but maybe my title tonight will be in a form of a question but really a statement why Christians suffer Affliction is I know there are many who say that Christians should not suffering and that if you suffer it is a sign that God does not love you and that you are cast so tonight I'd like to get into this subject and see how much we shall be able to get into all right um and maybe I'll continue with it another time if I don't get to finish it now the sculpture this is David speaking he said many are the afflictions not some or few other afflictions but he said many are the afflictions of the righteous but then it says but the Lord delivereth him out of them all well no matter how many afflictions we will go through before we even continue on the subject we have an assurance that the Lord will deliver you from all your afflictions so Matthew 14 if you want to write down or take your Bible and read with me that will be fine amen I mean it's always good if you come to church you come with a notebook and you know a pen wherever you can make note so do some indications in your Bible so that you can be able to follow up and straight away we are beginning with verse 22 chapter 14 of Matthew and straight away Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him and to the other side while he set the multitudes away and when he had set the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch at the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were trouble saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight away Jesus spoken to them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid during such time times we only want to see demons [Music] in hard times we said a visible in Trials because in Affliction the problem is many Believers say demons so we see what we sing they expect him on Saturday they feel Spirits they do not feel see or even believe the presence of the Lord in such times they were they thought they were all alone and so they were alone in the world and it was at night so it was that they were all alone and it was uh and also the waves came at Sea um and imagine the fear they were in and it is we are strong and hungry and then they see someone walking on the water in that kind of atmosphere the only thing that the only thing they thought about is an evil spirit how can it be our God when we are suffering when we are going through this Affliction Jesus wanted them to see something he says it is how can he tell you those words when everything is good how can he speak to you such words of encouragement when everything is going around no one loves a hard time so that the Lord Can Make a known his attributes to us now there is a message in 1960 called I know and I'll take some cutting out of that okay and why does God let troubles come again harnesses he put speech in his mouth and makes it obey him soon foreign nothing can happen to you unless God permits it isn't that wonderful nothing can happen to a child of God by accident if something happens to you it means God has permitted it to happen Hallelujah I mean there is nothing can happen to your network permits it a white cheese there is no evil can come unless God permits it [Music] friends you have [Music] why doesn't it happen like that foreign [Music] you know that song was saying I'm sailing I'm sailing going to heaven yes you know [Applause] [Music] oh your husband is going to be the best foreign foreign foreign and sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were Sinners I was asking sister I think I don't okay I don't remember the name of the sister I was asking her about another sister Nina system and I asked her where is this sister that sister she came to the message things became more for her she said I think she's in the wrong place foreign [Applause] I can prove that by the vibrations god promise to Israel that they will have a land to make their parents flowing with milk and honey did he promise them did he give it to them they were fighting when they were still in the desert they went through the battle with the the Pharaoh I went through the afflictions of the Red Sea they went through the suffering of the of the River Jordan but then they crossed over into the cannon and cannons foreign [Music] and they're fighting foreign don't ever think you're going to get those promises as I walk over for the words until the series again you are going to have to fight for every one of them all you know you are going to have to be determined or you know Hallelujah I mean I will not give up until the last stop of my blood pressure is going to yield myself to the Lord I'm going to fight for my marriage foreign Hallelujah Amina let me tell you God does not want weaklings God does not want weaklings in his kingdom God is looking for quality not numbers [Music] he can't manage the main results the guys are able that will drink it like dogs out they're looking around now this man did not know but he didn't only told them go and drink just look at this and tell you you stand here he already knew the tricks but they were ready to go through the Affliction Hallelujah I mean and prove themselves to be men are you here is what God is looking for even in USA foreign [Music] he himself when he was on Earth our Lord come off he prayed yes and sometimes when he was about to be uh crucified he went on the mountains until blood came down hey talk about prayer can you say your mind is filled with the world and the words I hate you then see you will let afflictions because now you are chasing after something else because it is written many are the afflictions of the righteous and but God delivers him from them God promised many afflictions that would be beyond our understanding is praise the name of the Lord you go through things that you can't understand why they are out there you want to say but sincerely are you really with me but it's always done for your goods just can't understand it because if we understood then it would not be of Faith to us we will go with our understanding but it means if we understood it we would go with an understanding not with faith but we do it and we have it and we believe by faith his word that it's going to work some good thing for us today and there is none of us immune from them I know I think those things you're talking about are for the poor me I'm okay I'm pretty established things no my friends there is none of us immune from them foreign [Music] yes Bill Gates no no no no no no okay there's someone here today and I think he either got sick or he died or something like that somewhere where he someone was writing he said he was in a hospital bed one way idea and he said that he could not he realized what is most important is life someone for anything but he could not have the ability of paying someone to be sick on their behalf foreign you can have the whole world and see your knowing you're better than you but sometimes God can can permit the situations to happen on your life so that you remember you are human your motto now no one does no one in this world is immune from afflictions you must go through afflictions no one is immune Teddy are garments there are many men of faith yet they were Afflicted there were many great Kings I was speaking with the brother about um King Nebuchadnezzar and the brother was telling me Oh King Nebuchadnezzar she was so great foreign foreign there is nothing there is no greatness with God there's only such great people that God has made great if you want to be great it's only God who can make you great you must understand but you will not be immune from this afflictions but God will deliver you if you are his child it is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible that trials are brought upon us are more precious to us than God itself it is God giving us this trial if I asked you how many here want some gold if you want some good raise foreign is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us more real to us than he was before the trial came oh because I want to join in this morning with job to say that I've lived long enough to know that that is the truth [Music] and it says I have seen it in my own life situation Rises [Music] and it comes out glorious oh my let me encourage you to not come by say my money situations come your way you feel you can't get honorary you can't go around that means god is getting ready sometimes such troubles and such Affliction and such trouble what will it says you know some problems you can sneak your way out what I hear is hallelujah amen that is the same Mission amen that Esther went on it was a suicide mission she said let me go to the king yeah [Music] Hallelujah she couldn't go over it and they eat around it so the King was getting ready to bring the golden scepter here is your way now I'm making a way for you where there is no way King Jesus we should learn to trust him he says oh it's so sweet to trust in Jesus praise the name of the Lord and remember in all these things Saturn tries to make us nervous and upset us to get us to think oh why did this happening foreign [Music] people but if you pass your exams no intelligence Hallelujah I mean don't pray why me prayers are watching don't pray those kind of uh you know prayers you know beating yourself the servant silence I know your words with us oh my God I want to be sealed with the Holy Ghost so much that I was confused I'll fulfill the kingdom of darkness because when Jesus is in my house he says it is oh we need this sometimes Hallelujah for him to come by give us an assurance that is with us in the storm I wanted to I wanted to look at job 16. job in his uh trouble Affliction or extremity he had been pushed towards the farthest limit of his faith of Passions hmm God has delivered me he says in job 16 11. God has delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into the hands of the wicked I was at ease but he has broken me Asanda he also has taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark his arches Compass me around about he agree with my reins asunder and doth not spare he powers out my girl upon the ground he breaketh me with the preach upon preach he runs upon me like a giant I have sold sacross upon my skin and he fired my horn in the dust my face is fouled with whipping and on my eyelids is the shadow of death my friends scorned me but my eyes powerth our tears unto God all that one might plead for a man a man with God as a man pleaded for his neighbor when a few years are calm then I shall go the way Queens I shall not return yeah [Music] foreign [Music] foreign have you heard these words look at Chapter 19 Verse 23. oh that my words we are now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an eye and pain and lead in the rock forever for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he star shall stand at that Latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroyed his body heated My Flesh shall I seek God whom I shall see for myself and my I'm not not that though my Reigns be consumed within me okay I wanted to read verses 23 to it is foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] if you read the history about the the church and you see what the Believers went through in the darker edges you would even wonder is there a God in heaven go through such kind of afflictions women's berries were ripped because they would kill them In Cold Blood foreign [Music] you know oh there's something about a child of God no matter what you go through you can never cast Jacob never cast the job never cast God yep at the end of all his words foreign [Music] when the devil buries you have to sprout out why why you are acid um praise the name of the Lord she says no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering yes what a stumbling block this is to so many people um like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people so far that's what they asked in the Book of Malachi chapter 1 verse 1 it says the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you say the Lord yet we say we're in our star loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and hated ASA and ladies mountains and he's irritated West for the dragons of the wilderness foreign where did you love us but I loved you and how God how does God prove his love he says I hated Esau is Jacob is Israel the meaning God is proving his love if God chose you mean you see they could not figure out God is love they saw that love meant no suffering but anyways God say that his love was elective laughs if you understand that's the proof of God's love oh my God loves me God loves me because he trust me [Music] because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification command of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commute you and he is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] negative he commits them to a prolonged suffering he commits them to die otherwise foreign praise the name of the Lord how many of us and it does what he wants that's what he does with the purpose you know maybe you know poverty maybe you know something something foreign [Music] you see after this subject all of you when I believe will now begin to appreciate God and the moment you understand the love of God then you can never complain you will know why the Bible says [Music] come on say it with me to his purpose and all of the three of us were in the car foreign you may not understand when something's happened but when you are mature in Christ you have a muscle when things happen in a place never expected you're not even going to waste your time and mine trying to think close up thank you but if you're mature in the spirit the first thing you are going to do Oh Glory so the devil will say what is wrong with you hallelujah hallelujah even yourself [Music] and before amen to dress you understand church as
