Prophet Lord you would draw near to us one more time speak to hearts Lord maybe weary in body through the day but Lord we just want that last little bit more that you have here so we can make this evening service to you both speaker in here in Jesus Christ [Applause] amen amen I'll bless you one more time it is sure good to be here together with you I've just enjoyed these last few days myself I don't know about you but I have enjoyed myself yeah amen I know you've had a big day and some of you might be even hungry because I think you forfeited dinner didn't you did you give up dinner yeah are you getting dinner afterwards is that correct so if I hear some sounds coming from the tummy I'll know it'll be time to close up yo foreign it's worth it all foreign amen so let's just press into the kingdom a little bit more tonight let's turn to our Bibles in Luke 14. we're going to start at verse 25. I'm just going to speak tonight on a title maybe we'll just call it uh we'll just stay with a theme I guess that we've been setting um we started with a generation unrestrained a generation of power and tonight maybe we'll just be going to generation of finishers verse 25 and Luke 14. and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them If any man come unto me and hate not his father and mother and wife children Brethren sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple foreign foreign verse 28 sorry verse 27 and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple um for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it foreign he is not able to finish it all that beheld it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able um amen amen amen you may have receipts tonight I want to focus on that scripture he that he has to count the cost if he was intending to build a tower Jesus is saying he would sit down shouldn't he sit down first yes and count the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it no one wants to be in a position where is Jesus said in verse 29 yes I would behold and begin to mock him uh the feeling of being able to accomplish something feeling like something a project or something in life where you you had anybody create to-do lists I mean there's a lot of things wrong you can do on these devices but I don't know do you use this for a to-do list anybody use one of these to do for to do you know yeah okay thank you he keeps things in check because you want to know okay I got this to do I got that to do I got some tasks here then you're able to go back and you're like yeah did that you know you keep track of your accomplishments and it feels good to check it off are we all human here you know that some people actually will create a to-do list for tasks they've already done just so they can check it off believe it or not because it's human nature we enjoy there's something that we receive when we're able to check off I did it it's over and there's a feeling of accomplishment that's just how we're built it's Humanity but when something is in your back your mind and you know it's kind of left unfinished oh that's not a good feeling it just kind of sits there wearing at you you haven't been able to finish it yet because some things are hard to finish it takes a little bit of effort to finish yeah some certain projects that you want you want to attain maybe it's a degree in school that you want to get um you have a certain profession you want to make there's a lot of effort involved to get there again it takes time it takes money it takes sacrifice takes determination all of that's required so at the end of that period of time you can say I did it you can check the box off yes Amina but then if you leave them you know certain tasks it's kind of lingering and lingering it can kind of start to churn you up a little bit sometimes though then something strikes ya I'm gonna get that done right man does that feel good but a builder as scripture was stating here a builder he will plan yeah he'll prepare yeah years in advance he orders supplies he gets his workers lined up he calculates what is needed to finish that correct because Jesus said he wouldn't want to stand there yeah you know what I'm just going to start this project right there in foreign to his community [Music] that's right no one's no one's star let's go to the to the example of a racer as we've done over these last few services or how about a soccer team who went to the FIFA World Cup this last few months ago I know nobody here you know watched or tracked that of course not um huh oh you did okay I don't know what team you were looking for we'll leave it right there but no soccer team going to FIFA World Cup not one of them get on to them get into the match again get playing their heart out and halfway through the first half yeah we're done with this we're just walking off the pitch we don't have it we don't have it in us we'll never make it they didn't get nobody even thinks of doing that they are determined to go all the way they're gonna finish that game they're gonna give every ounce of energy possible to try and win they figured out what they need to do no hiker [Music] the hiker like uh hiking up a mountain a hiker going up Mount Everest Everest he would not get halfway um and just go halfway you don't do that you train you prepare you get supplies ready huh no no no foreign [Music] foreign foreign but we have a mighty Champion greater than any Expedition greater than any athlete that was able to speak those words in scripture amen only in the New Testament other words it is finished because only one was able to lay claim to that word it says in John 19. after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirst he said now there's a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar they put hisself upon it uh Tennessee put it to his mouth and when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar yes he said it nagamba is finish amen and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost now are you the more you're with that word in Scripture it is finished it's a translation of the word with the word in Greek to tell us and I want you to grab a hold of what this means because it's not just oh I finished something I checked that off on my to-do list it's not a past tense word it's a present tense word because it doesn't just speak as something that happened two thousand years ago it means it's happened then and what happened then is still in effect today he wasn't just saying well everything then is accomplished redemption's plan is all it's finished amen men have goals oh they say I accomplish this I got my doctorate I did a certain I climbed a certain Mountain but no one yeah could say the words it is finished like Jesus could not yes amen Amino before Jesus said those words he waited out think about the cost a muedo that he had to go through before he could speak those words when he said it is finished the whole book is Allah and the prophets never nothing all that was spoken of him all the prophecies all the types and shadows all the types from the red heifer to the turtle dove to Solomon's Temple oh we're fulfilled in him every prophecy every dream every aspect of scripture we're wrapped up in him and it all had to be done for him to be able to say it is finished let's just take let's just take Jesus Christ let's put him on the put put him to the side here and I don't want to give you the Old Testament let's just say we give the Old Testament to a wise man I got a problem for you to figure out I want you to go home I want you to construct in your imagination the ideal character who shall exactly fit all that's foreshadowed in description okay well that's a big task yeah I need you to find that person remember he's got to be like Moses he's got to be like Moses but he's going to be a champion like Joshua but it must be like Aaron and Melchizedek he's got to be like David like Solomon he's got to be represented in Noah yeah in Joseph oh I gotta find somebody that matches all all those Shadows every one of you are not can't miss one he's a line of the tribe of Judah yeah he was the perfect type in Joseph [Music] he must be like the altar yeah the Tabernacle The Mercy Seat the show bread the wise man is just like I I know I can't I find something like that I'm gonna remind you some of those prophecies are seem contradictory remember if scripture says all Kings shall fall before him and all nations Shall Serve him but yet this one oh no has to be despised and rejected of all men he must be a man of Sorrows but he's also born of a virgin because a virgin shall can see Amina this must be a man without spots without blemish but yet one upon whom the Lord one upon whom the Lord does cause to meet all our iniquities he must be the Glorious one I think son of David dry ground how am I to find somebody like that and you can take all the intellectuals of the world they could get together huh they could get together go to the scripture search through all of history searching for one man one person that could meet every one of those criteria I tell you they could not do it and they so the wise man would have to come back I have to just Proclaim but there's no other than the Cross of Christ and the Son of God that's the only one that can match every single one of those scriptures when he said it is finished every single one of those scriptures every prophecy but it would not be every shadowed in him brother Brandon says when Jesus came yes he was the word in its fullness because the whole Plan of Redemption laid in him it didn't lay in Moses it didn't lay in Joseph it didn't land Elijah they were part of the world Amen he said see the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it so here Jesus now as he's coming up to the cross the cost is needing to be counted and he gets to Gethsemane he gets on his knees he didn't say wait I wasn't quite ready for this cost I don't know this is too hard to carry he didn't get up from his knees and say no can't do it it's too great it's just too much I can't yeah he counted the cost so that he had exactly in mind what he needed as the great drops of sweating blood went from his brows he started to feel the burden the cost door of what it was going to take to get rid of and he starts to wrestle through the garden for you and I he says he says no my bride When My bride is too valuable to me Nothing's Gonna Stop Me I'm gonna go to Hollywood all the way I gotta finish this he was alone and denied my loved one she's lost sin created a Chasm she's bound I'm gonna finish it he gets hauled into herod's court they take him and bind him there they start to beat him and they bruise him and every single time he takes a blow he says I'm gonna finish it I have someone in Uganda is my blood on his cross Uganda Satan stood watching saying there's no way he's not able to accomplish do you know the cost required and they started with they scorched him in his mind spit roll off his face as a shoulder spit this alive on his cheeks I'm finishing [Applause] was placed on his head I can just see in his heart he said I'm gonna go all the way he brought a cross up the hill for you when he was out of strength [Music] I'm not stopping halfway Hallelujah laid out his hands on the cross [Music] and the Romans drove took the nail place I'm finishing it I'm finishing it is up has he hung there on a tree naked gasping for final breath if one prophecy had been missed all of it would have been broken it would have been all broken everything had to be accomplished for the words full effect that's why scripture says scripture says when all things were accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled scripture has to be fulfilled God's word cannot lie if he had a type and Shadow in the Old Testament [Music] it had to match perfectly foreign [Music] but one was left one was left that the scripture would be accomplished he had to make sure that everything else prior had transpired exactly according to scriptures there's one more foreign since curse had been paid those are the three most beautiful words why do we know that you and I could ever hear why do we know oh that's something worth praising about yeah there's a lot of things that you could say but the most beautiful words is it it's finished sin has no more hole when he screamed it is finished it did sin died Glory now it's dead it's dead Jaffa it's done with it it's powerless it's lifeless think of it people that's sin the enemy to you and me is dead it has no more effect on you yeah foreign huh amen but you know what else happened there Bram says when it's buried and hid out of sight he carried my sins he said God can see your sins he said where are they buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness he said God cannot remember them no more foreign [Music] [Applause] hey Hallelujah he said no wonder the mountains jumped says shouted on that day no wonder the sun hit his face he said no wonder nature broke loose the wind shook the trees they seen the prophet shepherdsuma on the mountain on Calvary redeem every name on The Book of Life That's why nature could shout yeah the cycle of death that nature would go through praise God the cycle of death that nature even would go through uh the tree would die an animal would die but he said and the world went into an earthquake he said like any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you that it foreign [Applause] be above our praise they didn't the trees didn't see their name on the books [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah some would say someone said well when he cried it is finished it was a cry of defeat almost but it was a cry victory yeah Jesus was leaving no unfinished business yes Hallelujah any man amen Amino I said I wasn't going to be long so I'm watching my time amen I'll save that part for tomorrow but you can't preach it okay hey man I made a this is an all the way gospel this is all the way I know you sing the song all the way I'm going all the way [Music] yes yes and so we must this is no Halfway Christian this is a sellout foreign [Music] he walked right up and stared the king of glory not right in the eyes what a moment even in that moment think about it foreign [Music] but he says you can't remain there that is part way he says do not remain there my precious brother or sister you've not yet approached the fellowship all right huh just listen I want you to listen he said the Waters of Separation was provided the unbeliever being separated from his sins then he looks towards the congregation we're talking about the Tabernacle there was an outer court and the holiest of holies you can pass through the waters separation separated from sin and looking now he said towards the congregation [Music] he said we have to realize the word cleanse Us by hearing by the word and well we have to recognize the blood something died for us all right that's another step he says you can have Fellowship in the outer Court you can have fellowship with other other people in the inner court but to fellowship with God you have to go into the presence of God he said that's into the Shekinah Glory it's only a halfway walk brothers and sisters if you recognize well I'm separated from sin amen and you don't press more you've only gone part way you need to go all the way amen Amina he said the holy spirit is all the way not even 99. you could you couldn't be half in and half out there's no fence sitters you couldn't have your hand reaching inside the inner Veil that's not all the way amen amen he says we just stopped at the Waters of separation and the power of the Shekinah Glory why do you think brother Isaac this afternoon stressing you need a holy ghost experience not just while I'm separated from my sins even recognizing the blood that atones for Fellowship you needed to go into the prayer okay that's why we've been made Kings and Priests could go once a year but Jesus on the cross of Calvary made a way for you and me with the blood of Christ yes brother Brandon says now it was death to to step foot in the Old Testament if you weren't the high priest and you put your foot inside the inner Veil you're dead but he said now now if you don't go into it if you don't press all the way [Music] amen I'm saying tonight and I'd almost end the service here I'd almost end the service right here because I am burdened that many might have made a step um I recognized that I'm be he separated me from my sins you've made a step or two towards you know what time something there were those this afternoon huh put that bro came to an altar because they were determined oh I'm finished and you might have been sitting in your chair and it's something I say tonight finish it hey man don't treat your spiritual walk don't treat your spiritual walk like it's just a checklist well I'll get to it I'll check it out this isn't a to-do list item this is life and death I just say it how it is I'm not gonna just kind of prance around the issue City who are not just a question it's spiritual life or spiritual death is coaching I'll tell you could tell you these different Runners will tell you it's a Wonderful Life there ain't nothing better why did you sing a quote and you can yearn for it you can look at your pastor look at your mama you can look at your daddy but it'll take you now move huh um as butter brother Branham said we're gonna bring up my Gumball I think it was Buddy Robinson I might have it wrong but he got down on his knees [Music] you're gonna find a pile of bones right here I might have to sit here in an altar for a long time till it's finished I want to be able to stand up tonight [Music] and cry with the words that Christ did on Calvary is finished oh God next to it again since curse has no grip on me no more that's what these meetings are all about you can go to YouTube you can walk to school the next day you say it's all done yeah my sins are gone what do you mean there foreign [Applause] [Music] said he walks in dry places returning back bringing seven other Devils with him brother Brandon is saying when someone is cleansed they're emptied out they've repented and the devil is cast out those habits are cast out those desires are cast out but now you have an empty vessel and he says God gives an opportunity to move in God has given you an opportunity this weekend to clean it out but you can't leave it right there that Devil's walking around in a dry place somewhere and he wants to he's going to come back well is anything filled that vessel he says Hey huh they've just gone halfway oh no they're not pressing all the way come on over let's go back you need to give an opportunity where Satan once occupied yes get it filled with the holy spirit of God foreign that's critical yeah Daniel then you'll have strength of God's word in you strength of God's word in you uh manifested to cast out Devils this is my favorite part right here got a new one and he said then the contest is on yes the Holy Ghost filled son and daughter of God and the Darkness of the enemy I don't need to tell you who wins I don't need to tell you who wins on the contest you can't stay empty is idleness he said empty his idleness he says that's what's the matter with converts today as soon as they get converted they're idling around he says you ought to be on your knees seeking foreign [Applause] he said when the Mana was first poured out he said it'll dry up during the day but he said go out take a golden Omarion it was a vessel that could hold something all right he took a golden Omar and he took out he took that and put in some of the original manners and he took that into the holiest of holies okay I mean he said all down through the generations when a man entered in Beyond the Veil when a high priest stepped into the inner Veil they had a right to take a spoon foreign can you imagine the original man that fell a high priest had a right to take a small portion of that good day Brown says you don't need some kind of makeup some kind of emotional or mental makeup you don't have to take something from the devil said but every believer that comes from the altar to a consecrated life cannot get only a mouthful of the original baptism not some halfway mixed up things don't you dare take anything less because it'll bring the same results as it did on the day of Pentecost that's where Stephen could stand up I was Steven facing death uh fire they were looking to Stone him he preached in the power of the Holy Spirit there they were with stones ready to cast upon him and he picked him up foreign foreign he said labors he was in more abundant Stripes above measures prisons more frequent in deaths often five times I received 40 Stripes Thrice I was beaten with rods Thrice I was Shipwrecked uh foreign ah but the same one that held Paul yeah that'll hold you through every track yeah every tribulation every persecution I don't care what it is but if you don't go into the holiest of holies there's nothing to hold you okay it's a personal experience was such a normal Amina amen I wonder tonight I wonder tonight if there's some unfinished business you've had a long day but I'm going to give you an opportunity to finish it tonight [Applause] [Music] you need to get real and mean business with God I'd say if you were looking at a front row here this afternoon until we move on and go and you were saying oh I wish I was there no guns it's open tonight I'm not pushing and pulling and dragging is it um I need to finish that you heard this afternoon Jacob wrestling with an angel in the junction Jacob didn't stop yeah coma much foreign that's what we need tonight we need that character say oh God don't leave this building come by my way tonight I'm gonna hold on to you constrain him what did he say they did on the road to Emmaus just stay a little longer can we just keep you here just a little bit more your presence is too precious I need you to transform me I know I'm a

[Music] Hallelujah what an atmosphere tonight amen Amina foreign how many here in this Congregation of 40 years and below out straight now I wanted to look around while you raise your hand look around in Kono so you can put it down almost almost more than 95 percent of us here are beautiful 40 by the Barnum said that 40 is a generation in brother Isaac said he's 44. Brothers it's an age group is that okay how old are you he's 40. yewana you just made 40. is it your birthday is Battle just passed away I I don't know I think I'm 32. brother Ken how old are you 30. 27. brother Enoch how old are you but the Enoch is 30. I didn't ask sisters because with Brothers we are okay with that we don't have a problem telling our age the reason I did that some writing concession is to say a whole generation is in our handsafe if you've not noticed even here in our country there is a generation passing and there is a generation coming on things cannot always be the same change must come and if you live a little longer even in politics soon in our country things will change it's a must it's going to happen soon that's the truth most of our parents are above 50. others above 60. some of your parents are pastors how many pastors children are here raise up your house so it's okay so you see we have a lot of pastors so most of you pastors are your fathers and to some of you are your grandfathers there is a generation and there is a generation coming on there is something I want to impress on you in just a few moments before we we dismissed that our whole generation is in our hands and I just wrote these words by inspiration as our brother Michael was speaking nothing a whole generation is in our hands what shall we do with it our elders did their best and we in enough all of us here are the result of their work we know that our elders our pastors not all of them agree with one another not necessarily in Doctrine but maybe in some principles and in the way they do things and some of you who are a little mature you know that one church does not work with another one and I was speaking with one some of our ministers here at days of the voice of the voice and I told them nimba Gamba we call I know and I'm saying this with all humility and I told them I said this is a neutral place and that I felt about it to call a youth meeting because this is my generation and that this is a neutral place no brother find the right word it's I don't know somebody help you I need this to be passed only the right way brother Center where are you where is brother Center I'm requesting to kindly help me just for two minutes just come up thank you brother Alex and and I was saying that this I told them that this is a neutral Place foreign foreign taco and if you notice that all the preachers in these meetings you know are young people foreign 29 is 29. his father was a pastor and he is now a pastor where is your church brother he is a young Pastor I want this point to sink because he has received it by inspiration there is a generation it's not because I said it but because it is the reality if the lotteries we also like our elders like our fathers nothing we have an opportunity I'm sorry to be emotional friends it's it's just cutting me deep because we have an opportunity to finish what they started when his message came to them they were on fire they didn't have smartphones smartphone they didn't they didn't a few of them had access even to email but you know a few of them had computers some of them were just reading the message after writing it on paper when the when they received the tape of the message they were fighting we will listen to it some of you may not know about these things and then a book they were borrowing from one to another uh but our generation fake we have smartphones everywhere between a smartphone now we have iPad trainers we have computers between a computer electrified with electronics to enabled because technology [Music] the whole message is 20 of you but what is our what has our generation done about it we have put it on the pillow some of you may not maybe you've never even listened to one tip one message we are so busy today you find one young lady I don't know I don't want to make it like so big but it is true you find them speaking with hundreds of Brothers sincerely are you looking for a husband like that foreign [Music] because how will they come back here if someone has not gone how shall they go except they Ascent but how can you be sent to me without having an encounter with God when you have never received the Holy Spirit remember foreign [Music] good music and after when the preacher comes on the pulpit they disappear um and these days we stream our services now tell me how can we have an atmosphere for something like this that happened here to happen in our churches we have made our pastors we have burdened them instead of them preaching to us the word foreign here is what I'm just imploring let us come to a realization that we should take this responsibility should rest on our shoulders if there is anything we are going to take from these youth meetings let us go with the burden okay and responsibility of knowing now you are the one responsible you you wake up because you where you are the one who is responsible for this message now some of you may not know it but you're going to be past us soon and some of you are going to be pastors wives but what generation are you going to to be um foreign amen Amino Brother Martin how many he are not sleeping over but again just a few of you most of us may God bless you Saints amen we appreciate the Lord for everything ready to be on now yeah our supper is ready and we're going to have it where we had this uh afternoon the side of the
