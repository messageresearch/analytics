I'm so happy for this privilege that have been given to speak to you this morning and I love the free atmosphere in this church the pastor has always told me when he invites me to preach he tells me brother preach what the Lord has put in your heart Hallelujah so there's no hindrance for the spirit to move there are churches that you are doctor to speak what you must speak you are told what to speak so in other words the holy spirit is put out of the world and then man takes over Hallelujah I bring greetings from s in the name of Jesus Christ I happened to travel uh the other day Friday night I went back to sorot traveled at night on Friday I go to S at 4 in the morning I had to connect to the Village I got there at around yeah and then I I had a lot of responsibilities my sister was introducing so we had a lot of work to do yeah so and then at the end of the day I had to travel back I left this morning at 1 that's the time I left morning Hallelujah and then I arrived here at 6 and then I had to come for the service so I I I have not had time to rest I've not had good sleep for the past two days yeah but I thank God that he has enabled me to come anyhow I request that you pray for me that God will help me to be able to stand because I still have the body I'm carrying Flesh and Blood I can get tired praise the Lord I'm not here to talk about myself I'm here with my family my wife is is right behind [Applause] there and then God has blessed us with two kids they also there those are two girls that God has given us and believeing God for a baby boy who is about to be born hallelujah praise the Lord the Bible says in Deuteronomy 2929 that the secret things belong to God but the things that are revealed belong to us and our children Hallelujah we bless the Lord turn with me to the book of Hebrews uh I'm going to read read a scripture that is very very familiar and one time it was preached here when I was in this church so when pastor called on me to come and speak to you I was I was asking myself now what am I going to what am I going to speak until the Lord put in my heart that go and talk about Hebrews Hebrews and that's why we're picking our text tonight Hallelujah are we there do we love the Lord it reads seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into Heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold F our [Music] profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of infirmities but was in all points accepted like as we are yet without [Music] sin now uh this scripture says we have not a high priest which cannot be touched meaning we have a high priest who can be touched Hallelujah let us therefore come bold unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of [Music] need father we thank you we have read your word you said that the letter kills but your spirit gives life father come and reveal yourself to us this moment through your words will be able to draw understanding and lessons of life out of this text he said your word will not go forth and return to your Void but you sent it come and speak to our bleeding hearts broken hearts tonight Lord Jesus rest restore the joy of our Salvation heal the broken hearts tonight heal the sick and deliver The Afflicted and that father at the end of it all will have the reason to give thanks we bless your name Lord Jesus father Grant it for a testimony to the glory of your name in Jesus amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah now from where we've read in the book of Hebrews the Bible tells us that we have a great high priest that is p heavens and that is Jesus the son of God now let us hold first our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of infirmities Hallelujah but was in all points tempted like we are and yet he was found without sin Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus said yes oh the Bible says that be ye perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect now one may ask how can one be perfect when you are still in the flesh Hallelujah now all things are possible to them that believe the Bible says I can do all things through him who strengthens me now as human beings we are limited as flesh and blood is where we end is where we reach and we say we cannot I can't continue enough is enough Hallelujah but Christ does not reach where he says I can give up now I can't hold it anymore praise the Lord and that is why the Bible says we have a high priest so if you want to overcome then cling to Christ praise the Lord because it is Christ to overcome for you now when you try to overcome by yourself you can't he says we have a high priest which can be touched by the feeling of INF I do not know which infirmity you have I do not know which weakness you have as a as a Believer but one thing I know each one of us has a point where you fail you may be perfect in all things you may observe everything and all is well but there's somewhere you reach that you also fail as a human being now we as human beings as Christians we have different weaknesses my weakness may not be the one brother has Hallelujah so one can say look at that brother he's taken 10 years in the message he's been a Christian for 10 years now but look he still tells lies I have never told the lie since I believed but I wonder that brother is still struggling with a spirit of telling lies now telling Li is the simplest demon to overcome and I overcame it long time ago now I wonder what that brother is doing he can't just overcome a simple Spirit of telling a lie hallelujah hallelujah now brother hold your peace praise the Lord I may be struggling with a spirit of telling lies which you overcame years back praise the Lord don't criticize me because you may be struggling with a spirit of last which I also overcame long time ago praise the Lord then I look at you and say this one is still lasting and he says he's a Christian how can you last when you're a Christian I overcame that Spirit long long time praise the Lord I believe each one of us has a go a weakness something that fails you and you know that it's not good you know that as a Christian I shouldn't do this Hallelujah now you stop for a while and you try to avoid it now take for example you're F of telling lies and you know it's bad to tell lies the Bible does not allow us to tell lies so but you want to be a Christian you love the Lord with all your heart and you wouldn't want to hurt him by telling a lie praise the Lord and then you wake up one day and say from this day I don't want to tell a lie I'm not going to tell a lie anymore I'm going to try to speak the truth I'm going to try to be honest in everything that I do why because I've known that the spirit has taken me so long and I want to end it today praise the Lord you'll try that day you may be successful Hallelujah the second day you may also be successful up to midday but I want to tell you this before you know it you've told a lie praise be to God now yesterday you committed yourself not to tell a lie and you promised God but I'm not going to speak lies but you've broken your promise what am I telling us Church on your own you cannot stop and that's why we have a high priest and that's why Christ went to Calvary this church brother sister Jesus went to Calvary because he knew that you were going to be telling lies praise the Lord Jesus came and went to Calvary because he knew you were going to last Hallelujah there's silence in the house now if you are not going to be lasting if you are not going to be telling lies if you are not going to be qusome if you not going to be abused then Christ wouldn't have come praise the Lord now according to God's for knowledge he saw from the beginning before even the beginning praise the Lord before he said let there be [Music] light he had seen you praise the Lord and he had seen all through your life right from the time before your parents met [Music] and before you were even conceived and before you were born into this world God had seen your life and he had seen what you were going to go through he had prepared a program for you Hallelujah and he knew that you were going to stray off now uh God does not make mistakes you may say now brother you're saying God knew everything how did he fail to know that the devil was going to come and sin would rain praise the Lord now hear this God had a plan now the devil thought he had won praise the Lord little did he know that Christ had seen everything and he came with a Plan of Salvation he had a Plan of Salvation before he could say let there be light God knew he was going to create a body for himself to dwell in that he may bring Salvation before he said let there be so God in his forign knowledge had everything in place before there was one single demon god had prepared a plan even for that weakness blessed be the name of the Lord he's a high priest we have a high priest which can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities the Bible says Christ was tempted in all things and yet without sin what are you going through today I don't know which Spirit disturbs you Hallelujah I want to tell you it Disturbed Christ praise the Lord and hear this when it Disturbed Christ Christ overcame it and then he gave us the method of overcoming he said resist the devil and shall flee from you now brother says Jesus conquered what did he conquer he conquered every gate of the en and then he told us to go possess the gates of the enemy now ours is not to conquer anymore because Christ has already conquered now ours is to possess brother possess that blessing possess that blessing sister why because Christ went before he's a high priest went to Calvary in your place now we are not going to Calvary again why because Christ finished Calvary ours is to possess Hallelujah I pray that God reveals it to you tonight that yours is not normal to conquer because Christ conquer your is to possess the blessings which Christ for hallelujah hallelujah what is that that you desire from God do you want victory over the spirit of last there are so many promises in the Bible that we have been given and we are supposed to possess them and because they belong to us and that's why the Bible tells us that we have a high priest who which which can be touched by the feeling of our family now he says come with boldness hallelujah hallelujah now I want to ask you a question what makes you to come with boldness Hallelujah you have a weakness you you are doing things that you know they don't please God and then where do you gather where do you sumon the courage where do you get the boldness to come seeing that you have a weakness Paul said for the thing I be the Lord th that it may depart from me and then he said my grace is sufficient for you why did he go to seek God it was because he had a weakness that he could not overcome he had something that he could not help Hallelujah the Bible says come now with boldness what makes you bold Hallelujah it is because it is because he said come praise the Lord and once he said once he says come it means it belongs to you I want to give an example if you are if there's a function that has been organized and you've been invited you have an invitation card that means you a guest you are expected to be at the function now with that invitation you you are you are fully persuaded that you've been invited and you know that you were invited to come Hallelujah and nobody can convince you otherwise why because you know that I have the card now will you come doubting and you say I don't know should I go oh they will chase me when I go there hallelujah amen if you don't have a card an invitation card then you will doubt praise the Lord you will come with praise the Lord he will not come with boldness you cannot come straight to the gate you come and stop somewhere and wait for the invited guest to First enter and then when they after they enter and then you will try to find your way in and then you will make sure there's no one at the gate before you enter why because you are not sure that you you'll be allowed in you fear that you may be thrown out why because you know that you don't have an invitation card you are not expected at the function Hallelujah but when you are expected to come that means even if there is somebody standing at the gate you are very sure that that person is there not to throw you out but is there to receive you and welcome you blessed be the name of the Lord now if you are sure now that the Bible has given us an invitation and it tells us that we have a high priest and the one calling on us he says come with boldness to the throne of grace and we come with that boldness not for sure we don't just come to to to Showcase ourselves but here this we have come we have been called upon to come and obtain Mercy the weakness that you have praise the Lord if you didn't have a weakness you wouldn't deserve Mercy if you didn't have that weakness that spirit that has bothered you for long then you do not need Mercy then you don't need to come Hallelujah but if you have a weakness then you know that you have to come praise the Lord because you need help and the only person who can help you the high priest who went to Calvary and is the one who is calling on you come with boldness that you may obtain mercy and the grace to help in time of need what do you need Church you need a victory he says come with boldness don't come with was don't come when you're scared don't come when you thinking that Christ May throw you he the one who has invited you he's the one who has called on you and therefore he cannot throw you out he says come unto me all ye who La heav lad he says I will give you rest it is always come come come praise the Lord Christ knew that we could not overcome and that's why he went and overcame on our behalf praise the Lord he knew you could not overcome that weakness that's why he went and overcame the weakness for you now here this if Christ overcame then we shall also overcome praise the Lord through Christ who overcame for us that's why the Bible says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me praise the Lord the shed blood of calvary still takes effect up to now praise the Lord Brother Bram said the mathematics he says in in the book of Isaiah 1: 18 the Bible says now come let's reason together your sins as red as Crimson this they shall be white as snow but the first thing is come he's calling on you to come with all your sins no matter what you have done Church praise the Lord he says come and let reason together come and let negotiate come unless find a way of helping you praise the Lord this what brother said of your sins are as red as blood Crimson says when God sees red through red he sees white Hallelujah when he looks at your sins through the red blood of calvary no longer sees your sins he sees a [Music] saint why the blood of Christ has power to transform Hallelujah and that's why the devil cannot accuse you anymore why because the devil cannot cannot find proof that you committed it as long as the blood has been shed you know the devil tries to go and accuse you and says see the one you call your son yesterday he did this this afternoon he again did this Hallelujah but when you as long as you go to the throne of grace and you obtain Mercy the Bible says he throws them to the sea of forgetfulness now listen here you can offend me I can forgive you but when you do it for the second time I will make sure I will remind you of the previous one that's because I'm a human being but when you offend God and go to the throne of grace he forgets about it so that's why the Devil comes and says look here he lasted yesterday as if that's not enough today again he has quar with the neighbor then Christ will ask show me the proof where is the proof you have the proof that when I check through my records I can't see anything praise the Lord why because the quing that yesterday you put it under the blood Hallelujah now when Christ looks to your red quaring through the red blood of Calvary that you put the quaring blessed be the name of the Lord and that is why the devil can no longer accuse you why because Christ went to Calvary and the blood is still taking effect the grace of God is still sufficient praise the Lord do not be intimidated by the devil Church we've got to outgrow that let not the devil deceive you I tell you that yesterday you did this the other year you did this you have done this Hallelujah tell the devil it is under the [Music] [Applause] blood and the devil knows it prise the Lord he can no longer accuse you why because we have a high priest we are a privileged people because somebody went ahead of us he ConEd G he conquered the Gate of Gossip he conquered the Gate of L he conquered the Gate of quarreling he conquered every gate praise be the name of the Lord and now said come with boldness because I conquered for you now there is no more condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus praise the lord the devil can no more condemn you why because you are in Christ Jesus preach a message that hidden life with Christ listen this Christ in us and we in him Hallelujah I can't understand that but look here we are hidden in Christ and Christ is in us don't try to use science to investigate that don't use your wisdom you not understand things of God are understood by Revelation Hallelujah as long as you are hidden in Christ and Christ is in you then the devil cannot accuse you praise the Lord Lord why because we are more than Overcomers Christ went before and conquered every gate look he says what did he do he said he set out and conquered sickness there could be no sickness around him praise the Lord whatever sickness was he conquered it what did he do after Conquering the sickness here this he gave us the kiss he says whatever you bind on Earth I will bind in heaven praise the Lord whatever you bind because Christ conquered now whatever you're going to bind it is going to be bound in heaven if it is last brother sister bind it and when you take a step to bind it Heaven recognizes that praise the Lord because we were given the kiss whatever you bind it will also be bound the problem that spirit is disturbing you is because you have just refused to bind it but I want to tell you Christ is on standby waiting for it to start binding and the moment you start binding he will also start binding and when you're done with binding it Christ will have also finished to bind it and it will no more disturb you why because Christ has bound it blessed be the name of the Lord he gave you the keiss the keys are with you hallelujah amen open every blessing that you desire you need a peace you have the kiss you need Victory you have the kiss you need healing you have the kiss whatever you desire the Bible says hear this it says whatsoever you desire When you pray believing it will be granted praise the Lord now that's the key Jesus said if you abide in me and my word abides in you you shall then ask for anything praise the Lord he didn't say you you can ask for a job but if you are struggling with last that one don't don't don't ask because that one is too hard for me praise the Lord he says if you abide in me and my word abides in you you shall ask for anything and I'll will grant it praise the Lord do you now see that you have the keiss you have the keiss you can open your Victory hallelujah amen he says whatever you bind on Earth will be bound in that's the Royal Seed of Abraham his promise now the Holy Ghost in us now with the keys holding it to sickness are you are you hearing Church the Holy Ghost is holding the keys in us theh the Holy Ghost In You is holding the keys against sickness he conquered sickness sickness cannot stand in his presence and and and and he said that he gave us the keys to do the same thing Hallelujah to conqu sick he gave us the to do the same thing do what don't hold those keys for granted don't hold the key for sure Hallelujah show the proof that you have the key blessed be the name of the Lord do you love the Lord whatever you bind on Earth I bind in heaven also Temptation he was tempted in every manner like what did he do he conquered it and what did he say says resist the devil and shall flee he says he conquered sickness for us he conquered Temptation for us he broke down the gates he took the key away from the temp what did he do with the key listen here he says he took the key from the temp and he didn't Ascend with it to Heaven praise the Lord Jesus did not take the key from the temp and went with it no he says he gave it to us praise the Lord he picked the key from the devil and handed it over to you Hallelujah he hand over to a Believer Abraham and he if he tempts you resist him and he shall flee from you Hallelujah the devil knows that we were told to resist him I want to tell you this when you resist the devil he has no choice but to go because the master said that when we resist him he has to go Hallelujah resist him now listen here he conquered both death and hell he rose up the third day and saying I have overcome now listen here there's good news here and because I live you live also praise the Lord hallelujah because Christ lives then we also live Hallelujah the devil cannot destroy us anymore do you know why if the devil has to destroy us then he has to go through Christ praise the Lord listen here I want to give you an example I am a married man I have my wife praise the Lord assuming someone attacks my house at night and he wants to destroy my family he would have to kill me first praise the Lord person first has to deal with me until I'm dead and completely dead then he can cross and go to the but as long as I'm still alive it's a lie he's not going to cross praise the Lord and that's why what brother is telling us because Christ is alive Jesus said because I live you live as long as Christ is alive who is your husband and you are the bride if the devil Must Destroy you then he has to First destroy Christ hallelujah amen then you can cross the line to where you are but the good news is we know that the devil cannot destroy Christ why because Christ rose up praise the Lord and is alive forever more even death cannot finish you praise the Lord because death could not finish Jesus hallelujah amen he died and Rose up and he gave us a promise praise the Lord the Bible says if this power this spirit that Rose Christ from the dead be in you he will Quicken your Immortal hallelujah [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah I'm very very happy that I am the [Music] bride and my husband who is Christ went ahead of me praise the Lord he did everything and just told me just accept Hallelujah and all shall be well blessed be the name of the Lord church we have a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of what you are going through the pain that you are feeling now Christ felt it and overcame praise the Lord and therefore the devil cannot overcome you anymore rise up and possess the gates of the Hallelujah am when the saintsing in oh When the Saints Go Marching In Hallelujah I want to be that number oh when the saints go Maring oh when the saints when the hallelujah hallelujah oh When the Saints Go Marching In oh Lord I want to be that number oh when the saints go Maring Hallelujah want to be in that number I know and I'm fully persuaded that I'm going to be one of them do you know why where I have reached there is nothing the devil can do about it Hallelujah you are covered by the blood of [Applause] Calvary the devil cannot cross beyond the blood Hallelujah you are in the holy of holies praise the Lord and the devil cannot penetrate where that light is the devil has been shut out and listen here he tries to whisper to you oh yesterday you did this but you know what he does it from a distance he has to shout and call louder praise the Lord why because you are in the holy of holies and the devil cannot get where you are you the holy of holies where no Tempest can H the lord the devil tries to attempt you he tries to tempt you here this the devil can tempt you but he cannot harm you amen now shadra those guys God did not stop them from going into the fire Hallelujah God had to make sure that he allows them to go into the fire but the good news is this God went before them they could Le into the fire god was in the fire praise the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar was able to tell we casted three but now I see four walking l in the fire the fourth one is like the Son of God hallelujah hallelujah when you with the Son of God when you are with the son of God the world will recognize unbelievers will know and not only unbelievers the devil cannot get near you that's why I don't fear witchcraft praise the Lord because I know this witchcraft is real are we together Church witchcraft is real and it is the working of the devil praise the Lord but as long as you are hidden in Christ praise the Lord witchcraft cannot harm you Church hallelujah hallelujah we have a high priest Christ went ahead of us conqu that witchcraft that has so therefore when the Witchcraft is sent the Witchcraft finds the blood and the Witchcraft cannot cross Beyond blood Hallelujah so therefore we are safe and more than safe let nobody intimidate you and scare you that they will bech you Hallelujah one time somebody scared me when I was building my house somebody told me you have to be careful here in bua there's a lot of Witchcraft you asked me have you seen houses that have been built to a certain level and have been Abed there are people who go to the shine and perform witchcraft so that you can't finish your house I laugh and told that person let them try praise the Lord because the Witchcraft I have they cannot manage let let them try me Hallelujah and should I tell you what I'm sleeping in my house now as you speak why because Christ conquered me I just went and possessed praise the Lord possess your blessing Church Christ has already conquered for us nobody intimidate you do not live in fearr [Applause] conqu you know what the devil does the devil plants fear in you and once he plants fear in you faith is gone listen here God's word can only operate on the basis of faith without faith it is of none effect that's why Jesus said by your Traditions you have made the word of God of n effect praise the Lord so once the devil has planted fear in you you can even believe God for your Victory can manipulate you do not accept fear hallelujah amen we walk by faith not by sight we don't walk by what we see walk by faith amen not even our faith brother sration may be bad and I want to say terribly bad brother whe through the fire just walk with God whether your neighbor stand against you with God whether there's no money just walk with God whe things are tough walk with God hallelujah he says seek in the kingdom of God first andever you desire Hallelujah Hallelujah it is always about the kingdom first come with boldness to the throne of grace you may obtain Mercy listen when you come to the throne of grace you don't go back the same hallelujah amen the Bible says he became us that we may become him he took our right righteousness and gave us his righteousness hallelujah amen come to the throne of grace the way you are praise the Lord and you will walk away a holy man you walk away a saint and the devil will know that can accuse you why because you came to the throne of God the good news is this church God has called us with the throne of grace and if we come to the throne of grace that means we shall not go through the Throne of judgment Hallelujah no wonder the Bible says the saint shall judge the world we are the ones to judge by but not to be judged so because we have come to the throne of grace we are nor going through judgment Hallelujah we have come to the throne of grace and we have obtained Mercy a person who has obtained Mercy is no more convicted Hallelujah this I like giving physical examp if you commit a case and you're taken you're detained praise the Lord before you taken to court and of course in this case court court is Judgment before you to court they always give room for you to negotiate with a complainant and see if you could come to terms Hallelujah and when you agree with the complainant you're given what is called a police B Hallelujah and walk out praise the Lord now here the Bible is telling us now let's come and reason together praise the Lord let's just reason together we have committed a crime we committed a crime against him now he says come let's talk praise the Lord if you are told to if you are called upon to negotiate with your complainant he may tell you that now for that case for me to forgive you because of what you made me go through you can pay me 5 million and then you say maybe I can give three and then you say now give me four and then you pay the for and then out you come but in this case with Christ he says come let's talk he's not going to put charges on you he's just asking you to come that he may forgive you and that's praise the Lord hallelujah amen as long as you can just come and say I'm sorry learned my mistake you will say you are forgiven therefore the devil can condemn you praise the Lord amen why don't you just take a step and come there's a song that says I can't remember but it says why do you delay when when Mery is calling something like that when is calling you and me praise the Lord why why take long why not just come why not come when now when when you're being called upon now now brother sister hear this do not wait Hallelujah don't say I I'll go make it up with him tomorrow I will go make it up with him next week I still have this to do don't wait I do not know when mercy will end prise the Lord I do not know when Grace will end praise the Lord now when Christ still on the seat the grace of God is still sufficient why not come and obtain it praise the Lord why take long why keep your infirmity why stay long in sin when the master is calling when he has even promised you that he's not going to impose charges on you he just ready to forgive you Hallelujah and once Christ forgives you it is finished when he went to Calvary he said it's finished hallelujah amen and when he said when he said it's finished everything was finished it means he had paid a full cost amen what do you have that is bothering you what do you have that is hindering your walk with him remember he said it is finished Hallelujah take it to the Lord in prayer oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord he conquered the grave rose up the third day for our justification when he rose up he was our justification what does that make us he conquered sickness ConEd death conquered hell conquer the grave conquered every Temptation now we are more than conquerors through him who loved us and gave his life for us we being the Royal Seed of Abraham now with the same spirit of God in us the same spirit that was in Christ the one who overcame then we are more than overcome every gate has been conquered for us the only thing we have to do is possess it it's already conquered sickness is conquered death is conquered hell is conquered the grave is conquered everything is conquered and we hold the keiss by his grace now he ask the question are you afraid to stick them to the lock are you afraid to put the keys into the badlock and say I come in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah imagine I want to give this example again you've asked me for 5 [Applause] million your child is sick and they need 40 million and then I've contributed five and then I tell you now brother I'm at office I'm busy just come pick the keys go to my house check on the table you'll find that money there Hallelujah and then you come to my office and pick the keys and then you go to my house then when you reach the door you call me and say brother but the door is are you normal you have the keys the padlock means nothing when you have the keys [Applause] Hallelujah now says we have the keys but why are we afraid to put the keys in the lock praise the Lord the problem you have kept the keys in the house and your future is locked the devil has locked to your future you know before Christ went to calv devil had closed everything then CHR had to make sure these people canot go and F the KE let me go and F the so he picked the keys and gave them to but you are seated out with the door then you say the sickness my sickness beli now's own sicknesses they say this sickness of mine you are owning the devil you said this sickness of mine has taken five years I have prayed and prayed and g to p not change that means

you can come here and I pray for you Hallelujah but my prayer cannot help you if you don't help yourself praise the Lord it is you to end to put an end to the to your situation because the keys were given to all of us I have the kiss you have the kiss why not open up your Victory Hallelujah why not open up your healing Hallelujah am you are praying for marriage open it you are praying for a job open it you have an infirmity that you have prayed for that is not going away open it you have the keys church you can do it if Christ did it then you can also do it that's why we are called Christians Christ like whatever Christ did we can do more even said Greater Works than this shall you do he promised that we are going to do more than what he did why are you afraid you have the keys you can command situations and subject Hallelujah says after 2000 years has passed and is still here in our mid the mighty conqu hallelujah amen that rent the might conqu that rent the two the veil that took every sickness that took every disease he took every Everything upon himself here this and bore our infirmities to the Cross there's a song that says hallelujah sin our sicknesses and took them to the Cross Jesus Took My my sickness and everything Hallelujah he took everything he took our infirmities and our sickness and disease and he triumphed over them and raised up for our justification and stands alive in our Christ is here hallelujah hallelujah you believe that he here Christ is here now as speak and that one I'm more than convinced because heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away said two or three are his name is in now that's the word of God hallelujah amen so is's here that one I know you just have to take go to the throne of grace and get Grace to help in the time that you need oh my time has time has gone allow me to just read something and maybe I'll close I have I have just only started but nonetheless don't be scared don't think that that one when he comes we praise the Lord the Lord is here and he's here he's here to deal with our weaknesses is here to help you in that weakness that you are going through that's why he said come unto me I will give you rest don't you need rest are you not tired of gossip praise the Lord come unto me all you who labor heav I will give you rest are you not tired of whatever demon that is disturbing come unto me all Christ is there to give us rest hallelujah hallelujah now is speaking about the woman who had an issue of blood she had an infirmity praise the Lord she had tried of course she exhausted all that she could think of she wouldn't get helped maybe maybe if it was our day you could have flown to India because of the issue of blood the Indians could not help you Hallelujah now hear this now she had been pledged with a hemorrhage for years and years she spent all her money to the doctors and the doctors do her any good now she heard Jesus was down there at the river so she pressed through the crowd brother press through theow Hallelujah because of that weakness press through the crowd hallelujah amen she prayed through the crowd and touched His Garment hallelujah amen and she turned around and went back into the audience Jesus stopped now remember when we are talking about this the Bible tells us we have a high priest which can be touched by the feeling of infirmities now this one touched Jesus and disappeared into the crowd Jesus said Jesus stopped and who touched meu felt it hallelujah amen Jesus felt inity of this woman no wonder everybody denied it Jes said but I perceive that virtue is gone out of me strength I got weak Somebody Touched Me Apostle said but why do you say somebody touched everybody is touching me Hallelujah he says now that is what it is today now with your education your imagination you might do all kinds of touching Hallelujah but that's not the touch that will it a thatou we are talking about we are talking about the touch that brings a result the touch that picks virtue out of Christ not we need touch that is able to stop him from doing everything and turns back to address your case hallelujah hallelujah a touch Jesus said I perceived strength has come out of me that's why the Bible says he became us that we may become him Jesus got weak why because this woman took away the strength and give weakness in exchange of the strength oh Hallelujah hallelujah amen that's what church go with your weakness with that weakness make Christ weak Hallelujah and then you become strong Hallelujah am it is doable church that's why Christ is saying come come to the throne of grace that I may become weak and you become stronger he's willing to become weak for you because he loves you love conquers [Applause] everything blessed be the name of the Lord Christ is more than willing to become weak and you take his strength amen hallelujah so we need a touch that picks virtue out of now listen this what says if he could be touched that day with the feeling of their infirmities the Bible tells us in Hebrews that he could be touched today with a feeling of he a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of infirmities is that right church then if you can touch him today hear this if you can only touch him today you are bound to get the same results that woman hallelujah amen if that woman touched Christ with her weakness and she became strong and Christ got weak you can also touch him today that weakness and Christ will get weak you will get strong Jesus Christ the same yesterday he does not change if he was touched yesterday with the weakness and got weak he can also be touched today with weakness and you will get weak praise the Lord am and you will get strong if he's risen tonight among the people tonight if he has risen from the dead and with the people tonight the same things has got to take place today oh is isn't Jesus who raised up from the dead now if Christ raised from the dead whatever happened then can still happen today the Lord will help you in of we could talk about this and talk about and talk about now listen here I want to read just one last thing and I close and the woman touched him so he looked around and said who touched me everybody said not me not me the little woman also said ah not me all of them said not me and the Apostle say behold behold why do you say that everybody is touching you why say you touched me he said but I've gotten weak somebody touched me he looked around till those scared eyes from the little woman Hallelujah he saw the scared eyes of that woman pointed her out and said your faith has Hallelujah you see it it is your faith give him a touch of faith that weakness that you are struggling with go by faith touch him you will not
