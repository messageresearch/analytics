priest Cabana my mother while they were out there came in contact with him and I think they were watching one of our services on YouTube YouTube and they gave him a little bit of it now and he said

she has God is going to do Mighty things because she wishes religion but it can't take you away but when we're in salvation Salvation Texas because when we are in Salvation we preach the truth many people don't understand me and I challenge many references the ones I used to be with us because they get problems in their school foreign foreign in the name of Jesus amen so he sings uh he sells them also I don't know about you but I would like to hear what he says so if you want to buy it it is 20 000. for the purpose of supporting his ministries so I will leave that there yes my father was a priest and I was living with Bishop of Kenya um and also the grace of God got me out of there me a deeper light and I tell you what is also from church of Uganda Church of Uganda that's like I'm from church so some of you may be wondering what is this Jesus Christ yes to Christians not religion Sydney do you hear that 3D nature religion edini just teaches you hey [Music] if you want to go to heaven you don't need religion you need Jesus Christ need salvation for yourself and that's what we come here to receive amen Amina so also before we go now to the preaching of the world I just wanted to give you an update as I have uh I promised you last Sunday with those of you that attend Fellowship here you know we have a vision we want to buy our own land that we can move there together if Jesus is coming tonight yes foreign those are the since we updated on March 30th on March 29th since then those are the new contributions we have received [Music] um we we like I told you that we had to pay also for rent and we agreed that uh we take out um rent was increased from 500 000 to brother Joel to how much to a to 800 000 per month so we initially paid 4.8 that is about six months and we also paid another extra two months [Music] our rent up to November of this year is paid November although we had intended to pay a full year but we are yet to receive more contributions from you towards that we do not want to drain our land fund NATO challenge so as of today we have 22 million six hundred eighty nine thousand in the land funds we are looking for 150 million is God able to do it so I'm encouraging you not to give up also I did not read several offerings that we collect from the church but it's also reflected here I'm encouraging each person each member that comes to Fellowship here to try your best and do something you don't have to have millions and that's what faith is not going to wait for someone to come and do a miracle for us we don't pull for money here we are now I will not be I'll be traveling on Wednesday and uh to to to Germany for for for a few days there is a meetings there and it's bringing together many people from many countries and I'm glad to be a part of that so remember me in prayers services will continue amen so can we stand on our feet now and as we prepare to read the scriptures amen how many are happy because of what God has done for them foreign I want you to help me sing that sister praise where are you is there somebody else who can help let me thank the Lord you know some people fear to dance for the Lord but let me tell you I'm a very shy person I never went to clubs in all my life even at school I never dance to Jesus because I love him with all my heart so let us sing that sister somebody give her a microphone and let us sing that song Never and then we shall read in the Book of Matthew 16. amen Amina oh you don't have a microphone okay can you give us a key the key the other key I don't know whether you'll be

anybody [Music] I promise foreign [Music] Matthew chapter 16. Mateo is I love it when we open up and just worship him in the spirit of Liberty [Music] but in heaven we will continuously do that here we have to pause the moment and go to the word because the word is the most important thing here on Earth we will need it to get there Matthew 16 verse 13. all right so we're reading um I'm reading the name of the Lord Jesus came into the the cost of caisseria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man arm and they say some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah saw one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say he that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed that thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I give unto thee the kids of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt Bine on Earth shall be born in heaven and whatsoever thou shall lose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven just read up to verses 19. children [Music] [Music] foreign so this morning I'm speaking on part two of what I spoke on I think it was Wednesday or Sunday on the power of Revelation tell someone the power of Revelation I hear I will not take long again this morning maybe I'll speak for about an hour we usually here can preach even up to two hours the people here can take it in some Churches can not even go 30 minutes foreign the power of Revelation Jesus comes and asks and actually this in this scripture where we read this is where the whole foundation of the church is when I say the church I don't mean the denominations this is a thing that has really confused the people in our generation they have thought that you need to be a member of a religion in order to go to heaven again but come to think of it Jesus did not begin any of this religion yes he's not the founder of the religion but Jesus when he came he came with one purpose sin is unbelief of the truth when God gives his wife and the people refuse to believe it's not small attributes of sin a river when you refuse to believe what God says in his words judge you not because of the things you did yeah because of what you refuse to believe why we are not going to heaven like the works we do already the Bible says the works of the righteousness I am not going to make it because of my works of righteousness Jesus comes in my hallway yes do the works of righteousness and so here he comes with the disciples and they ask them a very important questions Jesus Yeshua was asking the disciples for them to tell him what the people think that he is a child now please understand that Jesus was Flesh and Blood yes just like me standing before you today he was born by somebody yes they even knew their mother and he was just like foreign [Music] [Music] foreign because God is the same way God is a spirit you can't count God you cannot see his beginning [Music] and that is through throughout the generations the Bible even says we are born in sin even if your mother and father we are married we are all Bonds in sins we are born Sinners why does the Bible say we are born inside we were shaped in the womb to come to the world we were born according to the last of the flesh we were born the way we were not supposed to be born children of God born the way we are born physically speaking who is God God is the spirit God is going to give birth to any son that son must be a word child not a flesh child secretary that is why all of us no matter what our title is born in China that is why we have to be born again born again Guru Lucifer Lucifer fought now one with Mike and Lucifer Was Defeated Lucy was thrown down to there so the bat of angels became the Battle of men when Lucifer came on Earth [Applause] what happened good Sota now it was not crawling it was like I am Charlie Charlie and the devil came in that creation then that creature came to Eve and she turned in the city another inspiration of Saturn did God say you should not eat of every tree of knowledge and she was excited so he said now you will not die and Eve ate from that tree did she what's that what did she eat yeah by the time she walked away from that creature again she had a seat the devil had introduced to her a new way that's why Cain is [Music] Jesus was the seed of the woman [Music] let me paint this to all right now okay stand just facing the people and now where are the two young ladies please come yes come and stand right there now I want to demonstrate something thank you okay you can stand right now I want to show you something a demonstration it gives you imagery and then this is just to show okay so here was one woman and her name was Eve and here is another woman both of them each of them since I'm demonstrating with young ladies sometimes you do this and then people get fixed it here are the two young ladies one is both of them just like my sisters when when in the in the beginning when the devil came to one of them remember this creature was working but by the time you've left she was pregnant so the question is foreign so one woman became pregnant um because remember the serpent touched her and then she gave birth to twins they are not racism [Music] foreign had the voice she said how will it be on the sound say holy ghosts how was it going to be by the words be it done to me foreign foreign foreign the first Adam Fair Adam was okay but God decided in order to redeem yeah how was the first Adam born think about it was born by what yes this is God gives birth to them by speaking why do you think you are here why do we go to churches to his kingdom and hear the first Adam was born by the spoken word was also born she became pregnant okay of Jesus so who was Jesus yes who was Jesus okay let me ask you do you know a hen um chili cookies it becomes him achali isn't it that is that the child of a goat is is a god when a cow gives birth the child of a cow is what if you say this is this one is a cow yes Crystal Jesus Christ who's the son so it means what Jesus Jesus was speaking to the Pharisees yes and he told them that he was the son of God he came from God he goes back together and they said you call yourself they did not know Jesus was not making it up yesterday there is nothing like God that the big one God the small one and God the flying ones God is God God is the spirit hallelujah amen that Spirit came in the womb of marriage Jesus was born so when Jesus was working yes foreign for the father is in me you have been with me all this time man has been so confused with these Mysteries so what did they decide to do they decided to devise that we have evoluted [Music] but we have gone changes the man is confused a connection between man and animals so they don't know what it is see them just shooting just without the reasons what is happening what's happening in Ukraine Ukraine why can't people live in peace I wasn't preaching about the students I want to go in details if you go in the Bible and you read it very well you will notice nowhere in the Bible it says Adam nowhere in the genealogies it begins with says and also in the New Testament again foreign [Music] [Music] he has revealed himself in three uh uh dispensations [Music] that is all three offices is it a set of the same God when was the son of man um one who died on Calvary oh yeah all the way and when he died he concluded his office but Jesus who was the son of man was also Son of God he's the son of God Son of God is the holy spirit dispensation you wait you when I Jesus Christ's greatest Christian Son omana of God that was a higher Revelation Peter literally said you are more than a prophet himself and then Jesus was moved yesterday you were shocked he said he said Peter Rabbit let me tell you something flesh and blood has not revealed this but my Father in Heaven Peter burn this is not Peter The Rock You know the the Catholics say The Rock was Peter always this is Saint Peter's Basilica and upon this yes himself [Music] I mean praise the name of the Lord in a few minutes I'm going to be finished it doesn't mean I'll be done I'm just going to be finished now listen the power of Revelation the true charge the true church that knows the true Revelations will know what what the Bible says Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ yes tell your
