Praise this afternoon hallelujah thank you Jesus let us pray our loving Jesus we we have come this evening Lord to to lift up your name and to congregate around your world and father Lord we are so grateful for this opportunity that you have given to us many would have desired to be here with us but they have not made it but by your grace you gathered us around your word tonight now we ask that you will give give us utterance and also whoever will be under the sound of our voice will be able to hear what you have prepared for them Father Lord may you give us inspiration Let Your Presence fill our hearts in the precious name of our Lord Jesus amen amen I'd like to greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ nice to see each and every one of you that have struggled to make it tonight amen um and and so before we are going to go to the book of second Kings chapter 4 but just before we turn there I would like to just give you a a few uh two hot testimonies uh there is um brother praise has a friend at school uh they both in senior 3 so this young man um her mother is a preacher [Music] p uh but but for a while now I think it's been how long since 1 year is it a year yet no not a year a few months we've been trying he has been trying to reach reach to him message and uh he has he even brought he invited me to say I went to school I met him and then the young man also one time he came at home we shared a little bit so they've been at home praise did not have a phone but when he got a phone he used it as an opportunity now to take itth at school so that they can be listening the young man can be listening to the message directly and so the young man got on fire he he sent me a letter I read it yesterday it was just amazing do you have it here no you have it here can you give it to me it's amazing it's just amazing praise God I thought this is good to encourage some of you letter in this booklet just he was having quite many questions out of what he has been listening to and just listen to it it just thrilled my heart I hope it will also it says Dear Pastor I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it has been a long time since we last talked but by the grace of God what you told me has made a change in my life thanks to you and and my brother praise that I have been able to unveil the revelation of Our Lord through the power of the Holy Spirit say praise gave me a book for the seven Church ages which is very helpful especially when it comes to the godhead and the true baptism but though I am getting to understand the Revelation I have a few challenging questions on the way he says number one is Jesus Christ the first born the first of all the creation number two what are the dimensions that exist number three how many Heavens are there and what is in them number four how can I do the passion of my heart that is science as well as do the will of God number five how can I preach how can I preach to others tell me the steps number six I would also like to be listening to some of brother Bam's audios and praise had told me he will assist me with his MP3 because he used to bring his phone and I used to learn a lot but he stopped bringing his phone and he says may our Lord be with you until the end time end of time and another thing is I am not sure of my baptism now I feel like I wish to be baptized again Hallelujah and the questions are endless another question is how do you pray in Revelation how can I pray in the Revelation how do I know that I have the Holy Spirit how do I know that I'm speaking the right tongues it's endless and I said praise God where did he get all this question after hearing the message of the so I said the message has life to the seed not to everybody but to the seed he that has the seed of God in them when they hear the message the message quickens their their SE so the young man wants to be baptized he's in a hostel he can't be allowed to come out of school so that's why he had to send this letter and I'm yet to respond to it and I think in the Hol day we shall be baptizing him in the name of and the other testimony is fellowship that I've told you always to pray for sister brother sh friends so um yesterday so we now we we now moved it from Saturday to Monday so this Monday I was there once again for the first time actually and here's the amazing thing shame had shared because the other past monday had shared on to them on Malachi chapter 4 and he was emphasizing on verse two which says unto you that fear my name and here when I went back without knowing everything he shared that's exactly what I shared on as well and I was emphasizing on the name above all names and why the name of our Lord Jesus Christ why it is connected to Salvation and we Shar quite a lot of things on the line of Salvation the Judgment that is coming and the grace of God for our salvation and by the end of our sharing two young people decided to be bz and the big testimony is this one one of them is a young man that has been listening to us for a while but he has been opposing us and he's a brother to sister f but he made up his mind on Monday he said I've also decided I want to be baptized now praise God Amen these things should put us on fire Amen on fire not only to sit to continue sharing the word God has more seed out there that are hungering to hear this word and how will they come how will they hear they will hear it by you so may God use you praise God I thought those testimonies are very touching amen so this evening uh we are also speaking to evening by tabac so I would like to greet the Saints at evening on zoom in the name of our Lord Jesus so if you can all turn with me to Second Kings 4 and we have already uh spoken on the ministry of Elijah in the end time and we've been speaking on this subject for quite a while now but to the Saints on Zoom I left up uh I left on somewhere I just it will just be a continuation for us and for all of us even here at the at the church it will be a continuation and uh just I have a few things that I have on my heart to speak to you may the Lord just you know give us inspiration to speak we are reading from vers 32 and we shall read up to vers 36 I'll read verse by verse with my brother and when elishah was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his [Music] bed went in there and shut the door upon um and he went in there and shut the door upon them Twain and prayed unto the [Music] Lord and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hand upon his hand and he stretched himself upon the child and the Flesh of the child Works warm then he returned and walked in the house to and fr and went up and stretched himself upon the child upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes [Music] and he called gazi and he called gazi this is a verse 36 and said call this shunamite so he called her and when he was come in unto him he and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son now amen let us pray father we commit ourselves to you at this moment Lord may you give me utterance may you just give Grace to us tonight for we do not know how to speak but may you give us utterance Lord give us inspiration father people that are listening to us oh God for these are the pches of your blood I pray that you reveal yourself to them that amen for your purpose that they will hear tonight will you open their eyes of understanding and may they see the deeper things of God in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated I'm speaking to to you today on the ministry of Elijah in the end time part seven and maybe for a little inspiration tonight a little phrase at the seventh time SE sneeze amen at the seventh time Snee so I want to say that we have established from all these things we've been looking at [Music] so we have established that the Bible teaches on the five comings of Elijah the first time Elijah came that was elah the and and and we've seen everything that elah the did he was anointed he was a prophet of restoration he rose the a child from the dead you know uh his ministry brought restored food restored life restored you know the power of God brought down rain you know went against the false prophets that was the first coming of Elijah and and the second time we see Elijah's Ministry in elishah because elishah received a double portion of the spirit which was upon Elijah so now I want to say it this way when we say the spirit of Elijah we do not really mean Elijah incarnating other people we are meaning that the spirit of God which was working upon Elijah in the nature that he worked he continued working again on other men in other Generations the second time It Came Upon elishah and when you see the ministry of Elisha listen the ministry of Elisha is really I can say h a duplicate of the ministry of Elijah [Music] everything elishah did is what Elijah had done but in a double portion so that's the second time we see Elijah's Ministry the third time we see Elijah's Ministry is through the ministry of John the Baptist now when John the Baptist came they did not know who who uh who he represented they asked him who he was and he said I'm the voice crying from the Wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight so John the Baptist again when Jesus came he said he was the Elijah which was for to come in many denominational circles they believe that John the Baptist was the one to finish the ministry of Elijah they understand listen they understand that John had the spirit of Elijah on him and they actually think that that Ministry ends with John but I want to tell you tonight the ministry of Elijah continues was on after John because John only uh fulfilled his portion of preparing the coming of the Lord turning the hearts of the fathers to the children which were the Jews previously not knowing Jesus Christ so the ministry of John prepared their hearts to receive the Messiah but you see the Bible says he was in the his ministry was in the power and spirit of Elijah but the people never understood at the time before the coming of the Messiah the people never understood that the ministry of John was actually in the power and spirit of Elijah they missed and because they missed it they also missed the coming of the Messiah when the Messiah came they never understood who he was why because they missed John when you miss the coming of Elijah you will miss the coming of the Messiah Elijah's Ministry only comes to prepare the people's hearts to receive the Messiah and so we found that John the Baptist was that third Elijah his name was John but his ministry was in the nature and in the spirit and in the power of Elijah if you understand that say amen and then we see Elijah comes the fourth time you see the fourth time now is is coming to the Gentiles and we notice that this was William Bram now I trust that all of you believe that some of you don't believe that William Bram was the fourth Elijah you can have another service to prove that to you but today we want to to also go on that line a little bit to prove to you why William Bram why this age has receiv received William Bram who is actually the fourth and why in the end time so I say that unequivocally without any doubt will Bram was the fourth elah that is without any debate agree with me you can say Amen praise God but that is to the Gentiles we are coming back to that just hold that for a moment and then we notice that the fifth time Elijah comes he comes now to the Jews and in Revelation 11 the Bible speaks of two witnesses it says that one of them had the power to turn water into blood that is Moses other one he had power to call fire from heaven so that is the the ministry of elij so we notice that the Jews will also receive the ministry of Elijah again but that will be after the Rapture therefore that is not our ministry that Ministry is not really about the Gentiles coming after the Rapture the salvation of the 144,000 Jews but for now where are we we are right here at the coming of the fourth Elijah now listen to me all the five comings of Elijah really benefit the Jews except for the fourth one William Bram went from America and he was going to go to Israel but do you know what the Holy Spirit stopped him God spoke to him when he was up in the air and told him don't you do that don't you go there why don't you understand that William BR you know you have to go and find that video they interviewed him and they asked him whether he thinks that he his ministry will be received in Israel he believed yes he said yes I believe it he said because the Bible says the the Greeks seek after wisdom and the Jews seek after signs and the min of William Bram was that Anointed with the Min with with the spirit of Elijah do signs and wonders to call fire from heaven to show the sign of the Messiah if if he went to Israel their eyes would have opened they would have understood the Messiah and it was not yet time for them to receive the Messiah the time of the Gentiles was not yet finished so God did not allow him to go there there would come another man who would have the same anointing like Elijah John like Willam and he would go to the Jews but that would be after the Rapture of the Gentile so God stopped him told him you cannot go there it is not yet time praise God so only the fourth Elijah came to the Jew the Gentiles everything about the Jews is known everything about the Jews is numbered so much that we even know how many will be saved among the Jews but for the Gentiles it is to by Grace by grace and grace alone God is dealing with us as individuals Ephesians 2:8 it says for by grace are ye saved through faith amen tell somebody we are saved by grace we are saved by grace in Romans 11: 24 amen I'm sorry I have a limited time here and so I'm going a little faster so you have to think quick follow follow these details now and so Romans 11:24 it says for if thou call cut out of the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and you were graft contrary to Nature into a good olive tree to Nature how much more shall these which be the natural branches be crafted into their own Olive Tree follow me closely here God intends to cut off the Gentiles God intends to do it God intends to cut off the Gentiles and return to the Jews but first the times of the Gentiles must be fulfilled for he said you were saved by grace the Gentiles you came in by grace and he said you were the Wild Olive Branch you were removed from the world and you were you know wrote onto this Olive Tree and the original branch of the Olive Tree was cut off and then you you were grafted on says he asks a question then if God can take a wild branch and it onto the Olive Tree how much more those who were the original how easy will it be for him to bring it back and graft them again let me tell you Israel is the original Church the gospel came to them first but because they rejected it they were blinded for your sake that you may receive the Gospel you were grafted on by Grace not of your works that you can boast of it hallelujah hallelujah that is why I cannot understand anyone who preaches the gospel of works because the gospel among the Gentiles is a message of Grace amen we have been grafted on by Grace but remember not permanently up to some time when the fullness of the Gentiles has come then we shall be cut again and then Jesus will go back to the original Branch Israel and graft them back on again okay let me interpret it what he is saying that the Jews right now don't believe Jesus because their eyes were blinded so that God can now call the Gentile bride when the last Gentile bride has come in it is time for Jesus now to go back again to the Jews the Gentiles will be left in their denominations in their and dogmas will go to the Jews so he says now I want you to follow me closely here 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own Concepts that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in praise God praise God so there is a Time coming and here it is when the fullness of the Gentiles has coming how long or when will it come in please listen to me the fullness of the Gentiles in by seven Church ages from epes to that is the time of the Gentiles from Ephesus Jesus is beginning to call his bride he continues calling his bride up to Revelation 1 verse 10 I was in the spirit of the Lord's day and I had behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia now this is John seeing his visions and the Bible says he actually gives a testimony that he was in the spirit of the Lord is the Lord this day I told you is the day of the Holy Ghost when you receive the Holy Ghost you are in the Lord in the when you receive the Holy Spirit you have received your Sabbath if you understand it say Amen so now he says here I you know I am Alpha and Omega what you see right in a book and send it to the seven [Applause] churches and he says these churches are where in Asia Asia is the Gentile land not Israel so these are gentle churches the first one is ephes the second one is the third is PG [Music] and and he continues on and verse where where he speaks of the mystery of the candlesticks and the Mystery of the stars please follow me Clos verse 12 he says and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and now this is John turning and he wanted to see the voice that spoke with him and he saw seven golden candlesticks and in the mid of the of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man closed with a gar down to the foot and got about the PS with all right now his head his head and his ears were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like the fine like unto fine brass and if they bur in a furnace as if they Bur in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right [Music] hand Seven Stars tell your neighbor Seven Stars and out of his mouth went that sharp two-edged sword and his contance was as the sun shineth in his strength so when he turned he saw seven golden candles and he also saw amen one that was in the middle of the seven golden C like a son of man and then he also saw in his right hand there was seven stars all right so we coming we are seeing s S7 began with Elisha Elisha prayed stretch himself over the child and the child sneezed how many times seven times so we coming down to find the seven Gentile dispensation which is the time of the Gentiles and it comes in its fullness after the seventh Church a but we cannot understand that until we see the vision of John John saw the Gentile Church John saw the the Gentile church as a seven candles so the seven Candlestick was the fullness of the gentille listen after the candlesticks then comes Israel again right before the candlesticks is Israel after the candlesticks is Israel so now we are seeing the candlesticks in the middle there so in your mind you can draw the the Star of David here and the Star of David here and the candlesticks in the middle are you following me now but yet in the middle of the candle there were seven there was one who was like the son of man and in his hand there were seven stars what does it mean every Church age had a star every church had a star but those stars were in the hands of God it was in the hands of Jesus amen they weren't on their on their own they were in the hands of him him that is Alpha and Omega him that is the beginning and the end these Stars don't have their own message these STS don't have their own life remember the son that was in the middle of the of the candles is the one who has the light the stars reflect the light of the sun are you following me the Stars don't have their own light the stars reflect the sign the light of the sun well here is talking of the s o n but we know it can it might as well be the S praise God because they they were reflecting the s o n light [Music] the Son of God so what does the candlesticks mean what does the stars mean Revelation 117 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as death and he and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and I am the last I am he that liveth and was dead hallelujah oh I'm so glad to serve he that is alive he does not say I am he that is dead who was alive but he's saying I am he that live I am he that was dead and is alive I want to say Jesus is Alive and he's alive in his church he's alive in his bride churches out there are praying for Revival but we are in the bride's Revival we are waiting for Brother CH our Revival is here amen our Revival am is the message of the amen that comes by the power of the Holy Ghost change our bodies one of these morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we will wake up to the resurrection I'm he that was dead and behold I am alive forever amen and I have the keys of hell and he has the keys Hallelujah tell your neighbor he has the keys he the KE he has the keing oh my good write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be here mystery of the Seven Stars which you have seen in my right hand and the Seven golden kind the seven stars are the Angels tell your neighbor the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which you have seen at the seven churches how many churches does Jesus have he has only one Church which is said upon this revelation of the world upon this revelation of who I am I will build my church and the GS of Hell shall not Prevail against the Church of Jesus Christ is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ and and and this is the same church that has been in all the church all the Seven Ages when he says seven churches it is just symbolic to Seven Ages so the gentle Church therefore is alloted in a period of Seven Ages 1 2 3 4 five six seven how many times remember in the child sneeze seven times we are coming back to that epes what was it meaning they aimed that and then relax you know you know was the beginning they had the anointing of a lion and they had the truth the purity of the word and then somewhere they began to relax is simply you know it simply talks about two things death and bitterness you know and you know the as the church started now to receive persecution and you know means married the church now married [Music] state became one the church and the politics married and there that was the beginning of the Roman Catholic Church movement but remember in each of of these ages God had a star Messer that kept the light shining it might have been a little light but it was shining any it kept life in and then come after [Music] p means the dominating female that is when the doct of the trity the whole now almost the truth was lost God had a little light God had a little light in that praise God hallelujah hallelujah oh my I wish I go in the details come s you know s means the escaped on why because this was the era or the age of Martin Luther protestantism started when there was gross Darkness covering the Earth amen God had his little star Martin Luther came and he began to Shine the Light of the World by preaching they just shall live by fa alone you know he escaped the false Church system and began the Reformation movement which we call the Protestant movement and then comes the 60th Church age Philadelphia Philadelphia means brotherly kindness brotherly love this was a generation where the gospel went all over the world and the star of that age being a man called John Wiley a man who preached love a man who preached sanctification amen man who preached that if you have love for your brother you are going to go and give him the gospel amen a man who preached if you you you you have amen Christ in you if you're truly justified by faith you must truly be Sanctified by the word of God you know and then after Philadelphia then comes the Street Revival which amen brought a new era of Pentecostalism also this was the beginning of the last age last Candlestick are you following me now the last cand praise God and then you know means people's rights that's why I say we are here we are in we people's rights Women rights children's rights homosexual rights everybody's rights this is the time this is the last age the seventh age then where is the seventh star the Seven Star must be here oh we are not in each Church age have a St messenger by the grace of God go the last one would actually be the Elijah to the Gentiles Hallelujah I want to say this is not a coincidence some people like Alexander they thought they were Elijah but their Ministry did not fulfill Elijah ministry as prescribed in the Bible alander thought he was going to restore righteousness and Hol by building cities that are holy phally what they call Zion city in America and he was planning to buy a great big piece of land in Israel to buy a to build a big Zion City there for the Lord we found that that's not the way that Elijah's Ministry would be Elijah's Ministry in the end time would restore all SE Hallelujah not start some religion not start some denomination some some or something or some mement I want to say that's why we believe William his ministry was that of Elijah because it fulfilled everything the Bible said El God spoke to to William BR in 1933 when he was baptizing the 17th person seven again Hallelujah and he spoke to him and said out of the pill of fire thousands of people were there John the Baptist was sent for my first message will on my second God himself declared who El in the end time just like Jesus he came and declared that John Was Elijah Even in our generation Jesus himself through the pill of fire declare that William BR was the Elijah in the praise God then he returned we are back to Kings now he returned and walked in the house to and fro and he stretched himself upon the child and a child sneez seven times and the Child open his the child sneezed one two three four five six times but he still was blind he still was dead awake but dead not yet fully restored but wait until the seven hallelujah hallelujah when the child sneeze the seventh time Hallelujah hallu then his eyes open then it rose from the dead then it was full restoration full restoration the Bible says in the days Revelation 107 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his Revelation 318 can the to buy of me gold tried in the fire that you may be richment that you may be closed that the shame of your nakedness do not appear and anoint your eyes with eyes that you may see Hallelujah I'm just burning up with re when the child sneeze seven times under whose ministry under the ministry of Elisha who had the spirit of Elijah on him and the Bible is telling us in there are going to be seven ages seven gentle ages but remember each age has one steng are you following me and we are finding out that the last St to the seventh Church age will Elijah he's a man with a Ministry that has the anointing and the power of the and the Bible has declared that amen the sounding of the voice of the seventh prophet of the seventh Star Messenger the seventh Star Messenger where he sounds the Myster is finished no more silence amen no more Darkness the mystery is finished the seeds are going to be open the word is going to be open amen Revelation is going to open up why because the seven St messenger is Elijah which the Bible says when elah comes he will all and now the Bible tells us hallelujah under the church age of God is counseling us to buy gold to fire the message of the seventh messenger is God deding the fire the message of the seventh messenger is white reignment the message of the seventh messenger is the eyes sh for our eyes when the child sneezed the seventh time his eyes were open when you receive the message of Elijah in your days your eyes of understanding will open up hallelujah hallelujah you can no longer be blind Hallelujah all the Mysteries will be opened up to you the message of the Gentile en time Elijah finishes the mystery the church amen the church would be blind no more tell your neighbor the church would be blind no more all the mysteries of the world would be revealed all things would be restored would be open up I say hallelujah we have arrived at that time oh we are not blind the Bible says that the would be blind and they would not know thank God for Elijah Ministry our because we will not be blind God has opened the eyes of understanding praise God and I finish up with's case Second Kings 59 so man came with his horses and with his Chariot and stood at the door of the House of elishah and elah sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in Jo seven times and they and thy flesh be shall come again to thee and thou shall be clean but was R like very many people today they don't want to believe the message of they very angry when you talk about it I'm sorry to say they will remain dir they will remain dir they have to receive the message of the seventh angel messenger coming at the seventh time Gentile seven churches Hallelujah and N the Bible says was Ro and went away and said behold I thought we have had a messenger that has come to us and he says lean not on your own understanding God wants to do everything I have showed knew that the ministry of Elijah does if you want food God wants to give you food if you want
