with our bible study um the philadelphia church age i know we had reached some place and so we're just going to proceed with that all right so we're going to start the edge of the open door so i want us to to do the listening and then we shall do the discussion amen okay so i'm going to play this uh from the edge of the open door you can follow you can follow in your book filthy wares god raised up mighty warriors of faith and the greatest works of christ okay did we finish the edge of the open door i think sorry we finished the salutation last time so we're supposed to be beginning with the edge of the open door the age of the open door okay revelation 3 8 i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast to little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name the first phrase of this verse i know thy works is analyzed in the rest of the verse for their works had to do with the open door little strength the word and the name in order to understand the wealth of meaning involved in behold i set before you an open door and no man can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age there is an overlapping a melting or fading into rather than an abrupt end and a clear-cut start this age particularly flows into the next stage and not only does this age overflow into the last stage but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of pentecost once the philadelphian age has about run its course the laodicean age quickly comes in bringing both the tears and the wheat to harvest first bind the tears to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn matthew 13 30. remember please that the sardisian age started the reformation that must still go on until the grain that was planted at pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing etc until it comes right back to original seed while this is going on the tears that were sown will have to go through their cycle and be harvested also that is exactly what we see happening if you can just think of the seasons you can get a very good picture of this the plant that you see growing in full strength in summer suddenly appears to be going to seed you can't tell exactly when summer became autumn it just faded into it that is how the ages are and especially these last two it is to this age that jesus says i come quickly verse 11. that makes the last stage a very short one laodicea is the age of the quick work it is cut short now we will specifically dwell on the open door that no man can shut first of all i want to dwell on the open door as signifying the tremendous missionary effort of that age paul called a new missionary endeavor for the lord and open door second corinthians 2 12 furthermore when i came to troas to preach christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord so we can see by the comparison of scriptures that this open door signified the greatest spreading of the gospel that the world has ever seen i want you to see something here god works in threes doesn't he it was in the third or pergament age that the church was married to the state the deeds of the nicolaitans had become the doctrine of the nicolaitans that age was the open door for the false vine once it was backed up by the power of the state it became actually a world system even though it bore the name christian thus it spread like wildfire but now three ages later after a long and hard struggle of faith here comes the open door to the truth the word of the lord now has its day of course the fifth age had set the stage for this mighty move as that age gave us exploration colonization the printing of books etc it would have been wonderful if this open door had followed the divine pattern of pentecost which was set forth in hebrews two one through four therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will now you know that this is the pattern for jesus himself said so mark 16 15-20 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen he never told them to go into all the world and establish bible colleges nor did he tell them to pass out literature now these things are fine but what jesus told them to do was to preach the gospel stick with the word and then the signs would follow the very first introduction we have in the way the kingdom of god was to be preached was when he sent out the twelve in matthew 10 1-8 he commissioned and instructed them on this wise and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and labias whose surname was stadius simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give this ministry that he gave them was actually the sharing of his own ministry with them for it says in matthew 9 35-38 and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest now many people have the idea that just the apostles had this ministry given them by our lord jesus and so when they died the ministry was over that is not so here in luke 10 1 through 9 we find that in the days of his earthly sojourn he had already started to give ministries of power to his own after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whether he himself would come therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into his harvest go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves carry neither purse nor script nor shoes and salute no man by the way and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this house and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the laborer is worthy of his hire go not from house to house and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you who would dare deny the mighty ministry of philip who would dare to deny the mighty ministries of iranians martin patrick and countless scores of others who have had god's anointing upon them yes the bible way is the real way of the open door and i want to add my testimony to that the reason i have to do that is because i can only speak with assurance concerning what god has done in my own life so if you'll excuse a personal note here i will tell you how i know for a surety that jesus is the same yesterday and today and forever and that the power of god is still available to those who will believe and receive during my missionary trip to south africa god so blessed that when i came to durban the only place that could begin to accommodate the people was the huge racetrack which is the second largest in the world the crowd was well over one hundred thousand in order to keep law and order they had to put up fences to separate the various tribes they posted hundreds of policemen to keep the throngs quieted down those hungry souls had come for many miles a queen from rhodesia had come with a train of 27 coaches loaded with african natives they struggled in across the fields and mountains bearing on their backs for many and many a mile some loved one that needed help the whole country was stirred by the mighty works that had been manifested by the holy spirit one afternoon as i began to minister one of thousands of the muhammadans came up on the platform as she stood before me a missionary to the muhammadans began to softly implore the lord oh for that precious soul oh for that precious soul he had been over there for years and years and according to his own testimony he had seen only one muhammadan come to receive jesus christ as savior they were originally the medo persians whose laws change not they are so hard to win it seems that once a always a is a law amongst them well as she stood before me i began to speak to her and to all those thousands through the interpreters i said is it not so that the missionaries have told you of a jesus who came to save you you should have seen the people look at each other when i said that then when they had answered that was correct i went on and said but did the missionaries read to you out of this book i held my bible a lot for them to see that this same jesus was a mighty healer and that he would live in his people down through the ages until he came again to receive them unto himself did they tell you that because of that same spirit in them that was in jesus that they would be able to do mighty works even as jesus did did they tell you that you can be healed even as you can be saved how many of you would like to see this same jesus come down amongst us and do the same things that he did when he was here on earth long ago they all wanted that that is one thing they surely agreed on i then went on if jesus by his spirit will do what he did when upon earth will you believe his word then and here was that muhammadan woman in front of me the spirit began to move through me i said to her now you know that i don't know you i can't even speak your language she admitted that i said as for healing you you know i cannot but you heard the message this afternoon and understood me her indian interpreter answered back for her that she understood for she had read the new testament now the muhammadans are descendants of abraham they believe in one god but they reject jesus as the son of god and instead they take muhammad as his prophet they say that jesus never died and rose again they are taught that by their priests and they believe it i said but jesus did die and rise again he sent his spirit back upon the church that spirit that was in him is the very same spirit in the church now and it can and will produce what jesus produced he said in john 5 19 the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also doeth the sun likewise now then if jesus will come and reveal to me what your trouble is or what you are here for if he can tell me what your past is surely you can believe for the future she said through her interpreter yes i can i said all right may he do it those muhammadans were watching intently they were all leaning forward to see what would happen then the holy spirit spoke your husband is a short heavyset man with a black mustache you have two children you were at the doctors about three days ago and he gave you an examination you have a cyst on the womb she bowed her head and said that is true i asked her how is it you came to me a christian why didn't you go to your muhammadan prophet she said i think you can help me i said i can't help you but if you receive jesus christ as your savior he who is here now and knows all about you he'll help you she said i accept jesus as my savior that did it she was healed and about ten thousand muhammadans came to christ that day because the gospel was preached in both word and power god never told a man to labor thirty years and harvest nothing he gave us the open door of word and power and that is what we are supposed to use that is what gave paul his great and effective ministry first corinthians 2 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power listen to uh i just want to make a few comments a few remarks i hope you've been following yes now um you see here he speaks of the age he calls philadelphia the age of the open door and when did philadelphia start according to brother barnum and when did it stop i'm talking about the age you do not know well go right ahead and check the other time i remember you were speaking uh the dates very with much ease now you have forgotten all of the sudden okay when does it start by the polyglot to 1906. and when does do you remember when azusa street took place azusa street revival azusa street that they're outpowering at azusa you've i did we not discuss about that sometime back yes we did i even had you watch the movie on the azusa street regarding the testimonies of people who were there at azusa did you not watch that how many did watch it now i can see i'm amazed that you people can forget that way we did uh maybe you maybe it might have been my few family members yeah but i i remember you we did i didn't show it to you on this screen up here so you see uh that event took place in 1906. we see that that was now the breaking forth of the pentecostal movement or the the beginning of the pentecostal era or time but that's why as we were listening but the banham says that uh uh quickly this philadelphia the elevation church educates the last quickly starts when this philadelphian age is almost coming to an end and the other one quickly starts so it's like it it just uh starts at the climax of the other one now we see that uh the philadelphian age was an edge of the open door yes just like the scripture saying that that behold i give you an open door but one thing that i wanted to comment on here he says that the open door okay let's uh let me read that portion for you which makes him to give his testimony he says yes the bible way is the real way of the open door and i want to add my testimony to that the reason i have to do that is because i can only speak with assurance concerning what god has done in my own life so if you will excuse a personal note here i will tell you how i know for a surety that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and the power of god is still available to those who will believe and receive now here is how about abandonment defines the open door but the bottom defines the open door as jesus christ the same yesterday and forever and he says that the bible way is the way is the real way of the open door some people think that uh you know the open door means that uh blessings and um you know you you know going through life and overcoming but actually in this generation the open door that god had given to the messenger and the people in that generation was an open door to take the word okay they were able to take the word to all the nations of the earth and many missionaries died even here in africa you've no doubt been in school and you have been able to learn about the missionaries it's a subject in which language in which subject history or sst in primary do they study about missionaries in primary school yes missionaries so there's those missionaries uh when did they go out it was between 1750 and 1906 that was the time of the great missionaries that went out you know god gave them so much love within their hearts to love the others and you see that if you love the others the best you can do is to give them the word you cannot claim that you love someone and you don't give them the word then that means you do not love them so we see that but abanamiya gives his testimony of how then god gave him an open door and of course him being the the the audition church age messenger to the last church age uh he was able uh to have god gave him an open door we know that uh his ministry was in three pools ah you remember that what was the first pull of the ministry of the prophet when i said pool it could it would also mean phases three phases that his ministry was in three phases just like we have had read up there he said that god always works in threes in threes in threes so what was the first phase or the first pool of his ministry the miracles yes and how did the miracles happen healing remember he was given a sign that sign was like the one that moses was given of putting his fist under his uh you remember how much was it was told and then when it removed it was reprocessed when took back removed it was here so i told him that when you touch people by your right hand you will be able to dictate to detect by vibrations what is wrong with them you would you that's how he was doing it and when the the the the disease goes out he would be able to detect also and satan has gone that way that worked in his first in the first phase of his ministry and then comes the the the second phase of his ministry what was it sorry disarmament okay can someone one of you explain disarmament yes well that is true discernment is being able to tear the secrets of one's heart of course jesus had that but and we noticed from jesus by the way did you know that from jesus no one had that designment of the heart because that was a messianic sign you can try and remember when that woman was designed she ran to the city and told them come see a man who has told me the secrets of my heart isn't this the very messiah she recognized that jesus was the messiah because of designing her heart and the nine spiritual gifts of the bible of the book of acts in the new testament he talks about the nine spiritual gifts now we talked about them the other time now those nine spiritual gifts that is what we call designate of spirit or designment of spirits but what actually the prophet had was designated of the heart like he did not only design the spirits of people but he would design the very the very heart of the people and you cannot truly do that unless you know those people and that's only god who knows us and so it was not him but it was god who would come in the meeting to vindicate the ministry of brother bana before the people and that was the second phase the second pool of his ministry it brought people towards him and people really accepted this ministry but then there is that third pool or third phase of his ministry which very many people have uh were stumbled when it was started to starting to get manifested so was it also in the days of jesus jesus when he was manifesting the third pool he remember what he said he said if you do not drink my flesh and you don't drink my if you don't eat my flesh and you don't drink my blood you are not part of me now the people were offended how can you tell us to be vampires they all ran away because they fail to understand that jesus was speaking to only those that he came for his ministry was now coming into do you know that all these things that happened in the first and second pool were good and were part of his ministry but they were not the real purpose why he came the real purpose why he came was to be able to attract those people that where he is before the foundation of the world by the revelation of the third pool okay what's the third pool the third pool is the revelation of the word it is not no longer the signs and wonders it's no longer the discernment and the great miracles but now it is the word the revelation the revelation the revealing of the word the revealing of himself the revealing of the son of man you understand what i'm saying talking about in revelation 17 30. now i want to show you this what does it say in revelation 17 that somebody read it out from your bible right now what does it say um did i say revelation i meant to say luke 17 30. excuse me luke 17 30. check it out and tell me what it says okay are you there and he said nay father abraham but if one went and to them from the dead they will repent and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded thou though one rose from the dead you're reading a wrong part you read in chapter 16 even thus shall it be in the day in the day when the son of man is revealed wait a moment what is he talking about when he says even thus meaning even like that but if you want to know the conditions he's talking about you can see them from the verses before verse 17 verse 30. he says that in the days of lord they married you know they did that until the fire came and burnt them all in the days of noah you know and now he says even thus in the same way it shall be when the in the days when the son of man is being revealed are you hearing me who is the son of man the son of man jesus christ jesus christ is the son of man right yes now the son of man would be revealed okay yes now but remember jesus christ has three offices jesus has three offices as a son what is his first officer yes son of man is his first office son of man is what he reveals himself as a prophet prophetic ministry son of man prophet prophetic ministry and in that same anointing he is able to go and die he actually concludes that ministry by being killed by dying and becoming a sacrifice he died after prophesying for three years and a half he was killed on the cross and he died and rose again and then after the resurrection he came on the day of pentecost and when he came under that pentecost he is no longer son of man but he is son of god now son of god is the holy spirit dispensation it's a god working in the form of the holy spirit so today is son of god if we believe him we receive him in our in our hearts as son of god now him who also is the son of god must also come back again as a son of david when does he come outside the son of david sorry speak loudly he really comes as the son of david on the day of judgment okay because that's when he's sitting actually not before before even the day of judgment but actually in the millennium because in the millennium that's when he's seated on the throne of david he's a king because son of david is a king in the tribulation he is um he is uh still the savior he is redeeming not the savior to the gentiles but the savior to the jews because he has also to save the 144 thousand what jews so he has to be revealed to them as a son of man son of god and son of david because remember by the bottom says they receive the holy spirit just like we did so everything he is to eat to us he has to be to them during the tribulation while the gentile church is going through their own chaos and now we see that he come now finally as son of david in the millennium and on the day of judgment now here is another part i want you to see that when he says in the book of luke 17 30 that even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed so the son of man is is going to be revealed now remember the son of man is rule the son of man is who jesus christ right jesus now that jesus being revealed as a pro it is prophetic ministry ministering to us so we notice that brother bannon is a prophet but actually brother banham was not revealing him himself just like john was not revealing himself john was revealing jesus christ you remember he says um in the book of john chapter one um well is it john chapter one he says he was not that light talking about john huh you you you read it open it in your bible you see we're in a bible study so we cannot justify to things without reading them john chapter one open in john chapter one are you there okay i want you to look at um verses uh six there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might be he was not that light but was saying to bear okay are you seeing that and who is that light jesus is the light so we said that john was only saying to bear witness of that light so brother banham was not the light but obama was not the son of man but this son of man that was going to be revealed was jesus christ so brother branham as a messenger just like john was revealing to the people the son of man you understand it so but that's why when he would design that people would tell them who did the touch who did he touch he never touched me i'm not even close to them but who did they touch you know that woman who touched jesus and jesus was able to to heal you without even you know turning so he said that it's not me i'm a man but it is jesus who is here revealing himself to us so the ministry of the prophet has been able to reveal the son of man to us how in the form of the revealing of the word that's the third pool the revelation of the one the demolition of jesus christ which is the revelation of the wife and that even under this third phase of his ministry now he has to manifest his presence he has to manifest his power he has to manifest you understand because this is the place this is the time when he has to uh show his presence to be among us who have received this third phase how many understand that you don't understand that what part don't you understand it's all right go ahead and ask we're in a bible study all right it's good you can air your confusion okay the last part that talks about what three phases the first phase was the phase of healing miracles the second phase was there's you know the discernment designing the people's hearts and all that you know then the the the third phase was the revelation of the world it has already happened and we are walking in that third phase we're already in the third pool the third phase of his ministry not actually the minister of brother but the minister of christ in our day we are living in that time so we have already accepted the word and now we are waiting for him to come and do it claim us hallelujah you know that part of claiming he's going to come and claim even jesus he purchased us that's that's the first phase the second phase he intercedes for us and in the third phase he claims us to himself in the rapture so always god works in threes into this entity so we say here in the philadelphia church age but the banham actually did talk about those trees also somewhere did i see that somewhere here so there is somewhere where you talked about the threes and he said that i'm trying to find that part if you do find that part before i do please let us know where it is i think it should be that portion where i was reading it was in the third oh pagaman age that the church was married to the state the deeds of the nicolas had become the doctrine of the nicolaitans that's in the pegamon church age right that age was the up that age was the open door for the fourth vine that age that's when they started to come in once it was backed up by the power of the state it became actually a wild system even though it it bore the name it had the name christian thus it spread like wildfire but now three ages later because remember after pegamos then then tatira after that then then studies so how many edges how many edges then comes the third philadelphia so after three ages but now after three ages later or three ages later after a long and a hard struggle of faith here comes the open door to the truth you know this reminds me the story of akimas ahimas and kush one day i don't know if i didn't talk about it in the chat but it's a very interesting story you know the job told kush to run and go tell the king the news of what has happened on the battlefield and he ran with all his might and before actually he started to run around with all his might then kev akima's ahimas came from nowhere he said i had the noise i had the rise i had the noise i also want to go and tell the king he said but you are going to tell the king what he said please just allow me i'm feeling the fire i'm feeling the anointing i'm feeling whatever i want to go and tell the king what has happened he said because they troubled him he said okay fine you can't go. so but the man did not know what happened so when he reached he read he even took a shortcut he did not use the the real way took a shortcut and when he reached the king where the king was he the king asks him how tell me is my son absolutely okay hallelujah glory to god or whatever it is you see i had a lot of noise and people were shouting at the ah and then i also i told you what was that said i said it is my son absolutely my life said oh king i tell you i heard out of the noise i was about and then i said i have to come and tell you what he said you just stand there because he wasn't aware he didn't have the real news just stand there and and be quiet he told him just stand there and be quiet and then kush was running slow at sure but he was on the right way huh he arrived also and when he arrived and then he talked to the king the king was so happy to hear his news and he said he's my son absolutely my life and and and kush was like oh oh long live the king for sure your son you know he he was uh they were running after him and then he was trapped within a tree and and job finished him off and so he died ah the king started crying and sobbing because his son absalom was dead because his son was staging a coup by the way but he eventually died but he didn't want him to die anyway so what does it teach us it teaches us that usually the one who doesn't have the right news or the right message wants to run fast and they finish you before the right message comes that's why even jesus christ said oh those who came before me were thieves and robbers you know can you imagine that's what jesus would say all the pharisees said this is that they were all thieves and robbers but i'm the one i'm the bread of life i am so in the same way here the the first church the first vine had its open door in in in what in in in pegamos pegamos remember that's what that was the time when they the first church started out and they had their own wrong systems and then you know wrong they made their own marriage state and and the church and they married together came together as one and they decided to enforce the wrong doctrines but by the power of the state you remember that so that's when the wrong seed was planted the wrong seed really got established and actually the bible talks about the throne of saturn itself being in pegamos so we see that that time was the time of your paper for the for the for the first vine but here after three ages three i love three three it's got the number of perfection hallelujah three ages later hallelujah three ages later i said what three ages later calm a time of the open door for the true vine do you love this yes he says but now three ages later after a long struggle of faith here comes the open door to there the word of the lord has its day the word the lord has his death of course the fifth age had set the stage of this the study for this mighty move as the aid gave us exploration colonization and the printing of books which age was that the 50th age what was the fifth age saddis sadist during sadist that's when you saw a lot of uh invasions happening you know there was the colonization took place during the that time god permitted it by the all this is the plan of god don't think that it's happening just like that it's all a part of god sister richard colonization to happen and for us to be under the english almost half of the world was under the english and we learned english language look at me speaking english english language yet i'm a black man from africa look at you even sometimes some people they behave as if they don't understand anything if they don't hear in english yet they are black men from african women so what am i talking about god permitted that because that was setting the stage for the open door that would come in the age of philadelphia this is really good good things for us to learn the exploration you know you remember the explorers yes who which explorer do you know sansa will baker who else was he an expert as well okay wow all right you to expo exploration explorers in a in your level of education sst op5 yeah oh yeah yeah you're right then we have uh the after the explorers then comes colonization all that happened in service service yeah we are learning the church ages and the church ages involves the history of the church it involves what happened before so that you can know what is happening now so we see that then there was the age of studies and sadis in sadness we see the exploration happening we see colonization happening we see the critical books excuse me that's when the printing press was invented are you aware you remember read about that in studies the inversion of the printing press actually it is said that it was invented for for printing the word because the one who invented it even made losses and sold it off to and they used it for printing bibles and things hallelujah so we see god allow that to to happen so it can set a stage are you following me so you can set a stage for what for the open door which would come in the philadelphia and church age now the philosophy of the church age was the missionaries that's why people wouldn't believe christianity they tell you the same white man who colonized you is the same white man who is coming and now giving you the word you have had them select that hey the white man is the one who brought the gun and killed us and then he's now turning coming back again with the bible ah and then they think it's a white man's gospel no it's not a white man's gospel if you notice all these messengers not all of them are from the same nation they've been coming from different areas others from germany others from the usa others from england others from you understand from all over and when you see as we shall when when we finish the pharah buffy and church edge and we start laudation before we we really go into the depth of the of the roundation church eight you will notice there was a revival which we can call the pentecostal revival the azusa street revival the time when the holy ghost came down and filled people at that time it was not because but the banham came much later after the outpouring of the holocaust of azusa street excuse me because that happened a substitute revival happened in 1906 but abandoned was born in 1909 azusa street revival that we're going to study about azusa street revival when we finish the philadelphia church age i think we shall begin with that before we go into the radiation church age but the azusa street revival started because that was the bath in a nutshell the bath not the drill bath but the rebath because it was at the door pentacles right but the rebirth of the pentecostal movement people talking in tongues people praying for the sick people praying in the spirit people shouting people rolling on the floor people healing the sick people you understand that kind of thing that you know people believing in holiness people you know you know believing in the real god and leaving god the same yes they're doing forever you know that kind of move in uganda we used to call them up and when we went back you know papyrus people who were praying in papyrus because they didn't have well-built churches like the ones that the missionaries had built so that revival started out in but you see if you notice very well as we shall see it was also spearheaded by a black man so it's not like god has forgotten about black people it was appearing by a black man although it was not like a a church edge messenger because you'll notice that that movement was spearheaded his name is palm palm we read about that and so you will see that actually we will take that day when we finish the elephant church age i want us to take like a full day talking about the the the azusa street revival because we need to know those uh foundations and those backgrounds and so then after that comes the rotation church age and brother banham came much later that's why but the banham is a not a it doesn't bring new things really his ministry doesn't bring new things because as elijah he is only to tie the loose ends together do you know what that means everything is done you're just going to to put it the cake is built the cake is rather not beautiful the cake is cooked you're just going to do it to put the icing you understand that's what brother bannon does in his ministry as a leader because everything is restored because remember matarutha brings forth restoration but actually it is that information but he brings the restoration of justification by faith alone in christ not the church and then we now come to this age um of uh philadelphia who's the messenger of philadelphia john wisley in this age now we see another second work of grace coming into view as in our generation and that is by who by who who brings this who spirits this movement who spirits this revival who spearheads this reformation or into the second work of grace john weasley and what does he talk about sanctification sanctification sanctification by grace yeah through grace yes the gift of god right we understand the justification comes in by rudder martin luther then john weasley sanctification of course then that's when you talk about holiness and so these things of ordinance teaching ordinance how to dress how to you know even appearances and even from your heart how to live right and repentance it is not our doctrine it's not what we saw to us we started it was the apostles it the roman catholic church took out that teaching and that john weasley is the one who revived it you see and and john windsor he was the one who you know spared that movement and it started other denominations you know their problem was to start other denominations because whenever they started denomination after the movement it dies it dies it dies it dies and the god continues on moving so when luther died the people started luther and church and they said for us we are lutherans meaning they were believing what rudolf preached but what did luther preach luther only preached justification by faith you only preached faith faith faith faith you believe not you do but you believe just believe all is well believe believe believe so you find people who are like john calvin john calvin took that and he we went overboard with it he said no matter what you do just go and do whatever you want to do no problem as long as you believe you see that's now lutheran lutheran kind of ideology calvinist it's called calvinism you know they just say you go and drink your alcohol as long as you believe you go and forgive as long as you be nothing that can touch your soul as long as your soul is just have faith in god and no matter what you do it doesn't count before god ah it feels so nice you know but actually that is communism it's only going hyper on one direction and doesn't balance the gospel you understand then god sends another man called john wesley now john wiesel is that who preaches love sanctification holiness how can you claim to love god how can you come to believe in god and you still drink you still smoke yourself from again you still can be about it how would you do would you do that and then he brings in this those scriptures of john with uh of of james show me your faith by your works it is by your works and that's why he was moving the people and shaking them from only believing believing believing and continuing doing the wrong things to believing and doing what you're supposed to do that's why the gospel during the philadelphia age became a doing gospel a gospel of what that's why you find people they they were at that time from 1750 around them a man a man like you would come to your wife and the children you said dear i've had the gospel and i believe it but i should not only believe it what am i have i done i want to go to africa you know what it means to go to africa even if i tell you to go to karamoja now you say oh please that's the punishment i want to go to africa and preach the gospel to those people in the in the woods if i don't come back if i die there they knew the risks if i don't come back and if i die we shall meet at jesus's feet they would sing a song till we meet till we meet till we meet at jesus deal with me the mother would cry the baby would cry the children would cry the wife would cry the mother man will cry but he said i have to go and do what i say i believe till we meet god be with you till we meet again and the man would go and many of them incidentally were killed and murdered by animals others by people who were hostile tribes others you know the problems the missionaries found even one of them david livingston was killed here uh you know it is saying was is it the one that they said that the king said that uh and the other one thought that he meant you know because muhammad means to release him and means to kill him so the other ones i think he was in saga they said the others they said they thought that he meant and they killed the man see so many of them were killed that way all because of the love they had in their hearts to go and take the gospel that's how you see how the bible society was even also inaugurated and many other you know things because they had this love within them to go they would come here build schools they would come here the germans those germany missionaries all those people they would come here forget about their home and leave here with the people build hospitals build the schools build and be here to live the gospel not only to preach it but leave it you see so therefore it's not us who started preaching works that we believe also in the works it was that was the second work of grace sanctification which was actually in the gospel of john wisley who was the fifth church age messenger the fifth or the sixth the sixth actually the different church age and then after that then came their pentecostal movement over to street revival now that they believed in the holy ghost the gifts of if you claim you are believers the real believers and you have been justified and you have been sanctified where is the power of god in your midst where is the power of god you see they were hungering and fasting for that and god gave it to them the power of god the gifts came down in abundance they would even talking tanks this was before but abandoned even came on the scene you see and but abandoned comes much later much like 20 years later to start the ministry and he found already when they were already manipulated the coast was movements times and waters already happening but when his ministry started it was very different because his minister that the end time elijah was to restore to tie the loose ends together huh the teachings already everything is already there but now he needs to put it everything in line what was left to tell you people just clean up yeah okay now he's like a supervisor you know you already cleaned he's coming for you and do that huh yeah and that's what this message is doing hallelujah so we are not demonizing others we are simply saying we have received perfection now you get a point so um that is it it's a very good study by the way we have done that on that line if you really look at it in that direction oh my it just opens your heart and you are able to see many many things in the word of god and in history what has been happening over the ages did i give out any parts but abandoned then he gives his testimony of the muhammadan and i was that muhammad and god was able to receive christ because she uh accepted to be to to see the living messiah actually this the edge of the open door meaning that god makes an open door for you and no man is you can dare to shout it may god give us that open door even us even now so that we can be able to preach this message without fear of favor and leave it not only preach it but leave it that's the best preaching you can ever do so i'd like us to unless you there's a question and i'd like us to proceed with uh the listening that we have been doing yes can you do it for us and then you ask your question have you seen that portion okay read it about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw them attitudes he was moved with compassion from them because they fainted and we are scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then say he and to his disciples the harvest truly is plain tears but the laborers are few pray he therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his habits now many people have the idea that just the apostles at this ministry give given them by our lord jesus and so when they died the ministry was over that is not so here is luke chapter 10 verse 1 to 9. we find that in the days of of his acne sojourn he had already started to give ministries of power to his own after these things the lord appointed other 70 also and sent them to and before his face into every city and place whether he himself would come there are four said he unto them they have destroyed is great but the laborers are few pray therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth liberating his harvest go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves carry neither personal scrape your shoes and salute no man by dave and into whatsoever house he had first said peace be to his this house and if the son of the peace be there your peace shall rest upon it and if not it shall turn to you again so my question was about deliverance yes yeah it says that the harvest is truly great or plenty us but the laborers are a few now brother the laborers here is talking about the preachers he's talking about the people who are going out who go out in the field to preach and those who do that are the laborers we are the laborers we are laboring laboring is to go out and carry the gospel the weight of the gospel to the people so those are deliverers so the field is the harvest is great meaning the people who need the gospel are there and there are so many but the laborers are few but those people who are ready to sacrifice everything and commit their lives to go and preach for the sake of the gospel they are few they are few and indeed it is true tell me how many within how many families have you seen someone saying one of the children saying well me i want to serve god if you ask every one of them what do you want to do what do you want do i do you want to everybody i want to be a doctor i want to be a what an engineer i want to be i want to be i want to be a policeman i want to be a soldier no one wants to be a preacher everybody's running away from it that's why when god wants to call you he arrests you when you're still young some of us could not be able to escape it when he arrested us we tried to run away but we couldn't you see so the laborers are few and they said pray either for the lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into his field harvest okay so and then he says go away i send you i send you islams among wolves don't think it is easy whenever we go out to preach the gospel to introduce the message to the people it's not easy when you go to talk about jesus among the people you become the enemy of the society it's not easy never think that when you go out to preach everybody's just going to accept me ah thank you for coming hey others can even abuse you others can do whatever they want to do against you when you talk about the word they just don't waste our time look at you now you're just wasting your life how old are you even you see they think they have this mentality that only all the men of 50 60 should preach why because they think they have nothing to do you know no me i started preaching when i was 13 and since then i never stopped until now and i will continue until i become 90. if the lord gives me a long life you see because i believe it's not the gospel is not only for the young the gospel is not only for the old the gospel is for the young and old as long as you are labor and god has sent you into the field you go and preach it not very many people are proud of their children if they decide to preach the word you know but let me tell you when god calls a laborer when god calls you to labor in his vineyard in whichever way it may not only be preaching you find that this missionaries when they were going out they had people who were there like doctors actually many of these missionaries were doctors themselves they like who like who they do was a doctor and albert cook even here he started a hospital here huh man goes peter so many of these were doctors a man he has his own profession he's earning money but he decided he says let me go and serve the lord not only in scripture but also in my career there you are so if you have a career if you think you do you should use it for the glory of god and be a laborer in the field of the lord hallelujah that is a big challenge now huh you are the one who brought it out may have knocked it out you see so you you need to to pray about being a laborer in the field you see you know if you know for example you were in the church and you were serving the lord with something these days young people do it for pay can you imagine they go to church to play piano for pay they go to to sing for pray they go to can you imagine they have they have tried to make the gospel business yes they have tried to make it like merchandise they're merchandising the gospel you know employment opportunity i will go be a you know cut a pastor's bag for money i will go you know oh dear the world is rotten rotten completely yet this gospel is dripping with blood there are people who give their own lives for the sake of what they believed in to be the truth so really these days we find young people because after all i don't get any payment of charge i'm just there you know i'm just doing it by my own free will so i can do whenever i want and whenever i don't want i can run away i don't even need to you know that's not right you know i remember me when i started serving the lord in the church of course i never got anything from the church but i was doing it with all my heart i started with the praying just praying for the for the believers i would just be there evident i need to pray for them from there i said the song some reading you know someone reading maybe one of you god can use you to some read you know i started some reading you know and when i started the song reading i was song reading not for money and i was always there okay i was i was sure that i would be there not for the pastor not for the church but for my god for the sake of my god and i would do it i was always there and then from there i became a preacher and i was always there i would preach almost three four times a day when i was a young man you know 15 years for 16 17. three or four times a week you know and i'm at school you know sometimes i would even i'm not ready to do that but i'd rather even escape at school to go and preach you know and god was with me he gave me grace because i had this zeal within my heart i want to serve god you understand so there is always you know you find even not only women men also men women they need a lot to be able to to be laborers in the field for example when you see jesus in his ministry never chose um women to be among the 12 disciples but yet in his ministry you find women there helping the bible doesn't document them a lot but like mary magdalene she was always going where he was going you know she was delivered like mary like uh salome also there are several women well in the municipal there were women all around sometimes yeah also you know but you know the women have always been there laboring for the lord you understand you see laboring for the lord does not necessarily mean preaching going there to preach i'm going to be a powerful preacher so i can never for the lord necessarily it doesn't mean that way even if you're a man or a woman laboring for the lord means to yield your life and give it for the service of the lord whatever you can do for another person for the sake of the lord is laboring for the lord you understand sometimes it may be giving money sometimes it may be helping someone in need sometimes maybe praying for the pastor praying for the preacher so you know you just said me you know no one has told me but i'm going to be praying every day for 20 minutes or 15 or 10 or 5 whatever or whenever before i go to bed i want to give something i want to pray for the ministry you do it that's laboring for the lord you see you can say me i'm always going to be the one to buy the water that the preacher will preach we will be drinking i'm going to always do it you know you don't even have the money but it's the law they provide me you don't promise anyone but they always see you bringing it by paying this is for water this is for water you see another one there are many ways of laboring for the lord you see me i'll always sweep the chat i will always do it i don't need anyone tell me i'll always go you know that is laboring for the lord our all is witness i always tell others there's always something that you can do every time to labor for the lord it is a lot that we can do in labor for our god praise the lord amen okay have i answered your question do not cut your shoes not carry this not cover that okay what is it about yes don't worry about where where money will come from don't worry about where shoes will come from don't worry about where that will come from god is another one saying i will take care of you it means do not waste your time in the the things of the world you know you see you said that let's say i am going to to to to to the shop and then before you reach the shop you find your friend my friend don't go in nonsense if you have a vision and a mission even in your own life don't waste it with the people of no value don't rest it in things with things of no value you see for me when i want to talk i talk to when i begin talking to you you may think this one has nothing to do because i'm realizing in my heart there is a value in talking to you me i don't talk to people with with nobody if i realize this one this seed there is no seed of god in their heart i don't even waste my time i don't even waste my time you see whether they give me money or not i don't waste i don't want i want to waste my time it will not be wasting i want to spend my time on the vision and the mission that god has given me what is it what is it to be a laborer and if i'm going to be a laborer what does the master want to see he finished the building so i don't have time to waste any greeting and talking and doing this he doesn't certainly greet people by the way don't interpret these things literally because you will begin becoming proud you are not a great it means that we barefoot even not get clothes do you just be you know that's not what he means but he he instead means you say don't waste your time in worrying where the money for those things will come from or wasting your time with them if you want a change to come to you you even have to change your connections this is what i did myself if you want to go to change you if you want to go to work on you if you want to go to take you to another level then you have to get yourself out of the place where you are like you told abram get out of the place where you are if your friends won't change then change them you get a point check them get other friends you know if your friends won't see what you you see then get others who will see what you say keep yourself around good influence keep yourself around good influence so that you can be able to influence others but if you have the influence around you is negative negative bad bad you will also be in that kind that kind of thing you know this is what they call memes these days i didn't even know who was it was it you or someone i don't know i think it was someone else uh there's a young man who posted it on a what's up and they said what is this now he said our pastor is just a meme sounds like what do you mean by a man what does that mean i don't even know what a name is you know honestly even now i'm here to study on it what does that mean meme he said even good luck i didn't realize that now i'm growing up i thought i was young you see that the influence in this generation is so big you know you are around people all the time posting memes it may no means and you're also very visiting memes wasting valuable time wasting valuable time you find that what you are doing is what they are doing because you are in their society in their web let me tell you if you want to go to about something be in the web of people that have already amounted to something so that you too can be like them you will always realize you become like the people you are around always you dress like them you talk like them you'll behave like them you will do the things they do even when you don't want to do them if you are around friends who always smoke weed you you a christian but for them they smoke like their nose and the other thing you you you when you say that in the first day oh you didn't run and then next time because they are still your friends you know you will go around them again and then you realize again they smoke puffing it and then you're like by the way okay you received and you ran away then again you see at the third time when you see the fact by the way even the way it happens it looks yeah elegant why don't i try it out you know so the devil will keep on pulling you pulling you're trapping you and the moment it helps you to come out of that trap it will take the buddhas of the holy ghost to get you out so that's why it's very good for us to keep ourselves around with a good type of influence yes all right so shall we now continue we have only about 30 minutes to close when he says muhammadan yes he means the muslims yes this was a muslim guy who got delivered and many of them muslims were delivered yes any more questions you see jesus did not only have twelve disciples after the twelve you only had children that you also had chosen the servant who were following him those servants also left him at one point when he told them the one who doesn't drink my fresh blood and drink and eat my flesh they also left it was only the twelve who remained so the twitter weather of the one of the inner inner circle and the seventy were the ones of the outer circle and the magnitude was the one of the outer outside circle so you find that you can only remain with the christ if you have the inner inner circle if you truly believe this word so he sent us yes at one time he sent them out to go and they prayed and they the demons came out of people and they oh they came back rejoicing hallelujah we chased up demons and they all they were listening to us and then jesus told them don't rejoice because demons are hearing you but just because your name is on the book and then your other question will be i know so you mean their names was on the book of life said yes their names were but their names were removed you see because they did not stay with the world not on the book of life on the lamb's book of life on the book of life of the lamb which the which which the lamb purchased and bought and your name cannot be removed but then why why is your name removed from the book of life yet it means nothing okay let me explain there are certain people whose names are on the book of life that are going to be saved but they will not be in the bride yes so but those people will be saved but they will be judged they will be in the judgment they are not a bright and they and they will be in the judgment because they will be judged according to their works you get a point but the bride is not judged according to her works the bride is judged according to his what he's works you got the point but the rest are judged according to their works that they had how that they did in their life time on earth that's why their names are on the book of life as long as they had life there are certain things they did and those things once they did they will be judged according to those works but the bride is not going to stand before the white throne judgment did you know that brother joe the bride will not because our judgment is here that is there for now no condemnation to those that are in christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so there is no way we can come into the judgment because we have already passed from judgment and to life so the white throne judgment will be there we are only going to stand before the judgment seat of christ even if we shall not go before the white throne judgment but we shall we shall be before the judgment seat of christ to give accountability for how we lived our lives okay yes even those ones who are going to excuse me to to not go in before the white front judgment and even those who are going to be ruptured they will have to give account my dear you see don't think that you are all going to be like equal like equal as in be the same i will say here on earth i don't think we are going to be we are going to have different glories even up there you see according to what we did yes but remember not not whether life or death that's not a question for us there because we all have life equal we will all have life but we shall go before the judgment seat of christ to give an account on how we lived our lives you get a point but the rest of the christians and human beings and whatever it is that their names are in the book of life they will stand before the white throne judgment and they will give an account of why they refuse their blood they will have to explain their actions for what to be counted worthy for life or not so for us it's not like we are preparing ourselves to go to the white throne judgment no we are preparing ourselves to go in the rapture and from there when we come back the next time we come back down on earth we are going to go in the millennium and that's a time of rejoicing and one it's going to be a wonderful time and from there then they were throwing judgement you see so it's a it's a beautiful picture there i think i'll need to talk about that subject more in the church because i noticed you people needed more information on that okay um any more question the white throne judgment is not for the bride let me give you a timeline right now what is the bride waiting for for the rapture so after the rapture then comes the millennium of course i've not talked about the tribulation because the tribulation happens at the same time as the rapture when the rapture goes sets forth the world is in the tribulation you understand and when we come out of the great tribulation it's going to be the great tribulation the the in the great tribulation that's when the 144 thousand jews will be saved now after the tribulation after the three years and a half of the rapture of the marriage top of the lamp what will come then nope then there will come the millennium now the millennium of course there are other things i'm skipping not to confuse you to give many details like the armageddon and blah blah blah because the armageddon is the third world war which is going to happen after the rapture it will be happening and it will be stopped by god himself ah the tribulation it will be the climax of the tribulation then comes after that after all those things then comes a new heaven and a new earth uh rather not at that point because then remember after the rapture then the tribulation and all those things then the this earth will be destroyed okay the elements will melt but remember it is this same earth which has to cover the bride and the bridegroom for their honeymoon now notice during that time the earth will be prepared actually the third world one all those kind of things which will happen on this earth it will prepare this earth for the millennium almost all human beings will be annihilated there will be only a remnant a few which shall remain those ones which are remain will be the ones to the lean they will be the ones to populate the earth repopulate the earth and the earth will be filled with people again right now the people which people that's before judgment that's before judgment because remember that they are destroyed and others remain and and um and uh you know when they remain that's when the city of god comes down and the bride with the bride will begin to rule on this world with a bridegroom are you following me now the bridegroom who is the bridegroom jesus christ the bible said that he will rule with a lot of iron for especially over a thousand years now the thousand years rule or reign of jesus christ on this earth we shall be ruling over what exactly we shall be ruling over them i'm imagining if you have made a king and after being made a king then you are a king of the desert with nothing how does it feel would you rather have i think you would rather be a king of the desert imagine you are king and you are king of the desert nothing is there we would have to be king and queen of the whole world populated with people these people will be giving back and having children these people will be on this earth and and the only thing that you want to be there is sin because there will not be the devil will be bound a thousand years and you shall be ruling over those people yes and we shall be appearing and disappear because that's the ability which we lost so we shall have it then you know and imagine if i want to go to america just disappear and appear i want to go to whatever and then you know i'm imagining there will be a lot of things that will be explained then they're lying on the calf i mean the the the child the bible says would sit with a lion you know we will be with animals as if we are brothers and sisters no problem we shall be back in that time when adam was ruling over them we shall be like ruling now over the world the world like it is supposed to be you can't fear anything now even the lion will just be petting it no problem they will be the ones in the in the throne room you understand and then that's the millennium but then after the millennium the bible says that these people after one thousand years the devil was losed and when he was loosed and he write to them that you go and destroy the city and when they went to destroy the city the bible says fire came from above and and they divided all of them finished them up and then shortly after that bible says and there was a great big resurrection of every living being that has ever lived as in the bride i'm yet to study more about that i don't know some of those many many details is not really you know there are many things about that that we do not know because he wants us to get it as a surprise so i don't think even when you are going to for honeymoon and for our you want to leave some little bit of a surprise for your wife you know so i'm sure that they'll leave some of those beats for us as a surprise we'll get it there we will get to know brother i'll look for you and i think now you see they are not dying or they are dying whichever it is so then we realized that uh then when they then that's after the 1000 years reign with christ that's when we shall now be on this earth to see the judgment seat rather the white throne judgment being set for the judgment of both modern great rich and poor for all those who ever lived on earth and whatever it is that they did he will be judged them then the bride will not be before the throne the bride will be behind the throne with the judge you get a point so that's how it's going to be oh you want to read it in the bible okay so you can see we are not continuing the philadelphia church else today go to the book of revelation oh sister rachel was like man this is a beautiful story but is it even in the bible all right let's go to revelations chapter 21 i believe it is no chapter 20. i think it's more self-explanatory and i saw an angel come down from heaven having a key of the bottomless pit with a great chain in his hand and he laid a hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and saturn and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shot him and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more until the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be ruled a little season that little season when he's going to be loosed i told you of it already and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgments was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the world for the word of god which which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with the christ a thousand years okay the 144 thousand jews and the the bride they ruled and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the day lived not again until the thousand years we have finished this is the first resurrection so now we notice that the first resurrection is the one of those that lived and reigned with the christ okay in the first resurrection the first one is the first resurrection hmm yes that's the first resurrection but uh but the rest of the thousands the rest of the dead did not come up in the first result they remained dead they had they come in a great resurrection another one the second resurrection blessed are the holy is he that has part in the first resurrection that's the rapture but the brother on such the second death has no power but there shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years that's why i want to be in the resurrection morning when the death when that surprise we shall rise hallelujah we shall rise and come on oh the words have disappeared okay that's a very wonderful song but i love it and when the thousand years expired that's after the millennium millennium by the way is a thousand years it's not two different things saturn shall be losed out of his prison like i told you and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle the number of womb is as the sound of the sea i already told you about that these people who are as the son of the see are the ones who were the remnant of the earth all right and the ones who had multiplied them like this under the sea meaning there were so many that they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed this camp of the saints about and beloved and the beloved city and fire came down from god out of heaven and divided them and we got that part and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever and i saw a great white throne and him that started sat on it from whom from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and now you see how the word film judgment is starting and the books were opened and another book was open which is the book of what you say now these people are going to be judged out of the book of life you see the bride is not among these people the bride is already done jagged when she was living on earth that's why for us as the bread of jesus christ all over the world whoever is a part of that body we are judged here on earth not then here on earth when we hear the word of god we don't have in our hearts we we accept it and we do what it says therefore that is our judgment but for them because they are then they have to judge them then it says that the dead were and which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to they are have you seen that yes according to their works and they say gave up the dead which were in it and the earth and the air delivered up the dead and no one would know that it would remain all of them would have to come out which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death you see that's the second death the second death is also the destruction of of death and is of death and hair death and hair is also going to be destroyed some people think that there is going to be an eternal burning eternally no that's not true but the banham the prophet of this generation was able to tell us so and it is true it's biblically true there is nothing if you say that you have someone is going to burn in health eternity it means they will also live eternal life you see so yeah it cannot be two types of eternal life that the one of god ones of the devil no you see there is one only one source of eternal life and that is joy god's own life and the only people who are going to live eternally are the ones who are going to live in heaven with christ the ones out of christ will be banned for maybe thousands or millions of years but he will do our will with it and whatsoever wasn't found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire so those ones who are not whose names are not even on the book of life those ones they didn't even waste time on them they just throw them in the lake of fire where did they come from hallelujah praise the lord okay have you got the answer to your question you will see them when we are there my brother when we get there many of those questions will be answered all right yes no one day to god is a thousand years and a thousand years to the lord is one day but the timing and the timeline and accounting of god with the jews was one week was seven years right one week was seven years seventy weeks was 49 49 490 years so is that does that answer your question why did you ask that what is it that you want to know okay ah so if it's going to be a million years as it means like eternity it is forever and ever but it's not eternity there is an element of time on it the way we count is not the way god counts and also a million years is not like a scriptural verse it's an estimate it's like to say it could be for really a long time but we don't know how long but for sure the bible says the hell was created and anything created has an end only that which has no beginning has no end and that's why jesus is god because jesus had no beginning and had no end it is only that without a beginning that has no end all right keep them coming you have quenched your questions i'm sure there will be do we see our presence now do we see our king we don't see them the way we want but we shall see them uh we shall be in a form that jesus was by the time you went to heaven you can appear and you can disappear what i say no excuse me the the that would be the city first question it will be right here on ah it's the city that jacob wanted to be a part of who's builder and mecca is god not mine so that's where we shall be and that's why the support those people were not able to destroy it so like someone said that when we go into the eruption then we'll be not knowing anything that happens often now now are you telling me that the people who died now they don't know what is happening especially those who are in christ they know what is happening they see you even what is happening they see even better than we do so but [Music] the rapture you see that where we are in the marriage supper is different from where we are in the millennium the marriage supper we're in heaven the millennium we are on earth that's completely different dimension in the rapture in the rapture we are going in heaven in the rapture we are going to be in heaven not on earth because you know that's the marriage supper of the lamb and god and jesus has promised that it will be in heaven yeah so scripture actually said that you you'll meet us over there now you wanted to read them it says one day is like unto god a thousand is it there's a thousand years have you read that before yes yes okay can you now read it second peter chapter three always avoid just someone reading for you you must always do it for yourself they will ask you and then your lips will just drop because you don't know second peter chapter three verse eight okay someone read but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day and a thousand years as one did you believe that and that's exactly the truth so you you can bookmark that in your bible and uh always know where you can you want to get it if you want it and i think your questions are getting us at the end of our bible study so you have more so that we can conclude with them anyone with any question the second day the second death is the destruction of the soul whereas the first death is sleeping what we call death today brother samuel is just sleeping no one dies really because the body just dies but the soul of spirit is the light you didn't know that so can you really say that someone is dead when they are alive somewhere else so that's the first death but the second death you are not alive anywhere else you are destroyed forever eternally that's the total destruction even the devil himself will be destroyed in that crack of fire so that that lake of fire will destroy spirits and he will destroy souls it means annihilation complete complete annihilation of that soul done with total separation no return so you can't say let me burn in hell for 1000 years and then i'll come out and defend way at all so the first date is the death of the body the second death is a death and soul yes right now our people are some no they are being tormented for sure but they are not burning tormenting fermented do you know you don't understand what is settlemented they are suffering they are they are suffering they're in a place where they are not happy where there is no joy where there is no fellowship where there is nothing you are just there alone seeing us die alone i heard someone saying i don't care after all there are many people going to hell we shall go up there and throw apart they think that you wonder if someone in here they will just enjoy no it won't be one day i told you of this story sometime back i was still in school in high school and that day they say that we had a party a school party and they told everybody to come well-dressed so i thought it was food and i thought it was going to be a wonderful time so when i reached there i noticed i was hearing something you might you might say that you mean you were that a fool at that age because i was in high school i wasn't raised in an atmosphere of discourse so it wasn't really my thing i'd never gone to one but that day when i went there i noticed that actually they were having a pate of dancing maybe it was a surprise the school did i don't know so i said better let me go and see what happens in there usually they just check their bodies or i mean what does it what happens they just dance or what so when i reached there and i reached the doorway i was about to enter like that and there is this wave of heat that hit on me you know why they are all flexing their muscles and dancing of course they're generating a lot of heat it just hit on me like this and it repelled me i said i would not come back here again that was the last that was the first and the last time i came close to a discovery but i was thinking that these people are really in hell it is really hair yet on earth you can't call that place a good place you know why there is a mixture of all spirits demonic spirits and a believer you find yourself in such a scenario and you are happy there is a problem a big problem with you you see that's why i believe i can never go to such discuss surely no no way if you want to dance church is the right place for doing that okay now in here there is no throwing parties and dancing like they do on earth in air i'll give you an experience and maybe you'll imagine it a little bit did you remember or do you remember that that ship that got wrecked at lake victoria yeah that brought cruz yes it is said that even the people who would have survived were pulled down by the others who were sinking you know this is water you have to understand and water is deep there is no it's like a bottomless pit so when you feel you are going down you are not minding about anyone else you don't even remember you had a girlfriend around even if you see her there and she is up you want to pull her down for you to go up you understand so it is only offending for yourself bad minding about yourself that is the that's the how hell is bottomless pit sinking feet and there is no hair there is no there is no um there is no bottom to eat and there is a lot of heat and there is a lot of discomfort and there is a lot of being alone you just want to come out of it but you cannot because there is no hair and no and you can't come out of it and and there's voices but the banner he was god they said he had voices all those verses echoing in his ears and you know of all the gospel and the preaching you have ever had of the people groaning of that and all those things you it is like tormenting you but you're not burning literally but you know you're being tormented and you don't have time for saying hey let us be tonight together you don't have time for that you are all by yourself may god help us not to go to that place and so hell is real but hell will be burning after the judgment because they're really bad they're really bad and uh but now they're being tormented it's not a nice place and uh so we are now at that time these are just dimensions there's this dimension where we are there is a dimension of hair and there's a dimension of heaven you can just switch as soon as you come out of that body right now there is a dimension you are going to which dimension will that be it will be determined by how you lived on this earth whether you accepted this word or not everything you did or did not do would not would not mind would not will not be important at that time it would be whether you lived true to the word of god or not may god help us so we can live true to his word so you can be able to go to heaven and not hell you don't want to go to hell you sure you want to go to heaven yes any more questions before we cross yes how many times will the rapture be i do not know because there are certain things that are not made known because we don't need to know but for those times we know that the bible speaks of the rapture we know it has happened before it has happened before with elijah it has happened before with them the ones who were dead in christ who were in paradise when jesus christ who died they rose again that was a rapture they were raptured and we know it is going to happen with us and i don't know whether the second resurrection i should call the rapture but i know they will also resurrect all those who are alive they will direct and they'll be able to meet the the lord on the day of judgment so that's all i can say that those are the ruptures i see the major raptures in the bible yeah so the one where we are headed and the one we shall be after the millennium if there are others in the middle there that is yes are we done for tonight my my your questions are flowing to go like a river all right go ahead brother be deported but the pope the antichrist for him he will go to him he'll be put in here before yes yes it's only one man and the devil himself and the first him the first prophet and and the devil the first prophet and how does it put it yeah continue with your questions no but the banana says there is one who is going to be the real devil incarnate all these ones are successions of the set of the office but that office it embodies that man of sin that the bible speaks of the office of the pope the man of sin but we do not know who that man of sin is going to be but but the banham gave a prophecy and he said it will be an american pope and he says um it will when he comes on board he will be the real incarnate of what it all means so that will be one man he'll be one man the bible calls him the man of sin the bible calls him the false prophet the bible calls him many things yes what was your question for my thinking he's not the ones who have already opened the recent pops no there is a someone brother biscuit preached some years ago i really would recommend it to you he titled it the beast that was and is and is to come it's a scripture and he took that scripture and was able to tie it in with the papacy and what will happen also in the future i thought it was a good summon i listened to it some years ago i think it will be a blessing to you so after this bible study reminding me so i can give you the link for you to listen to that but that is that man who is going to be the real incarnate the devil internet and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall beat them in the day and night forever so the beast and the false prophet were the one to be thrown there fast and i believe this ties in with the other scriptures and maybe in the in the i can have more study on that and then we can be able to talk about it more the beast and the first prophet i think that would be a good title yes any more questions yes that will be our headquarter which they will try to destroy yeah it will be our headquarter but it does not mean that we shall be stuck there you know we can go wherever we want to go you know so we have a status here in uganda but the president is not always in the status he goes wherever he wants to go so yeah that would be our headquarters my mind we seem so much concerned about what the things that are to be you should listen to that someone by the bottom things that have to be very very wonderful one okay are we done oh don't don't fear don't fear to answer more questions i'm not tired yes yeah that's true because jesus didn't come for them let me ask you a question when you it's a mystery of election they ever going to buy tomatoes you have ever done that did you buy the whole lot what did you do when you went to buy them so you and you chose even if it was with your money huh but you chose those that you laughed and you wanted he said put that on just add this or no put this one not so can i call you rude to have him pick that one and left the other one why it's your money and this is your will and this is your desire and it is your choice so how dare i call you rude because you you exercised your choice your power of choosing so the bible says he chose us in him before the foundation of the world so he really came to redeem those who he chose he did not come to redeem everybody he only he did not come to redeem the whole man she came to redeem those who he chose those who he died for those who he paid for because remember the lambo bleeded and died before the foundation of the world so he came to claim them all those who he had died for all those who he had been crucified for and i'm glad i'm one of those so um the others who are not when they hear the word they can't accept it they can't believe it they will not love it but you who had the word because your seed was in there it's not because you are a son of a believer or not of a believer even if you are a believers child there are many believers children who are not believers but because you you there is a seed of god in your heart when you hear ah you accept it essa and jacob were both children of the of believers right but yes i believe essa wasn't even accepted to begin with ezra lost the birthright because he was meant to lose it it was meant to be for jacob that's why when god came down he changed his name another you they were from the same womb you remember when when rebecca was still pregnant the the the voice said two children two nations are in your womb that is rebecca's womb two nations two different seeds two nations not one nation there was israel and there was another so you see how god used and loved israel because it was his chosen uh chosen one so that element of election still remains even today god is not going to save all human beings not that he cannot save all human beings i'm not saying he doesn't have the ability to but i'm saying that he won't because he only claims those who he were meant to to be saved it's a mystery but is revealed to us because we have actually had his voices my sheep hey so you mean the others one of these sheep yes hear my voice you see are you his sheep yes yeah you know some people when you preach like that they begin they get confused and they say ah so pastor are you trying to say that i'm now not his sheep are you now saying i'm a pig now me i always want to take the positive side i want to see myself as the sheep hallelujah praise the lord isn't the lord good amen brother polly cup you are going to uh close for us in a word of prayer and those who have been following us or who will watch this later on on youtube god
