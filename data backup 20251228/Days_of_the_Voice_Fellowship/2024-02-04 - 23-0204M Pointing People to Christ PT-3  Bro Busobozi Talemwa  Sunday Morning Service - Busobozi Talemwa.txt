sister Sarah God bless you you're welcome please welcome please welcome also I noticed that I have been overwhelmed with a lot of responsibilities and work uh sometimes people have said that they kind of felt because I was busy they could not be able to reach me and also we we do print some work here in partnership with cl Bible Way days of the voice Publications days of the voice publication and so uh you know there is a lot involved with printing reporting and distributing and posting and even translation different different teams togethera and uh even now I think we going to get add a uh we really started supporting it already and also some other languages in Ethiopia and you know this involves emailing back and forth uping the messages you know you know paying the translators and other people managing and um quite a lot of work involved so I noticed that I was getting burnning I was burning out and so uh it just happened in a supernatural way I kind of felt I needed someone to assist me and then there was a this young man who had been streaming our Serv for a while and he kept on writing to me he says I'm looking for something to do I'd like to you know and then one time I'm in my room and then the Holy Spirit speaks to me is the right young man to employ so uh today I would like to introduce him to you brother Dan Misha uh just we have to look around so that people can see you so uh he will just be assisting me in the work and uh we will soon get a phone number if anybody wants to reach me if you can't find me you will be able to call that the brother speaks luganda English He Speaks many languages so I'm sure that everybody can be able to communicate praise the Lord also there is a sister is she is she here oh oh right here she was in Nairobi but she has come to join us as well if you stand all right God bless you and this sister is not yet married praise the lord we are believing God for wonderful weddings this year more weddings Andrew and you have opened not turning back not turning back the whole year is going to be a year of weddings amen you wait and see praise the Lord and so uh with those few words I think we should stand and you know change the order of the service now to go to the word uh I I desire to have a few moments with the whole church after the service to speak a little bit about our vision this year and especially regarding the attaining of our land uh I would like us to really talk about that but for now let's just focus on the word amen everybody happy amen shall we sing above all powers and and then we shall go to First Corinthians chapter 11 I believe no one should now stand when we are preaching I mean like everybody should have a seat because God like I informed you on Wednesday God touched one of of us here and she donated about 50 chairs amen I'm so seeing the different ones just coming to join our fellowship God had you in [Music] mind and already you have a chair to sit on so we pray God for to bless that sister our business amen praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah just relax a little bit close your eyes [Music] and above all above all King above all nature and all created things above

situation we lift our hands Lord to you and we say we love you Lord with all our hearts now father Lord as we go into your word this morning may you give us inspiration there many who are gathered here Lord many who are listening in online and others who may hear this later on my sincere desire is that you will minister to every you have your way Lord I pray father we love you with all our hearts come now and take over in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah God bless you hallelujah amen please turn to your Bibles with me in the book of 1 Corinthians 11 we read the first verse I've been uh dealing with this for two Wednesdays and this will be like the third time speaking on this subject and also I understand that there's a Vista called Sharon from over there God bless you you're welome thank you for coming to Fellowship amen we just read one verse and then we'll be seated be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ amen you may be seated we desire that the Lord will come and make himself known to us want to from him we do not come to hear from a man we come to hear from God thank you musicians today you have given me good sound and I'm happy thank you so um I know we always forget to thank them we thank them when things are going sideways so because I want to we have a meeting with the musicians and then again uh I want to meet you shortly after the service so I will not be long this morning so I want you to bring your thoughts together and uh just on what we are speaking on if you had something on the stove at home let it burn at least for today let all your mind your thoughts be here be in the service 100% is that amen amen ah I'm happy to see my daughter over here sister so uh we speaking on pointing people to Christ pointing people to Christ and this is part three of that now we have read a scripture where Paul was writing to the Corinthians telling them be ye followers of me many Christians and especially preachers or men of God or prophets or pastors they read this scripture but they end on those words be ye followers of me who doesn't like a following especially in the generation in the digital generation that we are in now even those that are actually shy and are in a maybe in a room somewhere closed uh closed up they still want to following and actually we realize if that many people in this generation living a shadow a life of a shadow and even you who are sited here today you are following many people that you don't actually have an idea of who they are when you go on their social media handle they speak powerful things they post powerful things and you begin to convert their life but wait until you meet them you will realize the whole thing was a shadow it was not a reality many people put up what they really are not and you find that the ones that draw the bigger follower following are the ones who have little or nothing to offer and so we are in a whereby everyone wants a following and some have even made it a job they they drop out of school they they leave the job the work the jobs and they go on social media to try and get a following so that they can pay them money and so they will post anything and everything that people want to watch all the nonsense as long as it will attract people towards them and you will see people will really follow and maybe you are one of those that follow and and then you know you just click follow click follow and when someone has a following of of 1K 2K 3 four four 5K you feel that that you are no longer down here you feel you are now up here and that you feel that you are of another and and you know on YouTube people have channels and and you know they begin competing who has a better Channel who has a better following and of course the more the following the more you will be paid and so it's a generation of people who want to be followed and um we notice here Paul says be followers of me so like I said many preachers also they stop there and they want people to follow them they make sign posts of their churches and then put it somewhere where it is visible and then they put the picture of the pastor or the bishop or the whatever and they put another one of his wife when they like that you know she's painted as Jezebel and then you know they look so presentable and so powerful so that they showing you come and follow us and now when you go to that church the testimonies you'll be hearing oh I thank God for the man of God the man of God has done that for me the man of God the man of God the man of God the man of God it will be little or less of Christ and more of the man of God people will be telling you come and see our man of God [Music] he's anointed he can do Miracles you know SS and wonders are it's a generation of people following others and people wanting to be followed what is Christianity what is Christianity Christianity is not following people Christianity is pointing people to Jesus Christ chistian is is following Christ not even following a religion or a set of religious beliefs you know come in our church we believe a BC d e f and and they put a full stop at the end everything that is out of what we believe is wrong and when they do that they form what you call a denomination and and and you know they they believe that all the other denominations are wrong their is the only right one that's what the Catholic Church did that's what the Anglican Church did that's what you know all these you know other denominations the morons they the Jehovah Witness you know you know the formed religions whereby they have church manuals they have you know a set of beliefs no more Revelation understanding nothing more at all whatever is more than what they believe even if it is in the Bible to them you have gone astray and you are wrong and you are going to hell and as long as you are not a member of their Church you are going to hell and what do you need to do to to be a member of their Church a set of beliefs that they believe no matter where it is from as long as they believe it so you subscribe to it and in some of them you even say your name somewhere as a sign that you are a member they even give you a membership card as a sign that you are a member so it's it's really what is going on in the religious world today what does the bible teach us about true Christianity true Christianity is not subscribing as a member of a circle or a religion or an organization true Christianity is following Christ what is Christianity it means to be Christlike be like Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is God who came down on Earth and put on flesh and was in the likeness of sinful flesh and he died on the cross for us so that we might become the righteousness of God the Bible says he became sin that we might become the righteousness of God and so now following him believing in what he told following those who follow him is Christianity and why are we here today we are not here because you're following me we are not here because we are saying our church is the only right Church we are not saying that D for days of the voice Fellowship is the only religion what we are saying is we are preaching a living Christ here and you can follow anybody as long as they following Christ and if you're following anyone and they not following Christ then you are on your way to hell we find that all the disciples they thought like Paul here said be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ he said that you see these teachers that are blind meaning those that are not following Christ he says when the blind follow them they all follow into the dit they all go to hell but if you follow a leader if you follow a man make sure he's following Christ whoever you are following whoever you are making your role model who is his role model Hallelujah if I am your role model make sure you find out who is my role model if my role model is not Christ and you follow me you are on your way to hell but if my role model is Christ if I'm following Christ and you follow me you are on your way to hell to the rure you on your way to heaven as long as I'm following Christ and you also follow me you are sorted brother you are sorted sister but the problem people are blind and they following blind leaders if the person you're following on social media is not following Christ you in a very Sor State because whoever you following has an inspiration if that inspiration is not Jesus Christ if it is not the word then you are in geopy you putting your life in danger thank God that in this end time God has sent us a Propet amen William BR never pointed people to himself he never pointed people to his church come on church he pointed people to the and that's why we are following William every true Messenger is a star every two messenger is a star a star can only lead you to a destination in the Bible we find when Jesus was born there was a star the North Star and when it appeared the Wise Men followed the star if you are wise you will follow a star amen but the world follows every other star they have their own stars but the wise one will follow the North [Music] Star it's only one star and whenever it appears it is announcing something and here we find out that the wise men the star and when they were to Jerusalem they they realized they start disappeared and they were confused they were confused and they realized they needed to get out of this place and they find the star when they reach the palace the star disappear the star the true star is not going to be found in Palace is not going to be found in cath the true star is going to be found out there in the open the true star will not be under a denomination under a system TR star cannot be bound by organizations of Man by religions of man the true star will be out there in the open out of all denominations Leading the People to Christ not to one religion to one denomination but leading people to Jesus Christ and when that star appeared they followed it reappeared again and the Bible say they were so happy they danced they were so happy because the star appear That's why we should be so happy that we have found our star in this same time we should be so happy we have our star hallelujah amen in the Book of Revelation chapter one The Bible says and there were seven stars in the right hand amen of Jesus Christ that upon the Seven Stars in his right hand what are the Seven Stars the Seven Stars Are Stars to the seven churches what are the seven churches Gentile dispensation from the days of the Apostle up to the end time there will be seven churches but in each Church age there will be one star leading people to Jesus Christ and and then we find out that when they followed the star they start them to Jesus and when they found him disappear the work of a star ends the moment you find Christ are you following me the work of a St comes to an end the moment you find Christ there have been seven Messengers from Paul Paul was the first one you know to to Irani and then on on up to William Bram is the last star to the last Church age and when this star appear he found people when they are in confusion religions and denominations and his message was come out of her my people I have somewhere I am taking and someone asked William brother he said what should we do should we come and gather in Jefferson VI should we all come to your church he said no he said what about Arizona where you started another church did we all come there he said no wait it has been revealed to me where all of you should gather there is a place you remember there was a place called aella I believe it was and and that was the place where everybody of the Old Testament Saints had been buried how many remember that we talked about it one one time here all of them were buried in that place and so when the resurrection happened all of them because they were in that place they all rose again these are the people that the Bible says that people saw them for 40 days walking on the streets of when Jesus Christ died rose again he rose with them 40 days they were on Earth but they were all bued in one place so now people asked a question to our Prophet should we all Gather in your church so that we be sure of the Rapture should we all be have one universal denomination where you our leader he said no but has been revealed to me where you should gather you want that Revelation there is a place where we should gather there is a place where we should it is not it is not Jefferson it is not America it's not Uganda that place is called Christ Christ I said Christ is Enough For Me hallelujah amen we have been given a place where we should gather and as long as you are there you are going in Rapture long as you in that place you are going in rure when the trumpet of God sounds you will be found ready for the Rapture that's the place where we should go and for the first time in the end time we had one man a star who came and pointed us to [Music] Christ he never did point us to our denomination that is why this message is not a denomination can be denominated Hallelujah people come and they ask us so where where where where else are you as days of the voice fellow theow which other place are you and I tell them we are everywhere andwhere and you are the you are the overseer you don't understand we are everywhere and everywhere and our Bishop is the overseer over us so who is the bishop I said the Bible says he's the bishop of our souls his name is Jesus Christ Hallelujah he's our Bishop he's right up there in the headquarters he's right at the headquarters and we down here are scattered almost everywhere I said we are almost everywhere here in campala we are in every corner are you hearing me go to Kenya to every part of ug every District every little town we are scattered everywhere go to Every Nation on Earth even the Muslim nations we everywhere who are we we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we are the mystical body Hallelujah you cannot bind us together in one place because we are we have a spiritual place our spiritual place is Christ and that's why this is more than a move this is more than a movement this is more than a church this is more than a doct this is more than religion this is Christ this message is Christ we are not pointing people to ourselves to our church when we go to preach on the streets on radio TV on the internet we are not pointing people to our little church we are pointing people to Jesus Christ we are pointing people to the word and we are excited about that hallelujah hallelujah in this message is the only place where we can preach on radio and someone in sh hears and then you call them they call you rather say where can I Fellowship do you have a church we say yes when we we don't even know where the fellowship and then we call the other pastors fellow yes yes yes give me the other person as long as they believe this message I know they're pointing people to Christ Hallelujah am in this message we don't own people we don't have any membership how many here have membership cards come on come on I have heard stories oh as long as I'm I'm the one who baptized you you are my member I own you as long as you believe from here oh you must never live here your blessings are here as long those are religious stories I'm telling you in this message we have been set free from all those religious we have been liberated we are a property of he that died for us we are property of the Messiah his name is Jesus Christ we are owned by him he owns us and where he leads us we [Applause] follow I'm telling you this message is so sweet but if you try to denominate this message you lose the sweetness of it the message is sweet slap your neighbor tell them the message is hallelujah am what is the message the message is the gospel what is the message the message is Christ why is it a message like he said Moses go tell my people we also have received Moses come to tell this generation come out of the religion come out my people come out of them come out of Ang come out of cathol come out of PC come out of come out of days of the of whatever fellow in and come in another fellowship come in a fellowship with Jesus Christ come behind the ve it's not about your church name not about your pastor it's about the word this is what we believe this is what Believers stand for and this is the old time religion it will take us all to Heaven it will make you repent of your sins it will take you amen out of your sins it will change your life many of us we are found in a wretched way doing riched things but when we believe this word we have been changed and we are still being changed and soon and very soon we are going to see the king not because of who we are but because of what he has made us hallelujah I say give me that old time religion it will make you love your brother here is a Sister Sister Sarah from she has never met me she doesn't know me she has seen me for the first time same thing to all of you but she's here shouting amen why it is the all time religion give me that all time religion see in our youth meetings we had people from all over a brother from New Zealand he comes and sings a song and we all sing it as if we knew it why because we are of the same Spirit we have all been made to of The Same Spirit we are all connected to the father above see brother Prince here from Hallelujah he can come and sing he can come and preach and we shall all be crazy with am why it is the same manner it's the same word it's the same oil it's the same Revelation it's the same inspiration there is a body of Christ amen on Earth today and it's all over the world and I'm a part of it you are a part of it this is what we are we are not a religion we are not a denomination we don't follow men we follow Christ men point us to Christ praise God and when the star takes you to the to the to Christ the work is done now you hear these people who are saying bring back brother do they even understand what they talking about they saying that me as a pastor should sit down and and we should play the T of of brother Bram because he was the start to our generation do you see the star removing the the men saying the wise men move away I am the star let me give the gifts Hallelujah work that way when they when they reach the Messiah when they Christ the M they start disappear they start disappearing we are living in that time the Stars disappeared it is our time I said it's our time it is now the time of Revelation 108 hallelujah amen take the book and eat it it is our time to take the revelation of the word the open book the seventh messenger R the book open the book now it is our time to take it and eat it do you know what happens afterwards oh come on Church what happens afterwards say thou shall prophesy again you are going to prophesy again you are going to prophesy it is my time it is your time to prophesy again to leave this word to tell this word hallelujah to tell this word to leave this word to declare this word to your generation it is my time amen because I've eaten the book have you eaten the book it's your time to prophesy Pastor Jess came here and told us he said now you can speak things into existence you can speak to your situations Authority now it's time for the bride to arise and shine it's time for the word of God to come and live through US praise God Hebrews 121 where seeing we also ACC compassed about with so great a cloud of a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which that so easily beset us and let us run with patience the rest that is set before us we have a cloud of witnesses tell your neighbor we have a cloud of witnesses we have those who have gone on before us amen William is one of them now Peter is another one is another one Paul is another one come on all those John all those who died in Christ they are witnesses of what we are talking about but they are not here physically here in another dimension and they telling us even through their testimonies we made it you can make it too we overcame you can overcome too amen they're telling us through their testimony we did it you can do it too and and and the Bible says here because we have those croud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight oh who has a weight here who has something that is heavy for them we are told here to lay aside every weight lay every malice aside lay every fornication aside lay every last aside someone is saying lay aside tell your neighbor lay aside lay aside every weight can you lay aside now lay aside your anger lay aside your anger you say for us we have anger in our lay aside your throw it away you know you can give it up if you want whatever is disturbing you right now as I'm preaching don't always wait after preaching if you want God to do something for you that moment when you receive the Revelation receive it powerfully and when you you put it aside the Holy Ghost comes out and he enforces your faith whatever has been your burden he's saying lay it aside lay it aside all the sin that so easily beset us lay it aside and let us run let us run with patience let us run the rest that is set before us oh Paul R his rest his our Prophet William his it is our time to run it is have time to run I say let us run let us run we have a rest ahead of us while we are running who do we look to William Bram your past come on answer me now your church your brother your sister Amen Let us run looking unto Jesus Hallelujah looking unto Jesus who is Jesus amen who is Jesus Jesus is the author and finisher oh he's the author and the finisher of our faith our faith is built upon Jesus Christ not on any man our faith is buil upon the author is built upon the Finish glory to God that's why we point people to Christ and any man or woman who is not in this message and he's telling you he's pointing people to Christ is a liar why is he a liar is's pointing people to his organization to himself to his religion and that's why one one big Mega this is the truth women should not wear trousers they should not preach they should even use makeup baptism in the of it's the truth but if you preach this you become poor so they don't preach it they look at people like us they say you are losers but wait a moment time is coming when they know who will be the loser I will preach this even if I remain poor I will preach this even if I have only 100 people for 10 I will pre this even if No One Believes I will pre the word hallelujah and we know they are following other men who are leading them to themselves the Bible says they have itching ears you know these preachers they come to scratch their ears you know let me scratch it this is my pastor from today why because it scratched your ears he told you wanted what you wanted to hear he told you sister Dr the way you feel like I had recently another one saying even if you're a Christian but if God bless you with your body Let It Be SE show the glory of God these are the same men who use these women they areful themselves and they are calling themselves preachers thank God for this message because the message has taken us out of confusion we are in a place of understanding we know what we are talking about don't come here and you find 100 people and you think we are a younger child we are a mature child we know what we are talking about we are leading people to heaven we know the word this is what we are pointing people to praise if you don't like it you in the wrong place you might as well live right now but I'm glad I'm preaching to people who love it Hallelujah the devil must be shaking whatever he is hallelujah hallelujah in the message Be not Afraid amen the prophet says and mothers just take more time talk to their children about God and pray for them we would have less juvenile delinquency first of all it is parent delinquency before we have juvenile delen when you have when you see a generation of spoiled people young people it means the parents themselves of the SP if you see a generation of prayerless young people it means the parents are prayerless you look at how they dress and when you look at their mothers you will not be surprised it is coming from somewhere that's why you young men women of virt gods are virtuous who know how to dress coveries who dress as Saints because we are Saints we are Heaven bound but if you don't do that you get a generation of delence if mothers would take their place in the house and the Bible and pray for their children and lead them to Christ that's your job your job is not in a job somewhere in a public place somewhere no it is all right I did not say it is wrong for women to work I said you are God given role is to take care of your children is to teach them the ways of God but because the women have abandoned their the family is are broken M even if you're working find time for your children teach them instruct them pray for them lead them to Christ we have homes without a backone when a man in the house cannot pray cannot call a family altar if you are here and you are listening to me and you are a man in your house and you can't call your wife and your children together for a family you are a man without a because you are leading a home pointing them to yourself and not to CHR we should Point our home our family to Christ even you husbands Point your wives to Christ don't show them I'm your lord I tell you what to do you do lead them to the world teach them the ways of God become yourself as if you a God in your home you are not a God in your home God is a God in your that's why marriage is not marriage without God three God wife husband but fathers have abandoned their duties they have left their god-given Ro you should be able to lead your wife and teach her the way of God take care of her and and and pray for her pray with her if you don't do that she won't do it for the children it comes from up Christ did it for us so the men can do it for their wiv and the can do it for the children praise God I'm sorry if you think this is hard preaching I'm so sorry I I don't know how to preach better you see pray for them and lead them to Christ instead of going out to some stitch stitch and so party and play cards and drink and Carry On Smoke praise God in the message oness not only that but the Oneness between husband and wife was broken I don't believe there is any marriage can be what it ought to be without a union between husband and wife and God if you are believers please say Amen because even if you don't say Amen I'm preaching it any he says I don't believe any marriage can stand without that relationship Union between husband and wife and God they will bring up children in the world and make them illegitimates give them cigarettes give them Whiskey play cards in their s drink liquor before them no matter how loyal they are to their marriage vows that is just sexually that's flesh they are loyal there like that but there is a spirit in there that Spirit of a sinner Papa and Mama no matter how loyal to their children it will come wrong when you say I know men and women that didn't teach their children that and wasn't Christian the very thing of not leading them to Christ they may have raised their children well but without leading them to Christ the very thing of not leading them to Christ was the wrongest thing they could ever do [Music] besides they may not it is wrong to to drink before them it is wrong to to smoke and to play cards before but it is wronger to not bring them to Christ you must lead them to Christ come on Papa and Mama hearing me to you must lead your children to Christ you can't have a correct Union without it while you are beginning make a resolution I am an army of the Lord I am going to fight for my children I'm going to lead them to Christ I am going to show them Christ I'm going to pray with them I'm going to fight until I win this batt if you don't do that you can't have a correct Union the fellowship is broken then as soon as the fellowship was broken between Adam and Eve as soon as Fellowship was broke between God and them then their Fellowship between each other was first it was the relationship between Adam Eve and God as long as that was intact their family was in but when that broke see what became of the family friends some of you I understand you may come from broken home but what I'm saying here is that leave the past begin a new generation it begins with you some of you it begins with your children say they will serve the Lord no membership but Fellowship we appointing people to Christ not to our church not to who yeah not my husband my wife we are pointing people to Christ and you people that's this is identified with Christ and you people that's around here in the city or neighboring around that doesn't have a home yet a church home you're welcome here this is what a prophet said in his own church come any time make this your home remember so when he says that he says remember we don't have no membership here just Fellowship for all everybody say Fellowship for all welcome everybody and anybody some people they say I fear to go to your church because your church dresses so well everybody there looks so holy ah the very reason they have that attitude is because you g them that attitude don't give people that attitude that you are the best Church in the world you are the lowest Church in the world because without Christ what are you so Point people to Christ not to how good your church is I've seen people who say we here are going to heaven and everybody here going to heaven and everybody who is around here and does not come here he going to hell what an attitude some people have keys for heaven no one has keys for heaven that you will lock out someone and lock lock yourself in some people will come and say please open for me go you ref to of Heaven Is Not That Heaven is for all that in Christ in [Music] Christ and we know who Christ you may be a preacher for years but if what you preach is not in the word you are not leading people to Christ but to yourself so remember we don't have Fellow membership we don't have as as Howard say used to say no but love your neighbor no Creed but Christ I love this I'm this no Creed but Christ come on tell your neighbor not but Christ you can preach with me for a few moments now there no book but the Bible Hallelujah and so you are always welcome this little Tabernacle he say which we are expecting if the Lord willing soon we can to build a better church I believe even here at DF we shall build a better church he says I'm more substantial place you see if you have the truth you believe to have the best not some some we are children of the king and we expect to have the best so we should have Vision we should be men and women of vision all right a few more moments now here 1 Corinthians 12 12 for the body is one and has me and has many members and all the members of the of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentile whether we be born of free and have been all me to drink into one spirit so we have all been made to drink of one Spirit there is only one body how do we become part of the body by being born again don't join it we born into it by being filled with the Holy Spirit and if you're not filled with the Holy Spirit I don't it doesn't matter how much you are loved in the church how much you do for God you're not going to the rupture you're not a part of that body you don't join that body by being baptized in water that's what the church does to have fellowship with you but for you to be a part of the body of Christ you must be born again by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah where the spirit of God comes in your soul and he burns all the world out are you hearing me he burns all the world out he burns all the lust of the world of life and all the lust of the eyes gives you his spirit gives you his life that's what makes you a member of the body and if you filled with the Holy Ghost you are part of the body and there are many almost everywhere they are not only in this Fellowship there many fellowships all over the world long as they are filled with the Holy Ghost they are my brother they are my sister and if you're filled with with the Holy Spirit you will have love for your brother and for your sister no matter how they wrong you no matter how much they do bad to you you know you will have love because that love I'm talking about is the love of God it does not fail it is permanent say Amen if you believe that God has no grandchildren he only has Sons and Daughters children who are usually born by experience 1 Corinthians 12:14 for the body is not one member but many if the food shall say because I am not the hand I am not the body is it there for not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye am not of the body is it there not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing the whole were hearing where were they smelling but now has God set the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him and if they were all one one member where were the body but now are the many but now are there many members yet but one body that's why I said we have very many Fellowship you see but the each of us are different members you cannot say why don't you bring all the message churches brother and make a cathedral and you make brother Dixon your pastor no we don't function that way our headquarters in heaven and down here on Earth we are different members out of the same body you cannot begin to say our church is the best that means you have not been raised properly you don't know what it is it's not about your fellow just a little in and every member is important every Fellowship is important just like in the church you know the church has many different members everybody is important tell your nebor you are important say for us for us we don't have a car at least those ones are on another class those ones are better than us you don't know what you're talking about whether you drive or you don't drive whether you have a motorcycle or you don't whether you have a bicycle or you don't God takes each of us as individuals and he begins to mold a character within us when your has been molded to a level where God now can trust you with a car he will give you a car actually God is willing to give you a car like yesterday but the problem is you are not growing you are in the same same place you look at others and you C them you look at others and you look down on yourself that's why you are the way you are now I'm giving you a secret to come out of that place begin saying positive things about yourself I am rich I I I am better than this I am driving I am I am I am I am you confess it it will happen to you there was a time when I did not even have a bicycle and I was married I take my wife I've given you this story before many times we survived accidents because we would walk 3 km to church and three to go back home and the road was full of dust are you hearing young people thead was the car comes and then you grun to your wife are you okay and then by the time the car passes you're full of of D and then that car goes after cleaning yourself again and you are going to church and you have to reach there on time one time we nearly were knocked down bad driver just came on our oh God just save when my wife was pregnant for Elizabeth our first baby we were going to church you know we were going to church all we had was and as we were walking to church coming out from our village you know I always uh you know got up by the hand but this time we were just walking I don't know what I was doing and then you know she was she was about eight a month and a half PR and so and she hit a but root and she was going down I had to run and I go my bride and she did not fall down but because you know you mothers know the baby was already scared so I had to carry her there for a while for the baby to calm down and then after that we didn't go back home we continue to chch walking 3 K and sometimes when we have some little Shillings we go on a border border and and and you know my wife was very she didn't want to sit next to the border border man want to sit and then I sit next but my heart would go behind should not fall down we prayed one time I said God I wish you just give me but God said no your is not for and you know what God gave me a brand new cosme wait you see how you CLA because you expect a bigger thing God doesn't work like that God takes you from glory to glory to glory he doesn't just God doesn't work like that some of you expect miracles no he gave us a brand new motorcycle that was our level where is Esther lift up your hand this girl was four years we would take her and put her I would put her in the front and then we I take my wife behind with a baby now cuz we had a baby now that is Elizabeth raise up your hand right there mother would be cutting her go to church what am I saying go wants to bless you but he will bless you in phases phases the more you are faithful the more he will bless you but also you have to keep a positive mind you have to prophesy big things over you time came when I no longer prophesied a myself I now belied in a bigger a bigger car because there was need for it but you you are there you're not even married you don't even think about married and you saying God give me a how will he give you a car he will give it to Andrew because Andrew has a reason for but you are there you fearing responsibility and you want good things from from the Father the father will give it to those that deserve it he's a righteous judge and whatever you need chge you have to learn to believe for it you have to learn to prophesy it into existence and then don't be L begin working by faith beli for big things if you say believe it say Amen so everyone in the church is important you are important you may be a stripper you are important you may have nothing you are important because if the the little finger said because I'm not a thumb I am not part of the body he is just joking because you are needed the whole body is need every every part of the body every one of us is important valuable here we are not in a denomination where someone brings one milli and then the pastor fire the powerful blessing God shake heaven and then my brother brings God bless you here we believe every one of us is an important part of the body be faithful to God the little you have and the big you have and notice God will take you from glory to glory to glory to glory glory we are all a part of one another and we all need one another no one is more important than the other you may just be coming to church and sit down you are important you you may never do anything in the church that's your presence that makes you important I hope that nobody in this Fellowship ever feels little or ridiculed or look down on every one of us should walk as a son of Hallelujah Hallelujah and that's why there should be no competition in the body competion the ey cannot say unto the hand I have no again the head to the feet I don't need you I have no need of you much more those members of the body which seem to be more Fe [Music] unnecessary tell your neighbor you necessary and those members of the body which which we think to be less honorable upon this we best more abundant H and our UNC Parts have more abundant cess our uncomely parts have more abundant C our parts have no need but God has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked which lacked yes that there should be noism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for [Music] another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer someone rise up says you know what I'm doing a wedding support me help and like it's not my wedding hey you don't know what we are we are a body when something happens here and happens in another church we together even if it's a convention if invited to a convention maybe maybe which is being organized by evening light church we are members of that church as well we are members in the fellowship here members of the bigger church when you go there let me leave these people to suffer you don't know what you're talking about we are members of one body when one M all of us one member will be honored all members Rejoice with hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord I'm trying to find a place now to bring it to a close one body different gifts but they all poined to Christ but if he has a gift of God and he's trying to edify the body of Christ then I don't care what what he belongs to you are not Discerning the man you are Discerning the spirit the life that's in the [Music] man are you hearing me amen don't now be quiet on me yet and that's what God told us to do not one time was ever commissioned to design the man's group but we was constrained and commanded by God to design the spirit in the mind what he's trying to do what the spit in his life is trying to and then if we can find out that he's trying to lead the people not to break them up to bring them together and to bring the Church of the Living God not all to one denomination to understanding a fellowship a Unity of spirit then if he's a former Reign or lat Reign or whatever he is days of the voice fellow of the what his name is whatever it is his spirit and his purpose is is right and the spirit that's in him no matter what move he belongs to the spirit that's in him is trying to point the people to Calvary away from himself away from anything else but his only achievement he has is to point them to Calvary he doesn't care whether he's even known or not listen Church days of the voice Fellowship listen to me now that is why we do not believe in this press play movement why because they're pointing us to William they making a denomination pointing us to one man but what did William Bram do or preacher he pointed people to Christ and that's why we don't follow any move we don't attend any Fellowship that points us to a man to a man but we are followings such like Paul said follow me as I follow Christ in other words if anybody's pointing you to him follow him because he's pointing you to Christ but if he's pointing you to himself run away as hard as you can it doesn't matter what his name the name of his church is whether in the message or out of the message as long as he's pointing to himself his system run and I'm going to finish with this story in second Samuel everybody turn to second Samuel 15 praise the name of the Lord 15 verse and it came to pass after 40 years that absolom said unto the king I pray thee let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed unto the Lord in in Hebron for thy servant Ved a V while I at gesu in Syria saying if the Lord shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem then I will serve the Lord and the King said unto him go in peace so he arose and went to hibron but absolum sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel saying as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absolum reth in heon and with Absalom went 200 men out of Jerusalem that were called and they went in their Simplicity and they knew not anything and absum sent for AEL gilonite David's counselor from his City even from gilo while he offered sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absolum and there came a messenger to David saying the hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom now I want you to follow this story here last time we talked about a little bit about Absalom AB was the son of the king but you see ABS designed to make himself the King instead of his father and we see here that at first he was standing by the gate you know speaking to the people and speaking about himself and what he can do for [Music] them and people began he began to steal people's hearts and now we see here and we have a lot of preachers like that and I gave you an example of one preacher the student said wherever I stand miracles happen I'm telling you God anointed me God empowered me I'm a powerful man and when whenever I stand back the heal the sick are healed the eyes of the blind are open the dead are raised and to die it's going to be fire and that was the beginning the opening statements so everybody was ready for and by the time he finished preaching he wanted the pulpit to swallow him he went away very humble how I wish he had come to the pit it's not about what you have you are nothing there's no healer God is the Healer there's no savior God is the saor and so as a minister you a servant I am a servant and I have nothing God does not use me I have nothing of myself and so ABS made himself so high I don't know why people want people themselves it's as if like girls want to get married you see a young man talking about himself and you also taken up me me I am on free land what do you want tell me what you want speak speak the word me me in this nation I shake this I shake this some people say I can make you disappear in 5 minutes you don't even know how I have done it me I have authority look at somebody talking about themselves and then somebody's heart is taken up you really have something wrong with you let me tell you people who speak about themselves they are they they empty anty makes a lot of noise many times when people talk about who they are everything they speak are lies rich people don't advertise themselves I don't need to come and say that I'm rich I look poor know bread is there is the one who did that when somebody drives high class you don't need to go yes putting the kids here like this sh Shing usess W that they will think you are rich you shake the key I wish I entered with they know it is mine you have a c but you are poor in your head a rich person they don't need to show off they even hide their key and when you you humble yourself after the talk they see as you all going think all of you are going to walk they see you to this is [Music] your can you give us a it's okay sit sit why because you were humble they don't fear you now get what I'm saying my brother but pride has made people people think talking about will make them great we had youth meeting I saw you you think I was not seeing you I was seeing you smed they don't want to do anything they don't want to carry chairs they don't want to do anything they think when smart will see that brother is humble don't be deceived if you are like that the more you stay like that the more will make sure nobody will honor you or even love you must humble yourself even if you drive a big car you come and clean the church toilet man is very rich if your wealth or your makes you feel you are higher that Fame comes from but the fame from God makes you humble and you know I'm nothing Hallelujah everything you are everything you have you are not pointing to yourself you are pointing to Christ I am nothing but I can do all things through Christ gives me strength we need a church to get to that level whereby we shall organize a convention and brothers SS you will come amen you make your clothes short caring where and sister Faith will and she will go before God oh God give me that brother oh brother give to me I claim him the Jesus after sister Faith has claimed you no sister can get you I tell you now sisters I've told you you may not approach a brother but you claim him claim him God will make sure he gives him to you praise the Lord you had the testimony of Sister Sister had already seen the man came she was 100% sure why she had already been praying you know that sister came back to visit ethopia like two times after the wedding before anyone told she had also received the reation so that was free now servant V now I want to I want to finish my sermon today ABS there a speed I want to hammer on him here is ABS he comes to the king and tells him now you know your while I was still in in syri saying if the Lord will bring me again here to Jerusalem then I will serve the Lord and so the king said him oh you want to go to toon I don't know which place did you want to go to is it Syria wait absam said unto the king I pray let me go and pay my V which I vowed unto the Lord in Hebron yes in heon so let me go to he because I vow a that if God will bring me again to Jerusalem then I Ser I have a in my heart to do something for the Lord please let me go the king told him go inace but was was it true was it what was in his heart answer me we read the scripture together so he arose and went to hebon but ABS sent SP instead of going to serve the Lord he began planning and plotting how to take over theing and this is how sometimes people serve God mechanically if God has told you to do anything be genuine in your be sincere and do just that but the problem of it people are not sincere I have a go to where the truth is there is other things you have seen there your and you are lying to us we should be sincere God loves sincere heart this man reached there and began plotting calling others in other places we are taking over and soon everybody began AB he told the king is going to serve but now he's taking over the kingdom and and and and and so the Bible here's the part I wanted with AB went men out of Jerusalem that were called they went in their Simplicity and they knew not anything that's the part I wanted abom was very intelligent he knew how to approach the king he knew if I tell the king I'm going in heon to Ser he will not stop me and also he will give me some of his people so the king allowed him to go and Abed 200 in their Simplicity who knew not anything now this is the condition of many Believers preachers are very busy playing their politics but the people are in Simplicity they don't know anything and they found in such a sck why because of men who are pointing to themselves they will lead many people in simp and lead them to destruction AB did not Point people to the king to himself imagine 200 people following him simp today many people follow others knowing nothing may God help you that I will not follow people blindly let me tell you you people that are in this Fellowship I'm I'm encouraging by the love of God what this message is get the spoken word books read them know what you believe know what someone will ask what is the message but many people are just following Simplicity the only thing they know what's the name of your church days of the voice Fellowship your pastor what do you believe I will call my pastor that is a very s State you following in Simplicity you are like a go put a rope in brother don't be like that know what you believe don't follow blindly don't follow in Simplicity don't call me to explain someone what baptism explain to them what to believeing that's what we looking for but here is a man who was leading people blindly you need to know what you are all following tell someone you need to know what you're following only in this message you find believers who do not follow men blindly I'm now finishing in this message you find people who don't follow blind yes even when you ask a little girl I can call one of them who is baptized already and I them they will answer praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah huj I was going to try to do it but time because they know we know what we are believing I'm so glad for that this is not a man's move are you hearing me this is not a cult this is not a religion We are following Christ this is more than a church more than a religion Hallelujah it is Christ revealing himself to us in these last days God bless you you may stand on your feet
