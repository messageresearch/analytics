speed just write somewhere those scriptures foreign man spoil you philosophy and son of man after the rudiments of the world are not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead buddy and he I accomplish in him which is the head of all principality and power Billy foreign theology theology by gamalley area but when Paul received Christ the Holy Spirit Paul came out and said that I counted as expensive or value to me again [Music] after I have received Christ so that I may win Christ he said this again that it was the Holy Ghost and gave me this the knowledge again you know so who is the Holy Ghost he says Christ is Enough For Me are you with me for in him money in Christ foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah not in Jesus but in Christ everything that was in God empowered it in Jesus and everything that was in Jesus Christi in Christ [Music] is keeping me alive [Music] [Music] and the Bible says ye are complete in him Bible yeah foreign is no longer complete you can't see the head you are seeing the body you cannot say body is complete now it's not complete without the head and the Bible says which is the head oh principality hallelujah amen amen yes sir Colossians chapter 1 verse 12. Colossians chapter 1 verse 12. it says giving thanks unto the Father which has made Brothers which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light um who has delivered us from the power of Darkness foreign [Music] of sins are you listening to me hallelujah amen who is the image of the invisible God is hallelujah amen be sure you're giving me the right thing here but he says who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature um he says it's the image of what again Church [Music] make sure you do not disconnect do we have a problem here whatever movement you do can take away the anointing yes [Applause] for by him all principalities all things were created by Him and for him everyone all things get into your neck we are created by Him the way and foreign [Music] I am supposed to live foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] when the head comes submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church did you hear that that's what you already did wives [Applause] can you shout amen ities God bless you my sister the Bible says [Music] to your own husband but somewhere pastors submit yourselves to your husband foreign [Applause] [Music] you don't know so I'm wondering how you can think without your head the Bible literally said that a woman can't think for herself well before that you need your head to sing you need your help you need your head for decisions did you realize you can't make decisions in life without your head and the Bible is [Applause] even as Christ many Christians the church has no rights to make any decisions it is whenever you foreign you are not obeying your head that's what the church is Jesus I can run around what what does he says the woman where is it here the woman who is talking the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto the man he says whatever amen hallelujah amen and you say um it doesn't matter they don't even say it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you have the Holy Spirit which is where do they find women preachers when the Bible says the Bible says give it to me brother foreign [Music] [Applause] they go and paint themselves foreign [Music] [Applause] so let the wives be to their own husband in everything let them be subjects unto their own husbands in some things moving to every move amen I mean um sister sister sister sister sister Hallelujah foreign Ephesians chapter 4 verse 7. every one of us is given Grace according to the nature of the gift of Christ he led captivity captive and give gifts unto men what is it that but he also descended fast into the lower parts we are talking about the Holy Spirit is the same Guru that they might feel all things it's not that Jesus and the Holy Spirit foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] from the sky to myself [Applause] okay now and he gave some a post and he gave some Apostles and some Prophets I don't be enough for us so but please follow me here now try to control people from working and he gave some Apostles and some prophets are you following me amen I can't hear nobody foreign [Music] foreign am I speaking to someone keep your eyes here right here no don't put it nowhere sister Grace right here Christ has a body and that body is again the body of Christ because the body of Christ is not this one this one is still going to die um foreign [Music] and Christo has given the faithful Ministry Christ away it is by every foreign [Music] Yani who is the head Church the head is Christ there is perfection building I spoke to you the other times regarding Perfection and I told you about uh about the stage of a perfect man you don't grow in one day you grow every day I'm trying to see if I can get this picture again but probably another time amen all right let's see if I can get this in a minute the stature of a perfect man okay I have it now brother can you put up there are we there right here let me see that clearly a large screen brother all right change we all can see that nature but Perfection become perfect in one single day Perfection grows up since you believe you heard the truth but growth comes only when you are eating the word people are out there when there's a seat here why today all right so then we find out from faith is [Music] oh my God will be part of his body um and the bride will have will have to be the world who is Christ Christian the word Christian Chicago and where is Christ Christian Christ is in the church if Christ is in the church will have to be the one the word denominations I'm preparing people for the tribulation and they are also preaching in many other places in order for you to be lifted up [Music] good job with Jesus Christ foreign foreign

is it is by this time amen [Applause] is our Trinity now [Music] so that they can get money but foreign [Music] foreign [Music] there you are crazy it is [Music] and you're addressing the same way when you're coming to church choir you find them there in the church with fornication they go away full of loss why because the church it's no longer the gospel that is not the gospel the Bible says on to the Pentacles so we must be restored again not to that time see what you said actually or Pentacles is a Street Revival be restored back again why would I truly know [Music] and now the thing of it is after we find out these things that Christ is coming for his bride away now how do we get into that right how do I get it no we have a song We Sing twinkle twinkle little once again [Music] glorious Church in the blood without spottering gold it's a glorious Church Without a spotter wrinkle washed in the blood of the lot sing it with all your heart is so glorious Jack without me the spot

you know everyone every human being has emotions every human being all of you are looking at me have emotions but the issue is when is your emotion activated think about it if you're young I love you

other foreign [Music] for them what is wrong with them too intimidated to rejoice [Music] that's what we believe but that was not in my notes Let Me continue here he says How could a man or a woman or a child of God as born of the spirit of God deny the word of God when God himself interpreted and said this is it I promise you here it is showing it as plain as it can yeah why they are bound to see it to see but holy spirit how would could Christ deny his own word and if Christ is in you cannot deny his amen I found one young man there you know he was preaching so yeah we preached to three women they pray for them they will come by the way Brothers we started amen so when we went into one God when I went into water baptism when we went into women preachers but the Bible says a woman should
