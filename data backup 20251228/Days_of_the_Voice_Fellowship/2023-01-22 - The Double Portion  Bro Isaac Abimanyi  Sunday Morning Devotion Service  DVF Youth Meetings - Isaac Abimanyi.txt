a victorious day we thank God for his Provisions they are new every morning for him amen amen let us go uh uh in the Bible and read a certain scripture the second in the book of second Kings chapter 2 verse 9. um we talk about something and then second Kings chapter 2 verse 9. all right and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray the late a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me foreign foreign foreign and it is according to God's purpose and you should understand that you are here for a purpose otherwise you would have been somewhere in the world enjoying the world never to waste any single moment to yield ourselves to God in everything that we have now praise God Amen I'm brother Isaac next month that is February 24th um I'll be making five years in marriage has taken some time but I thank God foreign as long as it is in God you get it in God it will ever be enjoyable where praise God Hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus Christ so I want to talk about some little thing here expecting foreign it seems to be funny but some of us we don't pray in the morning I was there in the dormitory yesterday but some youth not even prayers yes we come from the bed and then they take off my name is a minister told us that we should cry to the Lord every morning that is when you commit your day to the Lord praise God Hallelujah I mean this should be our custom it should be our Behavior yeah when we are I fight as Christians praise God who knows about it is a matter about money not every morning you have to go down on your knees and you pray but yet [Music] praise God what you prayed in the morning for the Lord to give you is praise God praying in the morning that is where you get your strength from I want to talk about this man called Elijah I was a young man like you like you Hallelujah I mean praise God Elijah serving God and then his time was over to take him home then Elijah was the man that was following Elijah now it was time for Elisha to take over foreign we have got about ahead and time is going to come when the pastor shall be taken out today you are a sister you're going to be a mom ENT you're going to be a minister some people have to look at you picking the character you have as an example foreign is there something that should come into your mind that you come here for a purpose and a purpose is to serve the world Hallelujah I mean some of you maybe you came here just to see your brother your sister and even some of you maybe you came looking for a some young sister [Music] whatever foreign elders [Music] Ray is The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ I talk about the elders Hallelujah when I talk about the elders I talk about the pastor other Elders in the church time is going to come when you will have to take over what the pastor has been doing has been doing [Music] you will have to stand and preach today but you have to start it now [Music] praise God hallelujah not just to pass on time but he's just molding his character in you such that you can serve him praise God now Elijah understood his purpose or the purpose in his life and he decided to follow Elijah whatever he could go [Music] was going to be taken away and no one was with him other than Elijah hallelujah praise the wonderful Jesus Christ when time came in verse 9 where are we ready says it came to pass when they were gone over I shall do for this before I be taken away from me and Elisha said let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon him the overcoming generation we have been talking about we don't need a single a single person we need a double portion in everything that we ask from God we should ask for a double portion Hallelujah because God is able to give it to you more than you think blessings for a double portion that is this year that is what this young man got uh got revealed on I'm thinking about Elisha he knew that a single person is not enough for him Hallelujah it was an energetic was powerful he was determined and ambitious I knew very well that a single person it's not going to take him anywhere so he asked for a double portion hallelujah praise God and you should ask for another person everything you asked from God you should ask about it praise God I mean because the Bible's God promises everywhere we read and they are our promises because we are the seed over Abraham we are the spiritual Israelites and more according to your faith so whenever you're asking God praying to God in the morning tell him Lord give me a double portion hallelujah praise God let us catch the same Revelation that Elisha coach put in the Bible as our example foreign that you might learn from Hallelujah and you become an overcoming a generation Hallelujah why is it that we don't overcome these days because we limit ourselves when you go to pray you pray for one hour I mean for 30 minutes 20 minutes Hallelujah and even some of you you pray when you are on your bed already lying Hallelujah I mean sometimes even some of you pray foreign [Music] spiritual blessings some of us even don't even take time to read the Bible Hallelujah yes the Bible should be uh it is considered to be a a shield and a spirit of a Believer praise God even even though when you are at school you have to be having the Bible you read it today is The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ away I know you've got Bibles on your phones you have to have this Bible praise the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so we should be youth of purpose that is when we are going to overcome all right no foreign Hallelujah not to just sing about it to just sing about it sometimes we sing one of the people and then you see people singing and shouting Hallelujah I mean because when there are some songs that takes us back to air uh maybe we get accumulated when we sing when we sing about one of them you see people getting stimulated they dance their hands everywhere [Music] but then when you tell them sing I Surrender [Applause] Hallelujah they say forgetting that there is a certain meaning in that song about it it lifts you up and higher for them they like songs that let them flow their hands in the air and they dance and they enjoy reflecting how they used to do it when they were in this in the Disco praise God I mean Hallelujah I mean praise God but we should ever meditate upon those words you know when you're singing one of them let it be your prayer the Lord hallelujah praise God not just to sing anyhow so it should be a prayer every morning when you're going to church if you're going to visit one person in that church or in our church I'd be one of those people back to have praise God that is the purpose of praying in the morning Hallelujah that is where your strength comes from don't pray in the morning if you don't pray any money if you don't start your day by reading the word of God I don't know where your strength comes from Hallelujah I mean that is why we are having a weak generation but we came here we come here hallelujah to give you some golden nuggets that you might be rejuvenated that you may get transformed Jesus Christ is why you came here Hallelujah praise God so make sure I don't live here when you're not in the Bible you are still called somehow you're still formal oh yeah because when you should go down on your knees for the remaining services to me touch me once more not just to sing about it they deliver when you're contemplating about the message Hallelujah the people that composed those songs came after composing such songs Hallelujah I mean the anointing Came Upon them they composed the songs after composing them when the anointing left to them some of them killed themselves this song There is a fountain to always filled with bread the anointing afterwards left then he searched for that Fountain welcome he searched for that Fountain but he could not find it still when he hanged himself what I mean the songs had anointing upon them and they are still having anointing upon them they've got deep deeper meaning foreign [Music] a generation of Overcomers [Music] he was so ambitious for the things of God not ambitious for the things of the world because when you love the world is not in you praise God they are contrary if you love the things of God you learn to hate the things of the world praise God hallelujah I'm saying Elisha was a person that loved the things of God sorry forsook the world and followed a servant of God that is what we should do it whatever we have on our side the preacher said every way we should late aside Hallelujah and run this race successfully and Faithfully Hallelujah every way hatred which I married when he's a liar praise God maybe it is a way of Escape praise God I mean but I'm telling you brother sister then the same thing [Music] because they are all flute so yeah who can tell me lie mother mother fornication because you know what to do and then you reject to do it then that is unbelief as a Believer you know it's very well that you should not lie you should not commit fornication the pastor is not seeing me the difference when you enter into that house of that boy knowing the house of that sister praise God hallelujah what does the devil does in this generation he uses fornication among the youth praise God take away the power okay praise God I mean the power would have used to serve God praise God Amen then he takes it away with fornication he takes away the love of God and then he gives you lies instead of overcoming whatever you go down on your knees [Music] because God has got a purpose over your life Hallelujah when he looks out to you he sees an overcomer he sees an overcoming generation of Overcomers now pictures of preached the gospel why does oh what is the devil going to do he is going to tempt you in the very things you've had here again that is where the Temptations are going to come from when you go back home to watch and pray some of us we pray and then we don't watch just pray and go on then you find the person who was praising in the church then he's taken under fornication why because we pray and sometimes we don't watch [Applause] seven Hallelujah Nina praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ I pray you take these words and it's so crucial yeah praise God because we don't know whether we shall get this one this time uh This Moment again we don't know what is going to happen tomorrow maybe we shall be taken the tomatoes take these words and so crucial that is why you should even have somewhere you're joking Hallelujah yes I want us to follow that to read that James chapter 7. it is James let me first in chapter 4 verse 7. jacobo is listen to what it says submit yourselves to God fall to God this is the devil s we just resist the devil by praying and watching look I'm reading the word of God hallelujah hallelujah I was talking to a certain brother sometimes I don't rush for the devil and he said I don't rush I give him some time praise God so after some time he was taken under fornication up to now he's not back to church he was giving devil some space of time you understand he said I don't rush for the devil God of him and now it is here there it is years he's not hit back to church please just resist the devil praise God the only reason with the devil Hallelujah if it is possible they have attractions yourselves to God overcome [Music] Amina you don't overcome from anywhere Hallelujah I mean you have to do something Hallelujah I mean but remember Ephesians chapter 16 we don't race [Music] through prayers I mean you should learn to be a full-time Christian because the devil you're fighting with is a full-time devil the problem comes from we are part-time [Music] if you want to overcome you should so totally to God that is when you're going to receive a double portion from God when that time hallelujah praise God hallelujah I mean let me read this one quote and then we wind up Hallelujah in a message God is confident with Abraham and his seed it was preached 56. 72. Elijah being a type of the church he said I mean Elijah the type being a type of Christ area that you explain Angel Christian at Elijah the type of the church and the old [Applause] what will you do what with you that I do that entire portion of your spirit come upon me [Applause] hallelujah oh the trouble today we got too many spiritual cross highly children church members with close eyes one eye it is that is the problem we are having with the youth today what is the reason why we are not overcoming yes [Applause] serving me to decide praise God and there was an instruction you take aid of the two babies this side was was was what Noir ants praise God they were serving meet this side I decided we are serving hands praise God the money wanted me so much and he also enjoyed the ants so much he said oh let me go inside then he stopped and then he looked at the ants he said oh I should take ants and yes then he said it may be let me opt for something like this one leg there [Applause] praise God till when the man ended oh every here by the end of the day he had to break praise God so that is the problem today with some Christians today they want Christ the eyes are looking unto the world still it comes back to Calvary Church is a spiritual brother when it gets outside he becomes a brother trouble sisters so much praise God the trouble sisters and even the worldly sisters that is when you're going to overcome that is when you're going to be given a double portion everything the world you will stumble as sure as the world [Applause] let your eyes hey let your eyes [Applause]
