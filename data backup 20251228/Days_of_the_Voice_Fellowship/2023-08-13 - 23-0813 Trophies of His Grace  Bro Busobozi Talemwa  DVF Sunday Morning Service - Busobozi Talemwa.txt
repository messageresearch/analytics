Ephesians chapter 2. so but tonight we shall this morning we shall begin from today even when we were dead in sins as quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus yes for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God is do we believe that do we believe that a lot of Works lest any man should boast created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them yes I mean it may you may be seated so I'm speaking to you um and of course I want to Welcome All of You In The Name of Jesus Amen I'm sorry my mind is you know just focusing on the world Amen so I'm speaking to you on trophies of his grace [Music] they say one of the definition is a cup or other decorative objects awarded inclusion paid as a prize for a victory or success and the winner of the race usually gets a cup when they play football then the winner of the race gets a cup a surprise for their victory you can get a prize or a cup or something or just recognize your success and so um then in another definition this is according to ancient Rome uh and Greece trophy was weapons of a defeated army or questions [Music] we are looking at ancient Rome you know those who used to fight with swords and so now when they would go and fight an army and they defeat that amen then they would take all the weapons of that defeated and they would set it up in a place somewhere as a memorial of the victory praise the name of the Lord so these weapons were simply now there today display the mighty power of the of the Victorious Force the belt like the people who the Champions the the kickboxing um the Champions you know they they win belts and you know belt after belt after belt depending on how many times they win and you know it is it's not going to do anything with it really it is a sign of his victory it is uh it shows uh how great it is it's an outcome of the fighter he fought and therefore he will treasure it and so of course you are not going to go out there and then come back full of blood and say I've killed a hundred or some men again you have to come back with the trophies of your Victory and that was the heads of those that is [Music] and actually Christianity has been turned into a place where men try to work their own salvation did you know the major difference between Christianity and Islam Islam to be able to go to Jannah you have to kill some infidels you have to do certain things that's why the very very specific with their prayer times you have to pray at a certain time three times a day you know you have to do this and if you do all those things collectively depending on how much you have done it can buy you a journal we are trophies [Applause] something to boost [Music] [Music] we all walked according to the course of this world walking according to the prince of the power of the air in the two times we all fulfill the desires of the flesh no listen we all fulfill the desires of the mind is that true is that true church we were all by Nature friends so in other words being God at his throne in heaven she left his powers only to come down here on Earth foreign Jesus was God himself yes and the word was put on next so what who is the word god cartoon now God cartoon put on yeah if you understand it say amen I mean god cartoon put on flesh and he came among us but when people never recognized him they never understood who he was but he was the god of Glory he came down from Glory Faith one baptism so if Jehovah God in the Old Testament was Lord and Jesus is Lord that simply means became Jesus the Jehovah of the Old Testament the Jesus of the New Testament yes why would he do that why would he humble himself it is right there in verse 7. it says that in ages to come the exceeding Riches of his grace kindness toward us through Christ Jesus Christ [Music] tell someone he wanted to show back he wanted to show his infinite grace I pray that God will give you an inspiration to understand what I'm speaking about proof of his grace you know his purpose has been you know to be able to to say I point at something pointed at someone look at my infinite grace how could he do that yes when he was in heaven how could you show his grace what is Grace unmerited favor hey Jesus the Bible says and is God by himself he does what he wants to do no one questions no one questions don't question God God is only to be believed that's why we are believers we are believers we don't question how many believers do I have in the sanctuary we believe God being god without sin to come in the Garden of Eden yeah if you can have a lot of questions there that's why we need to learn to believe him we need always to give our battles to him he has to fight them yeah my battle is the Lord is higher than the stars of God said no I can't let this happen Michael Go and show him so Michael came by the authority of God Amen the Bible says and when he came Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah I believe what I'm preaching to you this morning I told you what church whatever I preach to you I believe Hallelujah so I believe Securities are God knows all things I believe even what the devil is planning against my life and I also know God has a solution for what the devil is planning against HIV why did God let the devil come right because he wanted to manifest you know he overcame the devil yeah I'm gonna sit down but you see you never how can God come down and tell you he's a god of Grace [Music] foreign [Music] whereby instead of Adam giving birth to sons of God much foreign [Music] [Music] now all of them are going to be born and they're all going to be in here they're going to be mine but wait a moment God let that happen there is something that God knew that the devil did know when they sinned and hid away God didn't wait for them God came down right quick what is that church that's the sound of Grace Hallelujah foreign the proof of his grace I am a proof of his grace hallelujah amen we are walking trophies of the grace of Jesus Christ if you want the proof Jesus died yes look at me and you will know look at the Son and Daughter of God Jesus died and rose again we are the trophies Hallelujah foreign foreign foreign [Music] hallelujah oh my God I wish you find a better word a better word you see it's a it's a it's a sign it's a weapon in this case a weapon of um of the of the memories [Music] that changes men and women foreign [Music] [Music] anything a child of God will say and you fight against number one you you cast it or whatever it is you will never be forgiven someone said what is that scripture whatever is done or said against the Holy Spirit that's the only sin it should change where is the holy spirit today it is you shall be received whoever rejects you I never go back shake off the dusted it's a strong strong force that's why don't anger a child of God you remember in the Bible we find that there was Elisha he was the son of God when he was angered you know he he out of anger he called Bears simply because the children were laughing at him at his bone here and he called she bears from the forest movies that's why it is very very serious when you are standing or speaking to a child of God I'm not talking about preachers I'm talking about the blood boat and when you know that also power that can change things even certain times when things don't happen the way you expected you can speak something and it happens to somebody without you know be careful how you use your mind don't speak either word use cuss words amen you don't think your thoughts tell the words that you're the one you don't think your thoughts don't always of you you say I think no you have no thought coming up the life that was in Christ I am telling you of your place and position in Christ that's why if Christians knew this is rushing to so-called men of God to anoint them with oil and cast out demons and rather and you know cast out casters the Bible says in the Book of Mark chapter 16. because the sign shall follow them that believe not essential for the prophets no the sign someone can foreign [Music] and the poison won't work you because you are not a normal human being hallelujah amen the life I don't know whether we understand the life that was in Christ when he was on Earth which life was in him God his own life you could forgive sins he says to forgive sins but you have that life you're just not exercising a woman would come with an adultery and he stopped it with a supernatural his life if his life is in you all the sinners because they will realize [Music] [Music] that's the same life that is hallelujah amen I said Hallelujah the life that was in crisis in you the mind that wasn't in crisis in you and there was a Christian The Works that was in Christ is in you every corner and Christ himself is in you you are dead amen your life is through Christ you are sealed there by the holy ghosts when the angel of death sees the blood then he passes you see 31 he wants was not responsible the token must be displayed if it wasn't displayed then it was of non-effects you could believe in it you could say oh yes I believe it but that didn't do it I will tell you what I will do I'll put it in a bucket buckets but really I think as long as I have it in here if I had the blood over here am I preaching to someone you're not going boredita according to what mothers say mustache had to take the blood um you think it was easier for people to do that the ones who are living in cushions what's wrong with them even so and so maybe if you had your friend an Egyptians [Music] the brother who is the very beginning put your name [Music] foreign that was the Place hey [Music] where are the sacred boys and the sacred girls [Music] sacred Christians these days we may not have our every one of us may not have a house but if you have Facebook never manifest if you have a wall if you have what's up you have your status there I will take out your own please [Music] I will know your spiritual status [Applause] got to be and walk with it no time these days others even by Bibles which are like notebooks people don't think they are religious so you buy a Bible and then you make sure it doesn't look like not so large so that people just think you have an audience [Music] that's the truth I doubt your testimony questions no you are quiet but as the truth let us put the talking on this planet let them know who we are in the world we dressed amen amen let them Behold our chest conversation and let them know those are Christians you've got to have it you've got to have it on display that was the purpose of putting it on the doors it is something you were not ashamed of course you want the whole world to know that you are dead and your life is here Daddy [Music] [Music] let me let me let me let me take this a little further cables the Lord said unto Satan come here come and Satan have you considered my servant job that there is one that fears evil yeah Amina foreign you know all the demons roaming around and walking in that Universe they must be able to answer the same from God God is singing about jokes God is singing there's nothing excuse me [Music] I want to introduce foreign display to show the people and the princess [Music] for she was fat [Music] but the queen Varsity she refused she refused to come at the king's Commandments by his chamberlains I told you why did Jesus died why did he calm down why did you want to save us that in the ages the exceeding creatures of his grace and I'm telling you about this whoever you meet in this life foreign and you don't understand crook and let me tell you many many Christians are Christian groups God help us God help us but I want you to see yeah it was the same same way was the same same way yeah was happy he was married with wine I don't know whether this is and so he was so happy and you know this King answered us at the time he was he was ruling a very vast Kingdom half of the Earth was the king of kings and before I continue I wanted to understand that is a type of Christ you know the Bible is not a Bible it's not a book of History it has the things people are reading it has the meaning behind us but the children of God are given that deep food they are to marry another woman foreign all I want is Jesus Christ and this this chamberlains oh seven Church age Messengers God will send a message and God has sent us the last message the true office of a woman in the church yes oh I always say so when royalty meets royalties Esther was distinct for the throne the moment the king looked at us the

Ephesians I want you to see a little bit about Gracia before I conclude as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him you know when you talk about his exceeding reaches Riches of Gaga who can you define as a rich man one was 10 billion oh yeah how much Mecca anyway he has a lot of wealth and he can't confide [Music] [Music] so that I might receive Grace according as he has chosen me in him for the foundation of the world some people think that they can actually sin to surpass the grace of God many people even feel that to be baptized because I like how can I like God I am not I know I have done I am a bad person is very good some even fear to come to church because they feel they are sinners when we are singing they fear to rejoice and the devil likes you when you go to a club better than anybody else when you are in charge not because you don't know how to dance what happens when you come to the house you can't even say anime the Bible says where the spirit of God is foreign ye why because let me show you something because he judges I want to show you his grace was there before your sin some of you didn't get that day how many years do you have 40 50 30 Your Grace his grace was there before Charlie walk you sinned foreign they were even born did he know you were going to sing he knew that yeah because without Grace there is no man will ever see God the Bible says he charged you yeah before the foundation of the world now listen some people think Grace is a license to continue doing bad things that is disgrace making the grace of God foreign foreign foreign can you say it he trust me if you believe inside he chose It Is by Grace it is this kind of Grace such you know is above and beyond this kind of Grace many people don't know this kind of Grace this kind of Grace this kind of Grace this kind of Grace this kind of Grace you are without blevation foreign so when I walk in time I know I'm a toffee of his friends I don't care about the past my past might have been so ugly heavier but I can't relate Hallelujah you cannot do that to do that quality is to betray the grace of God such as

yourself imagine how many times lies you have told me Grace abounded more than that it is now in your past imagine how many fornications you have done Grace did not kill you the Lord would have killed you were here and because you confess yourself you actually never did them do you know what justification is justification is that your sins are forgiven not only forgiven it is like it is like you never actually did them it is thrown into the sea of forgetfulness he doesn't know that you did it this is you in your memory that you remember I did this and this I did this you are still counting God doesn't remember anything at the moment you confessed it is forgiveness is Grace cleanses you and your sins are far away from you and the West is so some people think they have sinned so far that they cannot be restored that's why the devil lies to them each other the devil lies to you and he tells you this is your life you will always be a one Bieber you can never leave alcohol you know you
