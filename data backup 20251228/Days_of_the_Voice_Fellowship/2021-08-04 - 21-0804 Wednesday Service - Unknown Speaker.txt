everything we do oh god it will be pleasing to you lord father even the the clip we are going to listen to their father which was uh uh preached beforehand i prayed here that you would be able to be a blessing to each and every one of us and even most especially to be able to know you more and to understand what it is that you have prepared for us in our time father we just commit this evening and the service into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ [Music] i just want to welcome you to the service this evening in the name of our lord jesus and at this time i think i should uh work on projecting that the video that i promised that i would be sharing today now the one we put up on youtube i think by now it should be running by 6 45 so by now it's already running maybe yes but we shall have to replace it with the one we are going to watch because the editing had some few problems so to those of you who have been following up on this video i'm really wanting to encourage you to usually have your book i don't know because this is a continuation of our bible studies on tuesdays are you hearing me on tuesdays and on friday so this is also a study on its own it's talking about the dispensation of the gentiles i think one of one service i'll have to do questions and answers whereby i am the one asking questions and you are the ones giving the answers because we need to know and to be sure that we are following and understanding what it is that we are talking about amen so please listen carefully i really need your undivided attention as you listen to uh uh to the south to to this video and i hope that it can be a blessing to you and that we know that there is going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as sure to be as god is because it's his word come out over my people said the your lord your self-style thing i will receive yourself lord greetings to you once again uh my brother and sister who's listening to us my name is welcome to the voice of the days of the voice broadcast days of the voice i trust that this will be a blessing to you now we're just picking up from where we left from together pretending we killed our way to our command and we are just dealt with the first church age and i'd like you to look at verse eight in your bible in chapter two of the book of revelations and just it says and unto the angel of the church in this manner right this thing says the first and the last witch was dead and is alive i know they works and tribulation and poverty but that had reached and i know that blasphemy of them which said that they are jews and are not are the synagogues of saturn for none of these of those things which thou shalt suffer before the devil shall cast some of you into prison that he may be tried and he that he shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful and to death and i will give thee a crown of life and we noticed that this was the time that in the church of jesus christ was under india's persecution and in this church age [Music] which actually was a substance used to embalm the day but also it was a bitter substance so two things out of that which is bitterness and death cathy one and as you notice here on versus uh just turn back to where we've just read whatever and it took that one remember to vote he says verse 10 fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer before the devil shall cast some of you into prison that he may be tried and that he shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful and to death and i will give thee a crown of life [Music] who persecuted the believers for us 10 years but god gave them grace now you can turn them away to stand for the truth hold on to the wise [Music] i'm just going through it quite fast [Music] with the two agents i know that it works even where suddenly it is [Music] a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so as to thou also then that all the doctrine of the nicolas which thing is this is the generation where the church and the state came together remember this was the same period in 325.80 [Music] [Music] [Music] uh they put a hierarchy never taken a man whom they called or the one that was seated on behalf of god you antichrist you know everything that is anti-world is antichrist and so from that time we see that even the bible itself says that's where saturn is sick [Music] [Music] [Music] and this went on until uh until 606. [Music] then came another generation before remember [Music] [Music] [Music] and we see that this is happening [Music] he teaches something that is not in the scripture then are you going to go with what scripture says or what is there the bible speaks about from verse 18. [Music] [Music] [Music] is you ever been into what you're saying on the bible it's the spirit of jesus whenever you see a woman wanting to dominate to take over that's a spirit of jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] of a child canisters [Music] [Applause] she took over the people to control the people yes they do they [Music] the [Music] is [Music] [Music] they came on others [Music] he [Music] [Music] [Music] was uh uh a a man of the love goats in the street for the truth even when the rest rejected the truth at that time [Music] where [Music] and that we know that there is going to be a brand and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the sky that's just as sure to be as god is because it's his word come out over my people said the lord lord god bless you god bless you all now i i'd just like to just add a few things from what we have had the video which we were streaming it's just a continuation of the first three that we have already streamed for the last three wednesdays so we we we are also putting this on the app maybe just to inform you if you do not know some of you already on your phone you have a google podcast you can even check it now if you can if you're not using your phone google podcast you already have google podcast there and you can just go inside google podcast and type days of the voice fellowship and then be able to get these clips as we we upload them there also the service yesterday is already up there how many have already been able to see it let me see your hands those of you who are here yeah only one huh yeah the subs of yesterday yes it's already on google podcast and also if you even if you're using apple uh there is a uh apple podcast for those who are using up apple yes i also see brother peter's got it so you there are also other applications of course there are quite very many that we are on but i thought it's just uh necessary i mean at least if you have android you will have to get google podcast if you do not have android and you have a iphone then you can be able to get it from your uh from your upper podcast the rest you can just start it if you are using another podcast app so that is for those who just want to listen maybe when they are doing something else or walking or running or or you know doing something or driving whichever it is you can be able to get it from there in audio format and then be able to listen to it uh maybe you want to recommend it to a friend someone who is not in the message and they would like you'd love them to listen so just do not be the whole service we also put just those those clips of the audios you know friends to me i think it's later than we think and i believe i don't know what each of you really believes and really is convicted in your heart but why are we doing all this we are not doing all this to introduce ourselves to the people you see i believe that each of us has a responsibility to do whatever they can to reach out to the others and tell them about what god is doing in this generation now i am not going to wait for someone else to do it for me because when i go before the lord he will ask me what did i do personally you know what what did i do what did you do so as an individual each of us should do something not only on the church uh a platform or on the church level or you know pastoral level ministers level church level some people wait for others to do things and they then they can be able to do i i would like each of you to take this responsibility upon yourself well but the bottom side if you can't go support someone else who is going so if you cannot do this and it has already been done then you have a phone share it with someone who might be blessed you never know what a lord will do some of these things already you you already used to eat you'll be like well i will share it with you now you know me i already know everything now why do i have to share it after all you know well you might not need to know you might not you you might not find the reason why you have to share it but i assure you you share it with somebody someone will hear it and someone will believe they will all not believe but someone will believe those who are ordained to this life those who are dead to this word will hear it and they will believe it so do all that you can send it out and reach out to a friend and tell them what god is doing in this day and encourage them to listen to the podcasts or the youtube videos or or even meet them and evangelize to them and do whatever you can i believe once we have finished our battle here we will know indeed it was worth it all right now in this video as i i'm just concluding here we were able to talk about a few things uh you know about uh what good was doing in the ages but you see i can never emphasize over emphasize that part of the nicolas you know that spirit is now no longer working only the denominations but it is pushing its way in even among the believers and you find that you know one day i i i know we are streaming this so i will not mention the the names of uh the churches and the people because it could be watched so i one day i was in nairobi and i was in a certain church and this was a believer's church it's quite a large church and then they were going to have the lord's supper that evening and then a young lady came in and she was from another church but she had come to fellowship in this church so she's also from another church of the message and another large church so when she came in and they noticed that they were doing uh she knows that they were doing communion she said i will not partake of it i will not partake of it you know everybody was shocked why wouldn't you partake of it well because this is not my church you know my church is the other i was actually personally shocked i was like what you mean you can only partake of communion in your church what do you mean by message doesn't have different churches the message is one christ is one and there is only one church of jesus christ we are only the different fellowships that's why when you are excommunicated from one body of believers you are excommunicated from the entire body of christ when you are blessed in one body of believers you are blessed in the entire body of christ when you are elected as a deacon in one body of christ you are in one body of believers you are a deacon all over the body of jesus christ do you know that if you are a minister in the body of a believer somewhere you are a minister all over the entire body of jesus christ all over the world so this there's nothing like my church the other church their church we are believers of the message and we must know that we have come out of denominations and we we must never accept to be laid by denominational ideas whereby you are limited the holy spirit is limited to use you to one area to one group of people to you know the holy spirit will use you everywhere you go as long as you are you know led by the holy spirit and you know i'm going to read you two quotes some of you who have already been following this you have had this because you have started on it uh but i just thought i should i should read this and this i sent it to a brother he said but uh in the ephesian church age the ephesians church age it says the order of the temple service is also very revealing they were talking about the temple that was the temple of that woman what was her name someone remind me yes diana yes the type of diana in ephesus and uh so the order of the temple is trying to talk about it and then he says there were first of all priests who were eunuchs this terrible priest would precede that sterility over people who would drift from the world for a people who claim to know god apart from the word uh baron or life uh sorry about enough life as instead as is a sterile unit secondly the temple had within its confines the virgin priestesses who performed the religious acts of the temple now these are virgins meaning they cannot they have not brought forth life and these are eunuchs meaning they cannot bring forth life so we have two different types of people who were the ones that were prevalent in this temple of diana yeah if you can share the quote for us that will be wonderful okay then he says secondly now of course we're looking at the temple of diana but then he says this temple of diana had this type of people inside that temple so even today we have churches which are actually like the temple of diana we have people who cannot bring forth life secondly the temple had within its confines the virgin priestesses who performed the religious acts of the temple this showed further the day that that ceremony and form ritual that ceremony and form are you following me here that ceremony and form ritual and works would take the place of the holy spirit no longer would the charismatic manifestation feel the temple of god please i would like you to emphasize on that he says that that the people we are no longer following or being led like oh you know what what was in the temple was no longer the charismatic manifestation of the spirit you know but what was it he he you know the holy spirit something else had overtaken it and he said what had overtaken it number one ceremony number two form number three rachel number four wax and i wonder whether or not believers have not reached that level whereby they only look at the rituals they do the ceremonies they do the forms of their form of religion and the works they do and they thought that this was to be a believer but actually to be a believer you must be led by the holy spirit you must receive the holy spirit in your life whereby he leads you every moment of your life when you are even going to say something wrong or do something wrong or or think something wrong the holy spirit will point you out and tell you not to do that whereby whereby when you were in the church you don't just sit as though you are dead because you you have life within you whereby you respond whereby you you are touched by the power of the holy ghost and there must be manifestation filling the temple feeding the house of god over them all was the high priest a man of the of political power and and public influence portraying what was already in progress you see though not too many not not too manifested that is the church would soon be given over to the leadership of a man this is where i wanted to come to in connection to the the the nicolaitan spirit the church would soon be given over to the leadership of a man with manny's plans and manny's ambitions and that's a holy ghost would no longer be a living reality you know it's now all about a man and what what the man wants to do it's all about the man and what the man is led to do it's all about the man it's no longer about the holy ghost oh god help us and that we will be able to go back hallelujah whereby the holy ghost will be able to lead us amen whereby we will not allow ourselves at any time to be led by uh by man or to be led by our own instincts but to be led by the holy ghost hallelujah amen and the other and underneath them all were the tempest slaves who had no choice but obedience for the religious hierarchy and that is supposed to be the believers now they're just there as slaves whereby all you have to do the pastor said it i mean the pastor said it right the pastor said it true the pastor said it you don't even need to know whether it is in the word or not we are the church of jesus christ not the church of a certain certain pastor we must be laid by the holy spirit we have come out of the denominations which we are led by men like the pope men like the high priests whatever they call them we have come out of it we have come out that's why we do not have a headquarter you find our headquarters here no our headquarters in heaven and our archbishop is jesus christ therefore it means we each of us must be led by the holy ghost yes but abandon somewhere there you go down there he says he believes in men being controlling the church but by by the holy ghost you know when they okay you've gone too far hallelujah yes right there what this mean what can this mean but the day would come when the vested clergy by political maneuvering state health and the substitution of word and spirit for creeds dogmas and human leadership would enslave the laity while the later meeting the believers while the leaders luxuriated in ill-gotten wealth and enjoyed their filthy pleasures and the poor people who were to be served according to god now became the servants did you know that actually the true preachers the true ministers are supposed to be the servants did you know that i am a servant i am only but a servant i do what he tells me to do and you are the child of god you are the main thing i am the main thing anyone who is preaching to me must preach to me christ if they can't preach to me christ i do not want to know and who is christ christ is the word christ is the message christ is the bible christ is the word of god revealed in our day if any preacher preaches something outside of that he is not preaching christ and i read the last quote here in the message the ephesians church age he says now what was the spiritual climate of that church it had left its first love the spiritual climate of the first church of the church rather had left its first love leaving its first love of the word of god was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin which was pentecost so the origin of the church was pentecost but the church had now by this time fallen away from it in a plain english that means this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the holy spirit you see how important it is the control of the spirit you see god wants the church to be in control to be under the control of the spirit can you say amen to that this was exactly what took place after moses led israel out of egypt the way of god was to lead them by the cloud of fire prophetic utterance miracles and signs and god given wonders this was to be accompanied by god selected god ordained and god equipped and god sent men hallelujah with the whole camp being dominated by a holy ghost move you see all of us being dominated you know domination is whereby someone is controlling you you know when we they were talking about the spirit of jezebel where it was wherever it was dominating over the church but in this case it's not the spirit of jesus but the spirit of jesus is the spirit of religion you know whereby you find people even in the message but having religious spirits on them but here we find out whereby god is saying no the men that are preaching are going selected god ordained god equipped god sent and also the whole camp meaning the old church the old group of believers is dominated by a holy ghost move oh i want to be that kind of church hallelujah whereby we are all dominated by a holy ghost move whereby the holy spirit will tell you go on the streets somewhere and talk about me wherever you tell you speak to that man about chris whatever you it will tell you you have done something wrong before you even know you have done something wrong whereby you will correct you wherever you will guide you ever you will let you know what to do you know the pastor will only be there to just say yes just be another voice too because the bible says by the word of two or three witnesses a word shall be established so if the holy spirit leads you and he leaves another or two in the same direction then you will surely know it is the holy spirit that's what brother andrew was trying to say even yesterday you see you will be able to lead the whole believers in in the same channel i don't know i do believe he was not trying to say that it is the church which is going to select a wife for you to marry but he was trying to say that it is it is if the holy spirit surely runs through you to to make you believe that it is you're going to marry someone that someone holds people will agree in another person agree in the past agreeing the deacons are great you understand the holy spirit cannot if you have the holy ghost and you believe you're led by the holy ghost and another person and another one and i don't have the holy ghost they will all agree with you but if they don't agree with you and it appears you are the only one who is right then ask yourself do you have the holy ghost if you think you have the holy ghost then check it out with someone else who you think has the holy ghost hallelujah who has a testimony of the holy ghost then you can be able to know sure you are led by the holy spirit because the holy spirit in every believer will agree you know the majority of it that's why even sometimes when it comes to electing the you know pastor of the church or deacons or things like that we take the majority why because we believe that the holy spirit cannot lead all of them in the wrong direction you see the world camp will be dominated by a holy ghost move they rebelled and wanted herself a set of rules and agreed to go by that's why in this message we don't have a set of rules can you can i hear you say amen we don't have a set of creeds to go by we don't have any of that oh i'm so glad amen that i'm not even ruled by a set of rules instead of crates then they wanted a king then they wanted to be exactly like the world and went into complete apostasy and oblivion and oblivion that is exactly how the first church age started and it will get worse and worse and today it is even worse much worse until the holy spirit is completely rejected and god must destroy the people and when the holy spirit is completely rejected i assure you then god will destroy the people but i thank god that i'm still here and i'm believing in the holy spirit and and i and you are believing the holy spirit and i believe that we will not be destroyed will not be denied but we will go in the rapture hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord may god bless you as you continually are led of the holy spirit everywhere you go everything you do that you are leader of the holy ghost amen let the holy spirit lead you you know say that well sing a song on this day meditate over that song pray over that song and come to sing that song and bless the church this is the things that we desire whereby the holy spirit leads you to do things amen not mind leading you to do something hallelujah amen the lord bless you let us sing a song here as okay i had my song here i don't know where it went okay i lost it but we can sing i believe god i believe god it shall
