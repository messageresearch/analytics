believe God Amen and we know that our side amen [Music] so we should continue believing for that family there is a a v that we've heard uh I think others greeted the church but brother Michael yes from God bless you you're welcome amen thank you so much for coming to fellowship with us and there's also sister God bless you now this one is my S and you are welcome she told Mom this morning I want to go and fellowship with you we welcome you so much may the Lord bless you we believe the Bible and we believe if you have the thirst and hunger for the word God is going to fill you up amen amen um my mother lost um uh what you would call um I know we even announced it badly last time uh but the person that died was her only living father remaining living father Yes who uh in that case would be my grandfather so the only remaining one and he happened to be uh a brother in the in the Roman Catholic church so on my mother's side most of of her people are Roman Catholics and not just Catholics but they were really into the the uh the I don't know how to call it the system the system yes find their fathers brothers [Music] sisters was raised in the in the convent for H for a few years so as we went there for barrial last week I found that there was um very many other brothers that had been buried in that place and most of them die very late stages in their life uh so you find that they in '90s of course they usually leave they married to the church and they are you know part of the system and so the church takes care of them from the moment they uh go to um become priests this particular one brother Michael um was one of the old ones actually I remember you know we used to go in in that is it called a convent yeah we used to we used to go there and visit them he was a the superior of St I think secondary school and um he he is now no more well on the side of my mother he she has lost her father and feel free to consult with cons her after the service but on on the side of the spiritual we know that we were all born in those systems but God delivered us out of and my mother I'm so glad God delivered her out of and and God delivered you out of you know my mother was saying when we went that they slept there at one of the a night before before burial and uh so they would be having a few sessions of prayer and the priest would come and preach now the father now for us we don't need to stud to become brothers the moment we believe the gospel we become brothers and we we don't have fathers our heavenly father is the father and our father would come and begin preaching for a few minutes but you know she said these words um those people are hungry because you could see that when the priest comes he surely has no food to feed the and um this this this brother what's his name uh brother Sega he came to me you know he came from those sister are the things you tell us in church people are hungry here you sit here and you can't even get anything it's as if you just there and then he come and talk Pastor You Preach to us the truth you know you cannot know when you're still there come out and you sit under the preaching of the message you cannot fit anywhere else can let me tell you I see people who back slide from the message if God doesn't give them Grace to be restored they are Aon case because there is nowhere there is no church there's no they can fit anym many of you you have been from many denominations you come and then you go to another and then you go to another but you see you kept on finding something new something new but when you arrive in this message you can no longer find anything and that's why you should make your calling an election sure and be established in the present truth so that when the trumpet of God sounds you will be ready to go in the rapt most of you you don't know what you have until you lose it so I want to admonish you don't lose what you have praise the Lord amen amen I I would also like to inform the church that next Sunday I'll be away in m I'll be ministering there is our church where we came from so uh since we actually came here we've never visited so this next Sunday will be there for meetings with them so you remember us in prayers shall we stand up on our feet we read the scripture deons you can feel free to give me two more people right here in the front uh I would also want to welcome I don't know whether they welcome you and your husband God bless you so much fellowship with you this morning to to welcome visitors amen amen we are reading in the Book of Psalms chapter Psalms 11 we will read verses 1 and two nice to see brother Roland I was at his house the other day and we had some good Fellowship there amen we are reading verses 1 and 2 Psalms 11110 the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot Ste foot stol foot stol the Lord shall send a rod of thy strength out of Zion rule thou in the midst of thine [Music] enemies amen rule thou in the midst of th enemies Amen Let us speak to the Lord for insir father once again we come to you we come to you asking you said if you shall ask anything in your name you will grant it now Lord I am nothing I don't even think that I can say anything that will bless these people in my own self just like we're talking about the priests and how the people hungry Lord we do not want to be like that we want to be fed but we know that it's only you that can feed none of us has that Grace except you give it unto them now may you come and take us out of the way and speak to your people Lord feed their hungry thiry souls and by the time we leave this place may we have that rejoicing in our heart saying that he spoke to us and that's why our hearts are burning in Grant it Lord in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated so this um those of you who missed the Wednesday service I would um really encourage you to please please go back and listen to it because the Wednesday service was the continuation of the uh Sunday last Sunday service and so if you missed Wednesday and you were here on Sunday so you missed a portion of the service please go and listen to it are listen to each other go back and listen to that you know some of you know that someone was one of those that uh can help someone to really know what we believe I was speaking on contending for the faith and there are many uh doctrines and teachings that I was trying to uh uh bring to the people and even if you were in the service go back and listen to it and you a little card on it and you never know that you know Revelation revelation will keep coming and this morning we want God to give us an inspiration to be able to speak to you on this subject of rule thou in the midst of thy enies this is not meant to be a teaching as such uh it is not meant to be that although you did not bring out properly that what I I meant to say but yeah but uh we will see how the Lord will lead us how many have enemies ah okay okay how many don't have enemies raise thank God no one ra because I was going to tell you you are a liar once again how many have enemies okay now there are those who don't have enemies and there are those who don't know that they have but as I speak right now they those who have told people speak me oh I will never talk to you again or even if you said nothing there are some of you who have uh bitterness on your heart about someone now I realize that bitterness is one of the things that will uh drown you very fast bitterness if you are rich it can make you poor if you're big it can make you small bitterness or the root of bitterness in your heart is something that a Christian should never have no matter what people do to you no matter what they do to you say no matter what they speak about you no matter what they say about you you should never come to a place where you will have a root of bitterness you find that people have bitterness women have bitterness men have bitterness fathers get bitterness wives get bitterness mothers fathers and even children and this is the even the worst part even ministers preachers pastors you you find many times they get bitterness and bitterness or the root of bitterness will bring you down faster than any powerful force you find that a preacher who has bitterness can cause a great damage to the body of Christ much faster than the devil can because of the root of bitterness someone that his heart or someone who is disappointed in someone or someone who is heartbroken by someone that person is usually very sensitive and you need to be to go slow on them you know you may think that you are dealing with something you know you are helping them but in the process you are destroying yourself and destroy them more simply because they have bitterness they have been heartbroken I'll give you you know this example and this I don't it's my first time going to say this when when we came from Miana for instance in my heart and that of my wife we had some uh bitterness because there were things that happened and there were things that were said things which were not true things which were not right and we felt we very disappointed people with loved people we trusted people we we we we we were together with for years and years and someone comes up and says something against you that it rips your heart and you feel you you are so bitter in your heart about them and you know the Lord you know spoke to to us that we had to move that was not the only reason but there were other reasons there were some people believing in this area and we had baptized about 10 people and God now laid it on my heart to come and help and so but there was also the other part which I have never spoken of publicly until today and the only reason I'm speaking about it because I want to help some people I'm convinced there are people who need help it may be here or online or whatever because you are people and I'm a person I know that whatever I suffer you can suffer and our Prophet told us to teach experience so I usually want to preach what I've experienced I usually want to preach what I know about and so we were bitter in our heart and um so when we came um yes I wanted to start the fellowship but I was still bitter and I knew if I start a fellowship and I start preaching I am not going to preach about anything else but it's going to be out of the bitterness of my heart and some people have suffered in some churches with having preachers that are heartbroken having preachers that are bitter in their hearts whereby you know he will come and and and and he will Hammer you Hammer you Hammer you or Hammer a situation that you know if you have H him or something and then he and you know preachers we are very good we can be able to have scriptures for everything if you do something to me I can take scriptures and preach against you I tell you preachers are very good at that and maybe some of you have sat under such ministri whereby maybe the minister was hammering you for something that maybe you did or they did to you whatever it is and it is a it's the most uncomfortable State you want to be in it is the most uncomfortable State the church wants to be in whereby people's hearts will be raped where people go to church to hear from God but they end up being ripped apart and I felt I said God I not I don't want to be a part of that because I said to myself early on that I will never preach situation that I will always preach inspiration because there are many situations that can come up you know a minister had a fight with his wife and that day you will know because he will come on the pulit when he's very angry when he's rubbishing everything when he's taking everybody to hell you know today past I think he fought with his wife how many have experienced that before some of you have experienced that before you know there is a problem somewhere the pastor is not is not is not there and that is the greatest the greatest mistake any God called Minister will ever do so long to preach situations instead of preaching inspiration I believe every Minister every Pastor every preacher must himself to the holy ghost that he will listen from God have the food for that moment for the people no matter what is happening in his life or in the life of the people he will preach an inspiration not a situation and I'm preaching about love and a brother and a sister comes in the church wearing a trouser and then myON will change let us go to not Pastor you're preaching are you inspired really you are not inspired I believe I don't care how many women come wearing trousers if God did not inspire me to preach about that day I will not talk about it you come wearing makeup I will see you and I say what is happening to sister but if God has not inspired me to talk about it I cannot talk about it because it is not an inspiration I believe we should preach Inspirations we should never preach situations praise the name of the Lord and so we were very heartbroken so we spent we spent a few months in the house and during that time we were praying praying and praying we did much of prayer asking God to just give us Grace and understanding and mercy in our hearts and forgiveness and all of the sudden one day we were praying were in prayer and my wife was there and a few May two or three others children and there was a great outp of the holy spirit let me tell you the holy spirit is real God is real if you have never had that portion in your life listen to what I'm telling you because I received that portion and I've received it over and over praise God and it was like a I don't know how to explain it like a cool breeze and like something so strong it just came and it was again like fire cool but like fire I don't know how to explain it just came upon me and I began crying and crying and crying and crying and crying and that that moment while that experience was going on the Holy Spirit was ministering to me the Holy Spirit was massaging my heart and telling me things I have not heard before about the other people that had and and he began to convict me of sin of how wrong I was he showed me many wrongs about myself that I never knew that I had he began showing me everything about the enemies that I thought I had and he began showing me how much I needed them he demonstrated to me how bad I was and how I needed to put myself right here is something that is funny he never did show me anything bad about my en he only showed me good about them and bad about you I can't believe it almost you may not you may not believe me but I'm my wife was there we both had that experience and afterwards we collected ourselves and began to speak to one another and then I told her what I was experiencing and she told me to and then we agreed we had to call them up meet them up and repent not them to repent but for us to repent put ourselves right and the moment that happened it was like oh like a burden was LIF the Holy Spirit came and lifted up let me tell you friends we talk about Christianity but it was at that moment that I knew what Christianity is and it was on that basis that we started the fellowship and that's why you've never heard me slander anyone because this ministry is not built on that basis it is built on the basis of Healing Hearts delivering the bound setting the captives free this reminds me another experience I'll give you one time I went preaching and this man came up he teared me apart afterwards you know I was preaching about Easter and how Jesus you know rose again from the dead and then I spoke about his baptism and how the Dove came upon him because he was a lamb he was the Lamb of of God that takes away the sins of the world and so and then I I spoke to the people I said do you want the the dove to come upon you the Holy Spirit to come upon you everybody said yes amen I said well you have to be a lamb you have to let God the spirit of the pig you always go in Mad of sin you have to let it go you have to let the spirit of the god you so you can have the spirit of the lamb and then the D will come upon and this brother came after service he spoke to me said brother thank you for the service said but I have one thing against you he said How Could You Preach against me I said how did I preach about against you he said you called me a pig how could you call me a I said but brother never did I mention your name said no but everybody could see you were talking against it is me you called a pig I said brother if you felt you were a pig all that you felt that the things I was talking about was referring to you then just repent and be a lamb because God doesn't want you to you were abusing me that's not preaching brother you you don't even know how to preach you cannot talk like that and spoke things he ripped me apart if you know when you're coming on the pool to minister you wait upon God you pray you study and so when you have a case like that you feel like God I no longer want to do ministry I was ripped apart and for years I CED that I C that against that brother I'm I'm doing some confessions this morning while I'm confessing I know God is designing some of your and so sister peace I found myself in a city called shenzen in China and while there there's a a family you know they speak Chinese Believers and they do not know any English but they invited me over to their house you know just you know a black minister coming from Africa so you can have some time and fellowship and I can go eat some food so we went there and we had some good time now here are things that I really will never forget this this couple the sister you know she picked me up from the train station you know her husband received me and and they were so happy and the whole time we couldn't communicate we were communicating in sign language but you know the whole time they were smiling and that touched me and when we reached the house they had a picture of the of brother bham there with a pit of fire on his head and so she was you know here's what she they did the brother I was seated with a brother not like after the meal we were seated not like this the moment when you now so we just looking at each other but the whole time the brother [Laughter] was yeah and then we H each other and now he he looked up the picture meaning you see that picture he was a messenger of God do you love him do you believe you yes heed me he was happy he was so happy he couldn't speak my language I couldn't speak his language but we understood each other so easily and so well and the love that he had in his heart for me it was just beyond what I could explain it was beyond until later on he gave me an app um I don't even remember the name of the app whereby you send a message in Chinese and it translates into English and back and forth and so that's how we started talking so we begin texting and then when we need to laugh we need to look at each other we begin laughing it was a very wonderful experience and then as I was leaving his house I was just thinking about those things so I went in my apartment and now that Sunday morning I was I was supposed to minister and so as I was going into my apartment it was just like a few blocks away I was thinking about the love of God I'm thinking about this man CH Chinese people I I would never met them my first time to meet them but they loved me with genuine not because I could give them anything because they were giving me something but simply because of Jesus Christ and it was there that the Holy Spirit just visited and said what about you you you have bitterness in your heart I said no I don't you said you do you remember that man who came up after you preached and spoke to you that way you've carried this bitterness in your heart for against him for all these years he said you cannot be a Christian anding this you have to forgive as he was designed the Holy Spirit can design as he was designing my heart I felt condemned I felt condemned I felt condemn until there was that moment that climax where it was I don't know how to explain those experiences it's very difficult to explain but it was like something like did like and in my heart I felt forgiveness and it was at that moment God gave me a lot of Joy I felt joy and speak and full of glory and I and he gave me a song and I started singing I didn't even know the song it just came all all of the sudden and I went and wrote it down when I needed to forgive those who hurt me I couldn't do it even to those that haunt me but when is great found me so wretched poor and blind I couldn't help it but to say I forgive and I started singing I'm free and I had a jubile in that room the Chinese that saw me rushing up when I'm happy and jumping up they didn't understand what was going on but the Holy Spirit was doing a work and and they called up that brother and I was so Joly brother you remember the other day it is some years ago I I had bitterness against you but I'm sorry was wrong I shouldn't have done that and brother I wanted you to know I forgive you and I forgive you and I love you with all and I felt a lot of freedom maybe there is someone here today cutting some bitterness for someone that hurt you for someone that haunted you but you need to forgive and today I had to take those minutes or so to speak to you about my own testimony now shall we go to the word rule thou in the midst of thine enemies now I'd like us to go to the Book of Daniel chapter 2 we are reading verse 34 thou so till that a stone was cut out without hands which SM the image upon his feet and were of iron and clay and break them to Pieces 35 then was the the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken into pieces together and became like the Shar of the summer threshing flaws and a wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smart this image became a great mountain and fill the whole Earth for and now we are going to also read verses um 44 and in the and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to the other but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and shall stand forever praise the name of the Lord if you have enemies you are blessed because God cannot bless you without your enemies we are going to come to that short but before we talk about you I want to talk about the kingdom of Christ Christ has a kingdom and here Daniel now was uh you know began to see and talk about this stor of course he was giving the interpretation to the vision of the king the dream and um maybe if you can give me that picture there and he said he saw a stone that was cut out without hands now and and this Stone came and SM this image first of all you understand this is the image he saw and and the the image had the head of gold the breast of silver the thigh of brass the leg of iron and um and then and then down below was Clay now we notice that he would go ahead to um even the message of Our [Music] Generation give further interpretation to this and even Daniel himself had given interpretation and we know that this image was representing the the kingdoms of the world or maybe you want to call it the Gentile Kingdom you see that would rule over Israel and rule over in the world for a space of of many years but when these kingdoms come to an end the kingdom of God now physically no longer spiritually but the kingdom of God would physically come to the Earth at that time it was King NE Nebuchadnezzar and King Nebuchadnezzar you know the the prophet told him oh th King you are the head of God and that's why King Nebuchadnezzar now put up this image he said wow I am the head of God and and he said he put up the image and he said now I'm going to call all the people in My Kingdom including you Daniel and and all these you know we know them we call them you know uh s he see you all should come all the people in my land all the princess whoever you are when you hear the sound of the drums when you hear the sound of the symbols and you know every one of you bow down to this image because God has spoken to me that I am the head of God I want you to worship but there were people who knew they God and and sad they said we will not bow Daniel did not bow you know the story how it goes he was even taken to they were taken to the fire and he was taken to the of lions but God stood with him because yes he might have been the head of God but he was still the kingdom of the world and let me tell you one of these days the kingdoms of the world are going to be fully consumed and the kingdom of God will take over this Earth so you see then after the Babylonian Empire then came the median Empire which was the breast of silver and started with the kingdom of King Darius and then after that came the kingdom of the Grecian Empire which was the thigh of brass many of you in school have studed about uh Emperor um rather Alexander the Great and how he was very young but how he conquered almost the whole earth at young age but but you see he had anointing God had permitted him to that's why listen friends I want to tell you there is no one that can reach to Greatness except God has brought you that's why me I Marvel at people who think they can be so great in this life putting God and the word aside they don't even come to church on Sunday because they making money they want to be great they want to be something they want to be so rich you cannot be anything but what God has allowed you to be that's why you must give God time serve God first him up beyond anything beyond money Beyond power beyond culture because he is above all and he is the one who brought down Kings and lifted other kings my I wish we had time to go through this but when the time of lifting a kingdom came another kingdom no matter how great it was it had to be brought down you remember how Alexander the Great as The Story Goes how he told he told the people how he desired to be buried because he wanted to show I came to the world with nothing and I got to the world with nothing out of the world with nothing so friend what do you think you are going to seek or achieve from the world you cannot eat the whole world and finish it worship God more than anything worship God more than money God more than women more than men more than your job more than anything because God is above all some people think that we are here because we are fools but they are fools not to understand that we are here to worship The God Who is above all The God Who can lift and The God Who can cast down the God who can bless and The God Who can cast you go and read in the book of um I think theonomy chapter 28 you will realize it is God who blesses and it is God who cures praise the name of the Lord and then he speaks of after that the Roman Empire which was the leg of iron and this continued on for many years and by the way every one of these kingdoms almost ruled the whole world all right and now we see down here the last Kingdom to come the last Kingdom to rule the world in this image that nebz saw will be uh the the leg and the leg of iron but the feet which is the very last portion the very last part brother Dixon are you hearing what I'm saying the feet will be the feet of clay and the leg will be that of iron so meaning romanism continues until the end but right at the end there will be some other Kingdom which will not be entirely different but it will work with romanism because there will be iron and Clan they cannot mix but they're together what is what what is that Kingdom this is going to be Catholicism and protestan now I told you I I I I I I told you I'm not teaching but at least listen to this part understand romanism people are saying oh Russia oh this one we have had a prophet in our generation and he has told us it is romanism going to take over the world it's not Nazism it's not communism is romanism and they're going to rule the world in the end time it will be the last last Kingdom but at the end of it it will have some clay that is the other because we know that the Roman Empire the Bible speaks of it in the book of reation how it was a beast and then it was wounded but he did not die what is it it is the Roman Empire which at one time was ruling the whole world but it was ruling the world as a political power listen the political power of Rome ceas to be it fin the died but that Beast never died he came back again now in the form of religious Rome so we still have romanism it is now religious but later on in the very end we would see another part of it play which is the protestantism those who protested the Roman Catholic movement they had their many groups but listen to me church this is prophetic God is groups would B themselves up together all these Protestant movements right from the Anglican to the you know nazarin name them what even P they would all before it even happened William Bram prophesied that there will be a one world order and the power that will be at that time it will unite all the churches together into what we call the worldwide counc of churches are you hearing me the world counil of churches what why do they unite they are saying they uniting for peace for love and for Unity but they don't know they are here to fulfill prophecy because they are the gra and how will people get the mark of the by joining those religious movements by the right hand of Fellowship the Bible say they got it by the right hand on the forehead they don't they don't play Mother of God for us but they agree with the one who does and by so doing the members under that those kind of movements all of them that join the council churches they end up receiving the mark of the you better hear me while you can because time is coming when you won't be able to hear they will receive the mark of the be by joining those false Church systems but then we see that you know the Catholic denomination is not a member of the Council of churches did you know but yet the chairman of the council reports to the pope every once a year what is that romanism and protestantism iron and Clay they can't mix the Protestants can't become Catholics but they're going to work together and they will be the last World power this is prophetic it's prophetic but for us we just want to come to church receive miracle and you don't know where you are standing in the word you don't know where you are standing in the Prophet this is written in the Bible I wish we could have a lot of time to go deeper into those things probably in the other services we will and show you more scriptures and quotes on so Papa Rome would be the together with protestantism would be the last power to rule the world you talk about one world order one world religion who what is it going to be it's going to be Rome it's going to to rule over this world but listen to me Church by that time when they put them into full force of course we know the Council of churches already they already here by the time brother bam spoke about it the people of that time said no it's not going to happen and the people who said it's not going to happen they the very ones who joined it they're all a part of it I wanted to give you more details but it take more time they're all a part of it and and and this move the purpose is to rule the whole world will but by the time they exercise their power the bride will be out of here they are the ones going to persecute the foolish virgins why do why do you think that they're trying to unite the churches why is it necessary recently here even here they were saying oh give us power you know to unite and and let us pass this bill and then what is their motive every church one of the things they had on their list number one we should not accept any church to operate if their church does not have at least one acre of land they know they are the ones with the money number one number two we don't want to accept any preacher to preach unless he has he has gone to a Theological Seminary who has a theolog seminaries the tarians and they tell you you have to join oural seminar we approve you as a preacher and then we sanction we send you so in other words if anyone is not from us they would say is not is not a true preacher he should be closed down and they will begin the persecution you think God will allow it to happen before the bride goes the bride is not going through the tribulation the bride is going out of here that's why we are preaching this message because this message is preparing us for the Rapture it is preparing us to God to get to God of here and we see these kingdoms will rule over the world they are human kingdoms they are human powers they gentle kingdoms they rule over the world but listen to me now he said there was a stone that was cut without hands and it came down amen it came dangling down and it smart this image and it smart this image upon his feet where of clay and iron and clay and break them to Pieces it came and HD it right at the end here hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord well brother Dixon you have to stand up praise God some of you people who are doing you you're taking but deacons give me people who are not doing right here cuz I I don't want my anointing to be squeezed by I'm sorry I had to do that because the young man is really disturbing all right I'd like you to look at verse 35 then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broken to pieces together they became like the cha of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the small that which shall not be destroyed 7:14 Daniel 74 by the way do you know the interesting part is do you know when that kingdom is going to be set [Music] up in verse 44 he says and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed praise the name of the Lord by the way that kingdom is already being set up today the days of these Kings the kingdom of God is being set up but that kingdom is eternal that Kingdom shall never be destroyed that Kingdom you want to be a part of it you know he says how shall we inherit the Kingdom you know in in the Book of John 3 he says You must be born again born of the water and born of the spirit but many people don't want to be a part of the so in other words here he says that um and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom so now Dominion is a rule so here is the rule of Christ and he says the rule of Christ is an everlasting rule his kingdom shall never be destroyed but you see the one that is talking about he came here on Earth in the form of Jesus but you know when he was here was he surrounded by friends he was surrounded by enemies people that claim to love him but these are people who hated him these are people who are planning everything to try and bring him down I wanted to look at Matthew 28 for example before he could rain here is what happened to him then sayith he unto them my soul is exceeding exceeding sorrowful even unto death tell ye here and watch with me and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me the L not as I will but as thou [Music] wit and he cometh unto the disciples and find them asleep and said unto Peter what could ye not watch with me one hour listen to me Church praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord well I want you to follow me now because what whatever God gave me on my heart I believe is for you this morning you know we talking about the king before he could Reign Jesus before he could reain he had friends but his friends abandoned him you know the Bible says here he was exceedingly sorrowful when you are sorrowful that's when you need friends when you are s for that's when you need someone to encourage you so Jesus was in sorrow the Bible says he went somewhere together with the disciples and he went a little further and he fell on his face and he began praying he says father if it be possible and remember these are the times I don't know how many of you have ever been in need when you really feel you are in need when you feel you need support when you feel you need help you need encouragement Jesus was also in that moment but how was his moment he picked a few not everybody only a few he could really trust and call his friends he let us go together you comfort me as we pray but as he fell on his face and began praying these ones began snoring are those really friends they abandoned him he needed them but they abandoned him I don't know here how many have ever been abandoned by friends when they abandon you what do you do you begin cursing you begin making declarations this person I will never but is that the attitude of Christ he realized he needed them even when they [Music] abandoned this Jesus was betrayed by his disciples he was betrayed by his friends where he yet spake Behold a multitude and he that was called Judas one of the 12 went before them and Drew near unto Jesus to kiss him but Jesus said unto him Judas bet thou the son of man with a kiss I want you to follow me Church see Jesus here with somebody that you could call a friend a brother but let me ask you a question do you think Jesus did not actually know what Judas was doing but he went behind him and he connived and how many times we see that in our generation someone you call a friend you are standing right here but they come right behind you and they begin conniving you think they are your friends do you know can you imagine this man you know what he did is a very bad man he's actually you just pay me I'll deliver him to you and then they pay him says you don't want and then he comes when he's coming he's not coming to you as an enemy many of your enemies are your friends that's why the devil is fighting this someone because I'm going to preach it sister fortunate until the end because this is one of the truth in the scripture that if you know you some of you have stress it will go and then he comes my friend you know I love you but he said wait a moment this is how you are betraying the son of man with a what did Judas say does any of us know what Judas said he did not repent he did not say no I'm not betraying he kept quiet none of the people there knew what Jesus said to him he walked silently but he knew what he had done he betrayed him your friends can be your enemies that you don't know but do you know that actually Jesus did not want Judas but he needed him you need your enemies if you don't have an enemy you can't Prosper if you don't have enemies you can't go from point A to point B let me explain Jesus came in the world with one one goal with One Vision with one mission is to die for The Sinner he came to die for us he came to die in our state but how could he die without Judas he needed Judas but Judas was an enemy in a friend's skin you need your enemies for God to lift you to another level you need your enemies for God to take you Amen to fulfill your life's purpose you need your enemies I want you to think as we continue imagine a world where you are alone sister and you have everything you need you don't have anyone to be with you you don't have anyone to talk bad about you you don't have anyone to say any bad word you don't have anyone to say he will never prosper have anyone to say you will always remain in the same level imagine that it will be a boring world you have everything you need you have an airport with your private J you don't have a pilot you are your own pilot you don't have anyone to visit you are just roaming around the world alone you have cars you have houses you have no family you have no enemies only are by yourself you say take thees give me a word with people but I don't want a world with everything with no people but you can never be in a world with people without enemies never God will ensure you have enemies because he wants to bless you in the presence of your enemies your enemies are very very important hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord all right let us continue here here Jesus was abused by people who are supposed to follow his ministry in John 8:51 say very I unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death then said the Jews unto him we know you have a devil Abraham is dead the prophets and and and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never tou Jesus said unto them ver I say unto you before Abraham was a young then took they up stones to cast at him but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and passed by praise the name of the Lord these are people who were Jews who are supposed to believe him who are supposed to follow him but they the very ones abusing him that's why when you hear a preacher saying me I'm no longer preaching because I've been abused they've not confirmed their calling you have to have them they must abuse you they are very important your abusers are very important I don't know how many here have been abused your abusers have a part to play they on a mission in your life you may know it you may not know it but let me tell you you're moving ahead because of your abusers if they had not abused Jesus he would have remained in the same place but whether they abuse him or not he is still the king whose kingdom will be Everlasting whether they abuse him or not his kingdom was the storm that and struck the image and it grow bigger and bigger and cover the whole earth the kingdom of Jesus will cover the whole in the Millennium he is going to rule the whole world but here they saying you have a devil he didn't go to prove himself when someone abuses you and and and kicks you don't begin folding your shirt that is what you a Believer is easily provoked don't be provoked brother don't be provoked sister you should know who you are your enemies are important in your life let them not bring you to their level let them do their job while you are also doing your job while they were abusing Jesus he was very busy progressing he simply told them who he was he said before Abraham was I am they they said now we shall Stone you he he did not tell them you don't know I am let me show you he didn't do that but what did he do he knew he needed them just himself and just over and then he came back and with his powers he passed through them un recognized he didn't kill them but how many of you feel like you should kill your enemies and you find someone with a lot of H and bitterness some of them they can't even breathe properly if I see them show them anger bitterness you don't know who you are but if you know who you are you you will take it easy you know those people need to do what they are doing while I am doing what I am doing people will even doubt who you are they will doubt what you're calling we find it also in the ministry of Jesus one of the phes desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and he sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a Sina when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the phes house WR an alabaster box of and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet Fe with tears and did wiped them with hairs over head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now the phes which had be him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner but friends I want you to think about this for amen this is a man who called Jesus who received Jesus in his house but Jesus is there but this man is doubting the ministry and the calling of Jes oh God help preachers I don't know what is it with preachers today I feel like I'm talking about preachers today so much so much about preachers you find when when you know that someone doesn't believe in your ministry immediately you want to to to kill them you want to chase them you want to do something to them but let me tell you friend Jesus was our example he was in a church and I love Pastor I was here in the interview he spoke something about this and and now I am even getting inspired out of that as well he say that when sometimes you can be preaching and you have people in the church who don't actually even like you and you know it but you have to love them praise the name of the Lord well I'm not saying you I know you all love me and you love all the preachers here but here we are seeing the example of Jesus this is a man who called him this is a man who said he believed in him but when he came and he began his ministry he was touting who he was what are you going to do with someone you know doesn't like you many of you are employed and you're working somewhere and you have someone you know they hate you they don't like you the someone today is going down to your address you know someone doesn't like you what are you going to do are you going to hit them back are you going to help them to hit you what are you going to do you know they don't like you they even spoke against you you have the proof some of you even keep that proof you have the recording maybe some of you you even have those recordings let me keep it this is proof that he said this against at the right time I'll release it you are helping the your enemy to do his job let your enemy do his job your enemy is important in your life let them do their job while they hating you love them back the Bible says we should not be like the Pharisees who love their enemy who love their those who love them and hate those who hate them but we should love those who hate us we should not hate anybody we should let God hit our enemies on our behalf we should rule we should be Masters we should be Overcomers in the middle of our enemies the whole time Jesus was surrounded by his enemies people who seem to be more interested to finding fault in everything he [Music] did everything he saying but Jesus never once deviated away from his calling he never tried to help them do their job he kep focus on the reason why he came on Earth how many have found purpose in their life when you find purpose in your life you don't care what they say about you you don't care what they do to you you have a lot of work to do focus on why God told you focus on why you are here and your enemies love them because they are helping you to grow you just don't know it yet but they helping you to grow praise the name of the Lord when Jesus had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the goost he said is finished my enemies have done their job it is now mine now to do mine he went on the cross and at the end of it all he said it is finished Paul also was here on Earth and he said I fought my rest I finished my my rest and he say it is finished we should also be able to say it is finished nothing said to him changed him he was always pushing for his Divine Purpose nothing said to him or against him changed but the problem that we have many of us are changed by what is said about us we become good when someone tells you good things you become bad when someone tells you bad things but I'm here to tell you you should rule in the middle of your enemies your enemies are very very important and and the prophet says and you know most of all pictures all famous pictures before they are hung in a Hall of Fame they have to go through the Hall of critics first and then have to pass the critics and when it passes the critics then it can be hung in a hall of fa praise God when I I declare that I wanted to get married one of my friends at that time I don't know what was over him maybe an evil spirit I don't know maybe a good spirit I don't know but he came up and said you want to get married I give I give you two years two years you get married two years I passed the two years but the whole time I was not breathing I was wondering why did he say that after two years I wrote I made sure I find him I told him the two years have finished I'm beginning the third one he said the third one won't finish the third one finished and I'm still here I'll just C my 11 some of you your enemies have said you will never get married yes but I'm here to tell you let your enemies do their job if they don't say that how can God lift you how can you know it is G but when you know your enemies have said words then Rejoice because God is getting ready to prove himself and make you a ruler in the mid of your enemies someone says you will be poor forever the I see you you will never get that is your enemy you rejoice you rejoice you rejoice you rejoice because your enemy is there to fulfill a purpose they were there always you know disturbing Jesus speaking words saying things but Jesus knew one thing I am in a hole and I'm in a hall of critics amen I'm right here in this Hall but I'm not going to stay here forever brother listen when you are in a hall of critics it is because you are going somewhere when you're in the of critics it means you are being molded God is using the criti to mold your character God is molding you you are going somewhere amen they speaking all these things all these things because you're being criticized you are in that Hall but soon and very soon then God will lift you from that to another ho and that is called the Hall of now many people today I'm speaking practical things many people they like people who have prospered when they see someone even look at this younger sisters who are planning to get married if you ask them what kind of money would you want to Mar me I want someone who is highly educated someone who has a c someone who has a good job and also wants good money and someone who will give me everything I need that's what is in the head because you want someone who has progressed from the h of the critics to the of and you are very busy looking at brother Rand because he driving a very you don't know what he went through to buy that car to get that job to get where he is by the way we are having a a generation you don't want to work you want to get things which are finished you even see the even churches you find someone who is coming from the village looking for a church to Fellowship they will never find which which church preaches the truth which church is very balanced what will you look which church has a is very big people very big Ministry and which is hard of everywhere so that when I say I'm I'm going to div everybody say it's generation we Liv it's the generation they are not willing to build from SC I've seen them they don't want to build from but we should be having a backbone we should be ready to build from nothing from nothing from the ground to the sky Hallelujah the way you build a church ministry is the way you build a marriage from nothing to something there will come a time when people will be saying we want to be like them but right now you are in a hall of critics sister phib everything you do whether you know you don't know let me tell you people are talking they are talking and see she give birth that one they talk but when you hear those things you just thank God I know I am going somewhere I am going somewhere amen time will come when you pass at home you have five children should I say 10 children amen when you have your children amen and you have accomplished many things in life and everybody will say we want to be like that family we want to be like that person but when you are building everyone criticizes that's why let me tell you people who life whether they know our God or not they the ones who keep their head on their God they don't care what the critics say they still Focus some of you when you hear someone saying something you begin shaking maybe something bad is going and some people they just very presumptuous they believe things that you get confused in Africa something small happen because you fear your enemies don't fear your enemies love your enemies your enemies are fulfilling a work in your life they very very important you need them to grow Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah I give birth she was girl [Applause] before back will that one ever give bir to a son third one now they put another gear who told you Hallelujah am told [Music] you there amen when speaking I just looked on because I knew God alone has my life amen don't lose people who talk about you you need to have auth you need to have authority says he created us to be rulers to rule in every situation way things will be better then you will God but then you will walk like a you walk like a things arek God she get married you as if you have my will never even when you look in the mirror I'm you will be like they even when you reach remain looking Promises of the word don't follow what people say are fulfilling they fulfilling their Duty given to them by God even you have a duty your duty is to believe is to tr D you stand on the the rock of the word whether they or they don't is no matter even if you know some of them when they know they lose hope they look they the who who what is the matter with you if you know it that he has become more than the rest amen praise the name of the Lord this one is very practical today I am being a pastor I'm preaching something very practical in our lives Man was created to have dominion and the prophet says and of course when we talk about you know these things it's going to be in every part of our life as an individual family ministry business every area of our life if you can apply it you will see what I'm talking about people have a lot of heartbreaks and because of that they have a lot of enemies and because of that they spend a lot of time on speaking nonsense things which will never add a niche on them things which they don't even have to spend a minute all and they waste a lot of instead of progressing they become stagnated you see God wants to mold a character out but that character is going to come by the things you suffer you see he says um if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I Rec that the sufferings of this present time and not wor to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him unless we suffer with him we cannot re with him you have to suffer to rain everyone that has achieved something they have a story behind it but for us we want to achieve things without stories behind everyone has a story We hosted brother on the interview and he spoke very wonderful things but many of us we don't want to hear those things we are so excited with the with the current success now he a billionaire he's a billionaire and what comes in your head first I want to meet him so I ask him for [Music] some actually I I took about two three hours talking with him and after that I had many friends call me I think you are now lo I gave him he never gave me and I mean that and he didn't ask me and I didn't ask him it's me who wanted to give I give and he didn't give he knew he want to buy Church land I mean you host a message believer who is a billionaire in do normally you would say you Sur have to ask him to help that is because you see yourself as poor and you are seeing his success but you do not know the story he gave a story here and I tell it he said there was a young man who um you know was from a rich family and his father told him for me to give give you your portion I want you to go I don't remember the am $10,000 of your own so he went out and and brought the $10,000 and his father threw him threw to the fire and it burned and he said Daddy Why said go back bring another 10,000 so he went out and he brought another 10,000 and they threw it to the fire and it burned he said father why said go back bring another $10,000 so this time he said the first time my mother gave me the money time again she gave me should I ask another friend is my mother's money the problem or said okay I have an idea let me go and work and and make this money blessed and she he went and did every job you and made and made money up to $10,000 he brought it to his and his father picked the money did the same thing threw it in the and as the man was going in the fire this boy did not mind about the fire he ran after the money to the fire he picked it said how can you do that my life's earnings for this money this you will not throw to the fire no this boy also had a story his success he was not going to see the criticism of his father he was not going to accept it because he was seeing the go he had a story behind his success the first money and the second money he didn't run after it because he didn't labor for it but this one he had sweated he had labed he was not going to let anyone bring it down like that he ran after it and I thought that story was very good many of you not stable Christians because you have no story you don't have no walk with the Lord You Have Not suffered for Jesus you have not made decisions that you can be proud of but some of us we have had backs because we have made decisions that we we are able Amen to peray for yes you must make sacrifices in your life literally my own mother said I'm going to disown you if you believeing that thing I said you can go ahead going to stand with this message now you tell me my mother will like this and I and because of my stand she also believe you make a stand make a stand in your home make a stand in your don't worry about the critics let them do their job you have to be ready to suffer to be able to reain you cannot reign with Christ if you have not gone through the process in your job you have to go through the process but for us we don't you want to pay a lot of money and they give you a big promotion you compromise here and then you go here you find some I've met some young people they will tell you I want to be very rich you say oh you want to be very they say yes you give them some little work they can't do it well and they will tell you it is because this work will not make me Rich they want they want a job which will give them $ million some of you are la not all I'm saying people you don't want to work you must you are going to football here running here running a Believer what are you doing with your life you waiting for your father to give you or your mother you must be willing to suffer for what you want to become you must be willing what if your father says I'm not you you are not my son what do you do you have to be ready to go through life you have to have the nerves to go through life you have to be ready to work and you find a man with no job I hope you not in this church and you can't you are saying you can't do that job who will do it you can't do that job but you're begging for a living you can do any work as long as it is work Jesus told us to work we believe in work you go and work so you can get money to pay for the land yes so you can get money to get married you want to get married but you have nothing you don't have any skill refuse to go to school when you go you fail all the papers you're not willing to put your eort and when a brother comes he says okay what's your name okay which school oh this school how did you perform we did not and you see a brother taking off you start coming brother brother say the brother because he there is no value in you if you are in school don't at school whatever yours to with all your mind hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord this is what we believe you have to rule in the midle of challenges you have to be above your challenges you have to be above your haters you to be above your criticizers praise the name of the Lord I'll give you an example here as I'm approaching to finish I would have finished long ago but Power let us first read Revelation he says to him that overcometh I will grant to seat with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my with my fathers in his throne so this Christianity this journey is not going to be a walk Bed of Roses be ready to invest in fighting if others fought to win the pr you have to go through the same way Matthew 25:20 and so he that had received talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou desire deliver unto me five talents behold I have gained beside them five talents his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of Lord how many have the grace of multiplication if you don't make God give you the grace of multiplication amen whatever they give you you multiply you multiply tell your neighbor amen receive the grace of multiplication that you multiply multiply your joy but don't multiply hatred when someone gives you hatred multiply with love hallelujah hallelujah let me show you a case here that will be an example to us about how we should treat our enemies we should be rulers in the middle of in 2 Samuel 16 vers 16 chter 16: 5 and when David came to bahon bahim behold then came out a man of the family of the House of Saul whose name was shim the son of gah he came forth and cast steel as he came you can read with me because it is a little longer reading hallelujah hallelujah I don't want to be a a shim a shim shim this man was called shim yeah I don't want to be a shim but I want to be a David she came cursing this is a man of God at this time by the way he's almost overthrown by his [Music] son bad things happen even to good people even to real Believers and you can have questions that don't even have answers that if it's a child of God if I'm a Child of God why did God allow this to happen David knew better never to ask such a question he began running he went into the mountains and he was with some of his generals and um when he reached there you know a man out from the family of sa his name was shim he came running after him curing him speaking casing words this is a man of God he's anointed by God he has the grace of God upon him he had a heart like that of God himself but this man comes if it was you let us be sincere how would you handle it think about it brother Alan how would you have handled that situation you are who you are but someone runs after you curing curing you speaking words that are not favorable for years many of us when something like that happens even if I'm a Believer it doesn't mean I'm stupid you stand on my feet I show you fire Brethren if you are still like that you need another touch you need another touch you need to be like David this man came curing him cing him cing him and we see that he you know and did not stop there he started throwing stones at David and at also the Servants of King David and all the people and all the Mighty Men Who were on his right and his left let me tell your enemies don't care how Mighty you are they will talk against you they will they will Cur you they will beat you with stones they will try anything they can but it TT you who knows how Mighty you are to remain composed to in your place to not cast them back to not throw back Stones am I preaching to someone here today amen and David you know and thus said shim when he cast come out come out I th bloody man and man of was he well yeah he might have been a bloody man but it was a blood man fighting the words of God so some of your criticizers will speak things which are actually true but they twist it there are people who are very good gospel but you see a gossiper does not always tell lies gossip is not always lies many times it has a lot of Truth to become gossip but the one who is saying that gossip he has a bad motive he has a bad intention and he takes that truth and it twists it by the time it comes to people's ears it sounds different it is true David was a bloody man and because of that reason God told him you will not build my temple but how was he bloody he was Bloody fighting the words of God he fought Goliath and killed him he fought the Philistines and killed so he was a bloody man but not in a wrong way he was obeying the command commments of God yes he had also committed some sin by killing it was not right and took and sto and that is the only sin of murder that God judged him and you find David praying and he's saying deliver me from my blood guiltiness so you as a Son of God it doesn't mean you are going to be perfect but when your criticizers come they will take your imperfections and make a giant of a very big rock and Mountain out of but what are you going to do some of it is truth some of it is Li but the whole idea is a li this criticism against you they are your enemies how are you going to handle them the mistake we do is to begin defending ourselves and to begin fighting to begin and in the process you also sin against but David this man was saying to you you are bloody you are bloody come out come out you are a man of B was he a man of B answer me church was he is the devil was insinuating that David was a man of of the devil I ask you church was he he was not it was a lie against David now I'm imagining if I was David what I have done at that time must have been boiling down some of you have reached those moments when people speak lies against and you're feeling your Bo you want to defend yourself one time sister peace someone said things against and wrote a very big letter and sent it to me as I was reading I was boiling write them back tell them they are lies tell them those things are lies the thing was telling me that fire in me write them back prove to them they lying against you have you ever experienced that do I have someone who has ever experienced I have friends I don't know how you handled yours but I'll tell you how I handled mine it was boiling down when you know someone is literally lying it's not the truth I took that letter the Temptation was so big should I write them back should I send them a voice note should I call them should I what should I do how should I answer so it came from how should I answer to not answer at all but the thing of of of answer answer defend yourself was so big and that's the nature of man but I took it before God threw it before him and prayed prayed prayed prayed cried and cried and by the time I went out from the that time I was in Ethiopia from the time I went out from the my problem was over my problem was over I didn't respond that was Victory I look back now and say what was I what was I bothered about if you don't respond God will fight your battle God will fight your battle but where you want to respond this is my enemy let me show him God will not be in your praise the name of the Lord I want to finish but before I finish allow me to to climax it properly here the story of shim I know today have gone way on the time because of the disturbances we had in the morning all right do I still have people who are following can you say Amen if you follow okay that's good now listen here uh the Lord has returned upon thee all the blood of the House of Saul in whose State thou Hast reigned and the Lord has delivered the kingdom into th hand into the hand of ABS your son and behold thou are taken in Mischief because you are a bloody man friends when you hear these things they sound to be true but it was not true sister because he was saying the kingdom is taken from you your son is ring in your St the man who is speaking is not speaking on behalf of God let me tell you your enemy is not speaking on behalf of God no amen that is a prophecy for someone here today your enemy is not speaking on behalf of [Applause] God I fa to say it again your enemy is not speaking on behalf of God he is insinuating words out of the bitterness of his heart this man was from the family of sa but the way he washes you would say it was Lord has taken your kingdom it is true he was in a far Country and the kingdom has given it to your son it was right ABS was the king now because the blood he poured in Soul's house all the things were true but it was not correct prophecy because ABS had no God his hand on him the took the throne he just stole it you remember the way on the main gate and wait for the people who are coming you want to see the P if you see me it is finished even people in Ministry like that you want to see don't worry when you see meat is done hallelu people stopped going to the king and we are going to this the Bible says he stole the hearts of people God help that we should never in this house amen hallelujah amen made a to Ste he had no God's blessing but David he knew that well but he didn't know that do you know you know something your enemy doesn't know upon your life amen your enemy knows a lot about your but you know a lot about your life more than the enemy then I shy abai the son of Zai um said unto the king why should this dead dog why should he cast the Lord my king those are men like Brother Martin who was back born I didn't say that you are youing abusing they somebody the P they come out to a whole nation that was cutting like a came out and said King this dead dog now what was the attitude of the king that is how every one of us would react let me go over I pray you let me go take off his head that's how we want we want to kill our enemies I don't know how many here even while you're hearing me preach you like Pastor you're preaching like that because you have not had the enemy like I have but the one I have and what they did to me you would not say like that but let me tell you here is someone here who felt what David did not feel oh felt like how David felt but reacted like a normal man but for us we are not normal men we are not normal women we are supposed rulers rulers don't behave like little children because you have excited you're excited now you're angry now you are now feeling bad and indifferent I will no longer serve me I will Minister I will Minister even the enemy say what does I don't have enemies but I believe they are there I will no longer minister with wife I even not cook the food I will not cook the food you man because you're hry now you have become indifferent the is there take yourself take yourself then staying from church finished the wife is not coming out call all her names and finish them us you getry only the married can understand the on are not married saying what even become IND different go alone attitude is not for God his children today you are quiet because the word is hitting you and that's good pastor message today praise the name of of the Lord and the King said this is what I've been waiting for hallelujah hallelujah rulers rulers rulers rulers rule thou in the midst of your enemy now here is how rulers speak here is how the king spoke and the King said what have I to do with you son Sons of Zer and he speaking to his with to do with you so let him cast everybody say let him cast does not kill an e let [Music] me we are EOS Hallelujah you are an ego we are EOS let him cast because the Lord has said unto him cast David so who shall then say whether for thou has done so why have you done so ah if God has told them to cast me let them do their job they are my enemies let them do my job and David said unto abishai andto all his servants behold my son which came forth out of my Bo seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone let him C for the Lord has bden him it may be that the Lord will look on M Affliction and the Lord will requite me good of for his cing this understand here now God is speaking to David is speaking to and he's telling him listen you are telling me I should kill she because he's curing me but how much more they were in my own house own son AB has taken over my Throne what do you expect me for this one now let him C because God has told him to C and he added this Maybe by these cures God will requite me God oh Hallelujah for his cursing I told you I've been saying you need your enemies you need your enemies let me tell you this if you are not cast The Blessing will not come your enemies have to Cur you so that God can bless you why am I saying it that way because the blessing came before the Cur and when someone cures they only activate the [Music] blessing amen amen yes sir you remember when this Prophet went to cast Israel what what happened he blessed them you can't cast he and as David and his men went by she may went along the hill side against as him and cast as he went and they threw stones at him and cast that a king and he let that happen friends you should rule in the midle of your enemies behave like a king not like a Serv love your enemies Matthew 5:42 give to him that asks you and from him that would borrow of thee turn not th away ye have heard that it has been said thou shal love thy neighbor and Hur your enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that Cur you do good to them that hurt you pray them which despitefully use you and persecute you do we say Amen to the words of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah love your enemies tell your neighbor love your enemies love your enemies I hope after this sermon today our attitude will be changed about people generally some of you maybe you've been in church where you see someone you say God bless you God bless you because you they said ABCD about if you've been here today I want you to be set free you will got your enemy and you just say genuinely from your heart because you have now realized they a blessing to you God bless you God bless you hallelujah hallelujah

of my enemies how many have seen that hallelujah amen friends I even skipped a few things but let me tell you this one comes in a new light God prepares a table where in the middle in the middle of your enemies not away from your enemy and some of you begin praying prayers oh God Crush my enemy kill my enemy let them disappear change those prayers today let God bring your enemies because if your enemies are not there the table of Victory will not be there your table is where is with your enemies in the middle of them if you tell God to scatter them your blessings will be scattered and your table will be right there and you will take longer to attain your blessings because you have no enemies but if you have your enemies be very cautious with them because your table is right around where they Hallelujah right around where if you see someone who doesn't like you or someone who speaks bad against you or someone who resents you love that person love that person because God wants to shape your character using that very person and after he's done your table will be right there where that same same enemy who saw you doing ABCD and you overcame will be able to say he's changed and you'll be able to say the things I used to do I do them no more I'm changed I've been Reborn and you don't know the feeling of the person who said you'll never Prosper when they see you prospering some of you who have cars you always I know you always like driving around the people who said you'll never drive you to see you driving around and you even bring down your your your glass this one is laughing I think he does it and you want them to see you why because you want them to see how great your God is hallelujah the people who say you will never marry amen invite them to your wedding glory amen you invite only friends where is the F invite those ones who you thought wereing invite them to your wedding and when you are dancing and dance very well near let them see that God is preparing in the middle of your enem don't hate them love your enemies they are there to serve a purpose amen and maybe what I can advise you don't be someone who enemy because enemies are always losers you better be a friend to everyone so that they can be enemies let they be enemies but you be a friend never be found gossiping about somebody when you come at church and people who do gospel they very clever by the way they can see things even before they happen the way I see this person I think he doesn't like the other one and then he goes to the other one God bless you amen amen sister but have you ever thought about it the way I see that brother looking he doesn't seem to like you what do you think yeah by way that person even I heard words I've been telling you and then he goes back God bless you brother how are you I'm fine wanted to tell you something things but maybe let me leave it no tell me I tell you and then you begin to say that we have gossip really has come to tell you but if I tell you don't say it if you say it I will say I never said anything no problem trust me I will not say to anyone not to a all [Laughter] right so then he will start the way I see that sister she doesn't like you at all even the way even I heard her sayah blah blah blah are you sure yes people are there but people have bad but don't say I told anything and this sister go away this brother whoever brought the and now this brother who said I will never say to a soul comes to this one as soon as they tell him sister how could you say this about how who told you no but didn't you say it yes I said it not like that but who told no no problem you just know that someone told you and some would even say the Holy Spirit spoke to but you know very well it was the spirit of gossip but let me tell you brothers and sisters gossip breaks good Brotherhood go breaks the family go breaks the church even the best of friends gossip can break when someone tells you something I heard ABC me this is what I always do who told you no don't worry someone no you a gossiper if you're not telling me who told you a gossiper because you're not helping them okay okay okay so and so all right brother come come I was told that you told this brother when both of them are there before I even say what they were told their eyes already becoming because everybody knows what they said and what they added and you know the oil they put so now they will become the brother will now be shaking even sometimes I'm telling the spirit of Gossip is a very fearful Spirit when you call these people together we have literally seen them they even physic begin shaking until I tell the person relax no one is going to kill you and then you see them relaxing shaking is small small and then him you this one told me you said this did you say it many times I've watched in a distance I never you leave them to fight for a they will never agree who said what so what is it none of them said anything it was the spirit of gossip it's a very bad Spirit don't subscribe to it it breaks it will break you you will some people have even made themselves pastors others have made themselves deons others have made themselves you know some minister of some sort meaning handling matters which are never in their office and now others because they received gossip they feel they have enemies so now to I hope there is no gossiper in the church and I hope those of you have been having enemies from today you are going to love them because those enemies are very useful in your life you prepare a table for me before in the Pres before me in the presence of my enemies and that's where he anoints your oil head with o your cup run over goodness mer will follow you all the days of your life and
