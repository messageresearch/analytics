down it might work bob you're preaching next wednesday night you got that okay see what i mean who's preaching tonight i want to read you this little quote and then we're going to uh get right into the word of god the prophet of god in the world falling apart is this world not falling apart they're saying now that a dozen eggs will be 12 a dozen by august talk about inflation this is what happened in 1929 and 30 when the market crashed they were selling fl flour at the end that time for 10 and 15 dollars for a pound of flour pound of flour just a little pound of flour to make stuff with so you uh we need we need the lord not to get us out of this we need the lord to get us out of this world and man i don't want to dodge the bullets i want to be gone i want to get out of here and i think that's what we're trying to do this last push we've had almost 20 people baptized and uh i told brother boyd standing in the back i said all those that are baptized i hope they either will fill with the holy ghost can get more or they're going to be filled with the holy ghost and we'll have a good time amen because that's what we're going to try to talk on we're going to get to the baptism of the holy ghost this afternoon or this evening so brother adam says given a prophet this is world falling apart in 1963 they were given a prophet what they do each time they stoned them because they didn't agree with their system and put them to death jesus said you garnish the walls of the prophets and the tombs and your fathers is the one to put them in there and you testify that that's your children see they do it it's just too bad but that's the world see it's always god sends his word and wisdom tries to in other words verse the word that's the way it was at the beginning the very thing started the whole system of sin was because somebody eve satan produced a better plan than god's see we think we got a worldly plan to make it through this thing nope nope sorry satan produced a better plan than god's he produced wisdom they ate from the tree of knowledge wisdom always takes you away from god faith brings you back to god you don't know you don't know god by your great wisdom it's no good it's of the world it's foolishness to god but it pleased god through the foolishness of preaching his word to save the lost so god always uses somebody foolish and simple so here he is today foodless and simple that's me and you come to hear the word of god you didn't come to hear me you come to hear the word of god so let's buy our heads lord jesus thank you for this opportunity we have to stand before the greatest group of people that ever came on the face of this earth the people that the bible was written about lord we know that many prophets and seers and different ones down through the ages we're looking for a group of people like this lord that was gonna bind the acts of satan right here in his eden and lord i pray that you and that you will identify us we are the bride lord i pray that you'll identify us by signs and wonders and giving people the holy ghost and by the many things that we need lord manifestation of the sons of god father we pray that you just be with each one lord bless the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us be with sister wyveen she came through the operation they're okay that we hear father and that she'll be fine and get to come home and sister anna dale's mother lord we pray that you would comfort her lord and and save her soul the savior soul lord and i pray that you'll just be with each one that needs healing lord that needs salvation that needs the feeling of the holy ghost it needs a refilling of the holy ghost father today we open ourself up lord and ask you to come inside father and do the speaking for us tonight lord in jesus name we pray amen i had toby laying in my lap yesterday he'd already died and i told him i said i'm sorry i'm sorry toby that i can't speak your life back into you i'm sorry i'm such a sorry person that i haven't been able to manifest what the bible tells us to manifest but don't you worry little little kid i'll see you again we'll be with our the ones that we love but have you ever done that before have you ever come to a situation that said i'm supposed to be able to handle this what about a prophet with a possum that's what i'm looking for you say well that's for that's for that's for the prophet to god well there's the door you need to go find you on it's a manifestation of these sons and daughters of god us that have the baptism of the holy ghost that that maybe our lives are not always the way it's supposed to be we're not living exactly the sharpness that we should be living to where we can look down at an animal and say life come back into that animal that burdens my heart not for just a little toby we'll see him again i mean he's in a better place but us on this side is the ones i'm worried about i'm worried about the ones on this side that we can come to that situation and be able to speak in that and that life breath of life goes right back into that dog we've seen it with humans we've seen it with different ones we've seen it with animals but lord i wanted to see where like brother brown says like it's popping popcorn to where every time we speak something happens amen so let's read this who is this son of man this is part number 41. john 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word where it was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated the lord has his blessing to the reading of the word now we've been talking about just to back up a little bit for our visit or something we were talking about this has been a a 41 or 42 sermons on the life of a man called jesus christ but now not only the life of jesus christ back in history but the life of jesus christ and a group of people today amen and when we come to this place that we look in scripture and we see ourself and we see the time that we're living in we see that god has given us provision to make it to this time he has given us what a predestinated plan as we see there predestinated to adoption according to the book of ephesians we are predestinated in this end time to adoption so adoption is placing adoption is not just getting the holy ghost adoption is like i was talking about just it's god moving and god acting in everything that you do and everything that you see you know and it's not look it's not a flowery bed of ease it's not going to be that you're going to lay out on a cloud and your bills are going to quit coming due and you know your neighbor's going to instantly start liking you and you know it's not going to happen that way we know that but it does make things a lot better if we do have the baptism of the holy ghost and have these virtues working in our life as i said before the prophet of god tells us that it becomes a stumbling block if we are christians and then we have these little rough edges that we that people see that we have to deal with the little rough edges and that's what i want to next sunday we'll deal on or this coming sunday we'll deal with those rough edges because that's what faith that's what knowledge temperance patience guidelines brotherly kindness all that is knocking off the rough edges because remember you get everything you need when you get the holy ghost but you got everything in your in your being when you were born to be a mother to be a father to be a car driver to be somebody that can fill out a checkbook but you're not going to do that until you reach what the age of accountability or the age where you mature enough to where you'll be able to make a what a sound decision on all these matters same way with the word of god he's not going to give it we've been reading and reading and reading where where paul gets tells i've been feeding you milk i've been feeding you milk i've been feeding your milk i'm trying to feed you strong meat but i'm telling you what strong meat is what's going to make you feel better it's going to make you grow milk's going to be okay but you can't keep a baby on milk all the time and man so you got to grow up in god and we were looking now at the three stages of adoption the first stage is obviously you got to start with the birth you got to start where you get into the body of christ you got to get into this family of god because these virtues are not human virtues they're not virtues that humanly you're going to be able to just completely because remember virtue if you look up the word virtue in an encyclopedia it means being virtuous or being a virgin all right well you can be a virgin and die and go to hell in your physical being amen so that really has nothing to do it is it is according to god's word you need to be one before you get married but it's not a requirement for salvation it's a requirement that you be virgin up here everybody with me i'm gonna try to just do it a little bit slow i was gonna speed through this but i feel like i need to drop it back just a minute because the first stage is the birth now what is a natural birth it's water blood and life everybody with me all right it's water it's got to come the water's got to break the blood's got to come and then smack the baby on the rear end and the baby cries that's when that baby's soul enters its body is everybody with me all right now we know that by the prophet of god and we know that and and i'm not going to argue when conception and life and and all these other roe versus wade you that i take what the prophet of god said prophet of god said you're wiggling muscles until you come forth and god breathes the breath of life inside of you so okay so all right you're just wiggling muscles and you're getting ready to be birthed but you know what you're not birthed yet right we're not birthed yet if you're not if you're in justification and sanctification you haven't been born again yet you're still what yeah you had a first birth i can see that i'm looking at it right here i see your first birth and it was wrong it's killing you remember the scripture tells us that we're supposed to we're supposed to what do we do we we are joyous and happy and have a all kind of a big party for the birth of a baby the bible doesn't tell us that the bible tells us we're supposed to cry when a baby's born and rejoice when a saint goes to heaven we get it totally reversed we cry like a baby when somebody goes to heaven and we just you know this little baby just we look it's born dead time goes on long enough that baby will die so we're born with death inside of us natural death and if we're not born again by the spirit of god it's a spiritual death and to me that's worse than a natural death bible says don't fear the one that can kill your body you better fear the one who can kill your soul and the only one that can kill your soul is the one that gave you the soul but in between that point and that point there's got to be a change there's got to be a change there's got to be a place to where we become sons and daughters of god and we start changing our attitude and it's it's uh we got to quit the things that we did before because the things that we did before what does that get us that got us death right that's what we're looking at now this is what got us death our first birth that's why jesus told nicodemus that ye must be what born again not born from your mother again born from heaven and christ has got to come down and we'll read that in just for just a minute let's hurry through this pretty quick right here this point and then i'll stop and slow down romans 8 verse 14 says romanians are look led by the spirit of god i want you to look at these these words lead power uh and and all these things that the holy ghost is going to give supposed to give us when we get born again everybody with me on that and we'll get to that in just a little bit but as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god how many were led by the spirit of the devil before they were led by the spirit well everyone even raised your hand everybody everybody raise your hand because you're going to testify you were a son and daughter of the devil before you became a son and daughter of god you were not born a son of god now in the mind of god yes but not right here you've got to make a choice you've got to come to a place to where you got to what you got to be sick and tired of being sick and tired and that's what i hope we've come to that's why i always pray for my kids and your kids anybody that's that's kind of wavering on the on the fence i say lord stir their water don't let them sleep let them have the most restless night and i mean that i want to see that person in about three days you know about half asleep i said what's wrong they said we can't go to sleep i said praise the lord keep them up a few more days clean them out lord clean them out keep them keep them up just a little bit longer and fill them with the holy ghost because we need some holy ghost filled people's what we need amen for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are not going to be they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit now look at all this spirit spirit you don't receive the spirit of bondage but you receive the spirit of adoption whereby you cry as a baby father father our daddy daddy the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god now remember we got to look back and we'll see in a minute that that ezekiel and the different ones tell us that you get a new spirit and then he puts his spirit in all right so we're talking about a spiritual thing this is not a natural happening today this is the spiritual happening the only way i know that you've got the holy ghost or you know that i've got the holy ghost is what we manifest on the outside it's not that we get this tattoo or this 666 that we're going to have the mark of the beast over here and it's going to have a big number in the forehead and no come on people good grief we know that it's in your forehead not on your forehead what is inside your forehead intelligence your intelligence is inside your head and that's where the devil is going to play that's his playground that we are the children of god and of children than heirs heirs of god wow and join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together so we got to start with justification we were talking about last sunday but what says we the word is nightly even thy mouth in the heart the word of faith which we preach that thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus that's why no baptizing in titles how can you baptize entitled father son and holy ghost and be and be excuse me and be identified with somebody there there is a each one of us come from a family of whatever your life's name is and you're identified with that okay we're everyone human beings right we're everyone's spiritual beings too where everyone we we're most of us are fathers most of us are mothers and sons and we got all these different titles but look there's you know 60 people sitting in here right now who am i talking to why are you talking to everybody no i need one specific person so what i do i call you by name ruth mcferrin because he just walked in the door ruth made fear well then now john durrett didn't jump up and go that's me right you're identified by your name that's why we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ because it is identifying who we are and what we're heading toward we're going into the family of god so we need that name when you're born what name do you get the name of your family you get a family name all right not just human everybody's a human but one specific person you got a name and there's only one name that whereby we can be saved and whereby we need to be baptized and that's the name of the lord jesus christ and if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation when we come to this place of justification we've got to come to a place thinking back on my life you look at you look at your life there's no way you can justify yourself there's no way you can clean yourself up god's the only one who can clean you up but if you're so sorrowful where you're where you come to a place and say god i don't want to do that anymore see that's why people say the do's and don'ts part is well i got the holy ghost because i quit that don't have nothing to do with it i wanted you to get that out of your mind it's not do's and don'ts that the holy ghost now justification you won't do what you used to do but you still got that unclean spirit in you and you can do if you continue to yield yourself you can do and will do because there's nothing there to stop you yet but listen folks but if the if it say if justification is a part of the new birth it is a part of the new birth and god knows whether you're going to make it you don't but if you persevere those who he has justified he's already glorified so in the mind of god but you've got to start at justification you got to start going to the water be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ confess your sins repent say god i'm sorry sorry for what i did and i'm going today i'm going to as many as sister ruth did and and sister regina a different one says this is my state this is what i'm putting down right here no more devil no more right here is where i'm putting this steak down when i go into this water i'm going to die when i come out i'm going to come in newness of life and god i want you to fill me with the holy ghost if i already got it fill me some more fill my cup lord let it run over that's what we got to look for folks we can't look for a trickle i don't want a trickle holy ghost i was thinking the other day i thought lord here i am out here with this watering can and i'm just y'all saw my garden if you look at what's that or on marco polo it's bigger than this room and i'm out there going and it's drying up about as quick as i go back over here i said lord just in about five minutes you can water this whole garden and give it everything it needs and i'm out here for two hours squirting a little water here and squirting a little and that little plant is going i need some more that's the kind of god we serve see that's that's why you say well i don't know if i don't want to bother him no he bother right him on his door thank god i need and we did we cried for rain a few weeks ago and got plenty of rain we cried for rain and it got rained again so thank god for the rain and my little corn plants they got their little things up just like this right here they were like this that's how we are as christians when we don't get water when we don't come to church when we don't read our bible guess what we become malnourished but boy when that rain comes you know what it does it turns those leaves up and you know what it does when it turns the leaves up that's the funnel that funnels it right down to the stalk and then it runs right down into the what a mighty god we serve funnels it right down to the roots to where it needs it it needs it in the roots and the root system and that's what menu i'm trying to get us to where we're rooted and grounded and settled to where we won't be shaking because you know what war is coming i talk about war physical war i'm talking about a spiritual war war is coming satan does not want us to get anywhere so he is going to what oppose everything we're doing but he cannot win we've we we've read the playbook and we've already won the battle he just don't know that so being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god has set forth to be of perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past we cannot get forgiven for sins that we're going to do because we don't know what we've done or what we're going to do we do know what we've done you know today the things you've done that were wrong you didn't know him this morning how things changed we didn't know yesterday morning that was gonna lose toby but we did and that's okay but now in god you're supposed to get up and you say god whatever you got coming for me put the shield up but if i miss something then when we get to that spot i'm going to ask for forgiveness how can you ask for forgiveness for something you ain't done yet but you get re you get the there's righteousness for the remission of sins that are past and what does he do he is just in the justifiers we were reading there to what forgive you of that even now when we're up on the on the the top side of the mountain is as this uh song says we're looking up on that side of the mountain even with the baptism of the holy ghost we still have to say god forgive me and he is just to forgive us for the things that we're doing amen we just don't need to keep doing over and over and over again to declare i say that this time his righteousness not mine you can't get good enough to get saved you really need to get bad enough and realize you're bad that's what i come to i realized i was bad and i needed salvation because i didn't i didn't like going the direction i was going in but i didn't have that spiritual rudder to tell me and keep me what from the winds of war my war kids your war we all have a war pray for the holy ghost to give you that spiritual rudder to where if the winds start blowing in that direction but you need to go in that direction turn that rudder and say god i can't do it do it please do it for me and then what's he going to do the the big the big captain on top of the ship what's he going he's going hey turn the rider who's most important the captain or the guy the guy down there turning the rudder the guy down there turning the writer and that's what the holy ghost is giving for it's given to what to help us and we'll talk about it just for a second just in a second where's boasting then it's excluded by what law works there's no time we should boast about anything except what god's done for us nothing that we do therefore we conclude paul that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law the do's and the don'ts he said well now brother wave what are you talking about what about the dudes and the don'ts well under sanctification to me that's when uh but like brother brown said you become on in a religious order your name's put on a book you start your life starts changing not it's a new birth but it's sanctification when all that uncleanness starts going out of you when you say god i don't want to smoke anymore god i don't want to drink anymore i don't want to curse anymore i don't want to do this that or the other whatever you got your laundry list is the same as mine it just might have different list things listed on it because the bible says when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seek his rest and find us none when he said i will return to my house satan says he's going to return to his house from whence he came out of he was comfortable we made devils comfortable that's why we don't get rid of them the prophet of god remember he he drove that spirit out of that woman and then later on brother he said brother brown they said brother brown that spirit came back on a woman you know what he said he said she liked it so she didn't just want it out she was opening the door saying get back in here i like you get back in here you got to get to where you hate a demon i mean you got to get to where you really hated demon when you hate a demon now he's going to hate you but when you hate a demon you give him the word of god he can't stand the word of god he can sit in a church he you can you can throw we can put this oil plus 55 gallon drum but when you're not ready to get rid of him he will not leave but when you're ready to get rid of him when you get sick and tired of being sick and tired and you don't want no more of it you want to change now that's us in the new birth also folks we got to come to a place to where daily were sanctified when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man walks through dry places seek rest finds none then he said i will return to my house from whence i came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished then go ahead and take it with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first wow even so shall it be into this wicked generation i was mentioning something the other day when we watched many times like i said before i looked in 2015 2016 and some of the people that we baptized and they're no longer here they're no longer serving the lord even they're just right back out in the world well you know what that it wasn't a waste of my time it wasn't a waste of god's time i believe it was a waste of their time because god was willing to save them i was willing to baptize them in the right way they were just were not willing to continue on with god because of the 17 or 18 that we baptized i'm sorry law of averages i hope they all get the holy ghost but i don't know two months from now well my cat's got diarrhea i don't know if i can make it to church tonight or not well my neighbor's tree fell on my garden and i think i better see when you start with excuses you go right back into the same junk you were in before please don't do that because you know what that's the devil doing that that's the devil putting that in front of you that's not god but now god's gonna let him tempt you to see whether you're a child of god now not that god will see but where you'll see whether you're a child of god or not so please don't please persevere i think about today listen this is a fight this is a battle i mean i'm talking about bloody noses i'm talking about blood running out your ears i'm talking about dirt in your face that's the battle that we're in and especially in the end time because satan has got his hold on the whole world except for me and you he's already got them so he's turned his guns all on us and he's going to what he's going to fight you in your mind because that's his playground nevertheless the foundation of god stand is sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity what is iniquity it's a hideous sin it's knowing to do better and you do it anyway or knowing not to do it or knowing to do it and you don't do it but in the great house there are vessels of gold and silver and we'll talk about that in just a minute but also of wood and of earth and some to honor some to dishonor you know where they found a dead sea scroll where they find them in they found them in earth and vessels they found them in clay pots where you gonna find the word of god in the end time in clay pots we'll talk about that in a second questions and answers from genesis brother ryan said judas this carrot was justified by faith now we've already read this a bunch of times he was sanctified he was justified power to cast out devils they they healed the sick and they came back sanctified now sanctified none of them were filled with the holy ghost yet they just had an anointing they had that new spirit that that ezekiel's telling us about they got a new spirit they didn't get the spirit of god because god hadn't jesus hadn't died on a cross yet so there's no way he could transfer everything he had into them he just gave them power temporary power over those unclean spirits amen because with the baptism the holy ghost if you'll use it right you don't have temporary power you have power anytime you need it because the holy ghost is power all right and jesus said don't rejoice because the devil's a substitute but rejoice because your names are written in the book of heaven and judah says carrot was one of them called out sanctified in his name written in the lamb's book of life read matthew 10 and see if that's not right he called each one of the judas and everyone so we must be careful and not try to think that sanctification is our new birth we've been through this for years and years but please that's why i said don't settle down i got baptized no you get baptized you gotta start pushing you gotta start growing there was something planted that day you got planted in water but we come up in newness of life not death yeah we want everything that you don't want dead but not you we want a vessel of honor i'm glad jesus didn't throw the clay away aren't you a vessel of honor you're not tossed about by everything you know where you're standing there something happens you know that you're a real quick christian you know that you've been in contact with somebody that loves you and that's not filial love that's not just a little tickly in your heart that's knowing that god loves you but he loves you by corrective hands not by just i'm gonna shower you with everything hunky dory kumbaya and all that other stuff no it's a fight remember it's a battle and you've got to what jesus said if you'll draw nigh unto me i'll draw nigh unto you you've got to meet him somewhere all right you know that something happened down here and it's refreshing not only that but you'll refresh others you've seen people that was nice people but just couldn't hardly stand to be around them now he's talking about being a little creator now here's one i want to read real quick he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit so when you come under justification you've still got that old nature that you're fighting with you've just come out of the world and man is fresh on your mind and everything you did is right in front of you unless you moved but most of us most of us give our heart to god and we still live in the same place that we're living before as far as natural living right so all the things around you all the i had all the skull cans you know i had all the wild turkey and ginger ale and i'm just telling you the truth they were they were just like ornaments in my house i guess i'm the only one forgive me but i've been saved from them things hey man and you point you put yours up there and say i've been saved from that thing amen so i didn't and i didn't you know i some people put that stuff up and look at it and say well it don't tempt me no more i got rid of it get rid of that stuff don't ever tempt god or the devil you will lose on both points he'll give you a new spirit now that isn't god's spirit that's your spirit what's he doing he's he's cleaning your spirit up as brother brown said he said he said you know god he picks up this this dirty container out of the mud and he's it's all dirty and and what's the justification he he's justified in picking you up as we're going to see in just a minute god's justified when he takes that pound of clay still dirty still you're just changing the environment that it was in amen then you're going to clean it up but you're not going to drink out of it while it's got the mud still in it you got to clean it up you got to give it a new spirit what a clean spirit where you start going to church reading your bible come into bible study and when you don't do those things folks don't fool yourself you're not born again if that if that is see now look you say well you said everything was hard to do yeah it is hard to do but the overcoming part is when you get here amen you've overcome you've come here ask god to change something i'm asking god to change something now me god gives you a new spirit then he says out then he says i'll put my spirit in him but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you wow so he has to get you fixed up first thank god for a fixer-upper so he can come in i'll give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go all kind of oh yeah brother wait i go back to the bars now no you can't because that's not where he's going you got to be led by the spirit of god led by the spirit of god is not going back to the beer joint led by the spirit of god comes church get in a circle of friends get in and get out of the ones that you were in you can't do that you can't there we go temp god now you can be a light and i know we have to live among the people but but you don't have to partake what you did before because they've got to see something different you're going to display what's inside of you i don't care what you do you're going to manifest what's inside of you he's got to get you fixed up so you can entertain him right tonight we want to entertain the holy ghost but our problem is is we got the devil that we're entertaining him too and he's got the joker thing on because he's going to fool you into thinking that it's god wow i felt good that was good but he he said the preacher that was good i felt good but he said something i didn't like and i ain't gonna do that okay disobedience is the first thing you better get over so that's when you're on the first altar but when you hide away you get his spirit that's what we're going to talk about in a minute then the holy spirit none other than god himself comes and dwells in you that's what we want we don't want just my old spirit or or another spirit that makes me feel better and do things right i want god's spirit that's what we're going to talk about in a few minutes it's not just the holy ghost it's the holy ghost and fire something's got to burn you out it's kind of we were talking about last sunday about baptismal you start with a cucumber when you put it in the or baptize it or baptizo dip baptizo and then baptismo when it goes into that whatever pickling agent vinegar and uh and the pickling salt it comes out of cucumber abby where's she at you just ate one a little bit ago but smell good but you know what it was once a cucumber it looked like a cucumber it acted like a cucumber it didn't smell like one because it smelled like white vinegar but it became a pickle and there's no way that pickle can be reversed back to a cucumber yet it still looks like a cucumber praise god that's what the holy ghost will do for you he'll change you and there's no way you can go back that's the problem we get to a certain place and then we won't go any further with god we won't we'll we'll go to that first part where he washes us up and gets the cucumber ready and you know and and then we stop we turn the oven off because you got to heat it up gotta put pressure a good pickle tea of good pickles pressurized parents likes pickles a good pickle though has got to go through a pressurized process you don't just lay it out there and go well i'm a pickle now no it goes through a process it's got to be heated up it's got to be changed from a cucumber to a pickle but it still looks the same we're just all a bunch of cucumbers until you get the holy ghost then when you get the holy ghost you're a pickle you look the same but you don't act the same until they definitely don't taste the same amen then the holy spirit none other than god himself comes and dwells in you and then there's something about you the neighbors love you the people likes you excuse me interval let's get on down here to the bottom now even you pentecostal people a lot of times just mistaken in that you get a new spirit that's not god's spirit that's you that isn't god you get a little happy because you get a new spirit you jump up and down you run around over the floor maybe or shout a little bit speak with tongues run around a little bit and think you got the holy ghost that's not it that's a new spirit god gave you that's you like what somebody said one time you know we talk about special meetings and we go we act different at special meetings we do because they're special there's special meetings we see people shout speak in tongues run around run out you know run all over the house and and have prayer lines and all these different things but the preacher was making a point he said but you ain't gonna do that every sunday every sunday though you come back to this meeting and this is a meeting where the shepherd and the sheep get to know each other and you do something wrong that shepherd is going to smack you upside the head he's not going to be out there and just ah it's a special meeting you know he said that's okay go to special meetings cause they're special but when you come back here he said you expect to hear from god he said you don't expect to hear from all that shouting and speaking in tongues and all that running around you need to hear from god amen in the quietness of the preaching by a pastor for his sheep that's a new spirit god give you that's you then after he gives you your spirit then he says i'll put my spirit that's what's a matter of this missed meal cramps that's what we're explaining and two that does mean that you've missed meals and that's what it is you go how many of you come to church remember if you come to church you either gonna get full or you're gonna have a missed meal cramp you're gonna either miss something or get something some of y'all look like you ain't got many you haven't missed many meals naturally but i want to be fat spiritually hey man i don't care about no diet plan in the spiritual realm i won't know this keto that i'm on now that i'm trying or this weight watchers i don't want none of that stuff i want to eat all i can when i'm in this building because these vitamins is what's important oh yeah bodily bodily exercise prophecies a little don't be sedentary get up and do something now notice you put a new spirit god has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him because you know what you're doing you were alienated from god at your first birth you were alienated god you were not in the you now listen down here now in the mind of god you were but down here you were alienated from god you didn't have a clue what you were doing you got the things you did god was nowhere around oh yeah he was around but he was up here looking down at you or over in another dimension going come on come on come on you got to get through that one come on you missed that one you got to go back come on come on but you're down here struggling like you wouldn't believe but god knows what he's doing so he gives you a spirit to get along with he takes that spirit out of you and gives you a spirit to get along with him get along with yourself to begin with didn't we hate ourself in the world come on just i hated myself i got to a place where i just hated being me and most people that was around me did too praise the lord anyhow but what happened god justified me you've heard my story i got justified and sanctified i got cleaned up got water baptized felt just a freshness come over me and felt an emptiness where everything emptied out but you know what i didn't disappear from church i didn't quit reading my bible i didn't quit studying i didn't quit coming around you guys i knew that was part of my journey but not the complete journey i had to get around some good sheep not some black sheep or some ghost they say but and i know you did too you move forward into that next realm you've moved over into that sanctified place and it was all new it was all beautiful you heard from god but you can't stay there you got to keep moving you got to keep going i've seen people and you i don't have god knows i don't have any discernment but you can watch people and see kind of where they're at you know there's people it's just like like the children of israel they're going around horrible and they just continued you know about every from 40 years to every two years they looped that mountain they looked down and they said well that's my footprint i've been here before they were on an indian death march that's the way we were on an indian death march just around and around but one day god said stop i've had enough of this you either going to go north you're either going to go and possess that land or i'm going to give it to somebody else so that's what we what and only two people joshua and caleb said we're more than able but the rest of them said no i don't think so i i don't i don't like i don't like these two hour uh sermons i don't like this going to sunday school man i have to get up i got beer at 9 45. i'm i'm i can't even get a biscuit for then and coffee starbucks is not open oh i forgot to put gas in my car lord i'm gonna be late you would not put gas in your car if you was going to the doctor tomorrow you'd make sure your tank was full amen you got prepared for your appointment amen you hear the little excuses well i forgot to and i forgot to and i left my and and i didn't get enough uh and i didn't uh starbucks messed my order up i had to go back to the drive-through if you drink starbucks you've got to be say it's gotta be still a demon in you somewhere anybody i'm getting on my stool anybody that'll drink a starbucks coffee and pay 19.95 for a p for for a drop two drops of coffee is illiterate you know how much coffee is it's like five cents a cup to make it at your house and put you some mocha latte blah blah blah blah in it and squirt you some whatever that stuff on top of it is i never seen them dress a coffee up like that and charge you 20 bucks but i'm going to tell you something about starbucks though those people are blatant gays i don't care you can youtube and take us off they are blatantly gay they stood up against stewart kathy at chick-fil-a and told them they were idiots for closing on sunday and that they didn't have one nothing to do with religion well you know what i'm not supporting that i'm not supporting that you say well somebody else may be gay at walmart well i don't know it yet but if i do we'll find somewhere else to go all right i'm back off my soap opera box i'm back down here so he puts a new spirit in you then he puts his spirit in you gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new faith you take the faith that you had for the world that you had for the economy that you had for politics that you had for whatever you want to put in there and you get a new faith but we're going to come to a spot next sunday where the prophet of god have already read it to you where it says just faith alone won't do it that's a strong statement for a prophet to make that's a strong statement for anybody to make you say why everything he said yes everything is based on faith based on faith and it is faith all the way up but it's not just faith alone i've got faith god's going to give me a job well if you got one yet brother no i i've been sitting on my couch for three weeks and god ain't knocked at my door one time faith is is go to that interview and say god help me to say something that'll give me that job now see then god's gonna work on both ends but i've never seen god come knocking on your door and say hey i got a job for you it's starbucks there's other places and i know chris long if he's watching he's going to go what duncan donuts he loves the board love dunkin donuts but see that's just the silly things we get into though i mean you know and i don't care you i ain't gonna throw you out a message i might throw you onto the bus but i'm gonna throw you out the message for drinking starbucks but uh but i just can't see that i'm just not uh i may spend i'm danny i may spend 25 on a box of shells but i ain't spending 25 on no cup of coffee so that box of shells i can shoot 20 things with it that shot of coffee i just gonna go away after i two three hours my body's gonna process it and it's just going down in the toilet let's go to the baptism of the holy ghost and let's see what we do here seeing you have purified your souls all right now we're talking about soul we're talking about your inner being the real you that's the real person we're talking about the real you what's so funny bella hey i want listen she's got a job abby's got a job you know what they went and got a job yeah they went to a job at 15 years old praise god i hope some 45's try that i can't believe these we got a local store there well it's a dollar general they're closing at seven o'clock at night because they don't have any employees and you got people walking the street and i know some people get in get into bad ways but you can find a job you find a job it may not be the one you want at the moment but at least it brings you some money in so that you don't have to beg for it god didn't make us to be beggars he gave us this world he gave us this world to live on he gave you an intelligence it may not be that knowledge right there yet but he gave you knowledge to do the right thing and you need to do the right thing you'd be a good employee you'd be you be asked what i told my son i said be unfairable how can you be unfireable they can't do without you if they can't do without you they'll never fire you oh you might get ill and you might kick the trash can out the door every once in a while boyd but but or turn the desk over but you still were so important enough they didn't let you go right boys don't do that anymore brother boy he's delivered from that but there was a point in time in our journey that we knew that he was a little bit on the temperamental side so but you know what god will sell you there want him he'll give you a red headed wife being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god god will give you something to straighten you out if you're a child of god i promise you what did moses moses was the meekest man in the world zappora was not okay but you see how this look and i'm making a funny joke but this is all life it's the life that we're living it's the true life that we're living it's not some it's not something painted up you know it's not somewhat bob ross nice trees and we're gonna draw mountains and now we're going to draw flowers it's not that this is not a flowery bed of ease this is a battle you got to turn that brushstroke into a pistol or a sword something honestly folks me included we're not fighting as much as we should we are not fighting and using remember the warfare it's not of the guns that we haven't it's the word of god versus satan amen and where's god if he's in you you're doing the fighting he's doing the fighting through you if the devil's in you he's doing the fighting through you all right but this now let's talk about this being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god so the only way you can get born again is what by the word of god not by your mama not by your daddy not by listening to a good preacher that helps but by the word of god let it sink down inside of you see that's when i realized i had the new birth is it was not something external it was something internal because we're going to read here in a minute where the bible even tells us that you don't need a teacher anymore the teacher's inside of you now listen i'm going to tell you like the prophet god said he said that don't mean you sit at home and get all that by yourself no he give us teachers in the body to what to coincide with that teacher that's inside of you if you don't have the teacher inside of you there's nothing to connect to you will not understand a word i'm saying tonight without the holy ghost or the quickening power that heads you toward the holy ghost if you're in your journey praise god realize though that it's a journey and you've got to this point that you're trying to get to this point and god help us to find out where we are and help us to find out how much we can get further because listen in the mind of god he had an image and he was going to make sure that image come to pass and what was that image it had to start as a spiritual image first genesis 1 26 let us make man in our own image after our own likeness let them have dominion over the what the fish of the sea flesh you say anything about angels you ever thought about that give him dominion over the fish of the sea and defile the air and every living creature that's on the face of the earth god give this person dominion put him in a spiritual form first and then he created the physical form and he said you are over this group right here then god said okay i got this lump of clay and i'm going to put it on the wheel and i'm gonna work on it as a prophet god tells us that there stood adam in the garden of eden in genesis 2 7 he's getting ready to put that spiritual man inside of an earthen vessel inside of a pot called adam adam physical everybody with me and here as as the prophet of god illustrates it looks like adam is standing in the garden of eden and his toes are like roots of a tree because that's where he came from the potter takes the clay listen the potter has to go down to the earth to get the clay the clay's not in the air the clay's on the ground the clay's on the earth and he picked up a special pot of cla thing clay hey you know what clay threw it on the wheel he said all right breath of eternal life that thing's now living but i made it it's living but i made it i'm the creator i'm the one that'll make it and then i'm gonna put my life inside of that but i'm not gonna be finished with that i want them to bring forth little pots and more little pots and the pots that you that they make i'm gonna give them life and then i'm gonna give them a chance or an opportunity to become eternal everybody with me here bible says right here all flesh is grass it's just there i mean it's just there flesh and all the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass with us and a flower therefore falleth away but the word of the lord endureth forever this is the word which the gospel is preached unto you they found those dead sea scrolls in caves in pots they were preserved for thousands of years in earth and vessels and that's what god wanted in the beginning until that got marred by eve his second pot got marty we had to come the way we are now but you know what he's a master potter he puts the clay on the wheel he spins the wheel he uses water and you know what you got to do i've watched many times we grew up working there's a pottery place right across the road probably you've seen it cravings pottery it was world famous at one time huge 20 some million dollar company and they made they made tractor trailer loads of pots by the day you know what it all started from if you go out and look now you can see still a pile of it it's the ugliest mountain you ever see in your life because it's been rained on it's been it's collapsed it's turned colors that's what happens when you don't have god as a master potter that master parter though what does he do he takes that clay what happened with that one out the physical part of that that clay is what it's needed it's getting all the impurities out but it comes to a tube about this big and what happens is if you've got a one gallon jar or two gallon jars that somebody sits and cuts them off well this one is made for a specific thing but listen to what happens it's got to be soft so it can be molded like i said before god has to give you a new spirit so that you can get along with the potter because you know what you can't say to the potter why'd you make me this way remember the bible you got to be molded and you're going to be listen we're all molded in his image adolf hitler was molded in his image but there was something put down inside of adolf hitler called a soul to make a choice and he made a horrible choice but god just continued to let that vessel go and it'll get its reward but they have special pots their special special clay the kind that he has to go and get and pick up and put on the wheel and then spin the wheel and let me tell you something i've been and worked for a year or two over that cravings pottery and it's the messiest place you'll ever see but it starts out a real nice pretty clean piece of piece of clay but he puts it on that wheel and most of them when you put on the wheel you got to smack it down on the wheel because you don't want it to move you want it to be perfectly straight where you when the hands go like this it's not wobbling or your pot is going to look like this but put it in there and guess what's the first thing they do they take water there's always water right here there's always water and he takes the water he splashes it on the on the um clay and it becomes wet and those beautiful hands that was making that pot has now become as dirty as the pot god had to come down here he had to come down here and get dirty with us because god made a body on a wheel one time it's called jesus christ 2000 years ago and he came here as a baby but he had to get his hands dirty and every time he deals with me and you know what he does he gets his hands dirty and then old dirty hands oh my my cousin and and joe craven and all them they'd have mud all the way to here and they would actually wear an apron because it just swings everywhere so whatever came out of the clean part is not clean anymore but what's he doing he has got something in his mind that he's going to make whether it be a one pound jar strawberry jar whatever it is and all the things on the outside all the markings that he's going to mark on the outside but you know what he's got to do when he turns that wheel his hands get dirty but what's the first thing he does to make a pot you got to put your hand down in it first thing he does is he takes his hand and he pushes puts a little pressure on the pot everybody with me he puts a little pressure on the pot and what's the first thing he does he reaches and gets it like this and he starts up the wall and if it is an impurity guess what he stops he doesn't go get another piece of clay he uses that piece of clay he smashes it back down with the trials and tribulations that we have remember if we if we don't pass the test what do we do we take it again so he matches it back down because remember it's still pliable it's water it it's still something that god can work with it's still something that he can use he's still got it in his mind what he's going to use they had to have in their mind a strawberry jar a one pound jar or a jar with a handle and drive without a handle that's the master potter he knew and he knew how high to make it because he had a what he had a a guide he had a comforter he had a guide and they literally they did it was a stick and you turned the thing and you moved it down and had a little pen sticking out and that's how you made that certain pot and you'd make it that pot up to that side and make a lip to it and it would be perfect just what you needed but god had i mean the potter had to first do is stick his hand down in that pot and get it clean he had to get it clean and here he goes still forming to the lip and it's still spinning the whole time we think our life is spinning out of control let's try to think that's god molding us if it's spinning that's all right let it spin listen if you're of gods it will not go off that that wheel it'll stay there because when they get ready to put that pot somewhere else they have to literally take a a like a fishing line pull it as tight as they can and they do this right here underneath it to cut it off of that wheel when god's finished with you he'll cut the will he'll know what to do and he'll put your pot over there to use everybody with me but we have to go what we have to go through a process we have to go through a drying process the unclean spirit's gone out god's justified us by using that piece of clay he's sanctifying us because he's what he's cleaning us up getting us ready to put it in service because that jar has got to be at a certain um moisture content before he puts it in the fire if it's too low it won't kill if it's too high it'll blow up but what's the next thing god does he takes fire i mean the potter sorry the potter knows there's an oven right over there that's what i used to do i used to fill it full and but now remember when you did that when you got that when you got a new spirit you had to be careful because you could still bust the pot everybody with me that's all right on wednesday night okay it's still pliable but it's drying the unclean spirit's gone out it's being moved to a new area it's being moved closer to the fire but now once that pot is taken and put in that kill okay i only killed it's heated to like 1500 degrees you stack them here and you stack them oh we used to stack that thing completely full then we would put fire bricks on the outside and it up with clay to keep the fire from coming out but when we got finished what do we have a vessel of honor because jesus didn't throw that part of the clay away he put it in a kill he baptized it with the holy ghost and fire and now guess what you're not pliable anymore you're a hardened christian now you got a soft heart but they'll never be able to make that cucumber i mean that pickle of cucumber again you'll never be able to make that pot when you drive by there and you look you drive by cravings party you look you see all that all those pots they turn red somebody say it man they turn red when they get to the fire because when you put them in there they're flesh-colored everybody with me but when you put them in that kill they turn an orange red so you know they're finished because when you look out in that parking lot you can see that that's a finished product and you can see that it's what getting ready to be bought with a price and then to be put in use not going to sit out there all the time somebody's going to use that that's the same way with us being predestinated look after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation after you believed after after you were molded after you had the water after you had god cut you off of the wheel and put you over in a place closer to the fire to get you what to get you ready to receive him everybody with me which is the earnest of your inheritance when i put that pot in there that was an earnest that pot didn't get put in use inside that kill you can barely listen i think my tennis shoes i think i wore 20 pair that summer you walk in there and they just melt so we had to wait we had to have those fire gloves but when we brought them things out and put them out and let them cool let the coolness of the holy spirit blow over that vessel he's going to say use me lord use me lord i'm i've turned red now by the washing of the water of the word i've turned red in your blood i'm accepting you lord and now whatever you got for me i may be shipped to xyz but i'm going to be used i can't be used as a lump i've got to be put on the potter's wheel and god you got you got to get your hands dirty with me that's what he did which is the earnest of our inheritance into what the redemption of the purchased possession to the praise of his glory i want that pot right there that's a good looking pot that pot's been through the fire that pot's been through the potter's wheel and i know there's a potter behind that that got his hands dirty i know there's a potter that's slaved that probably spent hours making that whole pallet of vessels of honor i am today aren't you glad jesus didn't throw the clay away i am so glad john 14 15 says if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world look the world cannot receive this holy ghost i'm talking about the world general i was thinking about it yesterday you know you can quote charles stanley you can quote jensen franklin which is right up here you can quote jim baker what everything he done they still put him up on a pedestal you can quote jim baker god forbid tammy baker but you can quote all these people john hagee john hagee's a good man john mccarthy he's a good man he's a good he's nominal preacher good guy and whatever that one in texas is i can't remember his name the big guy but anyway these are these are guys that they they quote like uh well max locato uh and and all the different ones alistair begg all that you hear those quotes and you hear them quoting things all the time but you say william branham said what do you mean y'all still read his messages 60 years and quote his message after he's already been dead i say yeah you do the same thing billy graham's been gone almost that long or roberts has gone almost that long and you're still quoting him the problem is it's just like that quote i read you we want a prophet but we're going to kill him and put him in a tomb because we don't like what he said because he came a different way he was a different looking pot god made that pot now listen god made these brothers too i'm not saying anything against them but why can we get why we get ostracized because we can quote william branham we can quote a preacher from the past and everybody else quoted each preacher from the past and it's okay it's the spirit behind it he was different he brought us the truth of water baptism the truth of no eternal hell the truth of all these different things the true way to get the baptism of the holy ghost he brought those things to me and you behold i send you elijah the prophet behold i'm going to put that pi i'm the potter i'm going to put that special clay on there and instead of just molding him i'm going to make a whole truckload of them little messiahs the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive the world can't receive truth well hey listen the best read magazines are those that says that there's an alien came down and had a baby with a woman and and they had kittens jonathan don't look at me like that you've been standing in line with some encounters who looked at the national enquirer and you're looking it but the whole world says oh that's that's to be the truth and you tell the word of god and they go now no don't give me any of that why they don't have the right spirit they haven't been through justification and sanctification like you should go through and the baptism of the holy ghost god wants to put you and me in into a listen we're not above the world we are not special people only that god made us special people you and i are all come from the same place but by receiving the baptism of the holy ghost though that makes you different by making a choice that makes you different i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet why in the world will see me no more but you'll see me how many of you have ever seen jesus in the flesh on folks i'm looking at him and the word was made flesh your flesh your vessel your pot of clay that you think man this thing is just awful i'm all bent all over and and i can't hold much water but you're a vessel of honor because god's the one that made you now we got to give something back to the potter yet a little while the world sees many more but you'll see me because what i live you shall live also at that day the prophet of god said this day you shall know that i am in the father and ye and me and i and you that's why there's not two or three gods running around and even with us involved it's not two or three gods running around one god one god inside of me and you these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you how many times have you been sitting and thinking on god or or or have an issue that you're working through and you come in here and you sit down and and you swear that the the preacher was with you the whole week that wasn't you that wasn't the preacher that was the holy ghost the one the spirit of truth that was with you he said he wouldn't abide with you he'd abide in you so what you look at he looks at oh come on now hold on a minute brother wait yeah what he looks at we look at what he what you say we better be careful let's read this real quick and then we'll close and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove now this who is coming to abide on jesus now we know that jesus was the word we know that jesus didn't need the holy ghost he was the holy ghost the the spirit inside of him was the holy ghost he didn't need he didn't walk as many have said he didn't walk 30 years as a mortal man yes he did walk 30 years as a mortal man but he was god he was different than me and you he was not born in sin he didn't have a carnal mind his spirit wasn't all messed up sure the devil tried to get to him many times but he never defeated him that's right but now john you're a prophet this is john the baptist now john you're a prophet maybe he's sitting on a rock one day and he's got his head down and thank god he's dipping them locust and that pure honey man that'll make that'll make anything taste good being a beekeeper i should know that but he's dipping that locust and wild honey and he's eating it and he's fixing up his camel hair and he's getting ready to go out and god speaks to him and says hey i know you're a prophet i know you can see spirits you can see things ascending and descending because watch remember he's standing in the water and he's looking he sees two or three men walk by which are from the temple he says hey you generation of vipers ax is going to be laid in the room of your tree you don't even have the right kind of father what are you doing what was that discernment he saw the spirit of god with us descend on caiaphas caiaphas would go behind the curtain and he would offer the um the blood for the year and come back out and say all is well and inside of him he's black as black can be because he put jesus on a cross so john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode on him who jesus and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descend and remain different kind of guy he wasn't an anointed one because an anointed one you can have the spirit of god on your flesh and on your spirit every day of your life and you can die go to hell be just as black inside as you ever have been that's exactly the way kaipas was but god specifically told john said look i know you're watching in the spirit realm but when you see that spirit come down and go on somebody and stay there with him and remain that dub just didn't light on his shoulder it disappeared because it went inside of him and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the holy ghost or baptismal changed the cucumber into the pickle john 7 37 says in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me is the scripture that saith out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given sometimes we don't quote that scripture the holy ghost was not given the woman at the well didn't get the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth mary didn't get the new birth until the upper room and neither did elizabeth neither did john they got the holy ghost they got an anointing because the holy ghost had not been released yet there stood jesus with the holy ghost he said i can't give it to you now but i'm going to go away and then i'll come back and when i come back that's what i'm going to do i'm not just going to come inside of you i'm going to remain and i'm going to burn out everything all the impurities not one speck of you it's going to be wet i'm going to dry you out but i'm going to put inside of you something that out of your belly will flow rivers of living water your belly i just read you that we're joined heirs with god if he if out of his belly flowed rivers of living water same way with us what are we doing now we are preaching the word of god we're receiving the word of god and what is it it's a river that's flowing out there's a river of life flowing out from me what makes the lame to walk and the blind to see open prison doors set the captive free there's a river of life flowing out of me amen let's read this right here but you shall receive power that word power is dunamis like dynamite you've heard brother god bless his soul brother ernie villanueva has gone on to be with the lord but every time he preached he would use that word dunamis because listen there with the holy ghost everywhere you see the holy ghost it says power but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost you're not listen you're powerless without him brother brown said cold formal and powerless is this church that don't have the holy ghost cold former and patent and powerless are you if you don't have the holy ghost but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall sit down and close the door and not go anywhere and just keep it all to yourself no it says and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth lula georgia dunamis power mighty work strength miracles virtue strength power ability inherent power power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth power for performing miracles moral power and excellence of your soul that don't sound like there's a devil anywhere in that that's what the holy ghost will do for you now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace and believing that you may what abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that you also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able to add to it also to admonish one another first corinthians we'll stop right here musicians get ready come on first corinthians 2 verse 12 says now we have received not the spirit of the world we need to get rid of the spirit of the world but the spirit which is what of god vessels of honor that we might know the things that are what freely given to us of god if you're not getting something from god you've got a problem i got a problem because it's not god's problem which things also we speak not in the words which man wisdom teacheth tonight if you don't have the holy ghost you don't understand half of what i'm saying i am sorry but please say god i want to understand i want to know what this is i want to know about this person i've never met before meeting folks he's right here where you can meet him the holy ghost is not way out younger it's right here now thee which things also we speak not in the words of man's wisdom but which the holy ghost what teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god there it is for they are what foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are what spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known in the mind of the lord known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but paul says but we have the mind of christ musicians come for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power that's what i'm looking at i'm looking at the next phase it's going to be a power the power's here listen the power's laying here we just got to pick up music we just got to pick it up music but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we are among you for your sake and look and you become followers of us and of the lord having received the word and much affliction with the joy of the holy ghost you're going to have affliction but you're going to have joy titus talks about the renewing of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our savior last one for it's impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were partakers of the holy ghost now let partakers it came on them they used it but it didn't reside it had to leave because of something you turned it down remember the prophet of god tells us that uh what was it augustine of hippo that the holy ghost tried to come on him and he rejected it let's don't be word rejecters we know where they go they go to hell there's only heaven and hell and listen folks i'll promise you hell has not been done away with let's stand to our feet there's going to be a judgment you're going to give judgment you're going to have judgment you're going to be in judgment if you're not in christ you will go to that judgment bar and i'll promise you your knees will be shaking because it's your life but remember if you'll turn it over to god here if you'll turn it over to god here you won't have to turn it over to him there he'll say hey whoa whoa they've got my spirit i've already been judged you can't judge me again i've already been judged that's why i thank god we don't have to go through tribulation we don't have to even stand at the judgment bar doesn't matter how much this muddy clay looks god still puts his hand down in there and gets dirty with us now you know god don't get dirty but you know what he does he gets down here close to us he helps you and all your needs don't he don't step back and go no i don't think
