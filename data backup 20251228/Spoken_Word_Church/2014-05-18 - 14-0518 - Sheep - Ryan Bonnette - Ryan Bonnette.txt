========================================

okay good morning good morning uh okay is this one more right less yeah i think so okay let's all go the lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you lord for letting us get together here today in your name and we pray you'll just come and have the preeminence and the service and both the services and also the sunday school just help us all to step aside and allow you to speak through us and i pray that you will uh bless brother wade as he's ministering to those that came up for prayer yesterday all the requests that were mentioned uh thank you for blessing us so much in the fellowship meeting yesterday for opening your word to us and we love you and thank you for all your blessings in jesus name amen all right here it's hard to see the mouse come over here today we're going to talk about sheep they want to talk about the comparison between us and she how that we are cheap in our nature okay uh this kind of goes along with some of what brother boss talked about last sunday and there was some things that the brother said yesterday too that kind of put me in mind of this same thing that i'm going to talk about how that we need to offer up our own thoughts and ideas to god and just have the mind of christ so that's what i really want to do is show show all of us how much like sheep we are so that we can really see how bad we need the shepherd right because we are in desperate need of a shepherd we have here a really good natural shepherd brother dale and of course our our spiritual shepherd is the lord and he leads us through brother dale and in our church life but then also in our relationships we need a shepherd we need a shepherd in our finances and we need a shepherd in everything that we do i think because we're born clueless and we're born sheep and i shoot nature so by showing you how sheep are and and some things that i studied on sheep hopefully it'll get you to see because ever since i started studying on this a few months ago it's kind of helped me to realize how much in need of i am forever so what got me thinking on this month was a while back i was listening to dave ramsey a few months ago and a woman called into the show and she wanted to start following his plan to get out of that everybody here knows about dave ramsey right okay so she said well dave we owe 30 000 on each of our cars her husband and she did excuse me though 20 000 and their cars both worth 30. so he said well if you sell each car for you know its value you have ten thousand dollars equity you can buy two paid for ten thousand dollar cars and here's her idea here's why she said i can't do that she said number one a ten thousand dollar car won't be safe and it won't be reliable and of course dave condemned that on the air in front of all the listeners said no no no you know a used car is plenty reliable and it's plenty safe enough but i started thinking about it oh i said you know that woman wasn't really dumb she believed like most people believe that you have to have a new car to be for it to be safe and for it to be reliable and i'm not condemning anybody's got new cars okay i'm just saying this is i'm you know i like new cars myself but i'm just saying this is what got me thinking on this line so i started thinking about well where down through history did that start to become an issue where did they where did someone start deceiving people to think that it was the car companies and i did some research on it and i tried to find evidence to back this up and i couldn't but this is what i expect what i think suspected that happened okay somewhere down the line somebody started saying well you know to have a a new a new car you'd be better off and you'd be safer and to be more reliable and especially with women you know dave ramsey talks a lot about how women have a safety gland which is metaphorical meaning that a woman wants to feel safe and secure so safety is a big issue for women so i started thinking well the car manufacturers realized that and some genius said well if we will market these cars as being safe you know our cars being the safest on the market ever sale because especially women really want to feel safe and secure and so and now every car ad that you hear or see talks about the safety of the vehicle right you always see this crash test with the dummies in there getting thrown into a brick wall and think well that's the safest car and it's so it works so good it works so good that my mom she made this comment to me we bought the kia sedona office sister susan while back and my mom saw that it was a kid when she came to look at it she said well ryan you know it's a kid i said yeah i knew it before i bought it she said well you know they don't perform very good in crashes and i said okay and what had happened is just a few weeks prior to that there was a bad break on 365 and involving the kids the donuts was a suv and it rolled and somebody died but just because it performed kind of poorly it threw out in her mind that every kid is you know unsafe and she's a smart woman okay she really is she's an rdm and she's very intelligent but i got to think about what would make her think that and what makes so many people think that that's just one of the many lies that we fall for in our society okay that's just the first example okay i've got some better ones but uh this woman on dave ramsey's show she said you know if i buy this ten thousand dollar car in the first few months i'll have a ten thousand dollar shop bill for me breaking down all the time and that's a lot of silly and it'll uh and she said i want to be safe for my babies you know for my little because it's the mommy bear instead instinct kicking in wanting to watch out for a little bear clubs so granted new cars are more reliable and but really any car in this modern day is pretty safe in comparison to what they were in the 60s people got impaled by their steering wheel they got decapitated by the windshield because it wouldn't shatter properly so cars are a lot safer today than what they used to be and you know these are just some of the lies that have been sold to our society by car manufacturers and we bought into it because we're she that's what i'm saying so then i got the thing about the holocaust and we know about the nazis and about about hitler and how that he deceived these nazis and i didn't really research this a lot but i think i've heard somewhere along the way that he more or less deceived them into thinking that these jews were a lower life form so human how else could he have gotten them to kill these jews and mass murder as they did and yet these nazis were human beings warm blooded body spirit and soul just like the jews same thing but yet somehow hitler being a strong leader like he was deceived them in masses deceived an enormous number of these nazis to kill these jews that were also people and and you think they did unthinkable things that we could never even imagine doing to our fellow human beings you know so what is it about man because some of them nazis i mean i'm sure some of them had good morals and good ethics and some of them were fathers and husbands trying to be a good daddy husband and raise their family but for a living they killed people you know and in mass numbers and all because hitler was such a strong leader and he deceived them because they had that shield and then i thought about i hope they don't mind me bringing it up but there's a couple sisters that were in here one sunday a few months back we eat in here right and we eat quietly because we're eating and they were talking and we overheard them and one of their sisters said that she knows somebody in the message in a message church and one of these churches has gone off into polygamy and her comment was i'll see how such a large group of people can be so naive to believe that that's right and i thought well that's really true but then you think about all the false doctrines in the message and how can so many the vast majority of the messages deceived believe in especially two things that i've dealt with that i've had to battle which was jesus not being god before the root for jordan and coming with a natural seed of eternal life laying dormant right eternal life being dormant down in our soul and that we have it god gave it to us but not to our brother or sister that was born before us or after us and making god a respecter of persons you know how can eternal life be dormant and how can uh god be a respecter of persons he can but see they've been sold those lies by false shepherds and they've been sold the lie that jesus wasn't god god and flesh came down god and a man came down and they said at some point in his life before the river jordan he wasn't god and that he died just as a man he's saying well that's senseless how can we believe that it's because we're sheep all those things the polygamy and all the false doctrines and the message and why there are so many people following them is because we're sheep by nature okay and they've been deceived and we're not immune okay because i'll say this because you know even though we have a good shepherd that's leading us the right way we all believe right uh you know a saying can go forth from among some of us in the congregation or uh things can creep in unawares right that will start to cause us to go off and and in the wrong direction see because we're cheating we'll be misled we'll go up australia so uh those are some of the examples that i've been thinking about and how that we are in desperate need of a separate and we need to as sheep we need to be diligent too and try the spirits to see where they be of god try all this thing not just say just because brother dale said you know we need to try it for ourselves right and make sure on everything everything that we hear is hold up before that urine and thumb and see if it reflects and then so in these shepherds to handle our finances and of course i consider dave ramsey a financial shepherd because he is i believe he sent i believe that god has you know ordained him to or given laid that on his heart to bring what he's brought to the world and especially to the children of god because it's helped a lot of us in this church and self gave me not by leaps and bounds to take our minds and our worries off of our finances because we have everything squared away financially so we don't have to worry about debt we don't have to worry about so many things now and because he's a shepherd but see he's working through or god's working through him to bring that and i've been reading a good book here lately uh by emerson egrets about love and respect it's a good book about marriage and he brings from a scriptural standpoint how to you know for about scriptures about how wives love their husbands and i mean respect their husbands and husbands love your wives and you know all these things are to me are shepherds that god has put in place to help guide us as sheep in these different parts of our lives and see my mind keeps going back to the i think it was the last sunday school that i taught about wisdom and how that ever since we were put here ever since adam and eve were put here there was two trees two fountains two sources the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life and they've been present they've been available to us all down their time right and constantly really if you think about every moment of every day you can protect from one of those two trees and every nearly everything we do you can redeem the time and make the best use of your time or you can give it to the devil that's right and if you can't listen to a sermon all the time do what brother wade talks about he says that he doesn't listen that he's been saying here lately i don't listen that many sermons but while he drives those lawn mowers he's preaching a sermon in his head he's feeding on or digesting the things that he's heard right so we can think on these things as the bible says cast down reasonings imaginations the things of the world and think on these things and god will come to you and meet you in that when you do that sure god will absolutely meet you there he loves to be he loves to be present where he's being talked about or thought about and you know to me when you bring back to god what you see that he is if you just if you're listening to a tape and all of a sudden something quickens to you turn off that tape and start to think and more or less you can sit there and preach your own self a sermon you know and sit there and think well this is what i say about god he's that wheel in the middle of the wheel he's that pillar of fire and whatever you part of god that you're seeing unfolded there just start to talk back to god and say well lord i see this and i see and you can even just like i said i'm not a preacher but i'll sit there and preach a sermon in the chicken truck sometimes uh talking about what i see of god and not even realizing that i saw all that until i started to express it overcame by the word the testimony that they held you have to testify we receive the word but if you just hold it all in i don't know how to put it into words if you just hold it all in sometimes i guess it may be it won't quicken as it will if you just start to speak it out what you do see and then sort of the loose ends will start to tie together and you'll see you'll see a little bit more that's what i'm saying so they always thinking on these things and partaking of that tree of life of that source of godly wisdom and so those are some of the things that i've been pondering on okay um i guess we will go to the powerpoint now yeah okay all right sheep stand over here we are sheep ezekiel 34 31 and you my flock the flock of my pasture are men and i am your god saith the lord god in many instances throughout scripture god likens us to sheep we are all like sheep in our nature and are very easily deceived this is a god-given nature intended to make us rely on god as our shepherd that's my own statement okay i don't know how many posts about that but i think god made us that way so that we would be relying on him okay all right that's good you ever heard the statement pulled over your eyes see mankind realizes even christian or not everybody has come to the realization that we are like sheep i mean most people have some realization of that yeah because they use these things the grass is greener on the other side right yes over your eyes feeling sheepish okay that's all i have to say about that there are numerous similarities between sheep and humans the greatest similarity is in their behavior and here we have a man trying to be smart trying to sing look intelligent here we have a gentleman that knows he's a sheep he's content and he knows he has a paper he's not worried about anything he's not trying to be something he's not he's not trying to have his own thought coming he's just a sheep and he knows it just said what he said huh i said but what's he saying he's a sheep he's listening the sheet brain has many similar characteristics to the human brain though we have a much higher level of intelligence we are often deceived easily just to sheep due to our sheepish thinking ability all right the world is falling apart in 1963 0412 morning service the same thing has arrived again and many won't believe people won't believe churches won't believe no wonder you can't be disappointed in it because the bible said they wouldn't do it but if you individuals do this ordained to life look upon the fields now and see what power we're living in come to life let the life that was in christ come in you the mind you said oh i think i think this you ain't got no thought coming right you let the thoughts that was in christ be in you and that's the word that's right thank the thoughts that he thought okay vulnerability sheep are slow and clumsy which makes them vulnerable to predators we too are somewhat vulnerable and defenseless especially from a spiritual perspective we are clumsy and clueless i need a shepherd to guide us into all truth john 16 13 or we will fall prey to our predator of the devil jeremiah 23 will be to the pastors to destroy and scatter the sheep of my pastor saith the lord therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people you have scattered my flock and have driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doing saith the lord and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whether i've driven them i will bring them again to their foes and they shall be fruitful and increase and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be like and say they will behold the days of congress saith the lord that i will raise to david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth behavior sheep have multiple behavior traits similar to that of humans i'm not really implying anything i just found a picture of a man whoever that guy is that resembled that particular picture of that sheep that's why i put that there so i think he's your president yeah he could be gregarious which is a big word for sociable uh sheep are flock animals they tend to congregate close together and actually become stressed if they are separated from their flock they practice the principle of strength in numbers so these guys over here are comfortable they're happy they're in fellowship this gentleman here is very upset he's not smiling he's by himself he's stressed and agitated that's true and he's very vulnerable and that's how we are we separate ourselves from the flaw all right this is a continual reading about four paragraphs the good shepherd of the sheep 570308 we learn a lot of things by sheep if we would just notice them and watch their actions and as a sheep a sheep is a sacrificial m a little innocent fellow and he's totally helpless when he's lost i think that's why jesus likened us on the sheep because they just can't seem to find their way around they have to depend on someone leading them and they cannot lead one another they just won't do it and that goes to show me one thing if we are looking to sheep in god's heritage then we cannot lead one another we are helpless and we've got to depend on the great shepherd of the sheep the lord jesus and i noticed at a slaughterhouse once someone was speaking to me about how they slaughtered the sheep and when they want the sheep to come out of the corral go up to the chute where they like where they kill the sheep the gulp leads them up there they'll follow the goat and this goat will lead them up to the place where the killing takes place and then he would jump over the side and let the little sheep go right on to their death that's the nature of the goat and if a fellow doesn't know a sheep or well it's hard to tell the difference between the bleeding of a goat and of a sheep they're a whole lot of life but the nature of them proves what they are that's the way with confessed christians and real christians the god represents the world that leads you right down the wrong road to your eternal separation from god that leads you into trouble so if we are sheep we better watch what kind of shepherd with god sheep are funny little creatures in one way here's another thing we might learn the sheep tonight when the weather is real hot did you ever see sheep they won't separate themselves and one be at one place than one another but right in the heat of the day the sheep will stand all stand together you know what they're doing they're making shade one for the other they're having fellowship uh wouldn't it be good tonight or wouldn't it be good if all got sheep when the heat was on would stand together when the trials are real hard and that he was on and everything going on everywhere if all those little sheep would just stand together we'd have the coolness of the shape of each other the comfort to lean upon each other now someone said is that necessary brother barron it certainly is there's nothing like having a real good dependable friend that's when the trolls are blazing the heat is on and you go to this friend and sit down and just explain it to them talk it over in personal confidence and then kneel down and pray together and know that this person is a good god-saved man or woman that you can put confidence in oh it's good to do that calm let us reason together save the scripture or come let us stand together and i noticed another thing when i see the sheep in a coal country when and when all the sheep the blizzards comes to break the wind all those little sheep will come from one side of the field to the other and huddle up together it keeps them warm it keeps each other warm the one from each body helps form the other yes and i think when the church gets real cold and indifferent dog sheep ought to kind of huddle up together and pray for each other and the warmth of real good christian fellowship only means so much david spoke of it in the first psalm said blessed be the man that saith not in the seat of this cornfield standeth in the way of the sinners but as the life is in the law of the lord and in the law and his law does he meditate day and night and it should be like a tree that's painted by the river of water and its leaves shall not wither whatsoever to do with it should prosper all right followers sheep tend to follow the leader whether it be a shepherd or another more dominant sheep often they'll follow another sheep even if doing so will result in disaster um on that same line i started to say a man ago that i've dealt with a couple of doctrines and those two that were most prevalent and i talked to one sister that goes to church where they believe those and she said her comment to me was this she said that if we're wrong for believing what we believe and what are you going to do with as you start naming off all the big names in the in the message churches that have 800 people in the congregation and a thousand people or so and what are you going to do with all them because they believe the same thing or they are going to help and i said i didn't say anything you know i mean i didn't say well i said i'm not going to say that they're wrong you know i just i didn't want to argue with her but the point is this uh the bible says straight is the gate and narrows the way it leads to righteousness the few there be the end of their end and broad is the gate that leads to destruction so if i see a lot of people doing something i'll balk at it and i say and that goes in the natural life as well as the spiritual that's right but if i see a lot of people get together doing something i stand back and i say hmm that's right is there something to this because just because everybody's doing it doesn't make it right and there's a lot of catholics that's right okay there are a ton of catholics that's right that doesn't make and led them to their death which is what i was just talking about once i find it it was them and instant bold turkey is that how you say it is turkey first one sheep jumped to his death then stunned turkish shepherds who had left the herd to graves while they had breakfast watched as nearly 1500 others followed each leaping off the same cliff turkish media reported in the end 450 dead animals lay on top of one another in a billowy white pile the ascana newspaper said relax those who jumped later were saved as the pile got higher and the fall more cushion because they're all pushing out so the first 450 or so died and the rest of them that jumped on top of them survived is because of the big pillows they landed on there's nothing we can do they're all wasted and this that anyway there's a huge loss for those families that lost all those sheep because one dominant sheep for whatever reason i don't remember they're chasing a butterfly fell off the edge of the cliff and everybody's followed and that's what will happen if you just go to following another man with his own idea actually exactly but we follow brother dale as he follows christ that's right same thing on brother brown same thing i do with dave ramsey and with these any sources that i draw from that i think are from that i know to be from the tree of life or from god ordained god when i see that when i hold it up to the word of god and it reflects that your thumb and it reflects and it matches like brother bill says matches my new birth experience then i know to follow that it's okay to follow that shepherd you know to protect from that tree that's what i'm saying all right uh wanderers sheep are wonders and they often wander into dangerous situations they usually walk off in search of better food they see that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence so they try to get to it likewise we often wander away from the past the pastor where our shepherd wants us thinking that we'll find something better elsewhere there's the green grass voice recognition she becomes familiar with the voice of their shepherd they learn it over time and can distinguish it from other voices in the same manner we learn the voice of our shepherd and another voice we will not follow john 27 all right the lord is my shepherd i shall not want him he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leaves me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leaves me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake gather i'll walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll feel fear no evil for thou art with me i put in parenthesis thy rod of correction and my staff guidance they comfort me that's what shepherds said to their sheep they correct them and then they got them thou prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies they'll notice my head with all my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life don't swell in the house of the lord forever all right that's the end the class is not dismissed i had another thing this is a video of sheep responding to their shepherd i think it's in here freaking hilarious what do you want where do you want it wow anyone i'm not sure what he says in the rest of the video so that'll be all of that because i can't really make out what he's saying but you get the gist they're responding to the voice of their shepherd so that's just any video i thought that's good and any questions yeah i was thinking that brother brennan was talking about overseas somewhere where shepard was leaving his sheep through and he uh it was a gourmet eating area outside vendors you know and it had all these beautiful vegetables and things and he said they he figured that the sheep would just devastate the area but they just kept following their shepherd walking right past all the delicacies that were sitting out there yeah you just followed him any other comments or questions thank you for showing me who i am yeah i guess that's all is it too early to experience you know but you sit here look at each other for a minute
