========================================

about it later okay that's fine you can hear my voice over just about anything or no comment from anybody else Hebrews 11. now we talked we've been speaking on the Statue of a perfect man and we know that the foundation is fake it's real wide at the bottom so we must get this right before we keep going on that's why it's been 17. little mini sermons on the Statue of a perfect man just to get us to Faith and now we go to the great faith chapter of Hebrews 11 because you've got to have faith we were talking about last week faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you can't even see how many of us saw Jesus died how many of us saw the prophet in person only two there's two people in this whole room that actually solve the prophet alive the rest of us did so to us it's hearsay Kalan is here safe because did you see it no he didn't see it but by the eye of faith I believe that Jesus was walking on the earth I believe he died in Calvary I believe he rose I believe there's an empty tomb and I believe he came back on that Pentecost none of that we can prove by scientific fact or by video can't prove that right so you must have faith and that's the foundation we got to have faith the evidence of Things Not Seen remember God does it then he reveals it then you see it right God does it reveals it to you that it's done and then he makes it manifest through you are through an Evidence of praying for your children or praying for your spouse or praying for your family and then God gives you a revelation like he did Dad he was you know many years ago that I was going to come back to the lord well there was no physical evidence that that was ever going to take place I was out in the world I was doing the things of the world I wasn't coming to church I wasn't claiming nothing right but God showed a man gave him a revelation and then it became manifest well knee see now he can say that his faith has been manifested in what he sees same way with all of us and you can take that not just for your family or not but for any situation anything we must be the greatest Faith Believers in the world even when we can't see it because remember the Bible says and will not get into it today the Bible says that if hope is already seen in other words it's not hope anymore daddy hopes that I was coming back to now he can't stand up and said well I hope he's coming back the evidence is right here the evidence will be seen it says the evidence of Things Not Seen that's beginning of your faith you must believe it before you see it if you see it why do you need faith we have faith for a body change it's laying in the word it's laying in the books and tanks right but do we see it no we're getting older gray-headed which used to be a real black okay now Gray I don't like him though he's thinner than the last time I saw him just a rifle must be not feeding me very well it's just wonderful to see you man it went and got up this morning if I'd have had 10 people to figure out a saying you were one of the fans so yeah but good to see him we had some good times together so but see faith is the substance of things hoped for there's your substance faith brother Ryan said you got to have faith and we got to have faith in this statue of a perfect man that Peter tells us he says add to your faith not God's faith God's got things God is Faith he just believes when he speaks it'll happen and you know what he does right amen you know what brother Brown said about the the evidence of things by saying for the elders obtained a good report now watch what it says it says through the faith we understand that the worlds were framed by just somebody speaking the word because sometimes we have to have a little substance it says the substance of things not seen God didn't have one piece of substance except what he was nobody understand that all we had was him he didn't have a world to take a piece off of and make a on Earth when he said it it appeared all right so you and I are gonna that's the same Faith you and I are going to have to have because Abraham was the father of our faith but my heavens look how many times he stumbled but when Paul writes a commentary of Abraham's life he never mentions that he give his life away twice twice once after the body came so he was still in the flesh but it happened when you get Paul's commentary of what Abraham says Abraham and he says Abraham was strong in faith believing the promise what was Paul doing Paul was looking back through the blood of Jesus Christ and all those were clean amen because man they're they were pretty bad these people were going to read about if you were to read into their commentary of their life pretty rotten people David had his best friend killed committed adultery Abraham went with Hagar Abraham laughed at God he didn't just laugh in his heart the Bible said he got down on his face and laughed at God but you know what though Abraham made it to the end he just believed there was something in Abraham that said okay I don't have the substance with me and as he got older he definitely knew he couldn't perform physically so he knew I believe he got stronger in faith as he went along in his own self whether the worldly things happened to him or not he believed that he was going to have that child and then at the end he said okay God if I'm gonna have it you're gonna have to do it well if he would have said that at first see if we would have said that at first we would add virtue acknowledge tempers because the Bible says add to your face so it's going to be your faith right brother Brown said this is my eye God gave it to me he didn't just say that stuff to Philip tape he said this is my eye God gave it to me now it's mine this is my Holy Ghost it come from God it was God it is God but once he give it to me it's mine right and he expects you expects you to do what that Holy Ghost says because remember you can't grieve it the Bible says you can grieve it brother Graham said he'd go out on a limb yeah it doesn't mean he comes out of you and go some point no once you have the Holy Ghost you got it for life that's your Eternal destination you God can't take it away from you but brother Brown said the Holy Ghost is a gentleman he's very timid so what will he do he will withdraw himself from you in an example listen just this is an example because Saul did not have the Holy Ghost remember nobody in this Old Testament had the Holy Ghost in their soul right because Jesus hadn't died to release the light okay it'll tell you in a minute if we get down to it it says they all having a good report did not receive the promise well what was the promise the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the promise to the believer okay so they didn't have the new birth they had an anointing just like the anointed ones at the end times same example they don't know anyone come down on David David could speak in the first person they pierced my hands and my feet knowing him would leave him he'd go get into bed with a girl and commit adultery that does not happen to a born-again Believer right right so there's your difference okay but it will to an anointed one all right so you take that and you see Abraham and you see the ones that that had an anointing on them now we know that like I said when Paul looks back through the blood of Jesus it cleansed every one of them but he did not give him the Holy Ghost as a possession right the Bible says in John 5. they haven't received the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost wasn't given yet because Jesus hadn't known the word been glorified or died to release that life but they had a promise that they were heading toward but you look at Saul now listen Saul will be there right everybody understand that the Bible said if Samuel made it Saul made it that's right and and if Saul was listed with the prophets but remember what Saul said he said this who wasn't Samuel said the spirit of God has left you or he I think Saul even said himself the spirit of God has left me right right well now it didn't leave him and leave him alone he just couldn't feel that anointing he had grieved that anointing away from him but he was counted with the prophets and when he died he stood there with Samuel Uncle Samuel said tomorrow you'll be with me so wherever Samuel was that's where Saul went right so you see all these things that Saul did and you same thing with you and I we can get the Holy Ghost the baptism of the new birth because the new birth and the Holy Ghost you have to be careful because you can have the Holy Ghost brother bear said right on your spirit Spirit man get in anointing every day of your life just like he did with these in the Old Testament and die and go to hell why because it's not a new birth that's right a new birth is a dying and a new life amen okay see Abraham didn't have a dying and a new life Abraham was Abraham he just had Faith to believe what somebody said that's right it's like a and I'm like that I believe God God couldn't have just picked Abraham and said I'm gonna Abraham's gonna be my man and he's the one that's going to do it that's a respecter person true there's no telling how many people God spoke to and said get up and get out of this country Abraham was the only one they said okay I'll do it I'll get up and leave okay if not then God's will respect your persons but let's read this and and read through this chapter and kind of comment on the people because you're going to have to realize whether you just have a holy ghost anointing or the New Birth because you know what anointing ones at the end time is here right it's in full manifestation we see it now all these people that you know preached 10 or 12 years and then all of a sudden turn the message out say it's wrong say it's false the dude didn't have a new birth I'm sorry it's Rod Bergen and Jeremy Bergen and I'll name them because I don't care they're just filth to me they're just built they're causing people to turn away from this message the greatest thing and they walk in the shadow of it I actually had to walk in the shadow they walked in the light of it but they walked with an anointing right that's right not with that Faith like at the bottom of that pyramid so there's no way they can grow in the stature of God because somewhere along the line and it's happening now somewhere along the line you'll see him manifest who they really are right so we see people like that and and some of these people getting on the Internet you know but they just don't have faith they don't have the new birth that's right because the new birth will attack brother Brown said and we read the quote a couple weeks ago brother Brown said without the new birth you'll fight that's right you'll fight the word and fight the word and fight the word and fight the word see if you're a word finder that means you're a word rejecter right and word projectors go to hell that's what the prophet said in pretty plain and simple amen is that why the scripture says they'll come up falling away first that's correct we shouldn't be so surprised too you shouldn't be so surprised when we see no we should not be surprised but I'm surprised who it come from that's what I'm surprised is who it's come from right I thought maybe it would be those mate Believers which they were made Believers but the ones may be in the congregation but then you got to go back and say the scripture where they come up to Jesus and you know in the in the end and the judgment and they say have I not done Mighty Works cast out Devils that's preachers so you got to get into the preacher range because if the devil can get the preacher he's got you if the devil can get bad he's got every one of us because we can't go no higher than the pastor right so he's he's a Target I'm a Target all ministers are targets because if he can get them see if Rod Bergen was just a lay member in brother biscal's church if he was just somebody came to church and worked and didn't say much and was kind of unassuming he wouldn't have the power he has to get on the internet and say what he does why because he walks so close Judas walked so close until even the other 11 when he did what he did the other 11 had no clue what he was doing right that's right someone I questioned this but that someone said blessed is the man that walketh not in the counselors beyond God now they're Hypocrites a few weeks ago we were standing in the way of Sinners that's obvious you're a citizen in the sea of the scornful now who would that be today is that what you're talking about well that's what they're doing are they they're they're they're they're they're saying the message is not right they're saying brother Branham this and that and the other listen there's one thing for sure the Holy Ghost will not do that the Holy Ghost will not turn down the word now to hold it now you listen this is where we're gonna still stay on faith but we're still going to be on the new birth because faith is the new birth all right there's times when you cannot understand that's why you need virtue and all this tempers patient you get all that but like I said last week and I I hope you got the analogy the Holy Ghost is like a is like a uh capsule that you take for a pill right right what's inside that capsule will do you good but it won't do you any good if it doesn't get outside that capsules right and that's the same way this is the capsule everybody understand what I'm saying there's powder inside that pill you can take it apart and look in it you know it's got the good stuff but it's encapsulated are enclosed by glycerin right and then when that gets in your stomach and warms up it dissolves and it lets the good stuff out same way with God when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the New Birth you get all the goods right right you get all the goods you need brother I'm saying you need to get everything you need for the journey but remember let's go back to where brother man preach doors and doors he said even when you let God in your house right he said there's a door here of Pride there's a door here Prejudice there's a door here he named a lot of doors well you know what God's Not Gonna remember he's a gentleman he's timid if you say God don't go in that door he'll fail that's right he said but you will not get the blessings of me cleaning that door of me cleaning that room out you're not gonna get the blessings of that that's going to be your dirty laundry for the rest of the time if you're going to keep that right right that's why the baptism of the Holy Ghost is so ill-taught and Ill understood you've got to you can have problems in your life come on baby we can have we have and then we look you know girls say well that that brother and sister they're they're having trouble they must not be born again no they're just human right they're humans that's the capsule you're looking at that's right but see it then you see the manifestation is if they quit coming to church if they get it you know separate get a divorce and if they keep doing those things that are not right you can say hey they never got a birth but not at first that's why you got to have patience that's why all this patience is there you just gotta let it out patience is the Holy Ghost is patience but see remember what I said about this is the way I say it not changing the word of God but I believe reading between the lines the Bible says add to your faith all right let's change that add to what you believe right because it's just what you believe based on an individual affair with God it's what you believe add to what you believe virtue add to what you believe knowledge because you'll only have as much knowledge as you believe the people in the Dark Ages all they had was just enough to get enough light to know that Jesus died for their sins and to know that there was a message brought by colomba probably didn't hear him in person because remember the messenger always comes at the end of the age and then brings it and there's a 1500 year age there in Columbus time so you know they didn't hear him physically speaking but they believe what he said they died they're waiting on us but they have the new birth just like you do right there's not different levels of the new birth now there's different levels of this stature of a perfect man that we here on the Earth it's not just that you get the baptism on the Holy Ghost and then you go on vacation you know you get the baptism on the Holy Ghost and you start your job and you don't get a vacation because Satan don't believe in vacation he's there at church when you're not all right so we're not going to get through this Hebrews 11 3. through the faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear in other words derp pottery are aluminum metal rubber car see that's what we do we take things that's already done well see that's easy that's not faith right that's just human knowledge to put things together you and I today have to have faith in something that we absolutely can't hold in our hand s sure we can hold it in our hand but do we believe what's in it right do we believe what's in it is for you not for somebody else for you okay so I say many times all those people in the Old Testament the Bible says we're giving for example so take their name out and put your name in in the journeys of Life take your name out take David's name out and stick your name in take Solomon's name out and stick your name in those things that we're talking about in The Book of Proverbs because he's talking about my son he's talking about his walk in life he talks about his daddy David we'll put that in there for yourself because this the Bible's talking to you if not it's a history book just a good old history book that we read about George Washington and Abraham Lincoln but this is somebody that George Washington Abraham Lincoln can't come back inside of you and make you act like George Washington Abraham Lincoln right but the man that wrote this can actually come back into you and make you this amen only that's the only man that can ever do that that's Jesus Christ or the Christ right which do appear for by faith comes that stinking security thing again by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain in other words he lived a greater sacrificial life than Cain right coach Kane brother around you um you go back and you listen to what brother said about Cain Kane was not a bad person Kane was very religious Cain was not one that didn't go to church he probably went to church more than able to church as far as they had Church which was alter worship right so Cain and Abel were equal when it come to that but he offered a more excellent sacrifice than came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts rough day there's the gifts that God gave us right there add to your faith virtue and your virtue knowledge and all these tempers those are gifts and by it he ain't being dead yet speaketh remember said the blood speaks out of the Earth by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation not after before his translation we're not going to live for God afterwards we'll be gone afterwards we got to be like God before amen and there's the good report but before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is what God must believe that he's God that's why that the one God Doctrine had to be brought back into the church because which one are you going to believe the Father the Son of the Holy Ghost which one are you going to believe in because that's what they're doing a denominational world you know all they believe on Jesus who speaks to God for us and you know they're just as Catholic as Catholic is you know they believe in three persons of the godhead and all this stuff that's why brother Branham had to come back that's why a prophetic Prophet had to come break the word back down for us put it back to where it was supposed to be what it's irukable built the foundation right brother Brown had to come and put that Foundation back together sweep it off get it ready because there's no way brother Isaac there's no way that that you could have attained what Peter said in the first age because it had been eaten and corroded so much so God was still working God was still working in the people but there was no way to put that stature of a person I mean who in the world would even even Peter I was telling him the other day uh Elijah that Peter didn't do that Peter didn't make a chart and show what we needed Peter just said once you get this you need to add this once you get this you need to add this once you get this you need to add this but then we had a profit come in right put it in the word that it was a mountain a pyramid Mountain and showed where the Capstone was because remember the Cornerstone had been rejected which was The Headstone really which is Christ it had been took off and what down Through the Ages there's no way man could get to that that's right why because the denominational weeds and Creeds had grown up through it still there was wheat in there had a lot of Tears so we had to come to the end time to where you took a profit and see I can understand this and then when you look at people that that Caleb as an example of the end time believer Caleb had nothing he had no inheritance of any part of the land and I believe Joshua just looked at him and said hey man you've been with me this whole time what do you want well first thing Caleb said was he said I've been eyeing that mountain right over there I don't like that mountain man yeah I like that mountain but you know what he done he didn't just walk over there and say I'm Caleb get off my mountain did he the Bible said he fought for the ice and high bites and Levites and not the Levites but the High bikes and the JB Sykes and and the website my brother Kendry Diggs said he said you fight all these ice he said now we're fighting the website so and that's a good that's a good analogy but that's what Caleb was doing he went up there and he fought think about Caleb Kayla went with Joshua helped them fight all that stuffing Kanan get them out and then he comes up and says I'm just as strong today as I was 40 years ago which made him 80. and he had that 80 years old he had to go over there and get that he had to go fight him back off of that mountain but you know what he did he did that's the that's the Journey of the believer he did what he said he was going to do his heart's desire was to have that mountain if your hearts desire is to have this mountain God will give you that mouth you can have it those removable that great Mountain all right so you look at mountains then the Bible and then you see a a Prophet come up and he said the city the city is a pyramid shape amen Mountain see a pyramid-shaped mountain with all the Believers inside that City and it'd be a steady incline man just explained it well hey you know what he had to bring that straight from the mind of God because nobody else knew that that's right so whether brother Brown a missed a date I don't believe he did I don't believe he was wrong if he was wrong God corrected him you and I are not supposed to all right so I don't correct the prophet I wasn't sitting here to correct him brother Brown said wrestling Faith lives in those books and tapes so I have to go in them not on them he didn't say Rapture and faith lies on them he said it lies in them so it's got to be a revelation own it it'll kill you own it it'll kill you in it you'll find what you need all right so by faith Noah no but without faith is impossible to please him you say well I don't have faith for this I'm faithful that you have faith in the word like I said many times for my children for my daughter all the ones the journey means nothing that's right God said I could have my kids so there's my daughter sitting right there next seat him had to believe Abraham said God you said I was going to have a baby no you take care of it because you can't save your children you can't say it there's no man ever saved another man except Jesus Christ that's right no man there's no man can save you except one that's the Lord Jesus all right so you got to have that kind of faith for he that cometh to God cometh ongoing no just one time coming because God must believe that he is what is he is he's a great I am he is and that he is a rewarder there's your reward right there of him that diligently remember we were talking about diligent and dilatory totally different dilatory is lazy shiftless doesn't do much but diligent is somebody that gets up and goes to work every day and works all the time and does what he's supposed to do same way with a Christian we must be diligent to seek him all right by faith Noah being warned of God of things not as not seen as yet now Noah what was Noah doing he's like God it ain't raining to drop since I've been alive and I'm 600 years old 600 years and you say you're going to flood this whole world water where's it going to come from I I don't believe he questioned that I believe he just said God you said it we're going to do it all right let's go we'll start at verse seven next Sunday Lord with us thank you thank you foreign
