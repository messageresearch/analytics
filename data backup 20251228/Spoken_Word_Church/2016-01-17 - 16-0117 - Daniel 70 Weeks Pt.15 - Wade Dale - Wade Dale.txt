========================================

we are speaking on the stick full purpose now which commands the key to the whole thing if you'll pay attention to the six volt purpose it will tell you need to live a little bit this way yeah cuz we watch get out of that you can see other Harry I made this straight down the middle of what you do this and you just call what we want to see all the way no boy no I'm good okay all right here we go go go go refer to this but everybody's you can read that on your own all right Zakaria 13 no last Sunday and everybody needs to get the chart so you can look at it jahmene according to the Prophet message and according to the Bible hmm ok thank you use for a notepad or watch oh that's right two of you weren't my friend ro students were going ok I don't think listen that Sunday out there we go and Luis's gonna be doing sons good for us so what was that last Sunday we took this chart now for those of you that have not been here or had been here a while according to the prophets message and according to the Bible we see that there is one week left after the rapture of the church one week of time to fulfill scripture to fulfill all of the 490 years promised and Israel's Redemption okay now want us to get something in our mind today now your new birth happened sometime in a day right okay so let's don't get stuck when it says here's will be born again in today okay like I said before I don't think the whole thing 44,000 is going together in an arena they're going to preach one message to them and they're all going to receive the Holy Ghost at the same time and you'll hear brother branham say that they'll all receive the Holy go okay and the Israel the Bible says it will be born in a day we'll see to me when Israel begins to come back to God in 144 thousand August born again then Israel be morning in them today ya got that you did you know we're trying to repeat that woman what will happen is when you say Israel be born in a day so I don't think that Israel I don't think the two prophets are going to prophesy it takes me why would why would God give him 1260 days if if he only did it one day we got it same way the you know that my point is I seen by there this morning the point is is your new birth was a journey up to that birth right and it's a journey after that burden because we're Gentile all right all right but now what God is going to do is we're going to see this when we talk about the 70th week that God is not worried at all about anything but you and I sometimes we get hung up in all this right here that's leading up to even this rule didn't receive it at Calvary we didn't receive it at cow bring right right it took 40 50 days after the death of Jesus and he comes back on a dead planet cost of here in about 80 30 same thing and then the church started the Holy Ghost fell in the believers not only into believers 120 any upper rib okay right but it was the process they had to be preached to for three and a half years or they received the baptism the Holy go okay everybody got that so it's a process 1260 days we're going to read in the Book of Revelations in the minute I think what we do is maybe we'll read that one first the lesson hang on just a second but we've already proven by the Bible by the prophets message and by the calendar that 483 years is already finished in the redemption of Israel in the city but the city was tore down and they didn't receive him in Calgary so it must be applied over somewhere else the by all right with that but going we read it before where the wild olive branch would be grafted in which was the Gentiles because remember the Holy Ghost the the first church age 120 were to the Holy Ghost true the dead following God's people seek jesus said I come to my own see he come to the house of Israel but they didn't receive him but the 120 did so the 120 got the Holy Ghost right here on the day of Pentecost and then though Paul says what I turned out to the Gentiles okay Peter open the door but pita Paul's one that went in and nurtured the Gentiles in other words Tata all right so you got a Gentile age right here that's going to come down here to Revelation 41 remember looking your Bible revelations three two and three is your church agent right revelations 2 and 3 tells you about all these church ages okay all right Joe revelations 2 3 is your age is a Gentile age but in Revelations for 1 John says I saw a door open in heaven and I was caught up yep all right now the property guy said that was that was top of the rapture John was caught up and then then the bride the bride is no more sin until revelation 19 20 once when she rides back let's read that let's do that now stop and just make put it in script just give me a second so may remember lecture I 13 always did the way you could pin this would get later revelation for let's read it first this is John after this what after what after these church ages after this he wrote revelations 2 and 3 saw the church age has come saw the last church age be the worst and then revelations for one he says after this I looked at me older doors open in heaven the first voice which I heard with as it were of a trumpet trumpet of the Lord Himself time shall be no more the trumpet talking with me which he said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be here after all right God's turning to the Jews now remember spiritually we replied in Revelations 4 12 19 but for revelations 41 revelations 19 is to the redemption of Israel what the property God said right right that's weird Ashley that's Israel's time right right all these things that are going to happen are going to happen from 4 12 19 21 you see why what about revelation 5 everybody since finds redemption the whole Bible wrapped up in Revelation 5 is showing what John was caught up to see heavenly things to me what I glass see it is we i explained his revelations for one if you read it it's setting a stage to show what's fixing to happen one sitting on a throne one god round about the throne with a crystal your lake and all the things you see right here he just settled with Jasper sardine stone round about the throne four and twenty elders the who's four and twenty elders the twelve patriarchs from the white Old Testament and the twelve apostles on the New Testament which we're all to use hmm they're all Cheers global input going well but so there they are all right clothing la crema so this has to be then John was caught up and showed both ways remember properly when a profit goes up he can see both ways he can see it for one waiting to see another all right John is the Eagle right the type of the Eagle top of the bride brother Ryan was top of the ego because he could go up higher than the rest and look all for direction Johnny's looking back in time and he's looking forward in time because remember revelations 5 didn't happen in time and having an eternity the book was written before the foundation of the world when he took that lamb was slain before the foundation or all right redemption is not in heaven redemptions on earth but the culmination of redemption is what we were here come down to here we go back to here now not this chart remember we were we were up here with Adam fall down here we gotta walk go right back to this and put it all back together again I so you see how damn 70 weeks is not just days and times and seasons are putting this here and putting this here but yet if you can put it here in a Jewish time then that's just wonderful it makes you see it a lot better right a revelation for one revelation 19 21 you said what r up one by revelation of ten seven we're going to read in Daniel there is a mighty angel that comes down Michael he fights for Israel okay so you put all these things together then he comes to revelations 10-7 says but in the days of the voice what John's doing he's interpolating he's seen what's happening and he's going how is this going to happen he goes back to Revelation 3 knows it aligns it's coming al I just got a return remember John John knows the old testament to remember there is no new testament he's writing in it so he looks back the old testament seasons the malachite has to come but in the days of the voice of Elijah in other words these mysteries will be known and you'll be able to understand revelations 41 relations 19mm because there's a lot of strange things that goes on in there that man never knew anything about man never knew how to place these things that's my brother Dale said they told stay out of Revelations you kind of understand revelations 1 2 & 3 that's to church ages but what when you get for one he's up he's here he's redemption door this way and reductions over in Revelations files anything but we got to put them together it's like a puzzle take piece here piece here a piece here and put them together and it makes a beautiful picture so revelations 41 revelations 1921 it is going to happen because watch what brother Brown says in your book he says the woman in the Sun the red dragon testing out the red dragon teen a vile plagues the seals all happen between 41 and 19 21 and they're going to happen in this 70th week 90 94 7 okay but you gotta have something leading up to it because God's already said that 70 years determined so there's going to be four hundred ninety years of this redemption process just like there was there was a 38 year process of me to be morning in 38 of your process okay same way with you whatever day is born again there was a put your put your time in there that was a process from that time you said no i was living in saying i didn't care yeah you didn't but there was somebody yeah he knew where he is gonna come to remember believers get angels when they're born they don't mean believers are believers when they're born that means believers get an angel when they're born because that angel and God the only two people that know what you're going to do you don't not staying about that today yes this morning free moral agency you're still a freeman related I don't care for your morning it or not you're still free my lady but an ultra not free moral agent though I was just thinking from conception to the day of your birth that's why they're born in a day well the preparation coordinate for me before noon that's correct that's a good that's a good analogy and good process you see that from conception of the baby that's nine months until live birth comes in a day you were born in a day yes okay so when you say here's was born today that doesn't mean all 144,000 is going to gather together they gonna preach one sermon and they all will get born again I don't see that because what in the world else are they gonna do for 1250 nine days what I'm saying is what's going to happen it's just like it happens now they're going to start preaching right here and then going to say and I don't understand it I ain't going to hear no more i'm done i'm going away i'm coming back i enjoy what he's saying i don't enjoy what they're saying i don't care what they're saying what people do now same thing so this is going to take 1260 days for them to gather those people together maybe not in one place but in 1921 court okay to receive the Holy go in a day their day because remember I always I always think the Lord for the day I said lord thank you for the day I don't mean the 24-hour day you know they don't mean 24-hour day cuz we're not living in an hour or so we're not living in 24-hour day don't think living in 24-hour days this this thing right hand what you're saying okay you're you're sold already sitting in heavenly places we just got to understand that alright so now where we have revelation for so we go through revelation 4 5 6 7 on down through there and we see the death to the Jews you see what about the sealed the Celtic to the Jews rage the steelbook brother ramshead the stake sale are these to profit but we're going when these two prophets our own insane remember we get the spiritual aspect of it we get the spiritual breaking of the seal remember Jesus preached six seals back 2,000 years ago and he was number seven plays a lot of those with this but let's focus on this one week and put it in the Bible okay so what's going to happen if while we're in Revelations let's go to Revelation 7 get thick sticky honey now some revelation 7 verse 4 and I heard the number of them which were sealed with how many 144,000 that's all that's going to be sealing to give the old blood drive got it all right so we know for a fact that two profits are going to preface out and 144,000 is going to come in now let's go to revelations 12 because remember we're leaving out a lot about the revelation living right does giving me a reed like unto a ride the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God the author of them that worship therein but the core which is without the temple leave out and measure it Nava is given to the Gentile be we got to come in somewhere and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty two months how much is 42 months three and a half years count it up 12 times three is 36 plus 6 it's 42 months of 30-day months not 31 and 32 and 19 and 29 and all that you know we got to leave here this year got an extra day remember this put it under your tab every presidential election year is a leap year happens that way all the time it's like Christmas come on the twenty-fifth to come December hometown but if you will know when we leave yours coming out just look at your election year the election year is your leap year all right give the politicians one more date a lot yes and that dish one on the Internet I hear black helicopters yeah I'm a politician now see y'all acting like careful I'm a small one I'm a constable I'm a commission all right verse 3 captain I'm a councilman I'm I work I work for the city of gilfer and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days now what is three school or we've been through three scoring in 16 3 times 2 3 score three times two is six sixty so one thousand two are six today I probably want to go written right here ok got it Rover I think 260 days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of the mouth and divide up the enemy and if any man will hurt them he must excuse me being this mayor of kill these have power to shut heaven this one brother I'm thoughts about them being part of that sixth seal they can open it in town they can control nature now these two prophets are not just remember they're going to Israel it's not Gentile no James I will be saved once they start there once once we gonna wrap sure there's no Gentile saved after this point right here now you got to go way over to the white throne judgment before any Gentiles ever be saving in got it yeah that's way I see it because they don't because the dead and living not maybe even guys stayed there for that whole thousand years all right okay if you're not born again if you're not in Christ dead in Christ we're dead in Christ now because we're dead in Christ now we're just going to rise because we're dead in Christ now we're not like they said don't know there's no dead people in Christ it's the dead in Christ we died when we got in your birth we die so we're dead here already all right so we're just going to raise because of what the death here all right then you're sleeping right now they these have power to shut heaven that it rain down the days of the prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will all right so there's your tribulation cuz I don't know that I can't I don't have anything to base this on but I don't think they're just going to call just own the little city of it of Jerusalem the whole earth yeah the sixth seal opens it takes control the nature of the whole earth not just in the city of Jerusalem you understand what I'm saying sometimes we're narrow-minded and really we are we're so narrow-minded we said well that's just to the Jews it is but they can't look it doesn't give a stipulation smite the one earth not Jerusalem not my city is smite the earth with all plagues so they can fire a play golf anymore they want to okay don't make these two guys mad course we won't be around to see it but that's okay and when they shall have finished their testimony now look they got a promise I 1260 days right what the Bible says they must prophesied 1260 days and when they shall have finished their testimony in other words when they've got all that 144,000 born again by the preaching of their message the Beast that ascends us out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them now that's when the Beast breaks his covenant in the midst of the week hey where'd you get that and your land owner Daniel 9 now I'm going to just turn to it now routine Daniel 9 says and he we established verse 27 Daniel 9 says and he is the Antichrist because God doesn't make a covenant and then break it alright and that's a little age and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week he's going to make a seven-year deal with Israel and in my words let me tell you what's going to happen he's going to give them back the menorah he's gonna give them back the Holy of Holies he's gonna give them all their parts that they need to start temple worship again cuz they know they gotta get temple worship here and they know light has got to come back before the Messiah out but there no they're not gonna see that my side when I do this means Jesus is not going to be standing on the earth alright but watch what taken just a minute and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week what's the middle of 73 and a half so after 1260 days that's why I'm saying people I don't care what the balcon I don't care what ppl the message say let me put it this way I don't care what brother Brown says if he's wrong but he's not he's saying what the Bible says he has to be a word prophet man you see I'm trying McDonald left it man 40 years in the message and he leaves because he didn't see a brown bear getting killed or 16 people fall off a bridge or our brother Brown being wrong and all these doctors I honestly do not care if 16 people fell off a bridge and I want to be real honest with that I really back to me they ain't got nothing to do with the revelation that brother random brought from God to give to us for our revelation and for our purpose to get us out of here that has nothing to do a show well if it's false prophet you prove that that's something he saw as a vision when he was young that's correct but they found there's no documentation that ever happened there's documentation that one person fell off that bridge and died now listen people back in the nineteen hundred there was no OSHA there was no safety regulations and if you'll remember the lawyer or whoever that was to give the testimony said the men fell off the bridge but they fell down in the concrete and they died in the concrete and there's no way they're gonna dig them out they just said sayonara we love you bless your heart and all that stuff and filled it all the way on up so yeah that's what I mean you know they're picking it something they don't see the essence of the different man leaves a message in 40 after 40 years of preaching the message and Sam brother Brown said that's what I want to call him I got so mad when he was preaching that he kept saying the profit if he don't think he's a profit stop calling him one if you don't believe this message stop stop saying the message saved of Mac the Prophet you stop playing it just stopped tear it up throw it away don't just start preaching about our something I that they test for everybody sign at the time or something I change that yeah watch what I believe Sam Sam Sam a blade of time anyway so let's get my mouth my sofa and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week because loved it Daniel 7 two weeks is a very big controversy in the message very big huge and that's why a lot of people when they leave the message they say that's the second thing they say first is the cloud vision and second is brother branham was so wrong in day and seventy weeks that they don't even you know to them that was just a wasted three sermons again but yes I'm sorry it'd be nice to see because I still would like to see what it is that they say that how they explain Daniel 17 weeks and maybe after week well there is i am going to because they explained just by quote right they do not explained by the Bible that was one brother got so confused trying to explain it till he grilled he drew his own chart he put scriptures in that me and Claude looked at each other and we were like 12 world's anti-gay I mean skype in the message 40 years to and he what he did what you do though is is when you destroy somebody's doctrine you destroyed what he's built his cell phone and you can't take it if you ain't got if you're not right here at Bradley kindness you can't take it so you latch out and that's what he did he blindly lashed out didn't hit it in the church here physically but he tried to do it later on in this in his own church and drawing his own charts which is not even nothing close to what we proven that these states are right he never even took any of this he was just proving their brother brown said there's only three and a half years left after the rapture and there is a twelve hundred and sixty that he simply two prophets ministries like I said much time okay all right look at that Messiah week that's right that's what they miss they missed the Son of Man ministry week three and a half here mmm three and a half here that's that week they don't see they don't see this mystery of this 3000 three and a half right here so did Jesus prophesied the first half but he's coming back to the Jews who prophesied last night but what they're saying is they're saying this three and a half years is already by going in there's only this talk left 460 days there's only that nine out of ten the people who messaged believe that's all this time is left but we're going to prove by the libel we're getting today and by the prophets message and by the moon the Jewish calendar that you in 1260 days ends and that and where we were at right here revelation 11 well there's 12 13 14 15 because after 1260 days watch when they finish their testimony the Beast of Senator Obama's pitch shall make war against them show overcoming any children so their dead in the midst of the week when he's going to do he's going to make a real nice covenant with you the Jews the Antichrist the Pope he's going to give them this stuff and they're going to start temple worship but these two prophets are going to come on the sand say look temple worship went out back here the one you crucified yeah the one you crucified is the true Lamb that y'all are missing so what's going to happen to the regular jeans they're going to get real lab because they waste they've wasted to their to their point they wasted two thousand years you'll see once this temple was destroyed never been rebuilt never been rebuilt back that's why the Jews do all this time they're trying to they had to get back to the homeland we all look at some things about 19 16 about the the six-day war wait things c67 wait name is six table or 19 seats it's my favorite six-day war we'll see something a little bit but it all connects with them coming back goes really if you look on your charge brother rebel dream he's an easy feeling a little flap over up there because god I can't start dealing with them because this church age is going to end when we go on the rapture but in 1947 they became a nation that's when God started dealing with them bringing them back okay all right there my okay with it so far I'm training your brain okay all right 1260 days now what's going to happen he's going to give them all their material and they're gonna start doing animal sacrifices trying to get them aside back that's their whole point they missed him over here so that they know the massage coming to Israel he told him in the Old Testament come all right many many times he told him I'm coming to you you're my beloved you're my one right all right and they know that the Gentiles are going to come in but they can't lay it out like the prophet of God laid it out forth so head during this time the two properties are come on the scene what they're going to do they're going to preach that you miss them aside you've already crucified him preach basically the same sermon Peter did on the bed penticoff you who in Jerusalem have killed by this man you call Jesus you've killed both Lord and Christ you killed it all right and then 144,000 is going to start coming out but then other old Jews this is now its temple worship he's not come yet see that's where the fighting is going to be I believe that the their friends their Jewish counterparts are going to kill them because they're all going to be killed I'm forty four thousand plus the two prophets you're going to be killed well who's not a Gentile don't care and this time the Gentile was just trying to survive there you're going through the tribulation period they're just trying to survive they really don't care what's going on in Israel okay but Israel does but these two prophets preached Jesus so much to them until they I will read it in just in a min Tanaka right when they shall I finish their testimony the Beast of the Senate I Obama's pitch you'll make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them so other one in other words if that's true then the 70 weeks tops right here here's my point look what look now that finishes the transgression of Israel that ends their sin and reconciles their iniquity but their six things has got to go on before that 70th week is over how are you going to do it once they're gone I mean they're going to take a rack from their goal you got to bring in everlasting righteousness fill up the vision and prompted enter North the most holy all right so I finally brother Brown said seven times in the den 70 weeks book on the last book he said there's one week left after the rapture there is one week of work of earthly time because what happens right here and we're going to we're going to nail this thing down on our feast days all right cuz we're gonna read it somethin bout a feast in just a few minutes I doubt it but we'll try and their dead bodies shall weigh on the street of the great city which spiritually called Sodom and Egypt where Lord of two spots with Jerusalem mm-hmm they are the people candid and tonga nations shall see their dead body that's where like I said CNN and Fox News they go all show cuz hey look if he if them to them to people are going to be the two most hated people you think Osama bin Laden take the whole world's going to hate these two guns and they gonna love seeing laying in the street okay okay and they'd go phone the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry chefs in gifts one to another because the east two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth not just Jerusalem through the whole earth and after three days and a half left kind of three and a half days types of three and a half years they creak all right the spirit of life from God entered into them and what about seeing in going after three and a half days they go look pretty rough really yeah I mean they go either get shot up or pull through the streets or you know how many people are going to do when they killed somebody and they don't be bloated and just be honest but look what's going to happen is the spirit of life from God entered them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them we saw them and they heard a great sports from heaven saying them coming Tennessee that's their actress all right and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud their enemies beheld them all right remember then I all heck breaks loose after all this time okay everybody got that so we're right here now that came into seventy weeks of Daniel where you got to cook the Bible off right there okay let's just be calm how common sense then you cut them that's why real Brown had to say it as one week left down to the rector because biblically there was one week left after the rapture one week of earthly time that's left after the rector you can see what in the whole world would be against funny just now I notice it because the state of what they can bring on your chart what they say gent also hate you pinned I'll go hate them because what happened is is somebody will be messing with them and they'll just call fire down over on in Russia and it'll just blow up you know or burn 10,000 people well don't you think they gonna be ill when you don't see them use no weapons of war you know bombs and all my stuff they're just calling it out of their mouth and nature it's doing it that's why they control nature on that stick sealed that's why I'm due over 60 revealed to you is it it's a total disruption of this nature your nature that's why we get the spiritual part then it goes to the natural quarter okay all right don't you think that sexy if that's what this is come on two three four five six seven all these right here but you started faith add to your faith 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 cm you put the seals right in these will try to do it maybe one day later but six seals finishes our Redemption because right this is the total disruption to your nature because you were born contrary to God on every one of these these are not human virtues these are not these are your human virtues with God putting his virtue not remember where I preach them on virtue faith yes okay you gotta you gotta have you everything's out of your faith knowledge faith temperance faith patients faith and all these all this faith that's what we have to have to get us out of here here so it's a true revelation of the seal or the seal opening will come during this time but it can't happen in just 1260 days now that's just common sense you're not just bible reading simple bible reading there's more time way up after the 1260 day yes all right now you won't go somewhere else let's go to Zach right I had it up here for one year end route 13 all right Zach around 13 ground right at the end of the Bible run 13 and watch this and that day that should be a fountain open to the house of David into the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and uncleanness now watch this what's all this we're going to read it he shall come to pass in that day see then be born in a day that day they shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirits to pass out look I will end it shall come to pass that when he any show you prophesied then his father his mother that we got him to send to him thou shall not live for thou speaketh lies in the name of the Lord there's always been fault right and his father and his mother they've got him so trust thrust him through when he prophesied of these Falls and came to pass in that day and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed everyone of this vision when you have prophesied neither shall they wear a rough garment to the sea now I understand that but you know one thing's for sure when them to prophets raise up there's going to be fault there's going to be some imitations come out always happen brother Graham comes on saying everybody won't lay hands on sitting don't look okay but he shall say I have no profit island husbandmen for man called me to keep cow for me you look burst sex and once you're saying to him what are these wounds in that hand where was Jesus wounded in hands and feet where are they what are these wounds in thine hands then he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends a Waco sword against my shepherd against the man that is my fellow said to Lord of Hosts smite the Shepherd and the Sheep just scattered when Jesus was smitten the Calgary the Sheep scared they've been scattered ever since you should know it no they've been scattered the ones he's talking about right zacharias talking to Israel guy gathering backup right 1947 start gathering backup man and the Sheep shall be scattered how will turn my hand upon the white little ones who was the little one in the Bible Benjamin Benjamin was the baby remember Joseph and Benjamin were the only two that were that were brothers by Rachel all right Rachel great by Rachel so you got Joseph top across right when they come up to and he was always asking about Benjamin Reverend Joseph every time they come he said where's Benjamin
