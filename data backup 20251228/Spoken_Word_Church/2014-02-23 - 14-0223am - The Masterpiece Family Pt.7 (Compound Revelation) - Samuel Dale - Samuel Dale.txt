ministering and remember the little bride around the world because it's your promise we are we love your promises because they're yay and amen forgive our sins and cleanse us and guide us from all unrighteousness and let your love be with us in jesus name amen isaiah 53 we start with verse one through four it says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed but ron said if you believe the report dismayed he said then the word of god has been revealed all right for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor commonness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we did and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our greece and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him smith stricken smitten of god and afflicted all right colossians 2 begin reading about verse 6. as we as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy or divine deceit after the traditions of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him now watch that scripture and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power you may be seated lord at his blessing your brother gary will come he has a little testimony he wanted to give and we'll most of you know that they've told me i've had a bad heart from birth it was born defective and not to give you a medical lesson but just to give you some understanding your heart has two bottom chambers in it the left and right ventricle and the jobs of these chambers one of the ventricles is very heavily muscled it's very thick and it pumps blood to the aorta which feeds the entire body so it's a thick muscle chamber to do that the other ventricle is a thin muscle chamber and it's thin muscle because it just pumps blood to the lungs which is a very short trip well the way my heart was made from birth my thick muscle chamber was pumping to the lungs my thin muscle chamber is pumping to the aorta and one of the problems with this is it creates a very high pressure in the pulmonary arteries there and it's something that they're very concerned about and they've watched for years and historically my pressure and it's wears out valves and that creates problems but has been very high and they've watched it over the years through thin weight up weight so body weight hasn't affected it and when uh this week i had gone to have a echocardiogram which i have every couple of years and i told brother dale my wife and brother richard wilson before this i said you know this can't stay it's got to go somewhere why not start now amen well brother brother dale came out wednesday and if y'all remember he said you know you say there's nothing going on among us he said you're the problem and this was you know i was thinking all about this but i went and had the uh the test done and they told me that don't understand it but this pressure has usually been at a hundred which they said was extremely high now man has not been able to do one thing about this they told me said you know uh basically uh you have crested the best part of life and you're on the banana peel side headed towards the brick walls what they told me at emory well my pressure has gone from 100 to 45 which is less than half now that had to be a divine touch from god amen god has touched me many times but the reason that i wanted to to tell the church about this and i don't feel this way every time god heals me but i had an overwhelming sense was this was not just something that god had done to me this is something that god had done among us and the message is he's still god he's still the healer and he is doing things for us and i'm just looking now this is started just let the rest of it fall so i'm very very thankful to god amen i believe it don't you i believe it amen because god is still the healer he's the deliverer he's all in all thank god for medicine we believe in it we go to doctors we do what they can do for us but then we know too that they can't heal us so we don't have to worry about it we just put it all into his hands and and you know make it all to be for his honor and glory and then he'll make things manifest for us right amen so now what we've been trying to do is speaking to uh i told you i was going to take many different avenues in the message of what brother branham had covered our ways or whatever you want to call them i don't have the education to understand it but just the point of what i'm trying to say that i've i've tried in many ways to bring uh to you and i the understanding of that god is real and he's manifesting himself and he's working through his little bride in the end time to bring her to a place that you know uh see we are supposed to be in his stead not instead of now that's that's a different thing that's when you go into that you go into catholicism but we're supposed to be in his stead upon the earth all right and in doing that then we we've tried to make a lot of strong points toward the end time and we'll to keep trying to do today to make more toward that to get us to see what god says about us all right and then see what he says about us uh we we don't have no right to say anything other than that right because that's that's what he's saying and what i've tried to get us to see ever since i've been speaking for the lord over 40 something years is to see one thing god is trying his best to get you and i to realize who we are all right because in doing that then when we recognize who we are take our stand on that point and believe it then he can move on the scene to make manifest the things that he desires and that's the way it's been in every age that's where it's been in all the times uh you know it really was god waiting in the days of moses until moses got the people to believe him well it didn't work too good the first time but sure enough he had to leave and go on and come back but finally the people begin to believe what he was saying you know he was the deliverer the first time but he couldn't do it because he couldn't get them you know they well you're going to kill us like you did them others you know they they thought it was my force that was going to do it when it wasn't that it was going to be god and his way of doing things you know and that's that's what we we've been our best trying to get us to see but i've now do more this afternoon on it probably but i've driven hard on uh you and i to recognize who we are all right and uh see nobody's ever amounted to anything in bible in the bible until they realize who they were moses knew from his mother right that he was to be the deliverer all right but he couldn't do it i mean he just couldn't do it see we can take what people say and we can know a lot of things by reading the bible and believing it that way and that's wonderful but yet see when we begin to realize what the bible is saying about us not about somebody else not about another age or a time or a people or something to come remember what the prophet said the greatest problem was looking forward to something to come looking back to see what had been and not recognizing what's taking place all right i've spent 40 something years you know hollering and screaming at you to try to get you and i to realize who we are the martin luther was a good man and no doubt he had a lot of good thoughts and there was a lot of good people that had protested the catholic church you know in their days and tried to reform the church and the different things you know and uh maybe luther had spent a lot of it i don't think he just all at once wham oh jumps up and becomes a good guy i think god was working on him all through his life preparing him for the time but then one day he saw that scripture and he said the just shall live by faith all right then in that he said in his heart not to he didn't want to get out of the catholic church if you've read his writings about it he wanted to re to reform the church that was why it was called reformation he wanted to get the church back to god all right they put him out of the church and see your prophet in the light stage didn't want to he went everywhere he could go but they put him out it wouldn't wouldn't him you know it's what they done all right but now you think about it to recognize your day in this message now we recognize the prophet to be brought the message he brought to us we thank god for the message we believe the message we read the message we study the message that is our basis all right but when do we think that we're going to become what he said all right but that's what i say in there last sunday we look at things and we're trying to find the problem and naturally we don't want to look in our own cranium cap you know to find the problem we think it's everybody else because we think we're doing pretty good you know well no not not perfect now no but we're doing pretty good but if we could just get everybody else lined up as good as i am well let's that's the problem but see god's not trying to get us now listen the way i say it he's not as concerned in our lives as you and i think we should be concerned with our lives he's concerned with getting us to realize who we are that we're his children we're his offspring then in doing that then he can move on the scene you know what i mean do you uh do when you one of your kids does something wrong you just chunk them out you know get rid of that one no no you don't do it that way well god don't do it that way but you see it's an honest and a contract heart is what he's looking for all right but then we say well don't you believe in living right brother dale no i don't believe in living right oh you're a funny preacher i agree with you i believe in being born again and that let god live the right that's our problems we've tried to live right we've tried to produce a rapture we've tried to do it and it's run off into all kinds of isms and schisms and doctrines of people and we're still here but you see then i'm just trying to get you and i to recognize who we are all right now then i've drove it hard and i'll keep driving it hard because it is the message of the hour to get us to realize but my point is i've been thinking and i'll try to say it in the best words that i can see you might think that i'm talking about only the bride and the end time to be something special we're no different than anybody else we're no different than any age it's ever been we're no different than than luther in his day of drinking beer and sitting in the pub and talking about doctrine oh no we don't do that but what is the difference you see if you'll go back and check it you'll find that he's standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks the bible says i know we came through doctrinal ideas of people that you think they didn't plant stuff in your mind and i know where brother branham said it brother and said he's alpha and omega he said he says nothing in between i know that but they don't go to the other one where he says he's out for an amiga and everything in between well are you making that a contradictory thought no it's not that it's just the way he's stating it there is nothing in between alpha nomika he's the same he's the same yesterday today and forever the only difference in the ages was the word had been eaten down you know the spirit was in every age brother around them even preached a point of it the seven spirits you know and said that ain't seven spirits god we know it's not but it's the spirit of god manifested in seven different ways or seven ages or whatever but see it's the same god in each age and like i said if you want to take even the literal part he's standing in the midst of the seven goal again i know what that means i believe that he's he's proud to be in each age but if you want to be naturally carnal then he would be more in the middle of the ages than he would in the end of the ages right because he said he's in the midst and we say missed his middle we'll see we've listened to people explain away that luther didn't know nothing wasn't there now enough pentecost now nothing we got it all i don't believe that now and i'm trying my best and i'll spend more time this afternoon emphasizing that i'm trying to get you an eye to see it's not you and me when we're talking about the seed or the word of god you know i'm not talking about you and i because it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god but it's the cedar word the priest person comes free destination by foreign knowledge then he knows where that seed will fall but i'm trying to get you and i to recognize who we are not who luther was wesley was people that's wonderful not even to who brother branham was that's wonderful and without him you and i wouldn't have any ability or any hope whatsoever but you know what that was god's promise you know that brother brown said he would not send a headstone on our merits come on he said he sent it because he promised it did he send the holy ghost on the death pentecost back there because of some great thing they had done no they were probably having a lot of troubles but around just emphasizes that they were talking about well we need to accept it by faith let's get up and go but who was the guys that was talking about that the feller that turned down jesus you know right the peter that denied him right amen but you see church what i'm trying to get you and i to see is we we emphasizing the age and the time because of the word that's being revealed the word that's being revealed is is the main thing and that's why they're dependent upon us to bring them out of the grave because of the word that's being revealed that's a promise of god amen that's not just well we're good people so god sent us a prophet no it's exactly reverse god don't send a prophet to good people now come on give me the bible for it it's when it got bad it was when he sent a prophet it got down to where there was no hopes whatsoever it was down to a stump as the prophet would call it and then we were trying to preach the other day about joy where he said i will restore the years of the crank can't go warm by more him locust caterpillar i'll restore that's promise well he kept his promise he started in martin luther with a just shall live by faith that's why we believe in those churches and the messages they started with but it's when they denominate and die they'll first organize it then they'll denominate it and then it dries up and dies and that's what you see among the people of the message they're organizing everything they can you got to be in our group or you're not in well now we've got to be in christ they kept saying the brother random said should we move to arizona said we got to be in a place he said i got it just now boy you i bet you everybody are we gonna hear it now we we're gonna know where to go he said i'll tell you where to go he said you go to christ jesus that's the place to go he said if you're hunting a place get dire but you see we get it all figured out why has it been 40 years because of our not accepting the deliverance but let's get him accepted let's get to the point but i wanted to just make that amazing i'll bring it a little more this afternoon because i should try to speak on something on dispensations all right and uh but i want you to think about something today and remember now the point that i just made when brother branham speaks of the bride being the fullness of the godhead bodily he's not just speaking of the end time come on he's speaking of the entire bride because the bride is not complete without luther right you know that's an age that's a part you're leaving out some just like i said about the minor prophets you know we think they were not important but they were important to bringing the body of christ into being because if not he would have come into the world with a finger missing or a part off you know right but he doesn't he was complete why because all of those prophets had their part amen the church ages that have tried to cover and it's god coming down to reveal himself that was god in those ages he was pleased to dwell in martin luther when he said that just shall live by faith when the baptists begin to come forth and their move and the predestinations and the restoration of of immersing in baptism he was pleased the dweller that was a move of god see if we leave out any of those things then what have we done we see that's the point because i know that where the devil deals with people because he's the way he deals with me and it's been bearing on me to say make sure you explain it because everybody just think we're building the one great thing that this end time people are a great super duper bunch of people no we're a super dumb bunch of people that's a better word i guess for it prophet said the sickest body do you need that quote that he'd ever seen is the bride of jesus christ was he talking about physical or was he speaking the spiritual also how do you think that man felt to try to bring a message that's only i believe it's future home now they said it billy paul was the one that told it now that's up to him but said brother branham said billy did you catch that or what i said on the future home oh yeah daddy i got he said billy i asked you did you catch it he said i count on my hands how many people understood what i was trying to say what about knowing that yet pouring his heart out trying to preach right you can see what an hour he was living in thank god for the word that he brought to us and he was the only one that could bring it to us and we don't need another messenger to come to straighten that out we need a group of people to become what the man has said right the problem was that in the days of martin luther was what they started out burning down the churches and he told them to quit they said but that's what you said to do see he was strong against the church until they thought we'll just burn the churches he said that wasn't what i was trying to do he was trying to convert to people but you see that's what you take this message and you become so much until most of us remember the days we came into the message and a lot of it was people fighting against organized religion you know denominationalism well that's good but what happened to a lot of them they went back to those denominations or went to nothings right you see the point church that i'm trying to make is it's not to recognize whatever has been thank god for what has been god is wanting you and i to recognize what he's doing right now but not to leave the people out of it what kind of a body would you have built in the new testament if you left out some of the things of the ages you wouldn't have a perfect body that's why the prophet would use it like carriers he said those were carriers luther wesley pinnacle but then he would explain the carrier was the word of the hour for the age they were living right see the way we look at it there's nothing but just us in the end time all right that's the devil taking us over that away too far we've got to remember that even our roots are jewish and we've got to remember the stalk remains the shucks the silks the the thing remain until we come to maturity yeah we want to cut them down get rid of get rid of them denominations but you see in doing that a lot of times we fight so hard until all we've done is just condemn people instead of condemning sin he's that's why i'm not too popular in the message right why because i don't preach about that baptist church over there and i don't preach about that groups up here in that group so with our claim cleaning me i preach to the lulaites you know what the people sitting here anybody else wants to listen that's their business and i'm talking to you and i it's not up to me to pastor the world it's up to me to try to preach the truth to you and i to get you an odyssey but hey folks i look around here and i remember when a lot of you was black-headed and i look around and like i say it's no joke if this thing don't move on pretty fast we're going to be having services in the nursing homes but it's not been god's fault he gave us the word amen but the people don't want to listen to it you know they want their own ideas and their own thoughts and and then you can just read all you want to what brother brown says well okay i got a quote over here i got a quote over here sure we got it in the bible like that but we believe in being baptized named the lord jesus christ with them denominations believe in father son holy ghost no you're making a contradiction in your bible the bible says father son holy ghost it says lord jesus christ it's got to come together to be right right so then that's the way the message of the hour has to come together to build a beautiful picture and in doing that then we come down to see why that he would call people carriers why because they were watch what they were doing they were carrying but the last quote i gave to you brought around and said we're carriers and that's what i tried to get you to see we start off as carriers no matter what you think you started off as i was born in the message you were the carrier we're carriers until that word is brought forth from you and i and then matured right then we're carriers until that time but you just don't think that we're talking about just the end time people as being some i'm talking about the bride of christ that has been through seven church ages and at each age it had been the spirit of god in that age to quicken that word of that age but yet the age itself and the people of that time we couldn't come forth with the full mature word look at even after your prophet stepped on the scene it took him 30-something years he said before he could preach the statue of a perfect man a lot about that restoration maybe we need to get into because a lot of it is re reformation is what we're thinking it's just reforming from a catholic church to a lulayat he says why don't mine talking like that because i'm not against the world i'm not against any of those people i'm against sin and that sin is not drinking gambling smoking running around with that's not supposed to be in here but you know the sin i'm against is the unbelief of you and i all right maybe you'll understand what i'm meaning by see because i've made it so hard i've listened to tape the other day when i wrote around and said that i've made this so hard he said until you think that the others just don't matter he said no that's not what i'm doing and i thought oh god that's what i'm doing i made it so hard to try to drive it in about our age in our time to maybe the people is just not believing those other people had anything but they were the part of the body of christ they were the carriers and they're still there for that purpose as carriers see that's why the devil he'd be after you and i in a hurry if it wasn't for the rest of the religious world system because they're sheltering us why do you want to beat on people so much at your own shelter well i don't want to be trying to know how to organize religious stuff you don't have to be in a denominational church to have a denominational spirit anything contrary to the word of god comes out of organization right that's why i've been trying to get that point but i want you to look at it but remember now what i'm saying when i'm talking about and we'll read here the things the prophet says remember i'm talking about the entire body of christ all the way down through the seven church ages and what they have brought forth to not just be a glorious people up at the top as far as deserving it we don't even deserve to be the bottom right but yeah i was reading you that quote there the other day where he said he puts a believer according to john and on patmos were put right back into the apostles and prophets they're doctrine of what they brought so i believe the bible why because it's god's word but then it's like i told you we we spend our time trying to divide there maybe you didn't understand what i meant when i said it we we we're 25 people and 75 god maybe something the percentage that i gave you one day see we we get to the build-up point we want to be a 90 people and 10 god now just remember we're probably about it's 99 god and probably about 1 people you know and just remember whatever it is is what god's made us it's not our choices even a lot of time it's what he's made us right but now think about it because what i want to think about today is look at the bible through the prophet's message and look at it as seeing that what speaks of him speaks of you and i because when he was hanging there on the cross you remember they put a spear in his side water came out to knowing things you know that was you and i we were part of him well yeah we want to turn the whole thing around you know he came here with us in him but we wanted him to come here with you know we want to be here with without him something but when he came we were in him i want to make it some fancy thing that i'm special i come here with god in me no we come here in him eve was in adam there's no tops no shadows no points of dealing with it and he is the word amen all right when we get on down into the message after a while we have time about the the son of man that will be later on just remember the son of man is the sower of the seed but you know what he is the seed that's why we only believe in one true and living god i tried to explain that through the points of talking to you about it you know that that one seed that's planted comes forth in a multiple form right a bride of christ but then she goes into the ground in a mini-member body yeah but that's still just one seed i hope you followed the point that's still just one seed there's not many many seeds that's gone through the scripture galatians 3 16 said unto thy seed which is christ all honor and glory that i'm trying my best to give is to jesus christ that's all i've ever tried to give is to hold him up and to see what he's talking about what you see when we're reading there in isaiah we'll read in a minute where the prophet says she is smitten she's afflicted that's speaking of you and i yeah see he's outside the church right is that in the book of revelation because he stands at the door knocking well he's welcomed over here and now i'm not pointing over there or anything but he's welcomed in the churches to be god and be the healer and things like that right even to be a savior he's wanted but he's not wanted as lord and master so he's smitten from the church in that form so he's outside the church the bible says knocking at the door trying to get back in well then where are we at we are supposed to be called out of the church all right it's a bride to be called out of a church true well see then the things what i want you to look at today the things that speak of him speak of you and i write in the word because that's what the prophet says in paragraph 2 41 242 uh it's the rising of the sun go ahead and pull that up brother same word that speaks to the groom speaks of the bride why because it's all one notice now now notice this quickening power so we bring in the word the mind that was in christ was in you then i'm trying to show you that you when you raised when god raised jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quickened to life with him you are now quickened to life although then you were but an attribute in his thoughts back there but god had saw all in him at the finish all in him now what's that when god looked down upon the body the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die that doesn't mean the spirit left him i have to stop and express because when you read that see you people's mind what happened to him if the spirit had left him like this the word spirit is used then he would have been dead that's plain sense so that's not what he's talking about he's not talking about his body spirit soul but his spirit left him in the garden now if he is he's dead now come on but what's he saying look what he's talking about and the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which was human flesh and he didn't if he'd have went up there as god he'd have never died that kind of death can't kill god but he didn't have to do it what did he do the anointing we preached on this for 40 years the anointing the prophet said left him in the garden of gethsemane not his natural spirit the anointing that came on him on the river jordan left him in the garden in gethsemane well because he couldn't die with that anointing you know the thing i love about it is we're supposed to be that anointing and you know that's the reason we can't die somebody's going to become so anointed with that anointing of god until they can't die but just remember luther didn't die he went to sleep those people back down through there they didn't die either they went to sleep but you see the anointing is supposed to come back in the entire that's the difference in us and the rest of the people just to come to be an anointing on a bride right because all of it's him anyway but why can't we believe it all right but remember he went there with you in him see god had never been separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw a body he saw both male and female he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body see they are one sign same with word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride now what's he talking about male and female when adam was standing in the garden was there a female there no she had not come into being yet it was in adam in adam in what form when the bride of christ was in christ he looked at it as male and female but not looking at it as two different people because it was just one god if we're another person you're back to trinitarianism again you better consider that see if we're not him made manifest you're in the trinitarianism right you've gone back to your old thinking trying to figure it out there's got to be two no there's not two there's just one true and living god and that's what i've tried my best to get you to see the other day with it he don't need a body on earth now why because he's got a body his body is his people we are his body he's the head that's why we meet him in the air he doesn't come back here physically we meet him in the air all right but think about it now she is him made manifest it's not you and i right we're just the vessels that's right that he's living in all right he was anointed with the fullness of the godhead bodily and when we get to that more and probably this afternoon just remember no one of us can be that no one person of a human being outside of jesus christ can speak about being the fullness of the godhead bodily john on patmos could represent the bride being taken up yeah but that was only a representation but see he's the one true and living god and what we are he has made us so what speaks to the bride speaks of the groom what speaks of the groom speaks of the bride over in revelations i don't read revelation about 20 21 21 22 and how beautiful everything is there i read how beautiful he is because even john can't define the difference he sees the city coming down describes the people he sees the people describe the city why because they're the same source if we're another source remember that was what happened at nicaea there in 325 they were arguing over where jesus was almighty god or whether he was a like substance another source alike substance some like you know and even that now i see the first one they didn't come up that he was a different source read your nicey and recreed that he was the source of god but then later on it turned out to be that they believed him to be a different source that's what anthonies and everyone what his name and our hair is anthonyus two guys was arguing over where jesus was almighty god or whether he was a god in a flesh a demon of god as they later developed the words to to being but you see what i'm talking about a compound revelation that's what i'm talking about pull that one up let's read it look what he says about this day this scripture is fulfilled 65 paragraph 56-58 he said history always repeats itself and scripture has a compound meaning to it and a compound revelation okay he explains it right for instance like it says in the bible that out of egypt i've called my son referring to jesus run the margin on that and you'll find out that also refer find out referred all also referred to jacob same scripture jesus was the greater son jacob was the son that he called out of egypt all right double answer compound meaning all right compound meaning what speaks of the bridegroom speaks to the bride so we can go through the scriptures and see the things that speaks of him and then see what he has done by him giving his life to you and i it makes god manifest in flesh you remember that a few weeks ago where the prophet of god said the light of the age the light of the age is the word made manifest you realize what he's saying martin luther as much as we would throw off on him and his wife he was the light of that age why because he was a born-again christian and he brought a message and people went out and protested the catholic church and all of your writings your great things come from a lot in there and then pick it up with wesley to be able to pick up a little father west and then brought into the songwriting forums and things you've got your white fields and all the different ones that came through there that were trying to get the bible down into our language and thank god for them the printing press developed and we were able to start printing and things but you see the light of each age is that word made flesh and i just don't see it well you wouldn't have seen if you're standing back and see him to be the word in the flesh come on oh yes i believed it back there now do you need the quotes from the prophet he said whatever we are now we would have been then do you need that you see we deny the word made flesh in the last days then you denied back there but you see that's what we don't want we don't want somebody making it so strong until we have to make some decision we want to believe what we want to believe okay help yourself well i thought the bride didn't want to believe what she wanted to believe i thought she was giving up all of her beliefs and ideas and her ways to believe god's word that's why you hear me say a lot of times when i'm quoting brother branham or scripture you know i didn't write the book you know when the bible says he's just one true and living god i didn't write that god did you're not arguing with me about it you're arguing with the word of god well we got it figured yeah that's what it is we had it figured out what are you following me what i'm talking about compound meaning compound revelation the revelation that speaks of him speaks of her because where did we come from do you understand that we've got to be a part of him the prophet says who is the word and that's where i'm not throwing off on people to do but i mean you just heard the message and you're just now beginning to believe that message well you know the part you're really believing and what god has revealed to you is just as great as the greatest ones among us that's been in the message 40 years and can quote everything the prophet says that's the way god looks at it there's no big eyes a little use you know it's what he has made us it's what he has made us is the most important thing now he chose this last day people and like i've always told you you know i mean i've heard this statement that in the military they used to you know because i'd like another day tell him and my wife was talking a little bit nannies was talking about the militaries and things right now you know what if you took away all this electronical stuff from the military today you know just to take away the electronical stuff away from it and you give them a gun and they had to go fight i'm going to go help me up this hill i can't crawl up there wouldn't it be that anyway i wouldn't want this military backing me up without all the sophisticated stuff that's right because the whole military is not special forces fat slobs and then now they put the women in with them right and i'm not saying anything against that i'm just telling the truth but any something all you gotta do is turn it right loose and all i went and i started to pull up i pulled up a dress right now all the way to hey the old saying is oh you're a man or a mouse i'm evidently a man because my wife is afraid of mice i don't mean that as a joke i mean it's the truth but you understand what i mean why is it ladies you can be tough as a shoe leather and and you know you can i mean you can just tackle them kids you can take them just whoop them just and then all at once a rat runs through the house i'm trying to illustrate what the military would be like right but you see church have we become fat and lazy in the message you know do we think we got it all figured out and you know all about it take the computer away and a lot of people can't quote brother branham but just get back to the point compound meaning even a compound revelation as i said then it's one it's 90 percent god trying to reveal himself to you and i and one percent of you and i that can believe that part or try to manifest that part because it's all him anyway you know he don't need us right boy most people are he can't do without me well brother brown says stick your finger in a glass of water pull it out and you'll find out how important you are with god good illustration right but yet he chose us and he chose this end time people to be something to where they could believe it we could believe that what's speaking of him is speaking of us and we can see that he was the way he is smitten from the church is in you and i right well i don't have to explain that do i the people love us but they don't want the words you have they don't want the clothes you wear the the life you try to live they don't want that they want to do everything they can to try to talk you out of the word right well that really don't mean that now now do you think that that you're the only people that's going to heaven how many of that you heard you know we're good people aren't we well i agree but just remember my favorite quote is this remember you're looking in a mirror you're not trying to find yourself you're only going to see something getting older and fat and ugly right and you can go how the face lifts and the twists and the pulls and it ain't going to change not one thing in the world right well a good pain on a barn is better than an old barn that's a good favorite one but that's not true but listen church compound meaning read the scripture about him and think about yourself think about your life compared to what he was because see i i had that problem when i was in the baptist church i've told you many times about it i couldn't understand i could read the bible and my problem is i couldn't understand i couldn't understand how come people would kill him when he never done nothing but good that bothered me 50 years ago or more that i couldn't understand i mean the man doing good healing the sick feeding the people doing everything in the world yet they wanted to kill him why and just remember it will repeat or it has been repeating down through time because it's always been the church that's persecuting the people right do i need to get you the quote where the prophet said the ones who started out as being persecuted wound up being the persecutors is it not in the history that the catholic church killed 68 million of their own records they have but see we we're still lovey-dovey with them you know well that was way back under we're different now yep we're same old people but thinking about it look what your prophet has to say about the little bride if you read it on masterpiece let's get this one we'll try to at least cover this part look at number three brother who's back her brother anderson's out brother bob back there again whoever is running the that side this is taken from the masterpiece paragraph 159 through 161. he's talking about how the malachod forced to bring back back to the original look she is smitten from the church from the church body smitten with her master you remember that for the same purpose what she is the word just the same as joseph was smitten from his brethren because he was the word and jesus was smitten from his brother and because he was the word the church is smitten the bride is smitten from the church because she is the word there is your stages again one two three just exactly he's outside the church smitten she's smitten as we read in isaiah what's speaking of him is speaking of you are you not trying to get people to see the word yes you know are are you not trying to get people born again yes it's not that the whole goal of the christian life is to try to get people saved well you know that was his goal but because of doing it then he was rejected and so is she right as joseph was see she's the word you know what they say about lula ah that's just old word word word word that's all they do about a little word word word well what else is this supposed to be i i didn't know it was to be anything else to me that's a great compliment especially when they can't come and show you where you're off the word boy you better believe they'd love to and you let this old boy pass off the scene they'll come at you whenever attack they can i understand that because i know what's going on in it they're afraid of the word they'll go talk about you in the back you know they don't face in the word okay come on let's just sit down right here and talk it over i don't been 240 years with this folks i don't have to worry about it that's not bragging it's just true listen the word living and in action well i just don't see it going on i don't i don't see anything i just we're just a bunch of people that just we just go to church and try to be good well that's probably 99 true but there's one percent somewhere that that's not true about you know and i'm trying my best to be one of them i hope you are right see the word living and inaction that said there last week but if we if if you've got what you think you what is not signs and wonders because of your unbelief and i'm not meaning their unbelief out there i'm talking about the unbelief in here right because see what they are out there you let the word come in here and let it be revealed and out there know how to do it you mean it bothers you brother dale because the people don't want you to come and preach in their churches that did years ago many years ago because i wanted to get god's word to him but you know what don't bother me now you know why because i realize if it's anything it hadn't been me anyway i realized that well see then i know who's outside the church right come on but look the word living in an action the bible bride the bible right not some man-made bride the bible bride smitten and afflicted of god no beauty we should desire her but yet we did esteem her smitten and afflicted of god well they should have put him in there you know well that's all right with me go ahead and race it out and put him in there because him is her or hers him so all right that's right she stands alone she is smitten from all denominations now that means in the message is he making denominations just something prior to this okay she's smitten from all denominations according to revelation 3. she's smitten out of the lady you'll see an age that she was raised up in see this church is was raised up in the ladies in church age that's the huss but if them others went can't you pentecostal men man see that if that other was husk and died if that other stalk had to die if the tassel had to die so much the hust die there's three stages of organization see what is it she is smitten so when you read the bible just read of the people that he's talking about who was it in the book of acts that they were turning down wasn't the disciples it was the god of the disciples it was god and the people who did they turn down in martin luther's day who did they turn down in the baptist day the methodist day the presbyterians you say you can call them names why that denominations brother dale well where did you come from right all of us come out of some of them things and then if we didn't we're just a one-man denomination anyway so that don't matter but do you see what i'm driving out god is made manifest in his people it's not the people worth anything where it talks about during the gospel you know the seeded went forth to sow the seed and the seed fell here in the cellar i thought that he was given a parable of the bride of christ no he's talking about what was he just talking about jesus only see he said well why are you talking so much on this to lay a foundation for us to even talk about the bride could be the fullness of the godhead bodily because we take the wrong approach on that it ain't correct but the right approach is that we're nothing we've never been anything but it's what he has made us he shows us to be what we are why can't we accept that but instead we try to figure it out try to go through the lines of of you know well i just don't see nothing going on pull that back up on the masterpiece and look down on paragraph 164. remember the masterpiece yes you remember what we read up here now look what he says stands alone like the bridegroom rejected of man despised and rejected of the churches the bride stands that way what is it it's his masterpiece see the word that he can work through make manifests rejecting so the stalk the ties on the hust never becomes seed no we're all the time becoming more like the seed now at the harvest time the seed is back to original to its original life back to the bible malachi 4 said it would be brought back that way oh my must have all what is it what speaks of the groom speaks to the bride read the bible in that form and just remember that the bible is a books and names now the one you've got in front of you is a record of human mankind upon earth called the bible but the original book of life is just the book of names but when that name came on earth and became manifest in continuance psalm 139 when my members fashioned when it yet not perfect in continuance the body of christ has been built down to seven church ages and all of that body of christ is there and when we read this afternoon about the bride being the fullness of the godhead bodily i hope i don't have to spend three hours explaining he ain't talking about just us he's talking about the bride down through seven church ages the specific part for our day is to recognize who we are for this age and recognize that the bible is speaking about you and i yes you remember the who is it the ethiopian eunuch is that the one is the man speaking of himself or another why can't we realize the bible is speaking about you and i compound meaning compound revelation the meaning is is to try to bring his bride into view now how let's let's see if we can quote that isn't it something like this that he took my place right why so that i might be able to take his place is that derogatory to him to think about you and i as something and no he's the one trying to make us manifest he's the one that's trying his best to reveal the bride of jesus christ you remember the quote the other day where i was reading it spoken word original seed said this prophet in the last days would be pointing to a word born bride well what good is it to point to me to you right i mean the worst thing you get is pointing fingers is you got problems about what you're pointing at but he said he'd be pointing to a word born bro well that's one of these days brother dale maybe 50 years from now you know what that means it means you ain't going to have to have nothing to do with it because you're going to be dead and that's what we baptist used to say you say the lord is coming you let people you go and start talking to them and just make it real sly like around about the coming of the lord yes sir the lord's here we believe the lord's coming he's coming and it really ain't no telling how quick and you start talking about the signs of his coming well nobody knows the day and or the hour yes it may be 50 years from now that means you ain't got no responsibility because most everybody in here 50 years from now would be dead or dying but just think about it my simple little point is try to get a point across to us what speaks of the bride groom speaks of the bride amen he's smitten for the church you and i are spent from the church he was rejected of mankind you and i are rejected of mankind he was persecuted you're not persecuted well ain't nobody do it no not but they're beginning right now to pick up a few things right and they're beginning to bring forth some things that they're going to be able to take us to court one day too like the man in zimbabwe sister milka brought he's a polygamist and everything you know what they're going to do they want to know now what he taught the people to get them to come into that see a lot of things happening here in the united states too you know a lot of things going on right but you see church i'm not worried about all that i'm just concerned with you and i to realize who we are and what we're doing we have nothing against the government we have nothing against the churches we have nothing against the world i think we're all doing pretty good we're all getting fat and we all at least was able to drive to church today think another day about first time we went to jamaica in 93 i believe it was many more cars and the junk they was riding in i mean i wouldn't have started home in one of them you know if i did i'd had to tie the doors on and things and the door doorknobs was totally just tore off where they'd run into each other and everything else and we went back in 95 and then in them they went i think was 95 and and they thought it was bad honey they beautiful they begin to have cars of course they had 200 000 miles on them but they began to have cars that you could ride in i told you about seeing them tires on that car that night and the first time looking at it and pulled up i thought what kind of tire is that had these strings hanging out you know flopping i thought well we got feelers to try to find side you know you remember the old days of the feelers they don't use them much no more but we had all that and i thought well that might be what that is i walked around the front of that car and looked at it i went over that brother and i handed him some money and gave it to him the next day i said don't you drive no more until you get some tires on that car and he had drove 50 or 60 miles at 60 mile an hour around the mountains getting to where we were at you know what that was that was the old polyester tires there was no tread the whole thing that held it on was done gone they were riding on that inner lining of the tire and that was this polyester strings hanging out but you know what today they got better cars better tires a point you and i we're at ease and time we really need something to go come on brothers we need something to start knocking us around a little bit to make us get concerned yeah because we just kind of relaxed but do you get the point what speaks of the bridegroom speaks of the bride so just read the bible and read yourself into it and see that it's talking about you we really read it as things to try to women's hair dress clothes or something to beat people with you know and we got we like to quote that over in in uh what is the old testament where the woman's not to wear a garment pertaining to a man well that's good i believe it deuteronomy about 25 but have you read the rest of that verse have you ever read the rest of that verse where it says in for a man not to wear the garment pertaining to one we want to quote half of it but we don't want to read it all right see we want the part that we want to use for whips and things to beat with instead of using it to try to help i hope you understand a lot of people don't understand me when i speak i say i'm not trying to get people to be good no no no i'm trying to get you to be born again if you're born again it's going to come to that basis of his goodness not ours but you see church what speaks of him the word made flesh john 1 14. isn't it odd the prophet would come over and emphasize that that we used them over and over and over where he said the bride in the end time is a word made flesh and see he's the word made flesh he's just he's one and we're not supposed to be one we're a many-membered bride but remember every member of that body is jesus christ made manifest in that person there's no idea 103 in the red book 103 in the red book anybody have an 8. you have long for sweet peas and for faith until you know that's all god almighty god see we we look down we can condemn we like the prophet said one day and said there what must we do to be saved we tell them to quit this quit that don't do this don't do that i said that wasn't what they asked those are supposed to be attributes of our doings we're not supposed to be living like that if we are we're lost what about it we're just looking to condemn instead of trying to look into the heart of people don't worry about it we can do our own sales how many of you remember the story that was told about the man up in canada that the brother saw a prostitute standing on the street the lord spoke to it he stopped started talking to that woman wound up me and he said how much is your cost of your time he handed her the money when she sat down in the car and what the rest of the story he told her he said i don't want your body i ain't talking about that i'm talking about your soul like to scare the lady to death he said the lord told me to stop talking to you she said i thought i was true said i used to be a christian but said the lord's dealing with you she came to the lord right there but how many of us would think well i'm not gonna do that but i'm not asking nobody to go to a honky-tonk to bar room i don't think that either but i'm just saying for all of us to quit looking down at others to start looking to jesus christ and praying for them people try to look in the eyes of god see what he sees and have peace and sweet your dismiss remember the service this afternoon is you
