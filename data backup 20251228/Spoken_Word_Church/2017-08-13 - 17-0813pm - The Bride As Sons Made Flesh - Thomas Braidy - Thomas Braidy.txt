what you do for Christ that will stand a man right y'all let's stand to our feet we're going to have the Brady come out I guess rather than the elephant list you want to come up with hope you enjoyed them services this morning getting ready to hear the word of the Lord calling us what we we've come far we have everybody with us glad to have another Collins and his family with us maybe some of them hadn't been here before you happen your visitor you're welcome one time next time you're part of us we just all one together in Christ but good to see each and every one of you you know and I know you enjoyed the message but already done a great job this morning testifying and then reading the word shortened to what would happen and he testified to the glory of the Lord you know what had happened and all I can so we appreciate just remember pray one for another that we traveled in back home and he'll be here for a while and then going back to Jamaica so let's just sing open the eyes in my heart is where the Brady comes to bring the word of the Lord unto it ok open the eyes of my I want [Music] openly I open me eyes [Music] Oh Oh Oh [Music] praise the Lord again then it happened to be back in the house of the Lord amen he promised his word amen and we just love his word if nothing like its word amen and amen the Lord has chosen us for this purpose praise the Lord then we go straight to the Word of God if you have a battle let's turn to Galatians chapter 3 it's so much in there for us as the Bride of Christ as the Word of God has been made playing amen through the message of the hour amen now we can read with full understanding amen now we can see ourselves in the Word of God it's written there it's written there is fear your name is there hey Mara my name is dear but until you see for yourself they amen lovely some of us a preacher preached one time in Jamaica some up to wake up first amen and then kind of grudge the other and touching here to shooting hearing get them wake up also because the promise is true amen well I should read a little further down but I'll just go right from here from the sixteenth verse ten a man died just like sometimes to us regards word and school now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as one and to thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the Lord rich was 430 years after cannot be Dishonored that it should make the promise none effect Amen tangled by gutters amen Israel got this for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore then saith the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come whom the promise was made and it was ordained by an angel in the hand of the mediator now a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one it's the law then against the promise of God god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture have concluded all on the scene that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe no wonder we have this unholy but the poor faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed Alleluia therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith I like that but after that fate is come we are no longer under schoolmaster for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on the ring put on Christ hallelujah there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ and if ye be Christ's then ye are Abraham's seed and here according to the promise this is the word of the Lord you can be seated there is nothing like it Amen when it comes to the individual hallelujah I believe God send somebody to enlighten or understanding amen - thus saith God in Earth and to whom to ascend to to receive it Amen that's it that's it a man as I was saying this morning had little more to this and we go straight to it right so the emphasis differs from age to age depending on the anointing that the church is under in each age carries their own annoying sing hallelujah the emphasis changes for different kind of of anointing that of the lion amen the Branum voice well ago was just confirming this the ox the man and the eager each one a different power a different anointing different strength and now in this age I think the Gospels of Dicky gay men we have Oh a Jinnah this is it you all emphasis is rapture we got to get ready for it after the wedding thank God the marriage of the land the coming of the Lord the whole emphasis is the union of the bride and groom this is the age when everything circles around the coming of the Lord every scripture that has been given every sign for this age and I believe even we have a perfect sign that the Prophet awake us to as the bride of Jesus Christ never before even think that up I'm listening to hearing on the streets open wide Amen in schools of maybe six to eight ten to twelve Oh God Amen because is got to be fulfilled got to be fulfilled we have a different emphasis today and the Pentecostals Nazarene holiness will wonder why we emphasize certain things but it is because we are living under a certain anointing it's time to wake up time to wake up president even the new presidents and things like that email bomber came to Jamaica and he met said some things and trying to get all the Americans right though told me sexuals the main crops in this leutis day was to break the Roman hierarchy but that is not our main emphasis at all we are just as much against the Pentecostals of today as he was against Roman Catholic we have the same gospel same holy goals but a different emphasis we are not living on the manage and I believe that church and we have to come in line with our age we are too long in this message reforming people we can take a pig scrubbing up making look nice put on perfume but it's still going to be the same that's what we do when we just take people up it is not in America yet but it's in Jamaica and make them look right but inside they are still who they are you are not reformist you are gospel preachers we have to line up with a message of the ow you are going to preach perfect truth from the scripture and we found yet rabid random get mixed up in the state the Lord the main thrust the Wesleyan age as conscious he met seven churches was holy living center 5% their preaching just don't do this don't do that and still going on you means over in this age we believe in holiness just such John Wesley did we practice the same thing but that is not a man it for us as bride still right still we have to do that we don't walk around and just like the world amen we have to line up is that right what a day we are living in we need a translation not a reformation if we are ever going to be taught or caught up in the sky we had better get what in this revelation restoration amen but bandage back to Genesis back to the beginning you have to settle that with him what have you Pentecostal he said here the main trust was speaking in tongues gifts of the Spirit that was their main trust we believe what the true Pentecostal believed but the emphasis today has changed from that of Pentecostal denomination coming from Jamaica it's a little different King in at the right time amen they were just about to change those people that we met and had good fellowship with 50 years ago it's so different still Pentecostals amen my day he meant when we find ourselves with them and things like that this should pass your home and see a beer bottle and you flow as garden as a deacon you're going to be called up for that maybe somebody drink and threw it over there did it knock heads in the bar today it is the same gospel the same Holy Spirit but another 90 we are under no longer on the message for the whole trust now is the coaming we got to get ready the rapture the rapture I remember driving one hurly morning coming some we are going somewhere brothers I know I stopped it's just still a Pentecostal and he said I don't feel good it's morning I didn't sleep good last night right and it's like the rapture is is gone and in the public market some of the Pentecostals from that church goes a lot of them and then he said better Brady I have to go down to the mark and look at sister so on so it's still there and look at what a song choice still there or if they are gone I said oh what a shame amen they would be gone and he would be left it's time for us expecting our self he had more confidence maybe certain certain sister certain certain brother more than himself what an hour church we are living in it's time to get in line individually with a Word of God Scripture the two shall be in the bed yes and one is going to be taken to serve in the field working and one disappeared I would like to be me when it come to the rapture Church I'm going to say Tom Brady amen first I want to make that rapture you can home after but I want to be sure that Tom Brady make dad rapture and I want to keep it that way is that right think about it the rapture on on time all the Scriptures pertaining to the rapture amen it's before us now hey maybe we don't have to get funny and things like that because this is your day and this is my day hallelujah is that right the rapture the rapture the rapture that is the anointing that's supposed to be on us over the radio in the gambling scheme I don't know if like that over here that would demand place number 16 you hear people calling friends and asking what did it Montreuil what did man play and not only that but in Jamaican way right they would say what is yonder yeah okay and you hear them what is he under they nerve they please sixteen and they know what supposed to follow sixteen so me harlot thirteen and they know what to buy you know what thirteen years and they know policeman number and then they try to go that way I like to say we are to know what anointing we are on is upon I as I said this morning but been imprinted anointed ones in the end time is that right and called some in here from the scripture that was under that kind of a nineteenth and your anointing got to lined up with the word of God your dream got to line up with a word of God your vision got to line up with the word of God sure Georgia was a dreamer came to his father and he said daddy I have a dream and he told it moon Sun Moon on star or he picked it up far do you mean me your daddy and your mother have to bail Georgia said I didn't make up a dream is that right do you know it happened huh just add he junkie he wasn't afraid to tell his father because he knew he was spiritual he in you that is going to happen right when a few times is what his brothers but now his father and his mother God is no respecter of persons is that right someday it's coming back search brother branham book you see the hour that we are no living is that true reservation produces revelation that produces a translation it will be these divine revealed mysteries truth that will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of their fathers sometimes you got to read better brenham message more than one time not just one time is that right but one said that Jesus does all three as he is descending so damn tough solonian 4:6 mm-hmm for therefore the coming of the Lord so we can say that we are now in the cycle of this coming already he has already descended from heaven him in his grave and brought it out with a shoat they missed it at the Pentecost where God says I am calm down it is not as much geography if you think now I can distance that's not what God is talking about God and morphe God came into a dimension where we could understand him fit us for the rapture hallelujah I believe it won't be too long church the fate of it needs is here when we read while ago for ye are all children of God by faith in Jesus Christ nothing else for as many of you individually as baptized into Christ have put on Christ hallelujah wasn't too bad when we said we have to fulfill this that gives him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when we heard it it was very wide open for das set the law to put him on amen we are not going to emerge supper you know church that's it is off now looking forward okay there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if he be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed are we think about it a little bit and if ye be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed and here according to that promise I think the bride or no the hear of that promise we are know Abraham's royal seeds thank God that lawyer she died it put myself a little bit here in this I have the privilege to have Princess Alice one of the last nine one there that we would work with and she's on the island when we push my first wife right heard about better Branham and we read in the book and see that with Branham went to the palace and prayed for King George so we took one of the book brother branham's life story and we put it in the library at the library got it get those I really pray that some one of them will pick it up my wife she's little braver than me the time and she wanted to know because I wrote the message somebody said I wonder because we never heard about it that he went there or things like that there's no proof but thanks be to God my wife went and asked the princess Princess Alice she used to come every year stay there two or three months before she'd go back to England and this is not a bogus princess this is a real princess read the history was there I was saying that somebody somewhere last year and there yes were you called the Google or Asia by charm it wasn't five minutes when I just called the name and you just put it up on his phone and say you're talking to someone I say yes sir so my wife Loretta she asked if the princess if you know anything about it I should smile see ya right a little that we understand because it happened back home I had the last word - while she was clear a stranger comin want to see her right she would have to tell me before I can take it into the personal secretary and it goes I just put it prints a cloud on one of the big ask who came there one day the Hat on my uniform and things like that and asked what do you want to say come Silla princess so I went and I told who told it and she said go back and ask him what he wants to know what for I went back to this dick principle and I said please if you could just tell me purpose or the cause Oh something like that I don't want the year the whole thing goes sake they can go tell and I had to make four trips and he won and it said well tell him no cause here and he had to just turn the just field said well I'm a principal I'm having something at school and I would like you know if you could come on sister he couldn't tell it to me sorry they don't understand while she is there because I know the last king to be the one well we were there you came here but it's not published in The Gleaner nor over the radio until they leave so they hold it just like that we'll be there you take our evening walk after key four o'clock of the road okay there's a police watching some we're any home and sometimes it's run into once you say you don't have to follow me it was quite peaceful them days but it's a must so he would have to disguise himself somehow and you know when to turn a corner and he come out and walk fast and things like that but it's really not published her daughter-in-law she marked governor in Australia and she comes many times well they're there but it's when they flew out then the story come out so it's same way and his Wender that sick lady was going from South Africa to England if you read a story okay and I and things like that and they told it said when the plane stopped in England he was taken straight to the palace because the king music and saw the story opened just like that trying to say oh sure sure sure sure right cause we're abandoning him about it I live in the year coming here without six lady so it's quick as the plane lands and they check the eye and everybody come around and the auger yeah straight to the palace and that's where he left without paper or some news and things like that and prayed for the king and he got up and play his game the evening so she just confirmed it copy years ago they said still they were talking about it and so I smile I said I'm a witness now Laura's dead but I'm a witness okay and I told them as I was standing right there when Gloria out the princes the confer and then another part to it and it's the whole do the King know about him right now the Queen they have a lot of resources there was another one not a man ordinary from Canada that live over in Ireland and he he's got a lot of resources so the man that worked for him China with the one that works for the Queen but the Queen has a lot of resources and things like that so that man comes to our guest house every year right Justin all God can do things right unknown to the when they are having the Austrian disease you can Turkey where the cell is our society like that then the Queen would send his horse smack down there to purchase horse so he would stop by where this man which is the guest of that works for two days or things like that but she don't know about it because they're real friends and then he would buy our ships to for this mile so he went down to Texas I through the name the other day right and it was just talking about william branham this man that lives in Ireland with resources and things like that but I just make it here that all the time because the English they don't believe in Pentecostal preaching and things like that okay but somehow or the other this man confirmed it by this heart by a fairy queen and then you took the story from this other man down in Texas and said if that there's a man in America named freedom bran he presided six and God healed yes so they have that story and they seen it on I can say something there and they send it on and the king gave the order to have him come free so that's all it really comes out I want to say search a man wanted the preacher that was having problem with that story boy get light it up and things like that and let's just run it in this bride it is oil that we know who we are the oil is here it's true anointing is here the false anointing is here to do that right when I'm preach that is that right see but if we can get to the full knowledge who we are now I believe something will take place the bride are no hear of that promise we are no Abraham royal signal we can if we can just hold that is that right Amen believe in the word because everything that was in Jesus are in us everything that was in Jesus Christ is all soaked in the bride we have all his attributes as here's all his substance has been poured out into us as bride we got to wake up on all we are we are not just a church man though walking around our church floor we are the brave we are called we have a different College we are bones of his bones and flesh of his flesh according to 1st Corinthians 2:13 for by one spirit are we baptized into one body whether Jews or Gentiles whether we are burned-out free and have been made to drink into the one spirit hallelujah thank God we know no different to know you ever having the calling we are plugged into Christ we are therefore plumbing to Christ and cake our character from him as the fruits of the spirit we are made to conform to the image of his son as is seen in Romans 8:29 no other conformed will do we got a fit for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might I like to be the firstborn among many bridges we have to be like Jesus hallelujah God said looking at glass see who you see when you go home we have to be like here amen we are made to be like him we have not control over this this is why his word you son ate with us we are predisposed to his grace grace is a natural part of our attributes to begin with he didn't have to it was a word of it is that rat worthy of death me to be him on the earth we are made to be him on the earth current instead of 5:20 now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though Christ did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead he reconciled note we pray you in Christ's stead we act on behalf of Christ that is what ambassadors does we have been called to be ambassadors of heaven on earth hallelujah that is what ambassador just act on behalf of his home government as I said who is going to declare his government we're going to the clearest government on earth we are chosen to fulfill that by the scripture by the word and the world must confirm did we got to confirm the world we asked on behalf of Jesus Christ now when everybody say war war is a piece is that right the season of Jesus Christ is no past when he was here is that right Oh God no we are here this means that he season on the earth has been completely and we are no the carriers the bright there is a season and a time the purpose under the heaven we gotta fulfill that as brain we are not just ordinary church members we got to know who we are in yeah we got a list of that name amen is that right hallelujah and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God we have him in full measure we are in manuals but Vernon said when we get to that knowledge who we are Messiah not fall and you just come here is that right they thought they would think who he was yeah and don't look for that in this world when you start to live the Christ life it got to be live here got to be live here we have him in full measure we are as you say God is with us is that right our season hoping John 1:3 to behold know we are the sons of the OREA and it does not yet appear what we shall be but by the faith we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is there will be no difference between us and him the prophet of God and the book identification says the Word of God is a mirror and in which we see ourselves we are the reflection of the Word of God no once we are in the word the word reflects itself and it's supposed to do that individually in us we can live two different life game l1 life and he was here he lived and we have to come to that to live that one life is that right they may mock us they're going to clear us and all kinds but we have to measure up ourselves with does sit the Lord who are we they are not going to believe our reports King a heard a story about right right here in America after the first world war there's one of the royal family straightaway and you confine her she was right here in Atlanta someplace just two story to story and he was eating out of the sky right and she would tell people that I'm a part of a royal family and they were just my car that night I see have a little to say about the royal families cuz I work for them okay somehow they knew that she was alive somewhere yeah okay just like all the Jews and Syrians and kings like that after that first war is scattered and things like that there for some one day to show me right her little bunker she have to where she said if I'm lost then they'll find me see that way that's the old princess rant I mean I heard that story I said is just showing off with what she would say to us secretly she told me she said protect Princess Alice now she said when I'm in England somewhere I take the ordinary bus just guys myself sit there great with ordinary bus not only well you know sirens blowing and things like that and they don't even know where I am and they still keep searching searching searching searching for that lady and she would tell them on the street here thank you Sarah blog gone and she does walk little dock crafter and some news man come here search around because the word went out that she's alive and they came here and they found her and they know and it took her straight back right to England and join up back with the Royal comedy won't be long but I believe people don't know who we are but we are Abraham Roy y'all see that right fulfilling God's Word you tell them they're spit in your face but by God's Word are going to be what God's Word say when this word of God comes straight to you from the lips of the Prophet and tell you who you are to Revelation up of the Word of God hallelujah we got to believe it is that right everything about him will be similar to us all his attributes we are the same material that is found in him will also be found in us st. John 1:14 says that the world was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the wholly begotten son of the Father full of grace and truth we are God spoken word for this our waiting our teeefani is near hallelujah church I can't wait I hate this body for the one that is coming hallelujah never a P normal doctors hallelujah Church it is true it is true Oh God when you get grounded with the Word of God states that the Word was made flesh but a Branham preacher messages said when the word was made flesh in India I believe that you're going to come to that place where full of grace and truth he was God's Word manifests flesh for that hour when he said as a man we are God's redeem words manifests us flesh on this earth this is our season to be him no we are ambassador with a sovereign authority on the earth we reign supreme on the earth in our guns Dominion status all his might and power have been given to us Hebrews 4:12 for our strength hallelujah coming into power Jesus was God's complete truth Jesus Christ demand was God think about it truth for his day and we are the complete truth of God for our game or to say but somebody's foolishness that the churches are preaching hunting like they're the truth has been preached to us and to awake up sort of a samba hallelujah and get you as an individual to know who you are as the body of Christ we have all his attributes as he poured out all of himself into the church we are there for the complete truth walking around trying to tell people believe this profit leave the Word of God believe the 70 kgs and pinpoints the last one would be the best one to live in scored us to Z house knowing that we will make you this is the last age go back a tree revelation three he was put out then they sing they may jump Demi dance and carry on but they are ready throw him out we are the bride said thank you Jesus we are not the same of the gospel because it's a power of God unto salvation we know what we believe is true that right has the body of Christ we have all his attribute as he poured out all of himself into the church we are there for the complete truth of his word and John sensing sanctify them with my crew thy Word is truth o Lord we believe that all that history will come to pass we are God's complete truth your tents by the Word of God st. John 15:3 and the word that I speak to you they are spirit and life faith and John 6:63 we as the bride become the word by feeding upon the Word of God the younger and thirst for righteousness and you can only get it from God's eternal Word and the bride said amen that's what we want craze and dogmas will have to go from all callaloo you we are therefore blessed of the Lord say said Matthew 5:6 and some three eight his righteousness is our righteousness hallelujah has we her bones of his bones and flesh of his flesh we are his flesh bones and his blood says in Ephesians five thirty when you read that you're talking about yourself we have to macho to him now the scripture decided in st. John 1:14 above indicates that Jesus Christ was full grace of full grace grace is unmerited favor we didn't work for it we do do didn't do anything for rely because we are a part of him we are also full of grace supposed to amen is that right it's right here in God's words because we are equal to M and merited all things from him see if the parents to fall six let this nine which was in Christ Jesus be in you who found themselves to be in the form Hector can't denied thought it not robbery that's another versus I stumble are we going to believe what God said thought it not robbery to be equal with God hallelujah a years I couldn't understand that he was a man glorified of God the Bride of Christ is also men glorified not in some ways that some will take it but God's Word we have to be fulfilled all over whom he did predestinate I'm sure each and every one of us can say by debris of the message of the hour get to the Bible truth of predestination son then he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified the bride I'd like to talk about the bread as I say many times in church back yonder is the thing I want to be a bride the bride are called justified and glorified the bride have stepped up a notch glorified diets of divinity supernatural rams heavenly places in Christ Jesus Kingdom living hallelujah Romans eat went 17 which state that we are joined here with Christ it's hard sometimes for five senses to get us to believe what God thing things about us maybe in types what they hold on to Joseph okay and the Word of God must be fulfilled because don't have a dream and it got to be fulfilled we are full of grace ready to forgive it's kind of hard sometimes but we have to match up with the world of law God forgive them for they know not what they are doing until we come to that place church and we can say Lord forgive them because if they would only know they won't always but I don't know so grace is what allows God amen or since even when we were undeserving of his favor grace what allow us to be blessed of the Lord as is seen in sound 3:8 we hear it is seeing think think of that you see that his blessings is upon his people and so we are going to get it we are blessed because for being his just by believing what he said Amen hundred thousand heard it and just walk up the hills to be full of grace as Jesus was is to be full of blessing also I will make thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing Abraham seed is talking he's talking the Bride of Christ or being blessed by his royal seed who is the Lord Jesus Christ God linked like kissa to his pokin seed word by his grace by grace are ye saved through faith and it takes that and not of yourself it is a gift and it's a perfect gift a man of God vision to it will tell you that God's grace is a yearning to be reunited with his spoken words Jesus Christ says that no man can come unto me except the father draws him first we have been drawn by the father and all that the father draws will come we are a part of that bunch we are therefore drawn to God because we are words in the first place we are full of grace also to identify up with him God's grace is a deep-seated yearning by God on us as the bride to be united again believe that oh he loves his bride remember he said and it's proven to Adams bride fail hallelujah he's rayul he choose fail but this bride can never fail his reign was put away hallelujah harem wife was gone amen because of his love for her according to the Bible hadn't in sin but because of his love purposely like Jesus Christ is that we claim her and today that regulation of the message of the oh we know who we are Loreena did not deserve it either but God through His grace upon us and he has chosen us to be him standing at his side to be eternally one and it's going to prove that is that right first in the Millennium there's going to be a millennial and he and little Gentile bride oh yeah he'll be sitting on that throne to fulfill what he said it to daily and we are just waiting for that fulfillment of the hour because not one of God's
