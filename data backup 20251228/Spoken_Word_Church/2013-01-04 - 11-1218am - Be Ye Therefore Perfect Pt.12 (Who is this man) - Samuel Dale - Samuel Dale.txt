========================================

is let's look at 3.95 that's 395 in the red church oh oh oh glory be oh yay lord jesus oh come oh let's turn over 397. somehow silent night is is me is is hallelujah i oh god open the eye of my heart yeah open the eyes of my heart oh shining in the light of your glory foreign holy oh the children that come come and sing for us um might work uh yeah yes so everyone when i was a sleeper me oh is jesus christ christ wrong one um and that was good the children were read we see god in thing amen let's stand together like turning these scriptures turned to matthew 5 and psalms 32 matthew 5 psalms 32 and remember we're eating together today after the service and then we will not be having an afternoon service we will be fellowshipping together and i'll remember now there will not be a service here next sunday on the 25th so we say to all of you and out on the internet system and everything uh you know merry christmas to you you know and just have a good time and all of those things remember those that are traveling around in them called and asked us to remember them driving back today so remember that all right let's see then the what's not service will be on the 31st you remember that brother tom ernest from wichita kansas will be preaching for us and then he'll be preaching on the sunday service which will be a one o'clock service on the first of january will be a one o'clock service 1pm now so remember that okay now uh we're gonna because of our conflict of doing and a lot of people are out this weekend and everything and it generally works that way around christmas time so we've come up with an idea that next year starting next year now we're going to have our thanksgiving and our christmas time together as one time all right it will be the first sunday in december okay first sunday in december unless there's a snowstorm you know we will schedule it to be from then on and put our thanksgiving together with our christmas because it's always a conflict of everybody backwards and forth and a bunch missing today so just you know just remember that and be much in prayer that the lord would bless all of us anything no other announcements for the watch night service bring finger food bring finger food for the what's not service some sweets and finger food and all this where we'll have something when the service is over you know so just your sisters fix you you know a little bit of finger food or something and and something in the sweet line you know where we can have something after the service is over with anything else i generally forget amen matthew 5 and psalms 32. heavenly father we thank you for this day in the hour we thank you for your love and your grace and to us we thank you for the children lord that would stand today and sing from their heart and tell us that they want to go tell it on the mountain and lord just tell it everywhere so let's just be that way father and you that we could go and testify and witness all around and just let your light shine in our hearts and let jesus christ be the one who would be living in us forgive our sins lead us by that understanding hand that we may walk in you and lord teach us to wait upon you bless those that are not here and when they see the the services then by way of internet then we pray that you bless them also we love you guide us now and keep us in jesus name amen now brother richard wilson i forgot to announce it but his sister pat she fell the other day and broke her foot and everything so they had to operate on that so remember that and brother hobart arnold the brother there he's about 81 2 3 or something like that years old but he has now went uh because i reckon of the diabetic condition he's blind in both eyes so it was just one now it's moved into the other one so just remember that and keep praying for him he's kind of a guy that likes to get out and go so it's going to be really a hindrance to him you know so pray that the lord would help him and bless him all right so matthew 25 matthew 5 37 we've been reading so let's just read this and go on into the message today and just hold your hats on because i may surprise you in a little bit what i have to say okay uh matthew 5 37 but let your communications be yeah so ever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard it hath been said an eye for an eye and a two for a two but i say unto you that ye that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man shall sue thee at the law take away and take away thy cop let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow thee turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children so you'll manifest that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven now that same father is one down here he's supposed to be just as perfect right right okay for he maketh your son to rise on the evil and on the good and send his reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now let's go to psalms 32 verse 1 and 2. blessed is he whose transgressions is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputed not iniquity and who knew spirit there is no god he may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now i ask you a question there last weekend or sometime there of who is this man that we would think about that his sins would not be imputed intuitive and uh i've got some good answers good thoughts you know and they're all they've all been correct and it's relating to the situation that we're talking about but i still want to ask you a question before we enter into the doings because we're going to read they're going to pull up psalms go ahead and pull it up brother anderson um romans 4 7 and 8 and then we'll go to um psalms 32 1 and 2 we want them together so just pull up uh pull it on that brother until you just leave six and seven and eight and then put the other underneath all right now i want to ask you a simple question where is there a man anywhere that this would qualify to be able to say these things now we've had people who've tried to express uh their views and their thoughts about these things and as i said some of you gave me uh statements and they were good and it's relating to the the point but i want you to be real careful with me today to pay close attention because the psalmist david taken from romans you know bring it up put these two this is the psalmist david this is the romans paul all right now the psalmist david says you know basically it's a little different that's where you want to read it together now basically they say the same thing blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin now it's odd that these two men would make this statement then thinking of the psalmist david was he a special filler was he a seed as we call it in the message you know how they want to prove noah was a seed this was a seed that was a seed everybody wants to run seeds into all of these things and i thank god i didn't get a one some of you may think that and didn't write it down but i didn't get a statement that it was because it was born with a seed in them so at least you're listening amen because you know i don't believe that amen all right that's right i believe that everybody is born with an opportunity that's right brother brown talks about the great faith he said everybody's born with that faith all right say well there was a seed in me yeah i agree with it but a seed without life what is it a seed cannot reproduce itself it must be put through processes no matter where it would be the natural seed of an individual or a corn seed you know whatever it has to be brought through processes all right but now who is david and paul talking about when you would look at david and you'd say well david has there ever been any sin imputed to you you said blessed is a man to whom sin would not be imputed david is it not so that you were not able to go and build a house for god because you shed too much blood and with that blood would be what's the name of your eye you know besheba's husband so david all of his life was paying for the things that he done and was forbidden now to build god a house that's right so david who are you talking about oh that's right paul you say it in romans unless it is a man to whom the lord will not impute sin but paul i remember you writing to the corinthians a note ii corinthians 5 and 10. to worry that you was reminding people that that's right be careful that there was a judgment seat that we all must stand before right so paul are you in one side of your mouth saying sin is not imputed and on the other side of your mouth you're telling us to be careful because records can be killed who is this man to whom sin is not imputed now we get into the next message the lord willing i think brother forney's supposed to come this coming wednesday for the 40's possibly going to be here wednesday so we're just leaving that way possibly he's in africa right now but the next message we'll pick up in john you know how the seed reminded the enemy cannot stand we'll get into that and we'll cover those things but i'm just asking you a simple question very slow very wanting you to think is these men saying one thing and living another is it all right for us as supposingly being believers christians born again is it all right for us to just go out and live like the devil because it's not imputed what do you think very solid very serious what do you think that's right is it that we should go out as i was quoting the other day paul's saying that you know let us sin that grace may abound you know in other words somebody believed paul was saying that so we made an outland an outlandish statement about it you said god forbid because if we serve that sin we are of that sin amen so now as he's saying it's okay well i'm so goody-goody you know all right we would surely get away from that to not think about how goody-goody we are you know some special thing you know my people came over on the mayflower yeah yeah probably a bunch of crooks they run out of the country over there because they certainly didn't send the best over here to start with that's right like castro sent us opened up his prisons and sent us all of his goody goody people didn't he yeah right but now i told you the other night that's the hardest thing to try to preach is a straight line on grace and works and life and doings because of our previous teachings our understandings and our thoughts of human mortals we think that maybe there was some reason god saved us something i'd done or didn't do somebody have to be born in the right family yes that's my point who is that man that paul's talking about who is that man that david is talking about right that god won't impute sin is it okay to just live like the devil it doesn't matter what i do i'm born again that's a good baptist once they always say doctrine then a good method this is you know don't teach it no more the baptists don't either but a good method is this and just make sure you're right when you go down because you can be sanctified and lose it and sanctify and lose it just make sure you're on the upward plane when you pass on and i'm not making a lot of those people that's that's right that's right if i make light of anything it's of you and i because we can hold those doctrines and refuse to look straight at it and see what we've got that's right and justify our condemn of course we do a lot of justifying ourselves right and condemning everybody else right and very little condemning ourselves it's generally we're looking down at somebody else and what they do or don't do but i'm just asking you a simple question why would those men say that all right now i want you to look at it very seriously but now i want you to remember you out on the internet remember it then we're going to read what brother brown says in a minute david did not say blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin those are not verbatim words of david those are verbatim verbatim words of paul right amen now david said that in the basis of brother branham when the statements will come he said see david in the scripture says blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin so evidently paul is summing up the statement that david was trying to make and remember the situation that david was under the law not a born-again believer you agree because jesus had not been glorified the scripture said so the holy ghost could not been given the scripture says all right so david is evidently speaking something by the spirit of god because that's what we believe he was doing right right you know my prophecy men of old they brought us the word but looking at it from his situation he could not see the totality or conclusion of the matter that paul could see right amen so he would word it a little different because he would not have the understanding to word it but now listen then when the prophet would quote david as saying these things remember the prophet is putting together what david is saying with the conclusion of what paul contended to say of what david was trying to or finished saying what david was trying to say that's right everybody with me amen so now look at it see the psalmist david says blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered all right blessed is a man to whom the lord imputed not iniquity in whose spirit there is no god but when paul brought it forth in his statement in romans 4 he says even as david described the blessings of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness maybe he didn't mention righteousness of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works david didn't mention those things right but one of them is looking at it one way the other one is looking right and concluding what this are telling us what the spirit was trying to say through david right amen are you listening david was trying to say these things but he didn't have the words right the thoughts the holy ghost to direct him only as a leader by speaking by the spirit all right look so paul says i heard he's concluding that faith without you know imputed righteousness without works sin blessed is that they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered all right now david says your sins are covered your iniquities are forgiven so they're holding their point right because david was looking at it as only the fact that his sins could be covered paul is looking at it that his sins was eradicated that's right away with it but david couldn't see that but he knew as i was trying to express to start with then he wasn't allowed to build a temple for that and he got into trouble and lost a baby and all kind of things on because of his life that's right that he lived and paul summed it up by saying we're not supposed to sin that grace may abound right we're going to give an account of these deeds and things we do in our bodies if we don't confess them here right right now we get rid of them here they won't be anything right see god can't remember i love that what brother adam said you know i can't see what somebody else has asked god and god has forgiven them i can't pull it out and tell them about it i like that heaven yes sir so david is here speaking of a covering of god not imputed iniquity in whose spirit there's no child he's speaking of a great man heaven he doesn't say blessed is a man to whom the lord will not impute sin in verbatim words right but when david picks it up by the same holy spirit that told this man to say this the same holy spirit brings it through this man and he concludes it in verse 8 by saying blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin amen now so in order to give you some idea of what i'm talking about that and i'm being real slow because i want to be but i want you to think about what i'm saying all right so then one man is looking at a future point of salvation and doesn't see the total clarity of his existence so he doesn't speak and say that blessed is the man to whom god will not infuse in david doesn't say that right but when paul concludes his of what david is trying to say by the spirit then he brings it down into new testament words and shows us what david was trying to say by the spirit right david was prophesying of a man right and david said this look and david said this down here blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin he would have had to have the new birth yep that's right that's right so by not having a new birth and even though the holy spirit can direct a man to to say things he will not direct him over the uh beings of where he's at the psalmist david great thing sit out there i have a man killed in one day and the next day sit out there and say they pierce my hands and my feet right just seeing the joys of the lord right in writing the bible are you following me yes right so when brother random concludes his he concludes by tying together paul and this says david said is the man to whom god will not impute sin because he knows what both of them was talking about in the spirit amen when i was in the spirit was seeing the possibility in his day that his sins could be covered by the atonement that his iniquity could be forgiven by his honest confession of his heart you agree amen but paul looks back at it from the new birth and he concludes it by saying see blessed is the man whom god will not impute sin so there must be somebody now we're going to tie this together with a purist message we've been reading matthew you know be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and i hope we came to the conclusion to see that it could not be saying uh what we used to think it said and he's come to the conclusion of seeing that the only person that can be as perfect as god is is god himself unless our righteousness then the same man said exceeds the righteousness which means they were not guilty as i said about paul concerning the law of blameless he said but he couldn't find the righteousness god was looking for because it's impossible to do that without having a new birth amen so unless you're exceeding the rights and describes the first season with no wise enter so we found out that a man that the only way he could do that was to be born again amen right and then that born-again experience is what makes us just as perfect as god is right right right it's not mine own righteousness paul said that's filthy right smile called it right but the righteousness which is by faith right or what was imputed unto us because of our believing amen right amen now because of our believing our faith god could impute righteousness unto us and not just cover our sins that won't work right you got to be eradicated right that's right not just divorce put away sit over side some that can come back up later no that's right that'll be eradicated all right so then if we have the new birth i don't let my notes don't forget it if we have the new birth the new birth is the life of god right amen not i that live us but what christ that liveth in me and the life that i now live in the flesh i live with the faith of god all right now somebody remind me after a while if i get through you just say stop now finish that about that new birth tied together with our lives and about the flesh so keep up with that way after a while you say hold it you didn't finish it because if i lose the thought then i'd have to preach for an hour to get it back so let him hang on but now listen by the new birth which is to receive the life of jesus christ those were related to basically the thoughts that was given to me you know in the form of relating to the new birth and receiving christ and letting christ live in us and coming from uh genesis 1 26 man which is eternal life all right the soul of god divided amongst the born-again believers makes all of us god made manifest in human flesh by the new birth problem with that makes us his children and that's what we've been reading in matthew but you'd be his children and then we would manifest these things outwardly about the so you get the court you know give him this do this do that then you would wind up and have the life of god all right so now the new birth means more than the prophecy than anything else in the world that's right because only by the new birth can we have eternal life all right justification is wade who's been preaching to us that's done one wonderful job talking about the the justification saying pitch the baptism and hold us from abraham and no but see justification is a work of the holy spirit now remember that thought here while don't let me lose it sanctification is a work of the holy spirit that's right justification chops off your past sins there's nothing to your nature whatsoever just chops off that sin brings you a new nature yeah why because it's chopped off if it's chopped off then it's supposed to have that been gone that's right that's why people used to tell me so boy when i got born again i quit this out in the other i said well i quit that before right i was even considered i guess to be justified you know right sanctification is a work of the holy spirit that's right i'm cleansing and setting aside for service but the baptism is the holy spirit amen right that's right which is the life of god now i wanted to have weight wednesday night so much but i better let him preach his whole message we kept on reading all of that by and referred to by faith by faith you get time one of these days i want you to go in there and see how many by faith they are in hebrews 11. there's only one true faith all the rest of those by know why why does he keep saying about faith by faith by faith by saying and then one time it says true faith because every one of them was by faith it was things they lived and done no by faith nor done this by faith abraham done this by faith this was done by faith but then all at once right in the middle of it it says through faith say yep say amen one true of a whole crowd oh sarah is the top of the bride amen amen see we're going through a journey all of them byes had already been done so paul wasn't going to leave it but it'd only be by what all them done he wanted to bring it down to the day we're living amen so he said sarah through faith i want to say receive seed remember through faith amen you know that was the journey wade was talking about that you go through a journey through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and then you just really start your journey you know that's right because that's when you get born again and you're still going through amen so sarah paul concludes now here's our thoughts let's see if i can get it i thought say that abraham had enough for him and sarah so he just got his change and then he changed her see we led all to abraham right let's read that what is it hebrews 11. i'll make sure you get it right but i'm sitting there thinking oh lord i like to preach for an hour now okay all right through faith also savor herself first all right receive strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she would pass the age because she judged him faithful who had promised right through faith you can see seed that's what i'm saying we wanted all abraham abraham abraham sarah didn't have nothing all i want to preach about her was if hadn't just been part of abraham god it just killed right her that what you hear free do you ever preach that she was the top of the bride of christ and our abraham is not brother brethren and we're going through a journey to come to the ability of sarah did right so we only counted in abraham like i said he got his change he woke up one morning he looked over it's right reverse the way i say it right you know how i say it he woke up one morning looked over and i was a young woman he said i'm in the wrong bed but see we want to say it hey grant looked over they're saying you know i feel funny you look in the mirror yeah and i woke up the wrong man all right but i'm young that's the way we want it done what do you call that male shoulder this pitch is that the way the word is fart forgive me if i get it wrong on everything late to the man but remember she's the bride and sarah through faith a big long journey that she went through watching abraham he said well i don't understand the coop he's crazy he lets him push him around he doesn't give a lot all this land he's done you i could have been down there with him in that city i'll go with him because i'm his wife like wade said gave her away a couple of times they ain't an argument written no word she said to that guy why did she turn around what'd it be done today wouldn't it right nobody you ain't giving me away i'll have you know it hey king he's my husband was she respecting him that's right because she knew without him she didn't have anything that's right we might want to preach a lot about sarah and their faith because it seems like she had more faith in abraham because abraham lied and give her away and she's willing to give her life to a king to save her a rotten stinking lion husband maybe we want to preach on the saber son the blood of christ maybe she knows more about it he did maybe she knew what he's written about him you know i'm saying about offering up isaac it's written about him that he you know he knew he had had a mess from one from the dead but it's not written about that when when he's given her away a couple of times the only writing about it is this prophet the end time saying god was protecting that vessel because he had done said sarah would be the one that would bring the child amen that's right right do what abraham said say now you're going down there with a man live with him about 20 years and god's going to come along and get you away from him get back to me it ain't in there folks that's right i wanted to preach about an hour or two behind him on wednesday night jesus through faith a journey she traveled through watching that man kept watching that man and seeing who that man was meeting and what was taking place and she was just right there with me and then one day she looks at him he's young and she looks in the mirror and she's young do you realize something took place dennis went now listen because she was made young didn't make her worse you could conceive right when she was young to start with come on read your bible that's what i said maybe we ought to preach a lot like that folks but see after she has turned back young during the time he's giving her away the second time somewhere in there she got the idea that she could conceive so we were to pay close attention to the writing of the bible as i said about the psalmist david then and paul paul is concluding the matter from a born-again experience of saying what the holy spirit was speaking through david and concluded blesses the man to whom god will not impute sin paul is standing in that new birth that new creation as he says in corinthians make you a new creature in christ jesus a new creation so he's standing in that new creation and he knows who he knows he can't go out and live like the devil and get by with it because he's explaining that god forbid if that's what you think that's right he's seeing what's taking place that by the new birth within him right right by the new birth that is within him he's seeing the man that god won't impure sin he can't impute it the prophet said over the token he said because the token is laying there to cover you amen now brother anderson pull those back up because i want you to pay close attention but while he's pulling that up go over to corinthians where's that go to second corinthians while we got this one on the board up here go to second corinthians 10 5 excuse me second corinthians and verse 10. but i want you to watch this reading i said remind me to make sure to come back because now notice david you're talking about transgressions and sins and you know you're talking about the man but you don't bring him to righteousness you bring him into iniquity and iniquity is knowing to do good won't do it you know or he is sin and paul is describing the blessedness and saying that whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered so they're both covering the fact of a covering but paul is looking at the covering as the blood of jesus christ by the new birth right paul is look that david is looking at the covering of the atonement right amen now so let's read here in second corinthians got it 5 10 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the thing receive the things done in his soul according to that he had done oh did i misread that yeah oh what did he say there oh and everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he had done whether it be good or bad now a lot of difference in your soul your body amen if you're born again believer and have eternal life in your soul you don't have it in your body and your spirit right there can be no imputing of anything within the soul of an individual that's born again right right you agree because that's eternal life you can't impute to god sin so they can't you can't sin we'll get to that later when it says it's seed remain attended we don't have time today so paul says here that it's the deeds in the body there's not going to be a judgment the judgment the white throne judgment is to decide whether or not you give eternal life in your soul right amen right paul is not talking about a decision of eternal life right he's talking about the deep done in the body whether they be you know what and then we rewarded we covered that on the bible study saturday night or last saturday all right paul knows it by the new birth there's no way to impute sin to the soul of an individual that is born again christ amen you agree amen but in our bodies in our spirits we do wrong and we must confess those things here our health and through that so that's why marriage and divorce had to be preached right to clear the body or there would have been no flesh saved that's right all right see then you know a christian don't sin with his soul right but his body and his spirit is still subject to this world agree now we need to explain that you talk about sin right the prophet of god says not sin to drink smoke run around with women come home right so then the word sin must be divided into smaller things and going into greater things right or else how are you going to understand it when paul would speak of the sins of the body and he'd even say who can deliver me from this body that i am he said with my body i serve the law of sin but with the inner man i serve the law of god amen right which is what where there is no sin all right so then a christian brought around said and we'll cover these because there's two ways you've got to cover it a christian cannot sin but then he says the christians are what it does sin now if that ain't answered correctly you've got confusion right right all right so we'll get to that but now so we conclude that it's not all right to go out and just live like the devil in our bodies okay that's right right our bodies are supposed to be brought under subjection to the one that's within us that's right eat too much but you know what we got to eat we just don't have to eat too much i probably need two months talking about before we go down and eat right when he left brother gary back there we got a holler leg i said one night with that man and he got five plates off of the salad bar it rhymes five piled up plates until hannah finally told him gary i'm getting ashamed of you eating she was a little girl in that was five plates off the salad bar that wasn't his meal but i had not told him order the biggest steak you want he got the biggest steak and baked potato and all that ryan's had to go on top of the five plates i think that's eating too much now don't judge me there now but i think that's meant little bit too much all right maybe four plates my brother mold had a way of saying it he said a water pipe three-quarter inch or a 55-gallon drum you can only fill it up oh that's gonna come out yeah after so long all right is it a sin to be a husband and wife you're gonna be a slack world i'm you know haven't even been on the monster is it a sin for a husband and wife to desire each other no it's a sin for you to desire the neighbor right that's right come on so we providing sin anything's not a faith about what's any sin right right but yet life is life we have to eat we have to sleep we have to work we have to do all of these things right there let's not sin right yeah we can make it sin right but what we do with it that's right that's right all right so you understand what i'm saying and with the soul of a born-again believer he cannot sin because god is dwelling within him but our bodies and spirit is in the world that we're controlled by and we've got problems and we allow those things to override yes you remember the man that in the hebrew series that the preacher he just got fed up with it probably about like i do about two or three times every day but he got gets fed up with it so much until he just finally he sits down quick how do you get somebody else get him some beer though says i ain't buying a preacher a beer or something that degree two weeks later he died and went from heaven but around said he couldn't let god couldn't let his child marry his name but now you see somebody living 20 years they claim they backflip 20 years ago and they're still christians i don't like that idea i don't agree with it now if you do that's all right i'm naive but i'm not that naive right you know i believe people but not quite that much short period right because the bible says the day you find out this you get rid of it right don't mean your later see that's right you just decreasing anybody no no i don't de-christianize anybody that's right you do it yourself that's right yes sir and she's like what wait reading that list off about the ones he was going to be praying for some of your children's on that list you get mad because he read your child's name i got one answer do you not want your children saved do you not want your family that's right something wrong with you you would have been the one to come and put your name on the list brother came to me as a service and he said i want my name put on there amen i don't know whether i'm saved or not i said brother keep on going all right i said we got a man here for a year saw god i said you've got another one that's speaking to you for two years that's all god about the new birth you don't give up you get upset because your name your child's name is called you better remember one thing you've got the wrong spirit right now that's your pastor said whether you like it or not that's right because that's the way it is you don't want your family saved well i think my family is you know my story i try to go all of my life seeking god get it to end and find out i got it then i'm not sick of it all to get that find out i didn't have that's attributes of your flesh that is caused by your spirit because your flesh is totally useless without the spirit to motivate it right the inner soul of an individual that's born again they cannot sin that's right within our spirit and our bodies we can alright now i want to conclude one thing all right let me ask you a question okay am i ready who's the man that god wanted you to sin now don't say jesus right and then told you when i started it the other day don't say jesus i'm not talking about it who's the man woman whoever you want to say man means mankind women men who is the person that god will not impute sin it's not jesus that's right that's right as i said you're gonna get a shot can i say that's what i'm fixing to say anything but one person that god won't impute sin and that's a person that's dead i wanted that answer from somebody didn't get it you can't impute sin to a dead man would you like the quote my daddy's been dead since 1945 could you accuse him of committing a crime yesterday or today no because he's dead now you say but i thought it's a new blessing the only way you can have the new birth see that's where the key was missing amen you thought about the new birth and you got that right okay but you didn't think about you got to be dead before you'd be born again that's right you've got to be dead before you can be born again that is the man that god won't impuke sin to he's a dead man amen that's right amen it's not i that liveth but christ that liveth in me how many of you won't have run around say dead to sin but alive in jesus christ amen that's right dead men don't sin you say with a new birth but you've got to die before you get the new birth you're missing that point there's your journey of justification and sanctification if you're dying dying after yourself right amen to be made alive in jesus christ that's right you never heard brother brown say we baptized he's talking about buried but he said baptized too many alive people that's right is that a quote that's right that's right the dead man's only man that can't sin you've got to be dead before you can be born again that's what paul said now let's get it for a minute real quick paul said in corinthians that can make you a new creature right a new creation right i got a quotation who wrote around said he won't impute sins of this creed this creature you can cut them out of service with it didn't put them up you can't impute sin over the token he said because the token is laying there which is the life of god living in your soul but you had to die to be able to be born again that's right and when you died you didn't come forth the same person if you did there's something wrong that's why we don't die a lot of times we just get baptized we go through justification sanctification we get an anointing upon our spirit that's right yes sir we get an anointing on our spirit we go to church we glory hallelujah shout and feel good and then we died that's right that's it you had a brother calling wade did the brother dick number pinched in wednesday or something you know that's just to show that we're still alive out here now you didn't die physically to get the new birth that's not what we're talking about all right we die spiritually right will you tell me any other word for it justification and sanctification cleans the vessel but it don't destroy it that's right go to the future home and read it he says it takes the fiery baptism to clean out what's left sanctification cleanse and set aside you say well what's left me and you that's what's left and what we need to do is die of ourselves and that's right because right after that jim jones situation years ago you remember where all them people killed herself and they they asked fred hooper down at work one day said is sam are trying to trying to get you to kill yourself he said he's been trying to get me to kill myself ever since i've known him that's right i know you don't like me that's what i do people look down at the coffin and they say and i know you're honest i'm not throwing off on it you say well don't he look good no he's dead all right all right that's right i know what you're talking about the undertaker's done the best you can do to fix him up but he's dead well you know what that's what i want to be that's right now my flesh and my spirit is what's still alive there's what i have to give an account for them things it's done in my body and my spirit my soul is born paul said make him a new creature a new creation brother branham says you want these quotes not the old creation made over that's why everybody wanted to say you had to be some kind of get a new bodies and all this at the other no he's talking about the soul dying and the holy ghost coming in to live that's the person that god won't impute sin you see if i go out and do things wrong in my body today you know what he'll impute that because if i don't get rid of it he's going to make me answer one day right so now you see david and you paul you see what they were doing we got a recovery we got an advocate we're the father we can't die and go to hell if we're born again you can't sin enough to go to hell if you're born again but if you're born again you ain't gonna want to sin right amen you'll be condemned immediately and quit that's right right that's right because we don't god let's take us off the scene that's right what do you think about it we need to be dead that's right because that's the qualifications to get the baptism in the holy ghost right amen that's right it's for us to be willing to die out to ourselves and let him come and live not turning over a new leaf that's right that's justifications thank you that's correct repent and get rid of this don't do it that's wonderful but are we dead you know the bread around says we don't have any rights hungry is that true right amen we don't have any rights to think we don't have any rights of anything right if we're christians right a lamb we forfeit our rights we give up everything that we got notice the prophets did we marry too many people that are not dead what's wrong with the church pews today people sitting in them they're not needed right they're religious they want to go to church and be good that's all it's sanctification that's correct amen i didn't have as much trouble with the world when i was i'm talking about the world when i got sanctified in the baptist church and i know i did because the lord took away the desires right and the problems i had i didn't have as much trouble dealing with this old body as i do now right sure you know why because satan knows he's going to lose it pretty quick one way or the other like brother carol said he said i'm 80 years old so it doesn't matter to me whether i've changed or died he said because on that's it's pretty quick for me well but you know if we die you can live that's right let me die that he might live what does paul say he that is dead how can he live any longer they're in paul speaks a lot about it brought a reference sometime on just being dead right you know die out yourself for being born again or whatever just run reference especially with brother brown and just see what he's talking about right he's talking about how that we must die he said that old william brown right he said he died what about it right amen what do we think about it our sister just wants to be more dead than she's ever been is that all of her desires father you heard her sister heffer to just die out to herself and let you live lord then that'll take care of all things the deader we are the more alive you can be we love you and we thank you we just commit everything to you and lay our hands upon our sister believe in you that you'll help her to die just die yourself and come forth in you because it's a death all the way through the christian life then we die out of ourselves and get born again then there's a death through our life and we just keep dying out clean it out all in places that is not needed we love you and we thank you thank you for a person to have that desire in their heart in jesus name anybody else just have a name what do we got 478 he's coming let's see 4 78 478. in the spiral book you have a need just come and let's believe and let's see father in the name of jesus christ would you always be able to do it surely is are you good for me a new creation keep it covered let me die me end right i mean even just looking around you know not a lot of years left for a lot of us anyway that's right that's right and you know what if they're not a few left for a lot of it a lot of you don't catch up with us there won't be much left that's right but what are we going to believe and just accept that's right that's it and just pray and say lord let me die just let me die until i'm so dead and doing nothing bothering me and that's what we need and then we need to just listen to god let him direct amen i started to get up the other day to go hunt i still don't know the answer i started to go hunting don't say don't go don't go i said well hey lord is it you or whatever is it me just afraid you know to go or what is it what's the trouble i don't know i just parade went crow back into bed and said forget it you want to be more concerned and then pray right that's right lord wakes you up in the middle of the night somebody comes on your mind pray about it right call our name pray about it to be with that person that's right sure do you never know what the intersection is being done you never know what god is taking care of in the line of where you're at yep think of these things are we dead enough because i thought the bible said that the dead in christ she'll rise first right now houses can be dead and crushing there's no way that you you can't be in christ and die so it's not saying that right you can't be in christ a christian don't die what's it saying because every born-again believer that went down died in christ father we thank you for this day we ask you this bless us with your love and understanding to let us understand what's taking place here and we need you to help us to die lord lead us by that understanding and bless us as everybody out there listens may they just not life and say well what kind of a sermon was that but may they search in their hearts to learn that we need to die because some will do that some will like and say what a simple thing why anybody can know we can die but lord we need to die that you might live blessed and god each and every one of us go with us now we need a natural meal we ask your father you just sanctify this food that we all may fellowship together and lord may it be in you that we eat and have our being we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen you just
