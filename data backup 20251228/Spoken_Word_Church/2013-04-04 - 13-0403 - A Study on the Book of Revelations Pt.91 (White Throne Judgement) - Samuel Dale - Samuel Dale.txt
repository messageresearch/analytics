========================================

um let's sing a couple praises here key of c only believe amen holy is is that should be in prayer for next week for me i won't be able to make it here but the lord has blessed me with the opportunity to share what he's done for me and my job and it's taking me to las vegas and i have corporate coming in wednesday here and leaving out wednesday night flying there and that's all about what he's done and i get to share it with all of them so they've been blessed because he's blessed me he put me in a job reclaimed it and uh never been without thank you amen so give him the glory amen open the eyes of my heart foreign pour out your power and love you holy holy oh amen amen amen is that a desire in your heart to see the lord well then he'll make a way good to see everybody in the house of the lord we're glad to have june's father back there with us gene tonight good to see him thank the lord remember now the announcements were made that the easter festival will be this coming saturday two o'clock starting the evening about five and then we will be having our bible study at six o'clock there at the park at gillsville and just having a good time and the lord come and be with us and but you better bring you a hat and a jacket because it may be cool and it'll be best to bring you a cheer you know or whatever you need some things because you might be there for a while and be better to have them than have to go back and get them so just remember that anything else that we need to bring back yeah make sure that the kids are they you know to gather their little easter egg baskets sometimes we didn't have it this past weekend we haven't hit this next one so make sure the kids have a little basket with them where they can get out and search for a few eggs and and have a good time somebody said here a while back they said well brother dale's church at lula is the only place in the message that has easter egg hunt so i guess that may be true but i'm not worried about it you know i don't have time i don't answer to anybody else that's right that's right an answer to him in that way you know if that's going to send us somewhere then we'll get there i guess but you know okay if you want to turn in your scripture turn to revelations 1 and revelations 20. just pray for the sick among us and on these many things and many of us are having problems you know when the age factor is involved with a lot of us and that's doing it too but we don't have to give up we can just stand on our own and go on now we're changing about at the back back there and tonight i was in three places and out in the hallway so i'm doing pretty good they're gonna find a place for me eventually you know but that's okay we'll get it all done i appreciate these brothers that are doing it you know and getting everything set and it'll be a whole lot better for us to operate better camera systems and different things before we can get a better view and doing things and we certainly do appreciate all that are working and doing so you just remember these and tell them how much you appreciate them you know and the lord will bless us father we thank you for an opportunity tonight to come out we thank you that you would just give us this opportunity because lord without you there would be no air to breathe there'd be no food to eat there'd be nothing because you're god and you supply all things we thank you we just ask you now to be here tonight with us not as an onlooker to watch what we're doing and record it but yet lord to be here as the one to open your word and that you would speak to each one of our hearts lord we love you and we thank you we just committed all into your hands now believing that you will take care of all things because we we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us down in jesus name amen revelations 1 1-3 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him the show and to his servants things which might shortly come to price and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written to our end for what for the time is at hand what the time to reveal okay now let's go over to revelations 20 and we'll begin reading about verse 11. and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which would were in it and death and hell delivered of the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire you may be seated the lord added blessing to the reading of the word now we've been in the book of revelations and we're finally getting over to the part that we enjoy speaking about and lord willing will pick up sunday and get on the end of revelation 21 and 22 to be able to try to to um you know speak on a few things and uh you know then we'll move on to some other topic but of course we could stay i was looking today i was laughing my own self because we could stay right here at this point and spend three months just speaking from this scripture that i read tonight so you probably now by now realize it could be done so you know it uh but we'll try not to i want to try to move into a place because that's what we want to see is the future but see it by revelation now remember what we were talking about sunday that you know talking about the resurrection and see martha said to jesus when he spoke to her about lazarus and she said you know lazarus will rise again in the end time and you know she believed in that they believed in a general resurrection or a resurrection of all mankind you know they're going there but when she spoke and said whatever you say now or whatever you speak the lord will honor that in other words paraphrasing the scripture right and the prophet of god said that touched him and he turned to her and he says i am the resurrection that your brother will raise right now right because i am the resurrection all right and i said that was like sister hattie wright when she spoke to brother brother around spoken and she spoke back and said that ain't nothing but the truth and she got salvation for her two children right and like elijah was when the the widow woman you know when i mean i went over the woman's son that had passed away and and she went there you know and she had confidence in him and he said well here take the staff servant and run over lay it on the child maybe you know pre-adventure he knew that the staff was anointed and maybe things would be all right she told her she said i'm gonna leave it right that's right i'm not leaving do you go with me well you know that touched him well you know what he may have to pray may have had to pray seven times laying over the body of that child but yet the child came to life because that was a great thing see what i'm trying to do is talk about revelations not the book of revelations but revelation itself because without revelation we cannot be saved all right see he that cometh to god must believe that he is in a rewarder of them that diligently seek him the scripture says all right so then we must have a revelation not just a concept or a thought and not just to speak on something and say well we're glad we know this is what this is you know maybe others before us knew what that was also but to speak of it from ourselves and try to to be able to uh bring about a revelation within ourselves and what i want to do tonight and i'll repeat it again in a minute but what i want to do tonight this is the prophet of god says revelations and daniel is daniel is the book of revelation of the old testament in other words so what's in the book of revelations is over the book of daniel we went through some of those things all right now when we get to it in a minute i want to just compare the two writings of revelations and and daniel and do it in the basis you remember when brother branham was preaching the seals and he got over to the sixth seal and he said uh now i thought i'd just take something a little different tonight instead of just pounding on what that was he said you know i want to do something different and he did he took matthew 24 and compared it with revelation 6. amen all right now that'll be the form of what we're going to be trying to do tonight is compare or see reading both accounts and seeing that both accounts are speaking of the great white throne judgment that is to come but yet to see that maybe one will say one thing the other will say another all right then if you can't you know not something different now but more meaning will be taken into account in one writing than it is in the other writing all right and that way see then we can study the bible that way you know you you can study it and see it that comparing scripture with scripture goes that way then you know where you're standing see you're not taking somebody's idea or a thought then you're taking what the scriptures say and if we can't depend on the scriptures we've surely got a problem right you know but what else could we depend on you certainly can't depend on the on the land and the governments and the and the the things today all of these dominions we'll read in a minute are falling drastically and everything's going just like i said the other day about cyprus there that you know i i don't know where they released it yet i haven't kept up with it but the whole country the banks were shut down until you couldn't get your money out of the bike right well then when they shut it down to try to juggle the books as we call it you know borrow the money or do whatever they've done now they're afraid to open them up because afraid everybody's going to run in and get all their money out at one time and and see it's just a bad shape all around right so we certainly don't want to depend on anything else but we can defend upon the word of god because it will always be true now but that's what i want you to think about we read here in the book of dang a book of revelations that says that there was a great white throne or a great white throne that is known then as what we would call the white throne judgment amen all right now there will be a white throne judgment we're wanting to read who it is who's judging and what is going on and read it out of the scriptures but just make comments along the way to to be able to do it but get the point now maybe daniel will say one thing um john in revelations won't say it that way but yet once you see both of them coming together they're saying the same thing but one is giving more understanding than the other is and it is it'll open up into a beautiful picture and then we can read the scriptures that what you know instead of just reading an isolated scripture all right let me read your scripture the scripture says judas went and hung himself about the scripture right right did i turn over a little while and the bible finally says and you go do likewise well now i'm not comparing the scriptures right i'm just picking words off of a page to prove my point or to say what i want it to say that's not the way that i'm talking about it i'm talking about taking things in the word and seeing that the bible is self-explanatory we're getting here in the book of revelations we have a lot of symbols back in the the beginnings of where we were bringing out of of the beast and the things you know that was there and the dragons and the things in the book of revelation and we had to depend upon the prophet to be uh to give us a an understanding because that's what he came for has to break the symbols but then he put it right in the scriptures himself so we can depend on the scriptures and i hope down through there we we've done enough of it you don't understand but here in revelation it's not a symbol this just simply just says that the white throne and then it says who's going to be judged and then it says who's going to do the judging you know and the things that will take place all right so then we don't have to worry about symbols tonight we don't have to worry about you know we can read ourselves and see what it says right and see then that way then we can read the book and understand but now what i want you to look at first is just a couple of points now we've got a brother in this room and a brother in that room brother anderson's over here and brother over there because we're having to divide up everything tonight to get it fixed where we can operate but one of them's going to get it up and i know it's brother anderson but go ahead and pull up number one brother anderson and let's just see what the prophet had to say about this and now i'm showing you up front about the throne reading it about the throne what it is uh who's at the throne who's sitting on the drone and and the things that as that will be at the the white trump judgment because everybody's going to stand that judgment that is not born again amen that's right but now if you're born again you don't have to go to judge amen because you're already judged all right why would you want anybody judging anybody that's already judged that double jeopardy in the day well you can't do that you know not supposed to but now just think about what he's saying who's at the judgment when is it what's taking place all right this is questions and answers real number one 1964 823 uh the morning service paragraph 222 now here now there you are to the question while i go to at the judgment seat jesus the church the bride was raptured now remember how we brought it out we go up in revelations 4 1 because that's john going up we're not seeing any more on earth until revelations 19 which we just got through covering to be the millennial reign and we come back with him we're not seen on earth in between so look what he's saying jesus the church of bride was went raptured in the glory and he grew up there and was married returned back to the earth and lived a thousand years at the end of the thousand years satan was loosed out of his prison remember that's in the scripture right above where we were at there that is bound by an angel with a chain not a lot of chain you remember you can't do that with satan you can't you couldn't change him you couldn't put him in a building lock the keys on him it doesn't work he's a spirit all right but a chain of circumstances now what's the circumstances we read this before all of his subjects were in hell all of satan's subjects at this time that we're looking about tonight all of his subjects will be in hell you know all his people and because he can't work anybody because why all that was resurrected on the earth were redeemed in jesus with him he couldn't work on nothing but at the end of the thousand years the second resurrection blessed and holy is he to have part in the first resurrection over which the second death has no power and notice in this second resurrection when they come up then satan's loose out of his prison now the bible says he looks for a little season that revelation right then judgment is set now watch jesus with the bride as king and queen said at the throne watch their own judgment and the books were open and the books are the sinners see the books are open the books of the center and another book was open which was the book of life and every man was judged thus by the bride all right now we will show in a minute start reading the scriptures you know and backwards and forth of this being correct of the judgments and things like that but just remember it's after the millennial reign amen right and that will be what is known in the terminologies of speaking a general resurrection that basically everybody believes in the resurrection of some form all right whether you want to call it the as i say on sunday where do you want to go with the pharisees or the sadducees the the the sad you're seeing so they believe in the resurrection but more than they believe that ever they believe you're going somewhere they just didn't believe in it the relationship of anything of them could be thought of but the pharisees were kind of lenient about that you know they could believe things but go ahead look at the next one just get these two points this is 1954 questions and answers real two uh 103 the evening series paragraph 68 look at this morning's lesson on the lesson on when the judgment set and the books were open and jesus came with ten thousand ten thousands of saints ten thousand thousand times ten thousand and then the judgment said here they all are around the white throne judgment as we went through the scripture with it and the books were opened another book was open which is the book of life and these and the rapture was judging them all right is that right then that done went home and received their glorified bodies which is you and i and lived through the millennium was hearing in the white throne judging those he said he'd separate the sheep from the goats all right you remember that in jesus name jesus said there'd come a time that the nations would come forth and be judged and separated as sheeps and goats all right now in doing that then think about it the white throne judgment we certainly don't want to go there we don't you don't want to have to appeal your cases to what's on judgment right because it's no uh court of appeal uh when you go there it stops settle finish done you know and we'll get back to that in a minute to see and at the white throne they won't be judging you according to your deeds it'd be according to what you believed or what you didn't believe right to be judging our unbelief instead of our works and deeds but there will be a great white throne judgment but the bride has already lived a thousand years through the millennial run so gone into rapture live a thousand years and comes back to sit on the throng with him and we'll get to that in a moment to to cover it but think about it jesus said they'd be separated as sheeps and goats all right now in doing that matthew 25 32 34 right through there that's been argued backwards and forth of who it would be you know that there'd be sheep and all but notice it says as sheep right it doesn't say sheep because the sheep's done gone right sheep don't stand before the whites on judgment right we'll find out in a little bit when we see there's strongs and things that the sheep are sitting on the throne but these are as sheep all right so who would it be would be coming up at the white throne judgment and these people will come there to be judged all right and to be judged on according to what they've done in their life right now that would be a horrible thing for me to think about right for me to go there i don't know how holy and pious you think you are but that's just the way i talk you think you're good enough that you could get there and win some court of appeal i wouldn't want to do that that's right i don't uh you know i i don't think it would be a good thing because none of our goodness the bible says my righteousness is what guilty rags in the sight of god so there's no part of getting there and maybe something can be worked out remember we'll read in a minute it's their works that they've done so when you come to the white throne judgment it'll be settled stamp finish that's over with you're either going to be given eternal life or you're going to hell right which ain't going to last that long because you're going to be cast into the lake of fire then you're going to be burning for a long time but just getting the point now i don't want to go there i don't want a standard judgment you know i i wouldn't want to it's kind of like my sister told her one time that she uh got a ticket and uh she obscured the dad what this is going to do with her you know when she got there to the court to our daddy went with her and when they got to the court well the judge was sitting there you know and the judge looks back there and recognizes there's the girl's father and calls his name and said well hello there how you doing she said i felt pretty good because she was thinking maybe maybe he maybe daddy can help me now but just remember if you go to the white throne you're going to stand by yourself there won't be no jesus to represent you there won't be a court of appeal right that you can argue because the bible says that they'll even say have not i cast out devils in thy name and done mighty wonderful works and you know jesus never denied that they that was happening but he said they would say depart from me i never knew you you were never a born-again christian in other words no born-again christian is going to the white throne judgment right we are here being judged in the basis of whether or not we accept jesus christ if we accept him as our savior our judgment is finished amen right we don't have to worry about a court of appeal amen we've got everybody on our side it'd really be great to walk into a courtroom if the judge was your daddy the prosecuting attorney was your brother and you hired your sister to represent you as a lawyer and even that all of your kin folks were sitting on the jury you feel pretty good with you you'd say when y'all get to playing around i'm gonna get me something deep because you know you'd be leaving all right but you see church is a whole lot better than that when you're born again christian right that's why we need a new birth that's why we must be born again that's why we must we must be born again that's right why because we don't have to go to the judgment amen that's a wonderful opportunity we don't have to go back right he paid my price right he just annihilated my records is that what the scripture said to this amen our sins is in the sea of his forgetfulness as far as the east is from the west now if you said north to the south you get messed up but you go east to west you just keep going around and around and around right no matter which way you go you're not going to find a wind win all right see what a wonderful opportunity it is to be a christian amen to say he's paid my price i don't have to go there and beg right you know for a pardon or some form or a dropping of the charges or something i don't have to do that amen my case is already solved and the point that i'm using is to quote show you that the resurrection at the time this will take place this hasn't taken place yet it will be on down the millennium hasn't taken place yet so that's over a thousand years from now before this could take place if the rapture took place today but see when that bride goes in that rapture she's already proof it's proven there paul said you changed in the morning the twinkling time right it's proved it's already finished at this time the bride will have already be body spirit and soul eternal at least a thousand years plus three and a half you know i mean how much you want to count i wouldn't learn about it today because if i'm eternal that's going to be wonderful but it's not going up to heaven to decide whether we're going to get there that's been taught to us but that's not correct right see people say i i hope i'm saved when i i get up there i'll find out whether i am or not well that's true we'll find out we're not right right so what we need is something now i'm like the old fella said i don't want no trouble when i get down to the river i want my ticket in my hand you go over to one of these foreign countries you'd find out in a hurry they got onto me in israel because i carried my passport around in my front pocket i didn't know i didn't think about it and the the guy there he said sam put that passport in your pocket he said they were very valuable over here to other people and said you're publicly advertising it i'm sorry i didn't know but you get over there i don't have a passport uh-huh you know they're gonna have one we had trouble coming back from jamaica one time because we had we had failed to take proof they had asked for proof and we didn't take it and they told us that go down here pay 45 or something a piece and we'll give you the paperwork and you can go but they didn't tell us that that paperwork was not sufficient to get back into the country right they made 45 bucks off of all the three people you know each one of us had to pay that all right when we got over there it was fine man yeah yeah you're welcome we got back to atlanta and they said uh that's not sufficient to get back in i knew right then i've been conned out of three times 45. you know it just happened that we had our driver's license and things to prove who we were and they accepted that and let us come back but the point is i don't want no trouble when i get down to the river i want my ticket in my hand i want to be ready to step over into eternity and no problems he paid the price all i've got to do is accept it he made the way all i've got to do is say thank you lord i accept that he then just make sure he got the ticket all right but now listen it is not the bride it's going to be at the what drone you know standing there to be judged right we'll get around to it a minute should be actually the one on the throne judging but look what the prophet says number three go ahead brother brother anderson pull it up 1964 of 61 human uh 10 15 morning service questions and answers paragraph 189 let's see right around what happens to the people that are are considered the sleeping virgins remember that matthew 25. five wives five foolish now consider the sleeping murder when they are judged at the judgment well the sleeping virgin will be saved of course she'll be saved at the judgment she'll never be the bride she's just given eternal lives but she has a saved group of people that will come in the judgment that will not be included in the bride but as long as there are virgins that they are before god see they are to be saved he separates there'll be the sheep on his right side and the unsaying will be the goats on his left at the great water on judgment you remember i was quoting jesus while ago in matthew 24 25 excuse me were five would be i mean where they would be sheeps and goats all right who's the sheeps and the goats the foolish virgins will be the sheep because they're as sheep the rest of the world will be the goats man all right now judgment is spoken of throughout the bible in many many ways but i just want to get down to a couple of scriptures go ahead and pull up number four and let's read this one because daniel sees the same thing that john sees in revelation so that's where we're going to be comparing them in a second daniel 7 and 9 says i'll be held till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did see it his garment was just white as snow when the hair of his head was like their wool his strong was like the fiery flame in his whip and his wheels that's burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousand thousands ministered unto him no once and conjunction something else and then and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him i don't know what some ministers some stood before him and the judgment was set and the books were opened now all right so now we're getting down to a point that's where we're going to start comparing the show you brought around verifies it daniel is bill number five and we'll read that one taken from the ten versions 144 000. paragraph 194 12 11 morning service now at the end of the time how many knows that the bible says that the saints shall judge the earth the bible says that see the saints will judge the earth that's why it says don't take no man no no brother to court you don't say not you know for other people don't take a brother to court right why because you're trying to judge things that you should that should be judged in the church they shouldn't be judged by the world right that's all right the things you'll judge the earth he's saying well hey he ain't my brother well you might have a point because you might not be his it may be the other way around see paul said so now let's turn to the book of revelations and get the white throne we could get it out book excuse excuse me let's turn the book of daniel and get the white throne we could get it out of revelation well but i like to take it out of daniel it's the same thing daniel 7 and we'll catch the great white throne judgment here all right now what i want to do is i want him to pull up go ahead and pull up and i want us to just look at these scriptures and compare something now we've proved the point that daniel spoke of the white throne judgment just as john spoke of the white throne jacob now let's compare the two or study the two scriptures and look at it as i was saying to begin with that reading one by itself no matter if you read the revelations account or the daniel account you're not getting the full understanding that you are if you put them both together you with me put them all together i want you to learn learn to read scriptures we read the scriptures just because we believe god sent a prophet that doesn't do away with our bible that turned us back to the bible that brought the bible to be more valuable amen because it began to tell us you know what the word says i'm reading from a scofield bible that's the king james version 1909 all right i have the 16 11 editions in my home you don't have a 16-11 edition of a scofield you don't have a 16-11 edition and just very few that you can get a 16-11 which is original king james this is what it's called and you look on the front of your bottom you look on the side of it it says ken james version all right that is not the 1611. and the very very little wording has changed from the 1611 to scofield or world or any of them thompson chain when they brought it on over but it's most of them are printed into the 19 coming on up until some bibles have been printed just a few years ago all right but now the point i want you to get is look at what one scripture will say if you're looking at that scripture alone then you won't get a clear understanding all right now i'm just using this from the book of daniel this you know with the book of revelation go in and read your bible and think about other times things are said and turn over and redeem and see that they're not contradictory you have four gospels matthew mark luke and john right written by four different men two of those men luke and mark were not even original disciples when jesus was here right they come on later but when they wrote they wrote a lot of times of different accounts or one will tell of this whereas the other one won't mention it all right then you can go back in there and compare them and get some wonderful studies out of it i ask you to do that sometimes just start out just read a little bit in matthew and then turn over and mark and then turn over to luke and turn over john and look what it's doing is it's clarifying the subject the holy spirit is not just making those people write down verbatim word by word word by word because like i said really matthew mark luke and john were not pinned till somewhere around 80 50. there is a video out now which is very good one that if you want to watch it then it's called the end it's been out a long time but it's called the indestructible bible or the indestructible book and i would ask you to look at it because it really explains a lot of things or that a lot of things came into view but see the bible was not written down go read in your bible look at the thing it was not written down while jesus was doing that because luke and mark was not dire but i love to read the book of luke because luke comes along he's a physician you know a doctor so he's more intellectual but yet being more intellectual he's more precise upon some of his points that maybe mark and luke i mean mark and john and him are john is more prophetic god is a spirit and they that worship him much worship in the spirit and truth he's more prophetic form all right because he then he was chosen to go home to patmos or but see luke says in the beginning of his right he said having perfect understanding now what about a man that was never there to see anything that went on he wasn't there walking with jesus whereas matthew and john were well luke says having perfect understanding but compare matthew mark luke and john and read them and you'll see it's beautiful but yet of course we want to find contradictions because we're smart no it's stupid if there is a god he can't keep his word straight then what kind of a peanut brain who are we to argue about god's word amen well i got it right what gives you that right the constitution or the bible the bible store don't give you a right to think sheep or sheep they bear wolf come on but you see church comparing scripture you get a great understanding but like i said we want to find contradiction so we go in matthew mark luke and john we read and one says there's one blind man the other one says there's two blind man boy look at that look at that look at that boy you're what makes it stupid i don't mean to be wrong in the terminal i use but it is a great word dumb can be helped right and dumb can learn right stupid cane right now watch you say well there's one one blind man and one with two come on it's not a contradiction right that's two men writing and one of them was writing from accounts that other people gave we get the holy spirit using them to write that's what i want you to see that's the point i want to follow you to follow from from this okay thank you brother he's got him on side beside man that's what we're doing with all of this new system that's coming it'll be beautiful because they'll be able to sit in there and look at it and they can uh take their little joystick and just run over here to one run over here to the other one and we also got one that we can look at you there will be three of them if you turn and look up there one day and you see something with you you might or smile it might show up that you're not smiling and it's your discontent but look let's read the two daniel and revelation revelations 20 verse 11 says and i saw a great white drum all right now a great by trump singular okay look what daniel says i'll be held till the thrones were cast down plural is he wrong no because it's only one white drum amen that's right and daniel is saying he be held till the thrones dominions nations peoples were cast down they didn't make a whole lot of drones all the nation is cast out it's only what one throne left and that's god strong right so they're saying the same thing okay now watch revelation says draw what great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them look what daniel says i'll be held all the thrones were capped down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and his hair as in the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame singular throne and his wheels was burning fire now they're describing the same one because john comes on down and he saw that they had stand before god so this must be god is speaking of up here and daniel is speaking of an ancient of days now who is that ancient of days not because of being old wouldn't hire me white like wool even in our land a few years ago the judges and some maybe still do within certain nations would open court and everything wearing a robe with a white wig because it was the sign of authority then ain't this ancient of days is almighty god because who else could be described whose garment was white as snow and his hair and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels was burning fire they're describing the same person both of them is describing almighty god but yet look at it just understand what i'm saying see one of them is this saying a blunt that's all it is and stand before god he doesn't give a description right revelation doesn't give a description of this one he just says it's god but see now comparing the two we get a description comparing the daniel in the revelation we're getting a description of who this is you see what i'm trying to say we're getting a description of the person that's sitting there amen these the ancient of days it's garbage and water you give it a description where if john the holy spirit through john never chose to describe him why because it's over at the end of the book and by then you ought to know who it is forgive me like i say either put cough drop in or quit preaching and i hear the people say quit preaching but now it's just that old cough but now let's go on a little bit john goes over to verse 12. he said i saw the dead small and great stand before god all right he sees the small and the great you know where's everybody no matter how you're not gonna be a multi-billionaire and get bothered to judgment that the money don't count nothing you know you know like the guy that wanted to carry gold in heaven when he died he kept leading this case and he's wanting to die and when he died he wanted to carry gold with him you know so he said okay take it on me he gets up there and peter looks at him and there he comes carrying this gold what are you doing i want to bring this up here with me he said take it on in ain't nothing with payment not payment that payment like you're walking on the streets of gold you know all right now but listen and i saw the dead small and great stand before god now daniel says a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him who the same one we're talking about the god of daniel but look at look at him he says thousand thousands ministered unto him now what if brother gary if you didn't have revelation didn't have daniel to put with revelation where would you have scripture that there'd be a bride sitting on the throne with right are you following me where would you have scriptures but by putting them together to see the same event we see daniel tells you that there's going to be a thousand thousands ministered to him who ministers to you and your home supposed to let's put it that way it ain't right no more but the wife is supposed to minister to us and it's kind of got flip-flopped now and the husband ministers to the wife in all the cases but that's you know but he's supposed to minister into you the wife to the husband so now daniel is giving you a description that is very valuable he's telling you what is over in the book of revelation he's telling you that there's a bride that will minister unto it and there's only one throne it's going to be a big old throne isn't it you say but then wait a minute there's the boss says thrones but just remember we got one domain you didn't get what i said well ago the bible said he saw till the thrones thrones are dominions rulership so now we're seeing daniel as he picks up and gives us a wonderful picture that he's not sitting on the throne by himself his wife is with him you know the only thing in the african jungle or any jungle that's not afraid of the line the male lines there's only one person there that's not afraid of the male mind you know who that is the female right she's the only one that's not afraid of you see because she knows him you know he's not going to hurt her he said well that's casey i'm will not forget it but look what he said thousands and thousands ministered unto him here daniel said he saw the dead small and great stand before god now daniel is showing you that there's more sitting on the throne besides god himself but the bride is sitting there with him to judge but then he goes on and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him right see now you're getting somebody standing before him to be judged you won't be as bright she sits on the throne with him are you following me i'm going just a little bit more and what does it say in daniel and saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books plural were open and another book was opened which is the book of life now look what you'd lose if you just went with daniel because daniel said all these stands before and said the judgment was set and the books were open that's all he says he doesn't mention the book of life whereas john does i'm trying to get you just go in the bible and look at things and read it 90 of the bible is is self-explanatory if it says in the bible thou shalt not steal i guess my brother promotes that time some guy said something real smart back to him he said well it don't say don't steal chickens so that's not in the bible don't steal chickens until you steal chickens but you can't steal anything else that's how carnal we are in our doings i'm trying to get us to a point of being able to read the bible for ourselves especially this prophet's message do not run off on a deep interest because you got a quote you got a thought you got an idea i want to see it in the bible amen amen you can't put it in the bible i don't give a hoot about your idea that's right right bring it to me in the scriptures and show me amen then it would do away with all this garbage can this so-called around the message right that's right but the people don't want it that way they want a beautiful story but now look john and daniel both speaks of books plural they'll be at the judgment books okay now why would you need books and a judgment so what you do is you go down to the natural corner what you got you got people with a whole back of stacks of papers you know the prosecuting attorney he has not a book that's not laid out but it's a whole lot of papers laid on there telling you what you're supposed to be uh what he's gonna try to find you guilty of so he's got books and what does he do he goes out and searches out your credibility's your your life he gets your records from the courthouse or whether you've ever been arrested before and he compiles books right right that's right he pulls all the records he can find he makes books well then when you come up and say well just show me where i've done something wrong he said hold on just a minute it says here that you were caught for stealing last year and tried in this court and sentenced and you're on probation you can't argue why he's got the books right that's why daniel in revelations both mention the books right because god keeps a record he doesn't have to right well i don't have to keep a record of our lives he can call it back to us at any split second or moment he wants to you remember daniel curry when he was talking about it said that you know in his dream that he had and it was a good point he said when he had to stand before the white throne because we know it was just a dream but he was a saying you know i said daniel curry have you ever done anything wrong he said i thought i've been a good person he said the dire pool before me was my whole life and i saw all the little things that i done deceiving little things you know the bible said it's the little foxes that spoil the vine you know they eat the vine they they about to behind they kill the lion the little foxes that's right let's see these books the prophet said number one of books is one is the book of the sinners book of the sinners it's not going to be trying to plead a case before an amnesia god right because he's making records now let me ask you a question as i'm trying to illustrate records and what it means by books do you think that judas carrick would be able to plead his case at the white throne come on sure he'd have records there that he was a pretty good guy right that's right or jesus wouldn't have chosen to walk him to be one of the twelves he hadn't been off he'd been ever asked about a crooked drunk no you know and all of the things he wouldn't have chosen for that murderer sometimes he wouldn't choke he didn't choose any of them but do you think judas complete his case when the bible says about he said he was a thief from the beginning i think he was probably a pretty good guy and when he says he was a thief from the beginning i don't think he outlandishly robbed because he was the treasurer remember judas was the treasurer he carried the money i don't think he stole enough out of it to build him a home you know to buy a new car or a new donkey he just probably took a little bit once a while or something just a small amount because the bible said he was a thief in the beginning and like i said about daniel curry he said i never did steal nothing you know see i can stand here today and say i've never stole anything no bigger than watermelon a couple of kids we used to walk across the neighbor's field and get a watermelon we'll see if i went before the judgment god pulled that up before him do you understand trying to compare what the two seed you know what they're talking about judas couldn't plead his case because it says in here written in this book see this is the book of man pharaoh is in this book right could pharaoh argue at judgment of what he'd done against the children of israel why because it's recorded in the book right amen god as i said doesn't have to record he could pull it back any time he wanted and run him across a flat screen in front of you but he doesn't do it that way he just let us go ahead and he just writes down a record the children of israel were doing real good and then they'd do wrong they were sent into judgment right do you think they could ever plead the case and do you remember they tried to say it when jesus was standing there now what about a bunch of people that's why i love the bible like it is those pharisees and things standing before jesus one day were at that time physically in bondage to rome right right are you with me they were physically under the roman conquerorship and being killed because of who they were but when jesus said something to him they said we were never on the bondage the door yeah well i i think i remember when they went down to egypt and was slaves you understand what i'm getting at right the bible will meet us in judgment right because it tells of the things even to the day and the hour that we're living but could judas plead his case when he could read right out of the scriptures right to him that he pointed out jesus right right you understand right here this is the thing that will be at judgment forgive me for saying thing but i'm not about the bible because the bible is a book of life of mankind if they just look at this book and stay with it they'd be all right but they won't do it right you remember when they were going to send a spaceship up and they couldn't figure out they lost today and they couldn't get their calculations running whatsoever you said what does a day mean to sending a rocket to the moon well you gotta have all them stars lined up perfectly because you don't you're gonna run into one of them so they had to have everything so we're accurately so they said well how can we do it we got a day missing you know the story the man told him said in the bible it spoke of the sun standing still and they went back and they checked it and it said the sun stood still the bible doesn't say the sun still a day you know hold exited about a day this is this is proof of yours this is proof of your governments and the and the people they're sending these spaceships out they proved it right so they calculated at that time through their time spaces and things and they found out that they're like about 20 minutes having a full 24-hour day right so what did they do they said the man said they said is there anywhere else in the bible if some help thrust he said well it did say one time that the sun went back 20 degrees you remember that the scripture said well it's easy if we go forward but it's a little bad they calculate their time and they found by the bible the day missing in space this is what's going to be at the white throne judgment amen that's right but i'm going to tell you this way it's not going to be a king james version a thompson chain or scofield or whatever it's going to be a group of people oh my god that happened right that's right goodbye with elijah could you just argue with jesus you understand what i'm saying see that's that thousands of ten thousands is gonna be ministering unto it the true names of this in this book is gonna be there right amen but this is the book of the records amen right the bible even speaks of the earth and it says it where their names were not written or because they really don't need to keep it up with them yep that's right i just thank god that he showed us the truth books were present all right but the bible then is explanatory pull it back up brother revelation daniel just says books we're open revelation says and the books were open okay we're still in them no a record of your life if you stand before the white throne judgment it won't be that you know let me just roll your life right out in front of you and would that be something to me to be standing before the white throne and then god turn around and say uh chris did you tell this man about me he said he never heard of me yes i told him because he liked my face and walked away ain't going to be a court of appeal it's going to be blunt you understand but you see there's something else there that the book of revelation covers is very wonderful i'll try to get a little of it revelation says in the books were open watch and another book was open which is the book of life now daniel never recorded that he just says books now watch and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books books right according to their works right in the books a record of our life the bible then is a a book to be there as a record you think they won't have to give an account he's listening last night i believe it was to run around talking about that lady that he told her she was healed of cancer and somebody talked her into going down and let them operate because they would do a guinea pig operation for him and he told her he said you're healed that cancer is dead she went in and told them that before they operated they said that cancer is still alive in you they cut her open shoulder up cut her to pieces he said killed her he said them doctors will answer for killing that woman you say no they were just right now they was experimenting when you're experimenting judge according to their works now right so all you could put there is what you've done or didn't do right you see the bible says even a cup of water in my name not be forgiven and will not be forgotten in this world or the world to come it also says the blessing the holy ghost won't be forgiven in this world or the world to come a lot of things are written in the book what about a cup of water what about you just done something good for somebody not trying to go to heaven by doing it no that won't work because that's pretty pre-planned that's pre-meditating stuff that won't do it but you just help somebody who was it martin is that the one that martin was the the soldier and he saw this beggar laying out there and the records of him and nobody wouldn't help the beggar he was freezing to death and martin took his coat cloaker what they call it the thing they wrapped up in and wore you cut it in half and gave a man and they laughed and made fun of him because he was a soldier with a half of a garment that night when he laid down the lord jesus come to him wrapped in that beggar's right hand for garment said what you've done to the least you've done it unto me right amen that's written by records of saint martin you can argue with him one of the church age messenger forget it hurry up what and the sea gave up the dead everything which were in it you know you know i i like to explain things but sometimes it's just too hard and too late but see that sea gave up the dead which really doesn't mean there's people living there they might be but maybe people out in the ocean today when bubbles living but that ain't what it's talking about it just means those that died at that place are gonna raise from that place you know those who were cast in the ocean gonna raise from there come on and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them right right now death and hell both were delivered up right what and they were judged every man according to their works watch them and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire which is the second death that's why we don't believe in eternal hell that's right because if you've got an eternal hell where are you going to get somebody to put in that you're going to have to put god in it because god's the only one's got eternal life right is that sensible does that need a knock on the head to very understand it god's the only one that's got eternal life you've got an eternal hell you have to put god into hell amen there's no such thing in the bible that's a catholic doctrine to try to scare you to death and the good old baptist one i was there witness that enough they get you out there and ding on your hell if you don't get straightened up now if you don't come to the lord you're gonna die and burn in hell eternally i didn't like it then but i didn't know how to argue with him about it but show me where you've got an eternal hell in the bible i want a scripture no it's a catholic doctrine that the denominations took and put over it's like your post millennials from pre-millennials and all of that but look that's the second death the second death is the death of the soul when you're totally annihilated and whosoever was not found written in the book of life didn't say books was cast into the lake of fire if you wasn't found in the book of life it didn't say about your books you've been found in the book of life all right so the book of life what is the book of life brother dale then this bible that's right man that's right it's the only book that's got any promise of life in it it can judge us as books of our deeds what was the difference in judas's carrot and peter what do you mean betray jesus well i remember that peter had to be rebuked one time and jesus even said get behind me satan right because he didn't like what was in him and peter denied him three times there's no record jews ever denied him three times he just turned him into the people he didn't deny him you know what he thought so much of that life he'd done he went out and hung himself but peter runs around glory hallelujah but he had denied the lord jesus and even cursed that doesn't mean he used naturally vulgar words the curse means to light the esteem it doesn't mean you use these big long blank words that you black out that's just a plain old center but a person that claims with that bible don't mean that who are you to tell us what the bible says i'm not telling you i'll just tell you what it's saying it's up to you to decide whether it's right or not amen right but this bible is a book of life amen but you know what it's also it's also called the lounge book of life or correctly placing the book of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world this is it's a book what a wonderful piece of material right right it will be there and our names will be written now you won't find samuel there written in anywhere in here you find samuel that don't work too good he's old testament that's why i love the book of revelations because the book of revelations read chapter two and three especially it gives you seven church ages and the last one is the lady of cnn age right and ladies simply people's rights right and look around you've never seen a time when it was people's rights and that's not just saying to black people come on everybody now people's rights i have my right then you get into the religious room well i got right believe what i want to the constitution gives you that all right the bible don't do it right i want to see that in the bible right but you've got a right to believe what you want to believe come on i want to see it in here it says unless you believe that i am he you will die in your sins that's what this book this book then is the book of life you see your name is not in there my name is not in there no but if i can find what's going on in the day that i'm living right wouldn't that be my name in the book yeah come on come on the bible's written in funny ways see what was the brother hamptons used to use paul it says there in the scripture one time said paul come out to minister and said the whole town came out to see you you analyze that just a little bit you know the whole town came out it was the cars the buildings the stores the homes the streets that's not what it's saying right right right it's talking about people right right this bible is written about people right but it's written about you amen daniel said that they would be thousands thousands ministering to him that puts their name in the book sister gail you don't have to look around try to find your name and find it under secret codes you can take a letter over here a letter over here and put it over here and you come out with your name hallelujah right but you see church what i'm trying to get you to see comparing the scriptures and seeing what it's talking about books or natural life the book of life where are these books at this bible is this record of life that was written before the foundation of the world we are told in the bible to what you attempt of our earnings that truth did god just make that up we really ought to give him 90 and keep 10 but that's he didn't say that he said you tie the mint and roll talking to the pharisees and said you leave the other things undone well that's that's that doesn't do you any good then you just spent your money but where did the bible get that when did abraham that was coming back from the slaughter of the kings he met melchizedek right which was almighty gone and he said i'll give you a tenth of what everything i'm all right well that's just talking about that one see this book's got the answer to all things because it is the book of life but it's the lamb's book of life for the record of the bride of jesus christ paul saying to the church at ephesus he went right into the world those that are in christ jesus he said the bible's written about the world contains the many things contains the book of life it also contains the lounge book of life right in one beautiful book ended up daniel said i said it says that there was thousands of thousands ministered into it john never wrote it anyway because see he had already written about the millennium truth 19th chapter we're in the 20th chapter he doesn't talk about the millennium and then starting into the to the uh chapter 20 it's the first few verses is talking about the millennium in the first resurrection see he didn't have to put in there that they would be many sitting with him because he'd already told the story of the bride coming forth and riding into the millennial rain rolling and reigning with them for a thousand years look at one and see the other john tells you one thing daniel tells you another put them together you've got a beautiful picture of the story of redemption amen now we can read for ourselves see we believe god sent a prophet but we just don't go around here trying to make him god because he wasn't if i'd have been back in the days of martin luther i would have been glad to have protested the catholic church with you i would have been following what luther said because i followed today but luther taught the judge shall live by faith that's exactly right we don't reject any church teachings that's correct right amen the methodists teach sanctification i firmly believe in sanctification the pentecostals association street 1906 coming forth with the baptism of the holy ghost and gifts and signs and wonder i believe in that i believe the baptist is writing what they were saying they brought back to us immersion into the water because the word baptizo means to go down and come back up so they brought it back and restored it to the church each one of those churches had a uh a word for the hour right amen you know what the world's going to be judged by them the people of that day will be judged by what they taught in that day he said well you mean they'll be they'll be judged by what martin luther taught of the truth amen we just want to continue on keep on going until we leave the world when we leave the world see we can say the journey's finished we don't have to go to the great latron judgment to be judged whether or not we're going to heaven show me that in the bible anywhere but it's been taught by mankind those things are what i don't agree with those doctrinal ideas is what i don't agree with martin luther said that the jews were antichrists in order to be killed i don't go along with that but you know if he was here today he wouldn't go along with it either if he just thought about what he was saying he wouldn't went along with it then did you see the truth went up amen didn't jesus say you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free in that scripture he said i am the way the truth and the life that's all i want amen i want what he had i'm trying to make something out of anything that's no problem anyway but what is it any need of trying to make something out of something you know out of yourself as i said they're doing that in here that's what they've done in cyprus whether they close your money out before you got home it can't happen here in america i will remind you they have a great depression that took a lot of people down and i will remind you that the economy has fallen many times more points than what they fell into depression we just wouldn't time yet but you see comparing scriptures we see today we're living then we're not just isolating one scripture and reading it we're taking an overall view of the entire bible to bring it together to show us a beautiful picture of the plan of redemption come on brothers the plan of redemption the book of revelation shows you the plan of redemption all the way from the beginning clean to the ending compare scripture take the prophet's message then and compare what he would say with things that you think he said wrong but just give it a little while and you'll find out he couldn't say it no other way but we can argue all we want to that won't help nothing it won't change the thing to truthfully understand your own judgment we don't have to go there if we're saved if not that's where we're headed no matter how religious we think we are how much money we think we've given how much of our time do we think we've given now you think about that scripture as quoting a while ago when they come to him and say didn't i cast out devils in thy name and done mighty wonderful works he never argued with him at all he didn't say they didn't do it he was agreeing with him but he said you never i never knew you i never had an experience a relationship with you to be my wife spiritually speaking we don't have to go there if we don't want to but if we don't get born again we're going to the restaurant and i hope you understand what i talk about books book of life lounge book of life all right here in this one bible anything you need to know is right here as i said they even found that day missing in space by reading the bible they say the psalms is written in certain ways that they tried to break the codes that they can learn about certain people would be killed and certain people did i'm not worried about that because i don't worry about the codes i'm talking about the god or the word anybody oh i know uh all right hello okay just leaves me you know i can't argue the point because he's gone but just what if he does it you know it could be god's and let's belief join together do not change is here i am is i know until someday the racial candidate was telling this other day it reminded us of probably over 30 years ago brother collins is the girl had a baby and it's all this organs were basically outside after she told it we remembered you know when we were all praying and just with no hopes but you know what that kid's walked down 18 18 years old it learned to crawl this went into its bladder kidneys and something was outside of the body still learn to scoot along the floor they had to put stuff around it to hold it you know work and move and do it but today the child's living see that's in our day that's not to say in this and after the other seemed too many to not believe i'd be an unbeliever i've got too much testimony in myself how many times he's healed me i'm not talking about little things i'm a major thing changing my blood type totally from a positive a negative medically proven by their own records that they took the blood both times see it's nothing impossible with god if you believe that's right okay yeah located a picture up here and leukemia the kind that'll kill you now she's one twenty twenty couple weeks ago no problem what about that amen hallelujah but why can't we believe you see the prophet said it one day he said it would be sin to disbelieve now what were the things that we have witnessed among ourselves to see of the sick healed the dead raised that we don't have to brag about it's the truth we've got to have it documented if needed see god is real all he wants us to do is just believe it that's it just believe him he'll take care of him i didn't ask him to change my blood type i didn't ask him a thing about it he done it on his own he said that's medically impossible i agree with you but you want the records come on where they took the medic took the blood and then they had to go back and take it they proved it it's a negative now about it i mean this book is right it's the book of the center it's the book of life but it's the lounge book of life and the bride is that lounge book of life made manifest sitting on the throne with him in glory think on these things father we thank you and we just ask you to go with us now as we go our separate ways the lord give everybody a safe journey home because we believe you and just have your way touch these that lord that have asked about these things and we just thank you and believe you that all is well lord we don't have any second thoughts because it's not needed to be made it's all in you your your decisions are eternal but lord we know you can change the whole course of nature whatever it takes to bring about your word we love you and we thank you have your way now teach us to wait upon you in jesus name amen you diss me as member of saturday
