Holy Holy Holy You Are Holy Holy Holy yes you're holy holy holy I want to see [Music] you amen you this on this afternoon once again we're happy and in the Lord we're going to go ahead and go directly to the word amen yeah you already know me my name is brother Samuel naha we're going to go directly to the word but before we do that let's let's have a word of prayer he would be the one to guide us this afternoon that he would speak to our hearts amen let's pray Heavenly Father we're once again before your presence and in this hour Lord we ask you father that you take control of us father take take every nervousness out father anything that would hinder Lord in your hands we commit ourselves come Lord Jesus to our hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask amen amen open your your Bibles this this afternoon to the book of Hebrews chapter 6 verse one 1 through six in this afternoon uh well we're going to continue but our thought is seeking after after Perfection or seeking Perfection read the scripture in the name of the Lord Jesus therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on hand of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this we will do if God permit for it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame now in Matthew Matthew chap 5 verse 48 be you perfect as your father in Heaven which is in heaven is perfect Lord Jesus Christ bless his word you may be seated remember we're seeking after Perfection and as we seek Perfection our father he's perfect our heavenly father is perfect and if we're seeking after Perfection or if we're seeking Perfection then we are going to be perfect because nothing of this Earth will come into the kingdom of God without being perfect so our trajectory here on Earth is or our journey here on Earth is to walk and keep walk towards Perfection I'm not perfect and you're not perfect brother brandom says that this body is sin how can that be this is flesh and this flesh is a bunch of R is rotten it's a little tough to think about because we we bathe we change our clothes maybe we put a little bit of a lotion a little bit of cologne to smell a little better but even then you're still rotting because sin is something ugly something that we really don't want because we don't really want it you get angry you you get upset why because you keep walking you're not perfect but when all the things of this Earth of this life leave this body then you will come to Perfection meanwhile you're walking you have problems you have struggles you have sicknesses anything will try to T us down but we're going to a place and that place is perfection we are citizens and I was talking to brother Luis I don't I don't I don't I don't worry about the citizenship of this Earth uh this not really a big concern to me because the city that I'm going to it's not built by Man Hands of man conr the Builder of that city is my heavenly father that's where I'll find perfection then am amen amen amen in the message Hebrews chapter uh 6 part two brother Bram says okay now we got that this morning how that we are perfected perfected absolutely spotless and blameless not one sin on us then he asks a question are you above Temptation says never do you sin every day says yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him and God could not no more judge us than nothing couldn't be righteous he's already judged Us in him when he judged Christ he judged me he judged you can't judge me again because he took my judgment if I've been redeemed do you notice that that's the key right there if you've been redeemed God can't judge you because you're in him but if you're not in him then who is going to judge you who can who is going to judge you it's tremendous think to think about so if we have received the knowledge of the truth who is the truth Jesus is the truth the Lord amen amen when we have received the knowledge of the truth you can have it as we said this morning Judas had the knowledge of the truth he knew the truth personally in flesh because the the the the word was made flesh and so he had knowledge of it he knew who Jesus was he knew that he could raise the dead he knew that he could raise the the the the L he he saw he had knowledge of it but he didn't have it is one thing to know and it's another thing to actually have him so how many have a how many have them and so if you have them you can't be judged anymore you can't be judged so how do we obtain it through the new birth new nature it's a change the person changes the son the son that you change because the son of predition doesn't change he may be able to look or look the part he may look intelligent but he doesn't have it when you really have it you will realize that you've been redeemed God cannot judge you he already judged him you in him amen he says here and I got a ticket to show that I've redeemed my watch from the pawn shop let somebody tried to take it back in the pawn shop once when I've got a ticket I have redeemed it listen and if the devil would try to put punishment on me I've got a ticket that shows I have been redeemed yes sir no more judgment he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall never come to the Judgment but has passed death unto life that's my ticket he gave the promise so following or seeking perfection perfect as my father is perfect so if the father is perfect the children are perfect when when are they perfected there's a lovely thing right there when is something perfect we were in the in the pawn shop and amen amen who who who takes you out of the pawn shop the one that has money who has the money some of us we feel bad cuz if no one can take us out of the pawn shop it would be a sad thing we're going to just get old there we're just going to die there it's just like a saying that I know are there any Catholics here or were there any Catholics here okay I wasn't a Catholic but my parents were seventh day Adventists and they say that whatever their parents said that's what that's how it is the Catholics believe the same thing if their parents were catholic I'm going to die and they're in the pawn shop then we don't have it so easy the scripture teaches he said many are called but few are chosen we many have heard many have listened to the word that God sent a prophet God sent a messenger with a great message and we got excited about and brother brand said yes I believe in Emotion I believe in jumping but none of that will benefit me what will benefit us what will benefit us is that we have been born again and so there you come to Redemption and Redemption when you are redeemed there is no more judgment for you that's a good thing to think about so this morning we were talking about this Young Rich ruler and brother brandham says he's the one that died alongside Lazarus now when this young man rejected eternal life I I ask you a question this afternoon did he have a good rest of his life or or his life just went to ruins after that he had his Grainer the B says he he he he set him up and he made him bigger like that he was he got richer yeah so we're here looking all around us how people around us progress in life and there's nothing against that as the prophet tells us nothing against rich people the Bible tells us clearly that how tough is for a rich person to get into the kingdom now if God has allowed you to have money you know how to handle that money you're and you follow the lord Jesus to the to the letter or to the word man you're you're going to want to share that because you don't want to be you don't want to be greedy you don't you don't want to have it and just keep it all to yourselves and this young man even though he knew the Commandments even though he had everything but he he he was self-centered there was he was he was self-centered there was a high category that he was in that he didn't want to get around the ones that wanted to be around Jesus because the followers of Jesus were the were ones of the low class not even middle class ones they were the low class and so that's the reason it wasn't so much the money it wasn't so much what he had but it was the pride the society that he was going to get into many times brothers and sisters that that that that touches us as well that comes we we we we that that uh influences us you come you come to a point I'm GNA get with that person over there that's when you and I have to be careful and so that we so that we are are are exalted we first have to be Get Low first we have to get hum even to the dust of the Earth and submit ourselves to God totally and tell the Lord speak with our heart say Lord I have felt like I'm a little bit higher than my brother or sister I have felt a little bit higher than my sister Lord forgive me forgive me and help me give me strength to go and ask my sister forgiveness to my brother forgiv and tell her and tell him my sister I have I have been exalted over you but forgive me that's what happened on the day of Pentecost the days that they were there together it was about 10 days and in those 10 days every one of them when they went in in the church because it was a building that they were in we could call it a church but the Bible calls it calls it an upper room there Liars went in there haters went in there all of them went in there but within those days that they were in there all of them had to fix their differences and God will not take us we start fixing our own differences with each other yes sir I believe that that is the truth if I have something against my brother Samuel I have to go to him tell him with my heart said you know what brother forgive me I spoke bad about you I expressed myself in a wrong way I ask you to to to help me because I want to go in I want want to go to the kingdom of God I don't want to stay here I want to leave this earth clean nothing there will be there unless there's Divine love there God help us I believe that each and every one of us need that little part and that little part that we need is humility we need humility in our lives in our hearts amen the name of the Lord Jesus Christ these words will help you this afternoon I think they're helping me amen name of our Lord Jesus Christ in the message that we were reading uh follow me come follow me paragraph 47 and what we were talking about man is also for the goes for the woman see because we are talking about human life human Souls just as for men and women and after all these opportunities that the young man had see he says here that see he become on Easy Street how much money he had he probably partied with Splendor do you understand the word Splendor he it's not he wasn't walking like the way we Hispanics say he he wasn't walking with just any any sort of thing he knew how to he knew he had an answer for things he could do it he had a way he could he could he could uh he could uh he could he had a way to make it he wasn't poor right we call it on a place where he didn't have to worry about too much me he came to be a governor a ruler refers to it here of the as the Young Rich Young Ruler and we see at a young age maybe in his teenage just out of school just out of graduation maybe a few weeks before he become he's a ruler and he had all that Hearts could desire what a tremendous thing and the boy wasn't modern Ricky he's a fine kid I believe when Luke wrote about it or Mark I believe it was Jesus looked at him inside because he loved him and I was I was looking through the scriptures and it's only in Matthew maros and in mark and in Luke where they wrote about this Rich Young R and I was and I was looking that is only three places where it talks about this Rich Young and the Bible says that where there's two or three gathered together in my name that's where I'll be and the word of God tells us that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established amen amen he he Matthew he he he he he came to know those scriptures and when he went to the mountain he might have taken he took he took when Jesus went up to the mountain he took Peter he took John and and and and pet and James why didn't he take the rest of them he only took three right why have you ever asked why because Faith there was love there and there was hope there as well in those three let every word be established every business dealing God had his three Witnesses up above you know that you probably know better than I do now and so he says that Jesus looked at him and sighed and loved him right see there's something about the kid there was a nice personality hooked with this kid hooked with this kid where he come from out of a nice family who had taught him the Commandments of God and seen that he kept them and he did it from his youth up and the boy had an ambition how many of us have ambition as young as young people as young people as young we want to have a good wife a good you know what the Bible says a good wife will edify his her house amen but a bad wife will bring it down now who wants a bad wife how many here are married no no no oh how many here have not been married do you want a bad wife why not he said bad in Spanish [Laughter] [Applause] Malo how about you young ladies you want a bad husband no I don't think we need neither none of us do no but if you were living in the day that this young man was living how many would have wanted to marry him probably all of them why FIA he had a ticket they were going to go they were going to go to Hawaii over there where the rich people live and in the desert where they made a city over there where the rich people live over there Las Vegas because we're not of this Kingdom we are of another King where where where the moth the the termites nothing goes in there and hurts only the children of God happy children of God happy children of God if you don't have money you don't have a house but if you have the Lord Jesus Christ inside of you you're the happiest person on Earth [Applause] amen and the boy had an ambition he wanted eternal life he said good Master what could I do to inherit eternal life see of all you got in the world yet the soul yet the Soul on the inside of you tells you there is something that you need that you haven't got just by wealth oh no oh or it don't always have to be wealth it could be popularity some pretty girl she's got her beauty that she can think of maybe she's very popular in school maybe the boy can get any girl he wants he feels that he's kind of secured that's not security that will fade just like the flower in the field See it'll go won't be long just a few turns of sun that's gone then you've got a soul that has to live eternally that's what you and I have to take care of because the word of God tells us that the soul that sinth no no not not the flesh but the soul that sinth it shall surely die and so the last plague is death they in Egypt what was the last plague that they had there death there now now what's the last plague death but spiritual death there in the Garden of Eden Adam didn't die physically he didn't die but spiritually he died and so everything starts with the beginning amen amen he started at the beginning spiritually physically and then spiritually three things brothers so what are we going to do to follow seek after Perfection seek Perfection and when you get to that point where you believe that you are really sure God is going to have to do something with you have you ever have you ever thought about many people leave this earth and and and we we're we're sad about it and you ask yourself why why did they have to leave if you know what the plan of God is or if you know about the God's plan here on this Earth in the natural life we we have a destiny a very marked Destiny When God Says up to here and that's it he takes him and you don't have to question God why did you take him Lord no it's because that was the plan of God and so this young man in Luke 16 verse 19 let's let's read and we're gon to see where he found himself Lucas Lucas Luke 16 Luke 16 verse 19 we're going to see where this young man ended up after rejecting the Lord Jesus there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day you see sumptuously and there and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at the his gate full of sores and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments see Abraham a far off and Lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tor tormented in this [Music] flame now this is real this is real now you paint this picture and I believe as brother Bram says we all fail but when you fail you make it right that's why we have this message to restore us to restore us Amen to to to find out about where we're wrong in our Liv now many times the devil he makes us to fear and he's the one who uh who who who puts it in in us to to to to fall many times I've said the devil puts someone in in jail he puts them in jail but he's not the one who's going to take you out he can't take you out he can't take you out now I I tell you if the devil put you in jail that the devil will the devil take you out no the devil wants you to just get deep ER in that cell that's what the devil wants that we look at that we look like this young man that rejected the truth rejected eternal life one day he found himself in hell he found himself screaming now you make an example you take a a glass full of water just put your just barely dip your finger and as you dip it and you take it out you see how the water will drip he didn't have water but that's what he desired that would go there and to refresh his tongue you see he's not going to take water he just wanted a little drop but see the the child of God isn't isn't conformed or isn't satisfied with just a drop the Son of God wants more what does he want he wants more of God this young man he wanted more money more riches the Son of God wants more of God why so that he can be perfected following seeking after Perfection you see so when we're really convinced it's kind of difficult to convince ourselves and speaking about our young people how is a young man going to convince the one that he likes giving her the rules from the beginning of what he that wants in his home is that the way he's going to make her fall in love with him No No's she's gonna say no forget it I don't want none of this but if the young man he's tender calm he's loving he gives her flowers chocolates with that that might help let me give you a word of advice and I was talking to the brother brother Zach okay okay no no no no Pap oh brother Bob brother Bob okay okay and I was telling the brother and I said look brother the man and the woman they always listen through here but you know what the serpent that's where he went to go talk to Eve but the Son and Daughter of God they have to see with the eye of their heart they have to to hear with the eye of their heart or with the ear of their heart with the ear of their heart you say brother Samuel does my heart have an ear or see yes does my heart have an eye yes because you as a Christian I tell you you don't have a bad name no no oh you don't have a bad man you don't want a bad man in your life or a bad husband you want a good husband that that helps you that takes care of you that does good things for you because what what is it worth that you're in the house and you do your you play your role as as mother as as as as as wife and many make the mistake they say well if I get married I'm not going to have to do so much work and they get a man that puts them to work because that man he's lazy he doesn't want to work he wants to live in misery because he says he says that the poor shall inherit the kingdom of God but it doesn't work that way no [Laughter] no God help you sisters God help you brother find you a good wife amen amen in the message contending for the faith paragraph 55 just give me a few more minutes Brothers I forgot to put my watch on I didn't bring it today you want me to tell you a story according to what I thought I wanted I I I packed up my bag because my wife is usually the one who packs our bags and I and I forgot my watch and my wedding band when we were coming here she asked me where's your watch I forgot it did you put everything else in there yeah I'm terrible at those [Laughter] things I'm sorry that I found a good [Laughter] wife she's very she takes care of me us as men we forget a lot but it's not that God gave her to me I I I I I came I stumbled to her the only poor one was was Adam Adam God did give him his wife and he took her out of her side but I had to seek a wife so so get ready prepare yourself don't just go by your natural because they're hands good look and they have very straight hair or they or she looks very nice no no this eye will fail you this ear will fail you remember the death some thing failed Eve Eve here you listen to all kinds of gossip but right here amen from here you make a good decision from here you look for a good wife I don't know why I'm talking about this but I think someone needs [Laughter] it amen in the message contending for the faith to know God is to know the person Christ himself and to know him is is life not to know your textbook or to know your Creed or to know your catechism that isn't life it's to know Christ the person is is life eternal and that's what we wish to know amen amen and so this bishop told me brother brandham according to theology he said we had the Bible 1700 years before you became a nation and that's true St Thomas went over there and I preached there where s Thomas preached the original church that he established there in [Music] India when he went from Jerusalem to India and he established a church and he said from that point we've had the Bible and from that point we've had Christ Christianity but he said the but in India there's a critical point and he said Reed we've heard of Dr reidhead the man that came to you he was the great president of the M Sudan missions the greatest ones in the world that came that came to me and he said brother brandham I have sufficient degrees to plaster the walls with them I'm a doctor of theology I'm a doctor of this I have a bachelor's of art here and all kinds of of diplomas he said I've studied since I was eight years old but brother brandham said where is Christ in all of that and he said have the teachers made a mistake and where do all go that that that make mistakes where was this young man the the great error that you can make in your life is to reject Christ to reject the greatest mistake that you could ever make now the young man Young Rich he was crying out crying out not that he was all calm there in hell no he was crying out crying
