sister Wes with us and the the kids with us today so come on in and do and we'll then we'll read our scripture and uh we uh had the opportunity to stand with them in the water where Brother Dean could baptize them this past Thursday and we welcome them to Lula Georgia and we always say when you come here the first time you come you get a welcome the second time you come you're part of us we don't have anything to join we don't have any part we just part of the body of Christ and we're just you know serve trying to serve the Lord and doing the best we can all right in your scripture Romans 8 and then we'll go to Genesis 1 right Romans 8 verse 28 it be on the board for you and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren amen moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us that's a good point isn't it all right let's go back where we've been in Genesis 1 and uh just read our scripture from there and we'll pick up our thought Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the A and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God said unto them now what and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been studying for quite a while and talking about this why we read there in Romans uh you know about predestination for knowledge the Bible says those who he for know for new you know for no he did predestinate amen all right then we we know and realize that God predestines by forn knowledge amen it's not a thought that we used to have of one Church would believe it this way and one Church believes it that way and you have a lot of of uh different uh denominational churches and things that follow different routes of predestination and and all like that and you got what you call the calvinistic form of predestination which means god stamped it that's it you can't do anything about it's all done you just sit back and relax and try to enjoy what you can if you're a good person if you're supposed to be saved you will be saved if you're not you won't that's that's really what's taught to people all right then you got the Armenian form that would carry it over to a lot of works you know and and connecting in that but I I like to put them both together the best that I can and to understand that you know God predestines we've read there in the scripture by his forn knowledge amen those who he forew amen he did predestinate all right then that's a simple matter if we believe in God in the correct way if we believe in an eternal God that uh is infinite in his thinking that he knows everything before it ever happens and if we don't believe in that kind of a god what kind of a god do we believe in you know what what are we talking about uh is God just like we are that he changes his mind every other day and you know he likes this today and tomorrow he don't like that and he goes to something else and see we couldn't have any confidence in God in that way because he might change his mind the next day all right he might predestinate you one day and the next day he might forget about you because that's the way we think about in life you know of doing but see to believe that he's infinite Amen to believe that he knew ever that as the prophet of God that we follow after was teaching us that every n that would ever be in the world now this is the kind of God I believe in or and that he knew every time that natat would bat its eye right amen now that's that's a whole lot isn't it I mean I I don't like naps and you they just you know they're just billions and billions of them around all the time you know and you just think that God knew every move that that would ever make amen now if he didn't he's not God right you understand we can't pull anything over on him it's not something that we we we are smarter than he is cuz he made us remember we didn't make him that's all right and then in believing it then God predestines because predestinate means Destiny set before right or predetermined whatever you want to use the the term for so then we we read in the scripture where he said that Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated maybe you've thought about that a lot you know and wondering why would it be that it was and says even before they were born and then he tell like uh who was it Jeremiah one of the prophets there he said I knew you and ordained you to be a prophet before the world y well then we ought to understand that these things are not haphazardly happening I I what I said I don't go with the with the form of predetermined all doing because that will run out right right because God would that all be saved There's 7 billion people close in the world today you know what he would that everybody be saved he woulded every person that has ever been in the world to be saved cuz he's God right all right being that then why is it that some people are lost and some are saved it would have to be on the basis that you would be he would be dealing with for knowledge amen sure for knowledge is a great understanding because you go back into the mind of God is as we talk about Paul said you know Bringing Down the great things to the church one day and he said I have the mind of Christ all right now that was not meaning a transplant of the mind it was meaning by the new birth that Paul had within him that that was the mind of Christ that was being brought to him by that new birth amen right and that's way he the prophets could prophesy that's why they could uh speak before the world and tell things I mean speak when their time until what would happen even before the world and what would happen after the world Moses could write uh the first five books there of the Bible and tell what happened in the garden why because God had taken him into his for knowledge amen it opened Paul's understanding to where that he would would come forth with a knowledge of what would take place now remember for knowledge is knowledge before of what will be amen so you got to go to knowledge first if if the people had went to that first you wouldn't have had all of the splits in the churches cuz the Baptist Church actually split one time over the word over the predestination Doctrine and you know and then your your Presbyterian come along with it and some of your older form of independent Baptists got to the bases that they were more Armenian style I mean a calvinist style and they were say well we don't need to have a Revival yeah because God's going to save them anyway well what I always wondered if you going to do that why even go to church at all right I mean if you're going to believe it like that if you're going to believe well well God's going to save me he's going to save me well then why do anything right yeah eat drink and be married cuz tomorrow you die you know it's a hard way of saying it but it's truth and that's that's what people don't understand with me there one thing about it you don't have to worry about I what I believe cuz I tell you what I believe I don't have no secret code words you know I just tell it to way I believe it amen but see predestination is Destiny set but if you make God do it as picking one and not picking the other one right look what you've done if he picked Jacob and rejected Esau look What's happen happen right you make him a respector persons you make him to where that he wouldn't be giving everybody an opportunity but yet he does he gives everybody because you know God would that all as I said would be saved right sure but he knew who would and who wouldn't right if you're going to believe in him being God Amen if not then just take H Hazard L and forget it but you'll wind up against the wall one these days and you'll be wondering whether that God is real or not because that's the one thing I believe in I believe in a real God I don't believe in just an imagination or a thought or a concept amen I I believe God is real amen I don't believe that he ever had to come into existence right because he is existence he is what has brought everything into existence he is the Eternal amen all right and if we have eternal life today and the only way to have that is to be born again amen if you have eternal life you have the life of God living within you you said well that's hard to understand I agree that's why Nicodemus couldn't get it amen when he told him said you must be born again yep he said well wait a minute you mean I've got to go back into my mother and I got to come out again and Jesus said if I tell you Earthly things and you can't understand them in other words if I tell you the lower form of what you need to know right there's no need of talking of great things right amen but see Jesus when he said you must be born again look that up in the original it says You must be born from above amen amen cuz he said my kingdom is not of this world Amen right see the kingdom of God is not to meat and drink and and things like that the scripture says amen the kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost amen right but see what we need then is a new birth to be able to receive because the scripture says no man can call and I'm paraphrasing it no man can call Jesus the Christ what except he be born again amen why because you're trying to take the carnal mind and try to understand the spiritual God Amen see then that won't work so then what we need is the new birth to come and within us and then we've got the inside teacher right then the Bible would say you have no need that anybody teach you that's scripture sure come because the Holy Ghost inside of you will teach but now then he turns right around he said he puts teachers and Etc right in the body right God's not confused right see we need the inside teacher right to teach us what the outside teacher tells us the outside teacher is a five full ministry you know Apostles prophets evangelist pastors teachers right all right then in that if we get the new birth we have an inside teacher that's what's wrong with the natural world out here see as you you you got uh doctors I was looking the other day in a in a a thing that and it was telling about that I mean this is back two 2,000 3,000 years ago or so they were already studying back well on back about people that had migraines and you know bad headaches and you know what they would do and they actually had little things that they put on their head they bore a hole in their in their Scout Bo right in I mean this is 3,000 years ago this is not just 100 years ago or some idea this is way back but see they knew that there was something and they they said the demons was was in there and if I could get a hole in there you know they could get them demons out of you yeah and because they'd call everything a demon headaches and all kind of things well that's not demons that's a part of the human body that you know something's wrong with may be caused by a demon that has caused us but still but my point if those people back then already were studying about the human brain you know 3 4 5,000 years ago studying about the human brain then it must be right in the in the scripture there where it says the the imagination of man's heart mind is continually evil but then it says there's nothing to be able to refrain from his thinking right and you just think about a human being a human being and think about God because the Bible says that even the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things that are seen I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human but how many people am I I'm just one person with many manifestations amen all right see then your your sisters you're are a wife but you you're then you become a mother then you become a grandmother a great grandmother what is that that's you in many manifestations amen and that's what we believe about almighty God Amen right that God has many manifestations about him right to manifest himself right but that doesn't make it sful Gods right man because see that wouldn't fit his scripture right I if if there three or four God you going to have to have three or four Bibles that that should be sensible you know and and then you could be arguing of whether or not and I've always said that that and I'm just honest in the way I talk I'm sorry but old country boy that uh I kind of wish sometimes it was four or five Gods yeah because the things I do in my repentance might be able to filter through the chain you know getting up to him that may sound silly but you know I don't believe it that way I believe there's one true and living God but with many manifestations of that God that's right all right then that God that we're talking about is the one that had the forn knowledge amen those prophets never knew why was it just one man that knew what happened in Genesis right cuz it was only one man that God revealed himself to right all right then in revealing himself to Moses he could write what happened some almost 2,000 years before right see that's the forn knowledge of God Amen you look at in the Bible and think about it the Bible says that and to see the for knowledge of God and how that he's so infinite the Bible says that that one time they found a scroll and they stood before the water gate go look that up in your scripture sometime they stood before the Watergate and he read that scroll wasn't it odd that all of this come out with our president back there that had a thing called Watergate but at the same time that was taking place God was revealing his word to his bride through the prophet in the end time and you read there where it says and when the towers fall that the understanding of man would be what seven times greater right look at the opening of the word in the last days even all around the world more Bibles more uh doings than ever before right but it's in the scripture amen he would speak that down to the end the Bible tells you about the future home that we're going to tells you about the Millennium it tells you about the white Throne judgment it tells you all the things that's God's for knowledge am all right so then he could set that that would take place and those things would be right see then there's no way to change God's forn knowledge amen right no there's no need of you trying to fool with that right just believe it and accept it and say all right but you see I I want to believe it this way if I have a desire to be saved I believe God works on our desires you know what we desire if I desire to be saved he make a way right he make a way for me to be saved because I desire but that's the way it is with Jacob and Esau see Jacob had the desire in his heart for the birthright Esau didn't think anything about the birthright all right so then we can see that God could look down and see what Jacob and Esau would do amen and he could speak of it before the world right he says in Revelations uh what 138 there where it talks about uh the names written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world you know God could write their names down before the world ever begun right why because of his forn knowledge right see not because he predestinated us right uhuh it goes on the wrong wrong scale see God would that all be saved that's right but he knew some would be and some wouldn't that's that infinite God that I speaking of a moment ago because that God then after he brought everything into being after he had created the uh the the world Genesis 1 and you'll find that though that word God in the original there is where it's used 33 times I think in Genesis 1 but each time that word is Elohim which means self-existing amen he dwelt alone amen even though he would create the animals he had nothing like him in existence all right even though he could do those things but yet when he gets over there then to to Genesis 1:26 he says let us make man amen he said well look that word us they must have been two or three of them you know but see that's what we think about that's why we got it so massively confused right like John one in the beginning was a word and the Word was With God all right we stopped there and we say with though it must have been two or three of them you know but you don't read the rest of it and the Word was God all right so it solves a problem there's one true and living God Amen all right so then that's based upon the Bible then as we read of Genesis here of the creation of mankind all the animals all of the things that he could create but think about it a minute there was nothing like him right he's Eternal God he was still self-existing in other words he had nothing to exist with him like him you understand what it means the word self-existing means he existed alone all right meaning that there was nothing like him he could create the world he could create the animals the moon the stars the all of the things think and he still be the same word god read it in your Bible right then in Genesis 2 as he begins to create the natural man of Adam he says Lord God Lord God read your Bible just just I like for people to read their own Bible right it says Lord God right right the meaning something happened all right meaning that by this time God is no longer self-existing right it means the self-existing one is now revealing himself right what to his creation right all right so then when you do you pick up Genesis 1:26 there and it says let us make man as I said on John when it says with him it doesn't mean somebody beside the other one it means he is revealing himself right that's why I try to emphasize Genesis 1 you read it yourself it doesn't say Lord God in Genesis 1 that's right it says God Amen then in Genesis 2 it says Lord God Amen all right then in the writers that picked it up you can read scoffield footnotes and a lot of them are real good some of them I don't agree with but that's all right but see Lord God means he's not existing alone anymore he's going to reveal himself what to his creation amen all right now if we're going to take the word God to be what it is then the word god means object of worship because you can make a God out of platform piano cars people women they make Gods out of women today you know and and uh it just means object of worship amen but see this object of worship had no one to worship Him the animals couldn't worship him so he had to start doing something else so we know that in the Bible term and just giving you a long run in a hurry God said I'm not going to dwell alone amen I'm going to make man and I'm going to make him in my image right right amen all right now this is not the image of God as we look at it this is the image of the animals he gave us a foot like a bar a hand like a monkey all kind of things he made us to look like the animals called We're the top of the animal creation amen right that's why Darwin could follow the chain backward of the evolution we don't believe in in evolution I believe in Creative Evolution God created the animals amen all right he created the monkey he created the dog he created him higher higher higher higher higher the last one was man and he gave him a two-fold part as we'll try to cover you go to the Natural creation of man that natural creation of man you'll find out is just one man right and at that time when he created him Eve was still in Adam remember she had to be taken from Adam right he took a rib you know and made made Eve all right but that's not the creation that we want to look at this morning that's not the the creation of God that we want to look at we want to look at man and see that man is made in the image of God Amen and you think about it is I talking about the smartness of God the the the great understanding that he has now you look at mankind just look around you I said take a little old bitty thing in there cell phone down in the car cuz I always try to tell you you don't bring them up here they'll go off you know yeah and uh I can dial and I can talk to 12 hours on the other side of the Earth right mhm and I could just speak to them and they can talk to me as long as we understand each other in English you know and uh if that don't work they got another little device that you can take and and you can just type in what you want to say to somebody and overseas they just read it in Spanish or India you know what all of those languages Africa whatever it can go around the world in all kind of languages but go instantly now how can you explain that I mean we used to think about we had to had the wire run across you know I say the other day you know there wire run all the way across the ocean well that's what we started with now it shot off the satellites and back and all kind of things and and what they're letting us see is is just minute things I read one time that they had watch is back in 1900 when we was thinking about the old you know get under this thing and the thing Blaze off you know they had watches in 1900 that had cameras in them get smart wouldn't the first guy that come up with them things you know you remember that off of TV he was just showing what was doing he had telephone in his boots you know shoe all kind of thing to watch he could take pictures see they've had these things a long time why because God has allowed mankind to be able to break into his intelligence right all right brother mod at the end of the war there 42 or 3 44 somewhere in there when he got out they were going to school in and they were already talking about in 44 being able to decompose a human being and send it to California and put it back together they said they could send him and all that but they just couldn't get him back together all right now I wonder what they're doing right what I'm getting at the great intelligence of this last days shows the very infinite God in his intelligence because that's where they're getting it from you following me all right that great intelligence is more Superior than anything we could think of Amen right would you take a man you take this to a human being you just think about it I mean I'm 73 years old in my lifetime we came from an old t- model you know you had the brakes on it with with a leather straps around the drive shaft to stop it and most of the time you had to get out in front and hand crank it and break your arm by kicking and but you know what we had a car we was moving and those are beautiful Donny likes his but don't pick me up K to California in the sucker I don't want to bring me something with a air conditioner in it yeah all right something rides better yeah but my point is just to look at what we've come through In Our Lifetime right man and then you go back and you explain to human being that in that human being I don't have to tell my hands to move right right if he did i' had say fer move move hand move and I have to say to my feet move pick up move you don't have to do all that do you you say oh that's just an automatic process my point is trying to get you to see is that God could make a natural man in such a wonderful condition of what we are and you know that it says there as we said that let them multiply and replenish the Earth and have dominion amen that's right over the animals why is the animals afraid of us why is a great big Grizzly beer sniff in the wind smells a human runs the other way why cuz there still something in all of that that's leaderships and things that come down from the garden right right big old elephant unless something happens that you turn Rogue or whatever they call it they'll run from a human being right cuz that's still something the way that we even physically were made but mainly it's because of the way we were made spiritually that's right because we know the Bible and what did it John 5:24 God is a spirit they that worship Him must Worship in his spirit and Truth All right so if a Man was created according to Genesis 1 in the image of God he would first be created in the spiritual image right amen and that image would be in the image of an eternal God then no wonder we could be you could even create a world if it wasn't for God withholding you from it right amen why because there's nothing withholding from mankind what he can think of he can do why because he was created higher than the animals amen the animal deals with a little bit of knowledge a little bit of understanding he has a little bit of ability he can be trained right but he doesn't have a soul within him right see that animal doesn't have a soul that's why that the animal sacrifice was not it was enough to cover back there right right all the sins were pushed forward to Calvary right you've heard that he pushed up to where Jesus Christ could die once for all amen that would be the Old Testament people paying for their price and the New Testament paying for us right all right and in doing that that animal they could kill the animal and God ordained that to be sure he he he accepted that for the time amen but there was nothing in that animal could come back upon the the believer right because the animal didn't have a soul right the soul of man is a marvelous thing Soul means person being whatever you know all right in that then that man that would be created in the image of God it wouldn't be a physical man right it would be the image of God Amen H as we covered in the last message then this thinking about God now you say well we don't know whether you're right or not well you might not but you don't know whether I'm wrong either because you you don't have any way to prove it you just think about God coming down toward man that man could understand him right that's it amen would that not be the purpose right if we are his children right you know do we believe we're the children of God by the new birth right amen well don't you want your children to know about you amen I mean you see a kid and he's you see a daddy and he's walking and he you know like brother Mo used to say he can see me coming before he ever seen anything else CU my feet was always out you know I walk kind of duck walk I guess you call it and I can't run too fast cuz pigeon toed people their toes are turned in you can dig in run fter I didn't know where you knew that or not but that's that's science too but you see my kids come along and I see one of them every once a while and they're they're walking okay you know we talk about well they just like Daddy they look like Daddy they act like Daddy right right why you know they've got a personality of their own they have a soul of their own they have the beings of their own they have all of their senses of their own but they want to be like Mom and Daddy all children want to be like their parents and that's why we need to live a life before the because if we live a wrong life before them they're going to live like Mom and Daddy too they're not just going to walk like us they're going to drink like us and cuss like us and act like us and all those things right yeah exactly so that's why we need to be real careful the way we walk and talk and do but you understand what I'm getting at God wants his children to be like him amen Paul called us his offspring you remember at Mars Hill right when they had a little cubicle left and they said the unknown God you know because they had many gods and they said well you know just in in case we forgot one we'll leave a little hole over here and we'll say to the unknown God Paul said that's the one I want to talk to you about one you don't know anything about it but he said now you know yourself that you believe it we believe it that we're The Offspring of God now physically speaking phys just physically speaking and physically doing being you just think about Mankind you can take the dust of of the earth and make an automobile right y right and drive down the road at 100 mph he can take the dust and he can make an airplane and fly 2,000 M hour right why because some Factor about him that's yielding to that inward part of him right and even though he's not a child of God right it's still amazing what mankind can do right amen but you think about what about one that's in the image of God and then we know that God is a spirit but now let's don't lay too much on that because that has deceived us right we think about God just be in the spirit well he's just floating around you know well that's why in Africa they have the word I believe it's aoya I'm not certain right but they believe that the soul of man is the breath of man that's a Jehovah Witness and that's come from the Africa too in other words I breathe out you breathe in my soul goes to you your soul comes to me that's the way mankind believes a soul to be well you know that would be I'd be me one time Mark the next time sister Gail the next time we don't believe it that way right cuz that's just a breath right that you breathe that's an hour you breathe right but the soul of man is in the image of God Amen you know God had an image he walked on the earth one day sure sure Jesus said if you seen me you've seen the father amen that's right yes sir right amen see see we don't deal with this him being a spirit right we deal with him being a spiritual being that's a better way of saying it see you don't have to change the scripture cuz it's not you don't have to do that cuz he is a spirit he can he can be anywhere he wants to be he doesn't have to be on the moon today cuz a't nobody up there he don't have to be up there but if there's anybody up there he has to be there as a witness right God is a being amen he's real that's right Jesus said if you seen me he wasn't talking about this outward part right CU that outward part had a birth had a beginning but he said if You' seen me he said you've seen the father right when we get into Glory all of this is over with what do you think it's going to be a little Halo up here to represent the Holy Ghost and little something over here to represent the Father and Jesus standing down here represent a son no we'll be able to do as he said he said if youve seen me you've seen the father amen we look at him and know who he is cuz he's real that's the point I'm trying to get you to think about is a real God not just a thought of your mind there's people that thinks the good thoughts of your mind is God the bad thoughts is the devil well I don't get to fool with God being too much around me it's always a devil I don't know what you do right I have more bad thoughts than I have good ones you do we need to pray for you brother Dev I hope you do but you need to be honest and admit you got the problem too right I wish it was that it was all good but see what is the image of God to look back as I said through understanding and by way of the end time message were able to follow a lot of things that a lot of the people couldn't follow but yet you can still follow them through through the Greek and the Hebrews and the things and we were saying what would you use for God the only words they can come up with is Elohim which would be self-existing that's the earliest words they could use see because that that simply means the great Eternal exist but he exists alone right all right that's the word Elohim see and then when you get over in John 1 you go back and check your original we read it in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God the original said in the beginning was Elohim Elohim was with God and Elohim was God self-existing Amen see right one true and living God Amen he has many manifestations right right and there's no problem with being there on the River Jordan when you see Jesus standing here and a dove coming down and a voice speaking and saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell that's no problem amen right that's not three people that's three manifestation right that's more sure of proving one God than it is but we want to use it that's trying to prove that there's got to be three of them and then we come up with the good old Baptist understanding we old good old Baptist I was there Deacon for the Baptist Church and all this that and the other so I know the doctrine we believed in one true and living God that's the way we'd say it but you say well explain that that's what brother Mo said to me that time and I said it's God in three persons he said now you got a little intelligence man of a person is a personality the personality is an individual individual's a person now there's something wrong with what you're saying we're going on to read the rest of that that we quote God in three persons Blessed Trinity and there's no word in the Bible Trinity but then go on with what we was going to say co-equal and co-eternal now go back and read your Creeds co-equal and co-eternal Y how can son be Eternal there's no such thing as an eternal son you can't have that see there's no such thing in the Bible about God the Father you know being Eternal God the son being Eternal God the Holy Ghost being Eternal in the basis of what we think because we're trying to make it as three persons but when we look and see Almighty God and see that he is the Eternal God there is no two or three different Eternal lives right so the sunship see the Catholic Church come of it and so does your Protestants and they call it Eternal sunship now how can you have eternal sunship not any sensible words you don't need an education right right Eternal sunship you brother West are you mean your boy same age you are that don't work out too good and if he lives to be 100 years old he'll never be as old as you are he can't be see all right see then there can't be an eternal sunship but there can be an eternal godship amen right right hallu God was made manifest in flesh God was seen of Angels the scripture says right God was in this world that's right Immortal Eternal all wise God as we're quoting scriptures and that's his image that's what I was trying to get across Wednesday and trying to get to you the image of God right look and see how God came down right I know what do you mean right well listen I got a little sense and I hope that you're awake enough to understand it cuz that's what we do sometimes we sleep and then we don't understand what somebody says we miss it all right but you see we've got to admit now I was thinking about this the other day and I was thinking some way to try to explain you know what I try to say I'm talking about the revealing of God or God being made known amen to you and I right the making known he made known to Moses he wrote five books amen right he made known to Isaiah and Isaiah wrote a complete Bible in itself as far as the the beginning the middle of the ending and he made known his mind to those people to be able to write well that's what I'm depending upon him to do to make known to you and I the word that we can see him right and understand him then we'll see what kind of an image he was so you got to say whatever you want to say whatever words you want to use you've got to say that God had to be able to condescend downward for you and I to understand it right right amen now the wordings you use coming down is terminologies of Greek Hebrew Etc but you got to admit that if you just take a a person you know you take somebody born in Africa and they're they're raised there you know say they're raised back and they've never seen nothing and you bring them to you know time Squire and set them out yeah it'd be Haywire wouldn't it amen they never seen a car they never seen a light they never seen that'd be Haywire see that's the way our doctrines do a lot of times to us they go Haywire God we we think we got it figured out but all I'm saying if God if he says let us make man in our image then every how God came down you know to reveal himself then look at us the same way right and you'll see why we're like we are right amen not this physical part the inward part of us right so then God began to condescend the prophet of God we use that Wednesday you know CU we believe God sent a prophet in the last days am to bring the word of unto us but we don't make him God cuz he's not that there is a lot of people in the message that do make him God you go home click it in your computer run in William brandom and you're going to automatically find out a great big garbage can up front right but just remember the garbage can's always a scarecrow so go and read a little bit more all right but what I'm getting at whatever you want to use the terminologies you got to use something to bring it down to where this mind can see it right so the great Eternal God existing with nothing no Ires no molecules no atoms no no nothing he was self- existing it wasn't any Angels it wasn't any animals it wasn't any things and he begins to want to reveal himself he wants a family right you say well how do you know that brother cuz I'm looking at it now I'm looking at what his predestination has brought his family into being so I don't have any problems with the and you may have trouble with the wording but no problems with the understanding right I can see what he's wanted in his beginning he's now doing that among mankind righten he's revealing himself as he did the first that comes out we'll call it a little Halo of light whatever you want call that was God in another form not another God right right God in another form right I hope you were listening a moment ago when I said there on the River Jordan you got the son here the father over here and seem like the voice here that's not three Gods that's God in another form right right Jesus was standing there one day and they spoke something about Abraham to him and you know what he said he said before Abraham was I am amen amen they said you're a man not even 5050 and say you knew Abraham wasn't what he was saying was it he was simply saying that he was the one that spoke from the burning bush to Moses amen go back and run that I am right go back there to Moses burning bush why did I tell them who sent me said tell them I am sent you Jesus come along and say I am that I am the same as it did back there to Moses cuz it's the same God but not the flesh man that's where we get to trouble see the flesh man come into being about 2,000 years ago Hebrews 105 a body thou H has prepared me but it was that same God that created the world Amen yes sir now we're back to where that we were talking about Wednesday that the first part that we could look at and see of God is like a Halo light or whatever you want to call it they use the word theophany they use the word logos and those are simple terminologies of what we we use I mean I'm reading I'm coming out of the the footnotes of Scofield if you want to read them a theop is a body of God that's what it's called amen it a simple word for theophany it means a body of God all right now we as Sinners we had a God Amen y right right you know who he was amen the guy with the horns that we called a booger man you so we was a body for God to inhabit the devil right you might not like that but that's what we are right you look down at that little child and it's wonderful and sweet and I love him and you know that brother Wes a little boy the other day and set him up on the bar there where they could take a picture of him I love little kids but you just remember what PA what um Solomon said about him or David he said they're born in sin shapen in iniquity spouse my mother's wound a liar it's bad to look at a newborn baby and say there's a liar you don't have to worry about it M you just wait till it gets to work and talk mama don't lie daddy don't lie oh my little baby 2 years old cookie in his hand cookie all over his face did you get that cookie M you don't have to learn to lie cuz he's born in this domain right and you don't like to call him little devil that's that's not good words they're are children right CU if you going to call them Little Devils you're just calling us big Devils right cuz they're Offspring all right but you get what I'm talking about that the great Eternal God as he begin to come downward to reveal himself then you're coming to where it says in Genesis you know God created the heavens and the Earth amen well now course according to the Bible that's why we believe in one true and living God Amen Jesus Christ according to John 1 now what's the wording I use I said Jesus Christ I didn't say Jesus Jesus the flesh I've established that that was 2,000 years ago Jesus the Christ according to it's Ephesians 3 and9 I think it is but Hebrews 1 John 1 Colossians 1 all says that Jesus Christ created all time so he must have been the Christ that was back there so Peter was right when Peter said now who do you say that I am Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God right Jesus said Flesh and Blood didn't reveal that unto thee Peter but my Father which is in heaven I'll be my church on that right the Christ the Creator so when it says God created all things it wasn't Jesus the flesh standing there no no get away from that see it was the one that was inside of him the soul of that man amen that we call Jesus right the inward part of him was almighty God Amen are he was the biggest deceiver the world's ever seen and I don't believe that see then he could say Let There Be you're in Genesis 1 right let there be let there be let there be all right creating all the beautiful things that he made there through Genesis 1 and that word there in the Greek is logos speech right speech see logos all right I'm not a Greek scholar and I don't but I do like I said I like to read and that being that you see there that was doing the creating was the theophany which means a body of God we saw a thing down in Atlanta one time and they were never allowed to use it again at the Passion Play because they were uh it was copyrighted and it was beautiful they saw the world without form and void you remember Genesis 1 you know and then all at once the clouds rolled away and here stood this man well then that man said let there be and they begin to come into being these things I'm just telling you they had a good point of what they were doing we see the scene changed from the creation then to a baby crying in a cradle amen that was that same man that was here down in the Cradle which was Jesus Christ sir amen but one day on the earth on the River Jordan stood the same man amen that was standing back there there was a good point it was a good understanding for us carnal Minds that we have CU we believe in one true and living God Amen Moses standing there one day and what about a man that had talked to God lip to ear Etc read it amen but one day he said Lord I'd like to see you he said I'd just like to see you he said look you can't see me now you can't do it there's not time but he said Moses I tell you what you do said you remember that rock that you smoked that the water came out that watered all of the animals and the thing the Bible says go back and read it there so go stand in the cliff to the Rock cuz that's where he made the cliff where could water come out the go stand in that and he did said you I'll put my hand there now I'm just paraphrasing scripture but you read it and said when he walked by he saw the back part of a man amen yes that was the word theoy the body of God Amen right right you know what that same back part of a man one day got stripes for you and I right or you going to try to get another God that's right but see he begins to condescend downward to be able to let us know what he's like amen that's right and then he says let us make man he said why does it say us well that's God's way of doing it but how else could you say it if God has many forms to him many ways of making himself manifest would there be any problem with coming to Jesus walking upon the Earth you said well the father was inside of him that's right but he prayed outwardly right he prayed outwardly why because even though God was dwelling in that man why do you pray outwardly come on you got the new birth is God dwelling in you why do you pray out loud and why would Jesus say ask the father anything in my name and he would pray the father right that's not two Gods no that's God speaking to that greater part of him right the form that he was the Loos the theophany coming out from God is Not Another God it's God in another form right he just was simply here as I UST strating Wednesday and he just stepped out right but is he begin to step out the human mind is gaining the ground to understand God right and like I love to say it see the terminology is used by the scholars is Son of God the logos the theophany is called a Son of God what I love about it is be able to put that in scripture like I was telling you when a man there in Nebuchadnezzar you remember drove the three Hebrew children in the FY furnace come on it got so hot he killed the ones that told the men you remember the Bible right right next morning there when it cool down a little bit old Nebuchadnezzar goes over and looks down in there and he says when 1 2 3 they didn't burn up how come it didn't burn up when it even kill the ones that throw them in there he says 1 2 3 four how many did we throw in they said three read your Bible he said I see four men walking around yeah it wouldn't burn didn't even send your high on them right and he said that one I see is like unto the Son of God Amen that man had a great Revelation number one he knew whatever was down there to take care of them had to be the Eternal God right amen number two if he could see him he was in another form right so he said he's lacking to the Son of God they took them all out of there and wanted to get their God right they wanted to know about their God you see God is trying to reveal himself to you and I Amen to make himself known right but when he come into that logos or speech he could say Let There Be and out would come everything that's Genesis 1 but then when he got down a little further not a shorten in a hurry when he got down to the life day all right you got to just go back and read a little bit to understand Man was created on the sixth day right there's no creation on the seventh we certainly ain't going into the eth all right man was created on the sixth day okay cuz all the animals were created and man would have been created on the sixth day in Genesis 1 but yet you read in Genesis 2 about the bringing in of man but you fail to read Genesis 2 is just a referring as to what happened to Genesis 1 right so it says the beginning you know the doings in other words Genesis 2 is writing down what happened in Genesis 1 the 6th day telling you what happened listen when he said let us make man in our own image and our own likeness image means exact form the best any two uh twins identical they're still not identical they'll always be something a little bit different somewhere right cuz it cannot be see God said let us make man he's not talking to another being like one of father can we do this no but he's referring to all that God has revealed of himself in other forms to come down and if you wanted just a natural story I'll show you where the Prophet said it this way he said he's talking to animals about how to make me and you I love it when he makes it natural he said he's talking to animals that's right he look around animal said let us make man you said well did the Animals help no it's just way doing it cuz I come I said well let us do this all of us don't have to get up and go do it right but you see what I'm getting at he said let us make man and he made man a spiritual being he made man a spiritual being this afternoon we'll pick up going into Adam with it but he made man a spiritual being right he didn't make man like making him that's where we don't get the point of God in his doings I've spent Services trying to explain that when we see creation we think of something starting when we see beginning we think of something beginning you know a starting point that's what we've been taught all of our lives but that's not so in Bible terminologies in Bible terminology when it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the word's always been Eternal right right but it just means there was a time that was not comprehend Ended as being word but then he be to speak and unveil himself and bring it out and he brought a man out and he let that man have dominion over the garden all the animals in the garden looked up to that spiritual being because a physical being it took a little while before he got there the spiritual being was created first not created that's the point where it says in Revelations 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God now there was never a tongue God begin right that's human terminologies ex simply meaning in the beginning when this come into being that we can comprehend right I'm just trying to get you to see God there was a time God existed totally alone yet the prophet of God had said it like this he said God's not like the wind God is a being he said Heaven's my Throne Earth is my foot stol what house will you build for me he's real you don't just get a spirit anointing your spirit you wind up being an anointed one right right you got to have the life that was in the very God that created us to come into us as giving us a new birth not just changing our spirit around or it says in what is it is Ezekiel what is it uh I create a new you know get you a new heart and a new spirit and we think that's the Holy Spirit but he said then I put my spirit in you that's it amen that's right new heart and new spirit is a good idea alcoholic synonymous go through it every day getting people helped doing a good job right but they can't convert the person n right amen but if you can touch that Soul you don't have to worry about him drinking no more no amen right that's right you mean a drunk can be born again I believe it amen that's right abely there's nothing mankind could do so bad that he can't be saved amen except one thing blaspheming the holy spirit amen making fun of God and triping in the works of of God to the devil and now from then on that can't be done but that's the only thing right you can't be dirty enough that God can't save you cuz that's who he come to save he said the righteous don't need no salvation that's what Jesus said yep but those that are lost we see created man then in the image of God he created him in a theophany a logos a form higher than all the thing let's just call it the holy spirit amen let's just say it this way that God just took part of his spirit and put it over in a position to be called Adam right amen the Holy Spirit was in the garden the prophet said to lead those animals the Holy Spirit was in Adam to lead those that's spiritually speaking then when he was made physically he had control of the animals physically that's right right that's why they still have that control that that fear see because it comes all the way down but he created God God created Man In His Image what does God look like Abraham met a man one day and he called him MDC y Paul speaks of him in Romans 7 believe that's right seven where he speaks of M desic and he called him a man y amen yes sir that's what my whole point come on musician my whole point is we think we're something but just remember God created us what do you want to make it physical or spiritual or whatever he created you it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves the scripture we are his people in the Sheep of his Pastor amen amen see to understand the image that God would bring down and then bring man in that image and we'll pick up a little more this afternoon then we'll get on into the natural image of Adam amen and Adam had control of the animals but you know Eve did too sure amen yes sir but they were just a time that Eve was not in existence when Adam was created first physical he was male and female right amen read your Bible that's right then he took the rib from Adam and made Eve he called her a help meat not a help mate he called him a help meat that's right which means something part of you right God had a plan and a purpose to reveal himself Amen to Mankind and we see that unveiling before us as to see him and who he is right let's Stand Together 349 349 349 anybody have a need I've got PE like a river I've got peace like a river I've got peace like a river in my soul got anybody have need the open the river peace like a river in my soul well I got love like a fountain God gave it to me if you think that this that I'm talking about not right just remember one day
