sometimes it's good to just to get together in Fellowship amen I think we need that amen we need to sometimes I I my where my daughter and her husband goes to church at and they have several churches not too far within they have meetings they all and and sometimes I envy that and well I thought well brother Wade he ain't too far and there always have meetings certain people so it's good to get out every now and then just to have fellowship and enjoy the different brothers and you know the five-fold ministry amen so we appreciate that amen I want to read this to you before we get started little things that I picked up along the way and if you've heard this before just count it to my ignorance but I I just want to read this to you and uh and then we'll get right into the word of the Lord amen so he told me to take my time and my wife's sitting back there and you know get too far she'll go like this that mean you know like scissors that means okay cut it amen cut it you know I told her somebody one time said we uh there's a sister used to go to our church they don't go no more they moved and and uh her her and her daughter and my wife they take notes and well I guess I don't know who all takes notes at the church but usually you know when the preacher he starts getting you know wounding down they'll close their notebooks and that means well you know he's fixing the clothes and and everything and I said you know I said well just close your notebook just hold it up close it and a sister uh said hey I'm going to sit and watch your wife and so I know that when uh she closes her notebook you're about finished amen so anyway I'll read this to you and then we'll get right started amen it says a lady went to the pastor of the church and said I won't be attending church anymore he said might ask why I see people on their cell phones texting and typing during the service some are gossiping some just aren't living right some are sleeping some are staring at me they all are just Hypocrites the pastor was silent then he said can I ask you to do something for me before you make your final decision she said sure what's that he said take a glass of water and walk around the church two times and don't let any of the water fall out of the glass she said yes I can do that she would got the glass of water walked around the church two times she came back said proudly it's done the pastor asked her said asked her these questions did you see anybody on their phone did you see anybody gossiping was anybody living wrong did you see anyone sleeping she said I didn't see anything because I was so focused on this glass so no water would spill out he told her when you come to church you should be just that focused on God so that you don't fall that's why Jesus said follow me he did not say follow Christians don't let your relationship with God be determined by how others relate to God let it be ter determined by how focused you are on God Amen so I appreciate that how many's focus on God this morning amen I want to be focused on God cuz you know the prophet said you get what you expect amen so whatever you expect this morning that's what you get and I want my expectation to be on him this morning amen and he won't let me down you may let me down brother Wayne may let me down brother Homer may let me down but God will never let me down amen you believe that this morning stand together with me and if you have your Bibles turn with me to the book of Acts the 24th chapter as you're turning there how many's got a need this morning amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're so needful of you this morning Lord yes Lord father I need you every day of my life Lord every second every moment of my life I need you Lord Jesus and Lord I just ask oh God that you just come and be with us this morning Lord I believe you're already here Lord we felt your presence Lord Lord the song service and the Lord the the the the Sunday school and different on things Lord the special Lord you're in the midst thank you Lord for being in the midst Lord and when you come in the midst great things are bound to happen so father we just ask oh God that you just let me Lord be a willing vessel this morning Lord and let me move myself aside Lord and you do this speaking this morning Father Lord just a little simple thought father but Lord I pray Lord you take the words that I say Lord and may it uh go into the hearts of your brothers and sisters this morning your young people Lord whoever may be streaming or whatever Lord I pray Lord you just Minister Lord I can say the words Lord but it takes you Lord to do the work Lord God I pray Lord you do a work in each and every life this morning Father Lord you see the hands you know what was behind each and every hand before it was raised father take control now Lord God help me Lord anoint my lips let me say those things you'd have me to say refrain from those things that you would not want me to say father and I pray Lord you anoint the hearts and ears of The Listener this morning Lord that you just may they receive those things that they have need of in Jesus name amen oh you love him this morning amen excuse me amen we just appreciate the Lord man it was so good to see Brother Sam Dell last night amen just that just breaks your heart some amen but you oh we know that there's a better place there's a better home a waiting amen sometimes we might not understand some things why these things have to happen why this but we know there's a better place waiting for us amen and so we appreciate that acts the 24th chapter 24th verse amen try not to hold you too long but we just want to just go about what the Lord wants us to go by amen acts 24: 24 and after certain days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla which was a Jewish he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the the faith in Christ and as he reasoned of righteousness Temperance and judgment to come Felix trembled and an and and and answered go thy way for this time when I have a convenient season I will call for thee she hoped he hoped also that money should have been given him a PA that he might uh loose him wherefore he sent for him the offerer and commune with him I wonder why he did that there was something about Paul that that just gripped Felix his heart right yeah verse 27 but after two years porus Festus came into Felix room and Felix willing to show the Jews of pleasure left Paul bound may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated this morning amen i' like to take for a little thought this morning if I could amen missing your opportunity missing your opportunity and so in doing this and and here we are this morning we got an we each and every one of us have an opportunity to this morning amen and to come we've had this opportunity to come to the house of God and now it's up to me and you what we're going to do with this opportunity amen we may miss it this morning or may we or may we just grab a hold of our opportunity this morning now I looked up that word opportunity and it means a favorable juncture of of circumstances and I thought well a juncture what does that juncture mean amen am not on no hold it right there it right there okay it says a favorable juncture of circumstances now juncture I looked up that word juncture means a point of time especially critical or important I think if there ever was a time that me and you are living in this today it's right now that's very important amen cuz you look at every situation you look at the world's situation you look at the economy and everywhere she's falling apart amen and so we're living in a critical or important time amen where decision has to be made amen a point in time especially critical or important by concurrence circumstances he says at the juncture a decision has to be made so we're at that time where a decision has to be made whether we're going to live for Christ or not live for Christ whether you're going to walk with God or not walk with God whether you're going to worship God or not worship God we're living in that time friends we're here I don't want to miss my opportunity this morning but I want to take my opportunity to raise my hands to tell God how much I love him how much I care about him hallelujah amen oh my amen it said at the juncture says the decision must whether you stay or walk out on so here we're here at the juncture are you going to stay with the message of the hour with the word of God or are you going to walk out are you going to quit or are you going to go on for the enduration I say I'm going to keep going on I'm going to keep pressing on Amen I may not understand some things but I'm going to keep pressing on Amen Hallelujah I just I just love the Lord I than them songs this morning and the specials and the the Sunday School it would God all me and my wife going through a certain situation and we begin to talk about it you know we and this this been coming back stand still and let God work amen hallelujah and he's in the midst of the storm in the midst of the situation and he can take a care of everything hallelujah amen so since I'm at the juncture I'm going to just stay put and put my trust in almighty God I can't put my I trust in nobody else amen hey like I said brother waiter fail me my wife failed me amen the the president of the United States will fail me but my God will never fail me amen hallelujah he's still moving when I can't feel him he's still moving when I can't see him he's still moving when I can't see him he's still working oh you believe that this morning Hallelujah Hallelujah see and it goes on to say opportunity a good chance for advancement or progress what mean you got a good chance this morning for advancement in the spirit of God Amen a good chance for Progress amen you ever heard that statement it's just a little window of opportunity a margin of opportunity or critical window I've often heard like if a person's going to have a heart transplant or something like that they just got a little window of opportunity and if they miss that window it's too late what about us this morning what about us oh I don't want it to be too late for me and you amen that's why I'm going to come to the house of God Amen and take my opportunity while I've got it amen like that song we used to sing amen I believe I'll raise my hands while I got a chance cuz I may not have a chance at the wall I believe I'll testify while I got a chance cuz I may not have a chance at the wall amen I believe I'll just tell somebody about Jesus well I got a chance we used to same back in Pentecost you just can't keep it to yourself you got to tell somebody else Heen I got to tell somebody else about the goodness of God amen see it's a critical window it's a period of time where certain desire or outcome can be made what's your certain desire this morning right what you want the outcome of this service to be this morning see whatever you want it to be this is your opportunity amen you'll not have another chance this church at this service after we go home for him it'll be history and you'll never can pull it oh I wish I could pull a lot of services back I wish I could pull a lot of years back brother way I'd have done things maybe a little bit different right God help us missing your opport think about it friends think about it young people this morning are you missing your opportunity you got a chance this morning you say I need I want more the Holy Ghost well I believe he's here to give it to you don't let this don't let this be don't be this your opportunity this morning Hallelujah says it's a period of time you know where certain desire like I said Can the outcome what you want the period but when the p period is over the window opportunities closed that's it oh God after this service this morning it'd be it oh I wonder many times I could pull back a lot of services and say God I would done this I'd have raised my hands amen I I I I I'd have came down in oldfashioned altar whatever it was Hallelujah I'd have done it I think about this you know I believe this is an opportunity of a life time I working somewhere one time went to work that day and this went to work this Gody they told me said said uh David said this guy he's he's putting his two weeks notice I said said really he said yeah I said so I went over there started talking with him and I said I I hear you put in your two weeks notice he said yeah he said oh DAV but it's an opportunity for a lifetime and said I got to take it well I got this opportunity he said only a person only getes this opportunity once in a lifetime and I got to take it while it's where it's there I don't he said I don't want to miss it well that's in the natural well what about the spiritual this morning amen you're here this morning amen I come to house to to have church uh I come to the CH Church to have God come on in the midst of us this morning and let us see him work this morning let us see him move in our midst this morning it's my opportunity I want to take advantage of it amen I want to take advantage of being you don't have to wait for brother Wade or the S leader we are to take our our opportunity this morning and say Lord I love you I appreciate you I want to lift my hands to you and tell you how much I adore you how much I than about you lord it's an opportunity of a lifetime between life and death oh my see me and you come to the house of God this morning it's our opportunity here we are we come here each one of us I don't know what you want out of the service this morning amen but this is your opportunity amen you might have come here just to see something to criticize well the devil show you plenty to criticize but I didn't come here to criticize this morning but man I come here to see God I come here to see him do what he said he promised he would do amen he promised that he'd be in the midst of us amen he promised we're two and three are gather together in my name I he'll be here I believe he's here this morning to do the impossible Hallelujah amen so many you have an opportunity this morning to what to respond to the word you can say Amen you can say oh my you can say oh me or whatever but it's your opportunity to do with it what you want to see God has a provided way he's provided this way for me and you this morning now what are we going to do see brother bradam said it like this that there's never been a better way for a chicken to be born than to hatch his way out scr he say scrp that's why that big so just scratch his way out of the shell said if you try to Hur try to hurry it or or or pull him out said you'll kill him said this is God's provided way for him to be born well what about this morning in the house of God there's a provided way for me and you to become Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah there's nothing like coming in an oldfashioned altar and weeping our way to Calvary I know everybody's different amen we all don't worship them the same way some will raise their hands and just just not there with their hands raised some will have tears flowing in their face amen but whatever your experience is that's your experience I can't whatever my brother White's experience is different than mine amen but I got to take my experience amen and say God this is what I need I need more of you this morning amen this is my opportunity Amen to reach out to you this morning let me not miss my opportunity Hallelujah I don't want to miss it amen a lot of people's Miss theirs right amen hallelujah it's God's provided way and in here in this Mission your opportunity I think about non there he was you can find his story in the book of Second Kings the fth chapter and I think about him and oh he almost missed his opportunity there he was there and he was a captain in the in the army of Syria and during one their raids against Israel they had kep cap captured took captivity a Israelite girl right but you know during her captivity even though she was in a foreign land away maybe from her parents away from anything she still held her head up high oh that's what I want to do this morning amen when I'm on my job or wherever I'm at I want to hold my head up high let people to know that I'm a son of the king I'm a son of the most high God right hallelujah amen and so that little girl that they had took a prisoner took captivity amen they had she was a a a little mistress there to non and his wife and you know what even though she was away from a foreign land in a different country in a foreign land away from her people she like I said she still had her head high and she still had a testimony cuz this is what she said to her mistress non's wife would to God that my master non would know about my God that's in Israel that we have a prophet there amen that's right she begin to testify oh I like it when you begin to testify that's right amen oh she didn't hold back amen Our God Amen he's God and he don't change he's God up on the platform he's God back of the door he's God in the amen Corner he's God forever more and I know he's God and God don't never change Hallelujah he she begin to testify and said my God's A Healer amen my God's a deliverer she begin to testify how her when her people were in bondage over in Egypt that God brought them out through the hand of Moses that he's still the same yesterday today and forever and something struck non's heart and you can read it like I said and he he sat down wrote The King a letter when the king got the letter said Hey listen who am I to save or to kill and he read his clothes he said my but Elisha heard about it right amen and so he got his Chariot got his servant Gaza went down there to non's house and old non thought now you know if he really be be a man of God he'll come in here and he'll wave his hand over the place and I'll be made white as as wool again and everything will be all right but hey it wasn't like that oh sometimes you would say well I'm going to the house of God and brother Wade's going to preach or whoever it is and the service is going to be this way this way and this way but it don't go this way this way this way it goes that way that way that way and we get kind of disappointed amen oh but I want to say God whatever you want for the service that's what I want just don't let me Miss my opportunity amen Oh my he got kind of mad the scripture says and he sent his servant in there you know and said Hey listen he wants you to go dip down in Jordan seven times amen AR he got mad about that he said listen ain't some of the rivers up here better than the rivers of Jordan why do I have to go down there he said go washing Jordan that's all I know amen his servant said hey if you have told you to do something that was better or more no you'd have done

gripped his heart amen oh my what a what a testimony you've heard people how they come to the Lord or come to the and he gripped your heart something must have gripped Felix's heart cuz it says he trembled Paul begin to talk about righteousness and Temperance and judgment to come Felix trembled that's right but he said this at a camore go your way for now Paul at a more convenient season I'll

guilty of is the way you call heresy that's the way I worship the god of my fathers amen he began to testify to him over there the in chapter 26 oh King AG grippa said bring him I I like to hear the man for myself and King Ag grippa and Paul begin to say listen oh King I wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision begin to testify how that the Lord came to him when he was on the road to Damascus to rest so some uh Christians amen that's it and that light that Shone that brother spoke about this morning the same light amen that's over the head of the Prophet same light that struck Paul down on the road to Damascus same light that led the children of Israel out of the uh Egypt amen he's still that same light today and he's still leading his church Hallelujah he begin to testify amen and begin to speak amen begin to tell his testimony amen then he looked at O King Ag grippa and said Hey listen oh King do you know the prophets and before he could answer he said I know you know the prophets cuz these things wasn't done in the corner oh I could ask you this morning do you know the prophet William brandom I'd say before you would answer I say you do cuz these things wasn't done in the corner amen we can testify these things amen and the King said Festus before he even God got there Fest said Paul much learning has made thee mad can you imagine he said I ain't mad you know I'm not mad but uh I speak forth the words of truth and soberness and king of gria said almost you persuade me almost but almost ain't good enough can you imagine almost I don't want to be an almost Christian this morning I want to be a Christian I don't want to to be almost uh get to heaven I want to make it amen I don't want to almost go in the Rapture I want to make the Rapture I don't want almost a body change I need a body change hallelujah amen come listen 1955 the unwelcome Christ he said listen so many people in that day missed their opportunity he said you know there's so many missing their opportunity when you come into His presence and then turn away oh what an opportunity he said for them women boys and girls to come before Christ and pour out their soul amen oh they had an opportunity amen you got an opportunity this morning now I think about this it was let me sit that set the scene here's this big old fella by the name of Simon a Pharisee brother BR calls him roly poy ro ro rubbing his big fat chubby hands and he's walking back and forth and rubbing them big old fat roly poly hands now say he I got it oh I I'll have a great feast I mean with the money I got he said I can invite my associates my cohorts and my I'll just put on the I'll put on the dogs so to speak I'll put on The Big Show my I'll get the choice meets H man the choice beef and the choice pork and all the sauces and my the barbecue and my and all all the hot sauces and everything and I'll just get everything and my I'll put on The Big Show then he's walking back and forth again he said wonder what I can do for an entertainment they said H I got it I invite that what they call that person they call Jesus of Nazareth he's a phony he's a fraud and I invite him here to my to my feast and I I'll prove to my associates that he's a phony that he's nothing but a fake ain't who he says he is and won't I be the Talk of the Town amen so he writes a little gets his little paper out he makes a note amen he says I invite you Jesus of Nazareth to my house for a feast at such and such a Daye hands it to his curier and his cuer takes off and brother Bram said in that day it was hot and that cuer was looking for Jesus amen he's going back and forth and he's probably sweating and he's tired and he's weary and he gets to this town brother Aaron and he says hey I I heard that Jesus of Nazareth was here said you just missed him said he's 15 miles up the road said if you just go up there you'll find him so he's walking and man he's hot and he's sweating and he gets there all of a sudden he buns into up Phillip and Philip says back back now listen our Master he's he's he's preaching and he's fixing to pray for the sick and he said but I got in M he said just a minute you can have an audience with him but just wait a minute and man they here they were maybe he's getting impatient he goes again he said I told you and maybe he bumped into Peter this time and Peter says hey didn't philli tell you you know how Peter was he said listen just a minute oh I hear him say Amen he's closing out I'll see if you see he goes up there he hands Jesus's the invitation the note Jesus reads it and he says you tell your master I'll be there now listen what the prophet said the same message 1955 the unwelcome Christ he said but he had a mission that seemed to be more important he said listen isn't it the truth today that our work our work and our hous work the washing and the arning are some little card party we belong to our social standing is too important to come to an old fashioned Altar and weep before him and receive him into our hearts oh how many Earthly things the tides of the earth seems to be so much greater to us than meeting Jesus he said that's the way this curier felt to get this big fat Pharisees message to Jesus was more important than the destination of his soul wow oh God help us then there he stood in the very presence of the Fountain of Life and his duties of Earth had him so bound until he could not see his own need for Jesus oh God what about it this morning here mean you got an opportunity I wonder if her own social standing our own needs in our life it's got us so bound that we can't see that we need him this morning amen help us and he turned away and back across the mounts he goes down to that Palestine he said how did he do it could you imagine such an opportunity and then lay it down he said don't let that be your stand well if he would raise up today and had the same opportunity he he said what a difference it would be you do it today again amen oh my in the the message 1962 me meanest man I know he said what an opportunity God gave that man that poor miserable man I wish I could have stood there I'd have fell down at his feet the first thing before I said anything about what the Cardinal wanted I said Lord Jesus be merciful to me a sinner what about it this morning hallelujah what about it this morning amen he said i' bow he said i' have felt be Mur then I'd have that have been the first thing in my life knowing that he was life and only resource to God was through him I would have accepted him let him be my first no savior first and let the mission that the Cardinal had give me or the pope or District man or whatever he was that give me a mission I have sought Christ first what about it this morning amen who do you want to seek first wor amen well I'll just come to church and I'll come in a couple weeks amen and see what's going to go with the boat and everything like that and all this I'll come and do all Andy this this free of charge now amen come on now come on church amen we better go by the leadership of the Lord amen Judah he Thomas missed one service and missed God Amen Tom amen Thomas did Judas got so close he kissed the door but didn't make it in what about me and you this morning we got an opportunity and then when he gets to Simon's house you all know the story how that brother Brown describes it so beautiful how they got a foot wash flunky and the only way of transportation back then they had they walked that their Palestinian garment he said hung Loosely and the other and said the the manure and the travel cuz the donkeys and stuff they roke the same road that they did and the manure and all that and the birds come and pecking in it and scattering it everywhere and a dust and all that it get on there and it stunk and you didn't feel like meeting whoever it was like a brother Wade and sister June had invited your house and you walked and you didn't feel so they had a what they call a footwash flunky at the door and he would meet him and wash their feet and their hands and everything oh you know how he was and brother BR got up and said how they kiss him from neck to neck and everything and oh it's so beautiful he said but my Lord got in there unnoticed right got in there unnoticed sat over in a corner unwelcome he's here this morning he promised he'd be here me and you invited him and he goes where he's invited now if he is he sit over in the corner with unwashed feet this is your opportunity what are you going to do with it listen what he says amen he said on uh Jesus keeps all his PO appointments 1964 he said that's like some of our modern revivals he said the French men call him Jesu Jesu with dirty feet can you imagine me and my wife listened to a tape brother BR first time he ever used that scripture about him being invited to Simon's house 1955 campbellville Kentucky on a Methodist Campground and he preached a message titled pride and at the end of that mess message he was trying to get them said how many wants to entertain him how many wants to worship Him how many wants to wash his feet and he said no one raise her hands can you imagine brother W here he is a prophet of God that's been Vindicated amen and he could get no what who am I then amen who am I it takes God to move you amen sometimes I'm I'm I'm come to a conclusion brother Wade that some people can't be moved oh God God help us I want to be moved I want to be stirred my heart's been stirred my soul's been stirred I don't want him sit over in a corner with unwashed feet brother man begins to say Jesus he's crying he's weeping he said oh he said what's the matter he said I know what's the matter he said let me look into your eyes you think you're so good let me look in your eyes I'll tell if you're good or not then he went on and say hey he healed your sick last night he he did this he performed Mighty signs and wonders and you let him sit here just morning with unwashed feet you got too much pride help us Lord amen so here again he says Frenchman he said he was invited me to come and here he is and he got in some other way and unnoticed he sits over as a wall flow he was just much out of place he been to a place you thought my I'm out of place being here right I'm out of place I wish I was somewhere else I wish I was back home amen said he sits over as a Wallflower he just as much out of place he's in some other modern Revival banquet so-called religious gatherings he was out of place nobody was paying any attention to him they were too busy with other things although he was invited but he wasn't welcome when he come he said what happened to that footwash funky how did he ever miss that opportunity I wish I could had took had that opportunity had his opportunity oh my I have know he been coming I've been standing there waiting for him amen oh he's come this oh brother W's here this morning I'm waiting for him God let me wash your feet let me wash your feet let me do your service he said Brother David how you do that when I put my arms in a brother put my arms around him and say brother I love you I appreciate you Lord I believe I'm washing his feet what about you this morning do you want to wash his feet he said over in the corner this is your opportunity amen hallelujah this is your opportunity amen oh we think we're big so and so and all this amen God help us we think because we got the message amen hey if it wasn't for God's grace mean you go to hell just like the sinner will amen sometimes we need more love amen we want if I went to my brother now my brother used to follow the message amen he don't go to church no more if he goes he goes a big uh charismatic church but what if I went to his house every day if I lived around him and said you know what you shouldn't be doing this you shouldn't be doing that you're going to hell if you keep on doing that you're going to do this and do this you going to miss this but if I can just show him love amen now if he ask me I'm going to tell him according to the word amen but I want to just live that life yeah amen me and my wife we got her she's got our sister that's kind of interested Amen in her brother and different thing God had let us just be salty amen so they can become thirsty God it's an opportunity hallelujah amen he said how did he miss it oh he said I wish he said how did he do it he said now let's not condemn him too much because we might do the same thing and not know it see he missed him on my Hallelujah pardon me real quick Qui I'm trying to hurry amen I think about blind Bemus amen and we all know the story brother tells it so beautifully how that he has that them D Turtle does that does them tricks so he can make a living and there he is sitting there and them Turtle does is is doing them tricks he's they're coming by putting money in there and all of a sudden his daughter gets sick where he feels his way along the wall he prays he said father Lord you see my daughter Lord if you just toucher said this this total do that I use to make money they perform tricks and people pay me money said I offer them up as a sacrifice for what you done for my daughter that's his means of living God came on the scene what did he do he kept his word amen then back then the prophet of God said they had seen ey Lambs instead of seen ey dogs and he had one and his wife got sick he made his way felt his way around again said Lord my wife's sick you see my wife I need her she helps me Lord would you touch her Lord and heal her and if you do I'll offer this lamb as a sacrifice for what you did God came on the scene amen he's going down to the temple cfas is the high priest said where you going there blind Bame said I'm going to offer this lamb as for to sacrifice unto God for what he has done for my wife she said blind barus ain't that your eyes said I'll give you a lamb he said I didn't promise God any lamb I promised him this lamb and because he kept his word god kept his word and there was a lamb come walking down the dusty road he was Jehovah gy God provided him a lamb I'm saying this to say this that hey there was a lot of sick and Afflicted folks probably back then in the time of Barb but he didn't want to miss his opportunity Hallelujah he said I got to get to him I got to get to Jesus hallelujah amen he took an advantage of his opportunity I think about the Rich Young Ruler he come running came running amen cuz he wanted to know fell down and the Master's knees feet and said what must I do to inherit eternal life and you don't see that too much they did come running so what must I do to already eternal life he quoted the Commandments to him and he said hey I've kept all these from my youth up that mean you to know say hey he wasn't no Renegade he probably knew Church protocol he knew how to come in and come out know how to hold his hands just right but the Lord being that God Prophet looked into his life said you lack one thing go sell what you have come take up your cross give to the poor take up your cross and follow me and you'll have Treasures in Heaven now all he seen was his treasures in his barns he couldn't see his Rapture all he see was his treasure and bar oh God and he gave that all up he missed his opportunity there he was staring eternal life right in the face but he missed it brother Wade yes sir oh brother brother Bob he missed it missed his opportunity you said one if he'd have another chance I think here's what he'd do if he had another chance you know cuz Jesus tells the parable about him the beggar laying at his door at his gate begging for crumbs and the dogs would come and lick the sores right and I imagine old that Rich Young Ruler he proba said my lord I can't have none of my associates over I can't now have none of my friend look at him such a sore sight laying there at my gate I wish he' just die so it came to that spot and he did die and then you know the story how that Jesus talks about the parable that the rich man died seeing Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham if he had another chance if he could roll back the curtain of time he wouldn't send no servant out there to get Lazarus he'd go out there himself and he'd pick up Lazarus in his arms he'd walk into his house he wouldn't put him on No guest bed he'd lay him on his bed he'd go over to the closet Rob back the closet door said anything you want Lazareth any robe whatever you want it's yours don't worry about any kind of physician I got the money I'll buy the best I'll hire the best physician any Chariot that I got it's yours but he misses opportunity can you can you imagine what about us like I said if we could roll out the curtain of time in St Luke 1941-44 Jesus is looking over Jerusalem and he's weeping he's weeping he said Old Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I would have gathered you like a hen with her brood but you would not said you missed your day of opportunity you missed your hour of visitation amen I wonder if he's looking at us this morning reaping and saying you're missing your opportunity you're missing your opportunity Ephesians 5:116 Paul writes it like that Redeeming the time because of days are evil Redeeming the time was a buying up time oh if I could buy some more time yeah if I could buy a little more extra time God help me amen Redeeming the time cuz are evil amen I believe we ought to make out make the most out of the every opportunity we're given we're here this morning and we're given this opportunity let us make the most out of it like I said earlier tomorrow this after while this church this service will be history you can't bring it back God help me I think Paul was personally familiar with the perspective that each day could be his last yeah amen I've said that a lot I remember brother way I don't know if I said it here before 1969 my mom and dad were baptized Hardy Arkansas started following the message I just a boy 9 years old and then later on about I was 10 11 years old she was iring some clothes out in the den and she said David I'll be surprised if you see her 12th birthday that's just how close they thought it was brother Wade and they lived like it was that close today we have an opportunity but we use excuses right used to we get together at people's house when they we didn't have no church to go to when we first started and we listen to tapes amen now hey I believe in pushing Play Amen and I believe in listening too amen God help us amen help me to push play Lord let me I'm I'm I'm to determination that there's a bunch of young people that don't realize that we've had a voice in our day amen oh my I like it when he gets up there say good evening friends it's a certain sound amen I seen 12 I seen another 12 i' have never dreamed amen like you said tell tell me if You' have said hey this happen this a happened you said you see his dead in the shape he was is in he said no you're lying the rapture's going to take place place but here we are we're still fighting the great God help us we got an opportunity oh God don't let it run out amen I don't know when the last time may be but it's going to be somebody's last time we good it's a sense of urgency somebody wrote this in a poem I only have just a minute only 60 seconds in it forced upon me I can't refuse it I didn't choose it but it's it's up to me to use it I must suffer if I lose it give a count if I abuse it just a tiny little minute but eternity is in it that's right amen eternity is in it Hallelujah again brother 1955 the unwelcome Christ listen what he says oh you Pharisees you've been going to church all these times and supposed to be a Christian he knows what you are yes he knows what you are he knows what I am father help me help me Lord he knows my attitude he knows what I'm God and don't think the devil but way you'd be preaching like I heard somebody saying somebody get up walk out and maybe they just had to go leave because they they or get up to go and you go man they're walking out I wonder if I said anything and the devil goes right where you're preaching under the anointing then the devil goes to working on you he said they walked cuz they don't like you amen you said something made them mad and all that and the devil go to walk working on you amen and that's the way it is or whatever amen or this person maybe they got somebody something on their mind they didn't shake your hand well my wonder what's wrong with him wonder what's wrong with her amen God help us amen this is our opportunity God help me to make things right amen I want to be like this I want to preach like I'm a dying man preaching to a dying congregation right cuz we are this could be some somebody's Last Chance amen missing your opportunity amen he said don't worry he said he knows who you are he knows what's on the inside of you you're ashamed to come to the altar after belonging to church so long but he knows you he knows what's on the inside of you amen amen let May me take it a little a step further before we go on Amen now can you see this B A lady here she's ill Fame prostitute wh woman of the streets and so she walks down her little creaky stairs that day she looks around she goes man the streets are empty I ain't going to make much money today wonder what's going on then she oh yeah I remember Simon's having a big old feast and then she prayed thanks my Lord I wish I could sit down to a good meal I ain't had a good meal in ever so often I wish I could sit down to a good meal and she walks down you know by maybe past Simon's house and she looks through the window and over in the corner she sees him she turns she's thinking and then she turns back she says no that can't be said is it said I think that's him and she looks again she that is him I've heard about him in fact I heard how that he was at a funeral possession this woman the Widow of Nan is what I heard and he stopped a funeral possession and raised that widow's little boy to life again so that's him and she probably thought well I know protocol I know what is supposed to be like when you're invited to such a person's house like Simon there're supposed to be a footwash flunky there to meet you and make you welcome but he's he's sitting over in the corner wonder what's wrong
