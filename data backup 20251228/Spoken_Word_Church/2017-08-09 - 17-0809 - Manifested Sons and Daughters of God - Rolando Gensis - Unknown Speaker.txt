opportunity to to come to the US and attend camp meetings and met our brothers and sisters in the Lord other side of the world and I would like also to thank our beloved pastor for the hospitality and aggravate and a sister weed burger ah brother residence brother Dale and sister Dale and also brother Finn I'm sorry hallelujah and I really appreciate their for their hospitality and I'm so sorry for my my English you might be thinking that the Filipinos are they are good in English just like you just listening or hearing from a storable Danny they're engineers and English teacher but me I've added in the hub in education my parents has sent me to to college but during the time I was so obsessed in playing guitar so I did not my father my mother they are thinking that I am studying my the course that they want me to Olivia but I studied what I wanted to study so to learn so but I'm glad that the Lord had given me a few English Alleluia so before I ran ran out of English will now go to the to the Word of God the Reading Road of God and if you have a Bible with you please turn it with me this request everybody to please stand and open it with me in the book of Romans chapter 8 and beginning at verse 14 to 19 which says for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but have received the spirit of adoption we by we cry about father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God may the Lord other placing upon the reading of this word and would you please pray yeah yes mana the words you have no speaker hoping are understanding what we need literally no y-yes Lauren gash's amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord Alleluia tonight that I would like to share to you a topic the manifested sons and daughters of God Alleluia and in the message maybe tonight I will be reading some quotations because if I just if I just keep on talking and talking maybe I will run out of English I have a lot of English but the problem is I don't know how to talk on the connect them all so I'll go yeah in the message crisis the mystery of God revealed it says now notice again now what is trifold purpose manifests itself in Jesus Christ to come in the body by Jesus Christ to have the preeminence 'as to what restore back Eden bring back what which lost Olivia that was the only thing out of order all the rest of his of these things was in order hallelujah so there is something that was lost in order hallelujah and this is you know the purpose of God in sending a message it's not for us to have a strong doctrine firm religion that we can stand in any kind of argument area but God hallelujah he sent us a message in these last days hallelujah to gather his elect to gather his children and to let us know what is our position Alvia who we are in God hallelujah and to know our position in God Alleluia and I in the put in paragraph 240 and the same message crisis the mystery of God well it says the new birth is Christ it's a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same options the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position so there is a position that the church should know if the chose only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is Alleluia so ah to manifest itself in Jesus Christ to come into the body of by Jesus Christ and to have the preeminence over his shorts Alleluia it means to say that the church must be in in total obedience Alleluia hallelujah - to the bridegroom Alleluia and then Alleluia what's the reason why we lose the position because hallelujah of disobedience disbelief hallelujah and when we win we win we win we come back into that original condition then God will restore us back hallelujah - Eden bring us back hallelujah - that which he said bring back that which was lost el riih so it is only in this message that we knew hallelujah we learned hallelujah where we come from and who we are and where we are going Alleluia and by knowing our position Allah we are it will give us a confidence Alvia so up Alleluia what we should what we should have - up or what we should do like like for example in the Philippines we still use this you know this tropic enforcers but here in America you have all these traffic lights but in the Philippines especially in my place we still use this a manual tricycle you know with bicycle and the sidecar and most of them are farmers farmers in the Philippines are different than the farmers in the US we cut grass like you have seen on the picture we cut dress pass it by Bible loose in this mud city you know and then if they will plant a potato we have to wait for three months until the kernel you can eat the potato so they prefer to go to the city and drive this tricycle after going around the city for several hours they can they can buy rice Alleluia so they don't know how the traffic rules most of them doesn't know the traffic rules and I know a policeman who is a friend of mine and you know he's a policeman but you know he was uh he was maybe he is ashamed - standing out in the middle of the street and he was so hesitant doing his job and he was even hit by hallelujah but I used to see some a civilian who are odd who were given this authority to be a traffic enforcer and they also you know they are so confident and even dancing while doing the traffic you know and because they know their position Alleluia and when they blow that whistle even the big trucks and buses window their hands like that it will stop because we are so confident we are acting in a right Alleluia in a right way they are standing in a right position and there they know their position earlier so once we you know your position you really believe who you are Alleluia you will have B the D you'll have the the courage you have the the confidence hallelujah - hallelujah of who you are Alleluia so under religion did nutella's Alleluia about that it's only the message tells us that we are we are we come from we came from God Alleluia and you know in order for you to be a son like for example they have five sons and I have two daughters Alleluia they were not only my daughters when they were born but before they were born we were not my children when they were born but before they were born they were with me my loins hallelujah and we are not only sons and daughters of God when we receive hallelujah the Word of God but before the foundation of the world we are a gene we are acid in his thinking and if you are a part of him hallelujah if you are a part of him then one day you will hallelujah like like your children hallelujah you release that sin hallelujah but one day Allah we have in the manifested once one purpose is so that you can have fellowship hallelujah so that's the same thing with God hallelujah and if you are a seed of God you're part of this thinking you're part of bestowed which is the word hallelujah I believe that even Jesus said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in John 1:1 and the Word was God and Jesus said hallelujah I came from God and I go back to God and I believe it's the same thing hallelujah with the children of God hallelujah now it Romans let's continue reading in verse 17 Romans 8:17 Arabs children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also glorified together so jointers means to say ah like equal sharing hallelujah and if he is going to reign we will also ring hallelujah but if he suffered Alleluia not only to reign but we also have to suffer with him hallelujah and verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us that the sufferings of this present time Alleluia a short time with a little sufferings you know your sufferance could not be compared earlier to what he suffered for us a little time a short time with a little suffering are not worthy to be compared with the glory hallelujah that shall be revealed even burnham when he saw data in a God allowed him Alleluia told to experience beyond the curtain of time only I said there is no word Alleluia that could be uttered to utter hallelujah and even even the Apostle Paul he said I knew a man Alleluia I knew a man he did not say that I am I am that man he said I knew a man I don't know whether it is in the body or out of the body hallelujah that was he was caught up into the third heaven and oh my when he saw hallelujah the things that Alleluia and he even said I rather to be absent if not only for the ministry I rather to be to be there hallelujah I prefer to be there but because of the ministry that's only the reason that I am here he said I rather to be absent in the body Alleluia in order to be present with the Lord hallelujah so you know you hallelujah cannot be compared Alleluia cannot be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us Alleluia verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God means to say that the creator or the creation are expecting earnestly Alleluia the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God we are expecting earnestly they are waiting for the further God to be the ruler again Alleluia because when God made man creative man in in Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 he said let us make man in our own image after our likeness so what if God is that's that's the man it has make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion and let him up to view alleluia Dominion hallelujah he was God bo burnham said he was God he was a he was the authority and we have to subdue the earth Alleluia what he wants if he said okay you you met with play you are not supposed to be there you move this way Byron said he can he have those the power and authority Alleluia that even the tree would obey Him Alleluia the fish Alleluia da all the beasts Alleluia the lion Alleluia but he lost that authority before in II said okay this portion you give me eggplant Alleluia and this portion you give me tomato and the earth because it was under his ax he's his rulership under his Dominion it obeyed him Alleluia and then when he said lion come here the lion will come Alleluia because everything is under his Alleluia rulership being the god of this earth Reverend said the God is the god of unic of the universe and hallelujah Edom was the god of this small portion of the universe which is the earth but when Adam fell we need said okay this portion here you give me a plant and it grows thorns and thistles he could that he could not hallelujah have the Dominion he didn't have the power anymore Alvia okay in here you give me tomato it gives thorns and thistles this undesirable grasses mean is a lie on the mir then the lion was a drag Alleluia and Satan became the god of this world Alleluia so we can see brothers and sisters how home well we are how the creation is in out of order is in this order Alleluia we knew when you watch YouTube in the you you go to safari Alleluia these small animals being Allah we are eating by the day by the kita and tigers you know Alleluia and oh my maybe you will ask dosa those animals what are you waiting for maybe they will say oh I want to have our original God Alleluia we are Alleluia we are tired of running for our lives Alleluia we are always afraid we are always scared when the lion with the tiger shall come and and eat us Alleluia there's no more peace Vibram said perfect peace no death nor no hungry no no sickness Alleluia but you look Syria this time Alleluia Iraq Afghanistan hallelujah even in Jerusalem Alleluia even in the Philippines how how the devil had possessed not only the Philippines but all over the world how the devil possessed this young people with Olivia drugs and now our president is being investigated by by this human rights and even get angry with Obama when you No hallelujah I was our president this thousands of he kills thousands of drug addicts and pushers in recent just recently Alleluia Emir and his wife and his brother was killed by were killed by with the the police ready ready the house Alleluia and the vice mayor who who is the daughter of the mayor he was a put in jail oh my Alleluia and then a certain city in the South southern part of the Philippines Marah he is now destroyed by by bombs because of this sub Filipino Isis hallelujah and crimes everywhere in the world Alleluia and the Creator al Lia for the Creator was made are waiting Alleluia they are groaning Alleluia the Creator itself for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by the reason of him who has subjected the same in hope subject to vanity vanity means what is devoid of draws inappropriateness perverseness depravity LT but not willingly hallelujah we don't want it Alleluia by the reasonabie who has subjected the same in hope but one day we are hoping Alleluia God will deliver us God will deliver this hallelujah the whole creation from this condition verse 21 because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption so the creature shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption to wear into the glorious liberty of the children of God Alleluia who will give them the Liberty Alleluia the children of God Alleluia and verse 22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together together until now the creation they are groaning Alleluia we are waiting we are travailing already our longing Alleluia in pain together holiday to be delivered and not only they so not only the Creator then the sons of God they are the god of this world hallelujah and they are waiting for us and we are not only it is not only the creation that are groaning and travailing but not only they but also ourselves awliya also hallelujah which have the fruit of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves we know that the real man is in the inside our we are the way the inside man is born again and we are living in this in this body that is born in sin hallelujah we are living in this demanding body Alleluia and sometimes we are longing ourselves Oh women I remember yesterday before I left from brother stood up brother - his church and he's a brother Ed you know buried Alleluia a I I said to him buried Lord willing see you next year is it I don't want to have I don't know I want to go home hallelujah I don't want in this world anymore hallelujah I said if there is next year Alleluia because even we Alleluia we are longing we are groaning Alleluia to be released hallelujah you know sometimes in this body is Alleluia very demanding you know sometimes the inside says okay it's windy now and I want to go and this body will say oh it's raining oh no it's called you know you need to to do to do this to do this because you need this you need that hallelujah and sometimes this old body is always the hindrance hallelujah its hallelujah not only we but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body Alleluia so the condition of this world fixes those that have the first fruit Alvia which have the Holy Spirit we don't like the scene of this world anymore hallelujah everywhere we go we go to Walmart hallelujah you know people are my men and women hallelujah pathos all over and then you know the body and hallelujah the wickedness of this world is getting more and more worse and worse we have trials we have sufferings we have persecution Olivia though we are the children of God and especially if you are a children of God the enemy Alleluia the opposition is always doing something hallelujah now I want to read another quotation in the message the Messiah is it when God made man in Genesis 1:26 it shows if you are putting the scripture down in his 1:26 it shows that God made man to be a god named og Natalija to be a god to begin with man was made to be a God a lesser God when he was made in the image and likeness of God in likeness of God and he had hand like God he had feet like God eyes ears and intelligence like like God so other animals they don't have this intelligence only only the man that can imagine I can can his mind can hold this mini plans can remember hallelujah can compute hallelujah because we are made in the image of God Alleluia and intelligence his whole fiber because he was a son of God and I believe that if you are son of God I believe that you are God because if your if your if your mother is big I believe that the Alleluia that the child is also big hallelujah and if the mother and the father is dog the chalice dog Alleluia if it is called that the child is cow and if your father is God I believe called via the pure God Alleluia so that's our original position or the original position of man and even Jesus Christ Alleluia said that in John chapter 10 verse 33 to 36 says the Jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because thou that thou being a man makest thyself God jesus answered answered them it is not written in your law I said Ye are gods it is not written in your law I said Ye are gods if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came so who are these that are being called God are those people whom the Word of God came and I believe that the message is the Word of God for this day and this research is not for everybody Alleluia and if you receive this message if this mission is sent for you Olivia and Jesus Christ said Alleluia if he called them gods unto whom the Word of God came so if the word of God came to you if you receive the message Alleluia then I believe your God the Bible told you gods hallelujah if he called them God's home unto whom the Word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken say of him whom the father had sacrificed sanctified and sent into the world that though blasphemous because I said I am the son of God and even in in sam tsui verse 82 chapter 8 to double 6 I have said Ye are gods smoochie and all of you are children of the Most High Alleluia now in each of those chapter 7 verse 1 it says and the Lord said unto Moses I see see I have made thee a gun smoochie I have media got to Pharaoh an errand a brother shall be thy prophet now Moses what's the prophet of God and of course God is the God and Moses is the prophet and then in this in this sin God said okay Moses I am the God and you are the prophet but now you will be the Guardian our own shall be your prophet hallelujah so in Versailles in Exodus chapter 4 verse 16 is it and he shall be died he shall be legs spokesman and to the people and he shall be he shall and even he shall be to be instead of a mouse now Moses Aaron shall be the prophet it shall be the mouth hallelujah and thou shall be to him instead of God and Moses you will be the god now musa Aaron will be no your prophet he said Moses a prophet and then here is God now God said okay Moses you will be the god and then hallelujah Aaron shall be your prophet hallelujah and we'll God we know that at that time there is no redemption yet hallelujah there is no redemption yet a true Redemption by the blood of Jesus Christ they were under blood the blood of goats and bulls but when God gave Moses a chance to be a god hallelujah and Aaron is yeah what is profit when Moses said price hallelujah the price obeyed I know the last been the water became blood Olivia even de and originally I became a dry ground everything that makes your open Moses hallelujah because he was given a chance to be a gun only although man was in a fooling condition earlier but when God gave dad a chance into a a sinful man hallelujah to be a god and then we know Alvia that even nature's obeyed Moses because he was God hallelujah now in a missions hear ye him all things are possible to them that believe so we know that men had fallen to see because of unbelief el riih and here he says all things and the Bible also said all things are possible to them the believe we've got the anti resources of God at our hands to display God we are sons and daughters of God when God made man he made him a god he gave him a dominion over the earth but his fallen state dropped up but what they lost by Adam it was restored by Christ Alleluia so in general in Genesis chapter 126 when God made man he made him a god is moji he gave him a Dominion and rulership and had power over the birds of the air over the cattle of the field over God over the wind maybe if enemies you know it's a goal he feels so economy's it ok air just blow slowly I am I feel so called hallelujah maybe you you Oberlin and you are saying something that this you don't have a we don't have a you don't have proof hallelujah everything hallelujah obeyed will be Edom because oh my my my and I forgot three Alleluia because when the second Adam came who knew nothing Alleluia he displayed what the first Adam had lost Alleluia when when they were win the disciples holiday were in the boat Jesus Christ was sleeping Alleluia and the wind and the stones blue alleluja alleluja windy called the second Adam in second Adam stored Aloha and hallelujah rebuked the storm stop the wind we stop the waves hallelujah and be even animals hallelujah you know when I was when we were yet children we used to have fun with this music karabakh carbo water buffalo in the Philippines and if you will right on the the small one which is not time yet Alleluia we will kick you out you cannot ride it with it Alleluia it will run Aloha because it is not tame but when Jesus needed an illusion and as in in the book of marketís yeah I small a little ass Alleluia to write the to write in to go into Jerusalem the donkey which is not untamed Alleluia you cannot ride an animal which is not tamed yet but Jesus hallelujah even that Halloween wait-wait-wait in Jesus use that Wiggly when he did not command his disciples to get a Abba a big one a matured one Alleluia but when Alleluia they get this small this ass Alleluia and it did not you know it's obeyed him and that's hallelujah the authority that's the power of the first Eden there are much Alleluia so he got here but here's this Dominion but you know Edom hallelujah he fell from that position he lost that authority to rule in sit become the ruler of this world he is the Olivia the god of this even age and we are now living in Satan's Eden Alleluia now the Bible says that the earth is groaning crying waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the world is waiting for the man to come back into his rightful position is the state Olivia so Jesus displayed Alleluia the second Adam Jesus the second Adam displayed the authority that Adam had lost hallelujah so when God made man made man he gave him viburnum seed he gave him some of his spirit part of his life and he is in the likeness of God therefore man in his natural condition hallelujah we are barber ham said we are more than we are much more than an animal Alleluia man in his fallen state yet being a fool in son of God he still can better himself Alleluia we have an intelligence we have to better ourselves you know thousands of years ago thousands of years ago the bird they build their nest Alleluia and until now didn't improve it's the same unevenness but man hallelujah he improved some the design of the houses the buildings if but it improves the cars it improves hallelujah and he even Burnham said that the man one one was to go to the to to a to the air and then come back again Alleluia and the sense of God will do that Alleluia there will be a three and half years Alleluia and then come back again hallelujah we have that kind of nature hallelujah but although we are in the fallen condition yet we have that kind of nature Alvia now the Messiah the message the Messiah now when man is converted say just like that little white button starts in his heart when man is converted there is a a little white button like a little white button started in his heart now that part is God when you small again with the Spirit of God God's Spirit dwells in him now he can let that spirit grow and take up all the roots of bitterness and praise God's Way through him again so God's we will be pressed through him again when did he started Alleluia I start by that little white life hallelujah just like a button hallelujah and then when it grows hallelujah and it will take out all the roots of bitterness Alleluia which is one of the nature of a sinful man Alvia the bitterness and praise God's Way through him again he come he become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the garden a believer jesus said in mark 11:24 verily verily I say unto you if I if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you say that puts him right but supreme again it puts him right back in that condition Alvia he can grow he can grow now because of our you know biggest angle is tellin ya yes and God khuda Alleluia could have not the preeminence in us Alleluia but when that light started to Alleluia to grow to grow and then our nature and we became more obedient to him albian until he got ah immanence ona's hallelujah then he said you can say hallelujah say to that mountain be mob and don't doubt no more doubt but totally obedient hallelujah to his word hallelujah then you can see then that puts him right back supreme again it puts him right back in the condition hallelujah so before Adam doubted the world they can have whatsoever the same but hallelujah wyndi doubted they can no longer have hallelujah but therefore the full authority being sons and daughters of God been lost it Alleluia but brothers and sisters although they lost it although the children of God like like Israel in Israel Alleluia when you know in enough when we win the interred into the Promised Land God had allotted for its family and inheritance this is your inheritance and for the children and the children and the children did not work for it they inherited from their forefathers but when they you know me Manila's me Reuben bad Luck's yeah and then like for example I have children ik and I could not pay my dates anymore okay here is my children yo I will give it to you as like as a slave and then though he became my slave he lost his inheritance but he didn't lose his right being and his realized hallelujah although we are born hallelujah in sin because of our parents but our rights being son of God we never lost it hallelujah but here is and I slave in Israel but he would not be a slave forever there will be a time if he if he has a relative who is Allah who is wealthy he could the relative could redeem him Alleluia or else when the Jubilee year comes when the trumpet ee Trump is being blood blown hallelujah he could walk free hallelujah and go home hallelujah and visa he's a master have no dominion over him anymore he could go home and fellowship with his loved ones with his family with his father Alleluia and Sangha hallelujah although that inheritance of ours we will lost that authority but thank God we have a kinsman redeemer at the same time we heard hallelujah that Jubilee trumpet the gospel trumpet Alleluia and that gospel trumpet will give us hallelujah deliverance Alleluia and it will give us hallelujah it will bring us into our rightful position into our authority an hour into our inheritance hallelujah and in Ephesians chapter 1 chapter 1 verse 4 to verse 7 says according I said chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predicted us 'introduction of children so having produced method there would be a time Alleluia that you will be an adopted children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so we know that the adoption in this is nice not like that option here in the Philippines in America that if the couple didn't have any children they can go to those families that have a lot of children I have a lot of children but I will not give one and then they will adopt Alleluia one and that will consider them as their own as their own son or as their own daughter but the adoption in this is different early adoption in this is it is their own son but the Bible said that as long as the child is is yet young he is no different than the servant he is under tutor there will be one which will teach him teach him how to how to grow as a you know a businessman Ora so he could manage a hallelujah what his parents the property bees parents hallelujah and when this son became matured and the tutorials since that these are enough he is good enough to manage the business of his father then he will go to the master he said your son is now Alleluia he's now he's responsible he is now hakoda he's good enough to manage your your your properties your businesses and then the father will make a hallelujah will make a party and during that party he will proclaim hallelujah that from this from this time on my son is now an adopted son anything that he will say you will be he can manage whatever I have his word is my word if he sign a check hallelujah it seems that I am the one who signed the check Alvia so he can do the Father's business hallelujah and we are chosen we are participated and adoption of children for what hallelujah to be back again hallelujah as Adam who is the manager hallelujah who was the god of this earth Alleluia who was the ruler of this earth away all the children children of God are adopted are appreciated for that adoption food opposition Alleluia by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Alleluia verse six to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the blood in whom we have redemption we have redemption it means to say that ah we were lost data that inheritance were lost that position but we have redemption through his blood hallelujah and through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace redemption in in Greek word is Apollo Apollo truces Alleluia redemption deliverance are releasing affected by payment or a brunssum Redemption
