foreign foreign and unless you do come forth you're not going to be in his presence that's right amen so this afternoon if we would take our Bibles the Lord bless you this afternoon and we turn to Saint John chapter 11 once again praise Dear God and we would just like to maybe read uh verse 43 if we could and also we would turn to Titus Chapter 3 Verse 5 if we would and we just want to continue on in our line of thinking that we uh were ministering this morning amen and we want to go a little bit deeper into this resurrection and uh really pray that the Lord will bring these things out to a reality to you right amen it says and when he had this spoken he cried and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with great clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and Jesus said unto them loose him and let him go and then Titus if we were just chapter 3 so that you would see the line of direction of thinking that I'm going verse 5 says not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shared on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of Eternal exactly amen what a promise that we have right amen amen let us come to that place where we do come forth Heavenly Father Lord we ask you to bless the reading of the word this day Lord God and Father just moved thy servant out of the way excuse them Lord Jesus father let us reach down to the needs of the assembly father God let the Holy Spirit speak to each heart your lord God as you did in Lazarus in the condition that he was in Lord father bless us now we pray in Jesus name amen praise God Amen God unless you said you may be seated the Lord's bless you and I am now we're speaking of Lazarus being called from the dead and we're seeing that it's not just any voice but it is The Voice of the resurrection and the prophet of God said this voice is the voice of Christ and that's very important to realize because we have to understand that Christ is the anointed one Christ is the one Hallelujah that when he came to Lazarus he spoke not just to a man this is what I'm really trying to get you to see he wasn't just speaking to a man because this voice is the voice that transcends dimensions because when when he called Lazarus Lazarus was not in that tomb right Lazarus was on a four-day Journey but that body was laying down there and it was in a rotten condition where everybody knew it's over right everybody knew there's no more hope right but all my saints of God that is the voice that speaks to them amen hallelujah that is the voice that those that are dead right praise God and here he was in the four Nature's brother random says we don't know where he went right we're in the Lord now we've been in the scripture and the understanding that we know we know that those that died before the blood went to paradise and he was on a four-day Journey right yep and I don't know if he was four days in Paradise but he was on a journey and I mean he had already came to this place and here was The Voice that was on this earth right he was a man in that dimension and that voice he had to hear that voice right amen that voice had to be heard in order for Lazarus to come back and come into that body and there'd be a resurrection and that body would come forth and stand upon the Earth all saints of God we have to realize what this voice is doing it's not just calling us but it's calling us to a condition it's a condition that the word sees we must be in right right he wasn't just calling to a man but he was speaking to a condition right he was speaking to a rotten corruption where let me tell you something everything about Lazarus in that body had died even is your his germ of life yeah now think about that we're talking about a great Resurrection right even lazarus's germ of life where his children would come forth from was dead but when he came forth he come forth with all his faculties God don't come into your life and halfway packs you up he's going to break the limits into your life he's going to set you free he's going to listen you my brother and sister that you can live the life of a resurrection you can live what is the life of a resurrected person right it's a person that can overcome all things Jesus lived that life he can overcome himself a resurrected life is a life that knows no obstacles come on Church Christ himself we find out that he could walk through the wall he can do all these things right but he comes to that place his body had come to the place now to where he could travel as a thought before he was locked in this male flesh and he had to come in flesh because the blood had to be shared right amen for a reason amen that's right and what that reason was is it was his blood come on that washed you it was his blood right that the prophet of God says that loose that the word wash actually means to be loose amen do we see what his blood is doing for us amen church that's why it has to be put under the blood right to be made right are you with me see it has to be done you say oh well I'm going to trust in the blood covering most of us don't even understand what the blood covering really is right right my brother Brandon says it is to be made see that batch of blood covering because here is the token not just the blood but the life that's in the blood is that right apparently and what is that that is the word that speaks to you right that is the voice that speaks from the blood right the life of the blood and that life is telling you get right live right right do this do that come forth right right amen right and I'll ask you this day what does that voice say leave right now the voice is telling you to come forth and you say but I can't yeah then you don't believe in the vision right right that Jesus sold you right because see that's what Lazarus was coming forth too he was coming forth with the understanding of what Jesus saw of him amen hallelujah amen Church don't let the devil deny you don't let nothing of this world deny you because that promise is yours amen amen praise be to God now you think about that that was a man four days rotten corrupt but then one day he stood back on the earth yeah and I don't know maybe he could have had children and maybe one day they were all sitting together and his kids could say you know death I was there yeah sure I was there yeah I was in that same condition and that voice called and you came forth oh come on Church Hallelujah see God will not just resurrect you just to bring you to a halfway State that's right amen but if you notice Lazarus came forward watch what the Bible said it said and he that was dead not his dead right right exactly it's like is that it was dead man he that's already been in that condition I'm now calling him to another condition and it's only one boy one voice my brother and sister and that's the thought this evening I'd like to speak you of is the voice that summons all things in US amen there is a voice that's calling today and that voice is calling you to a place it's calling you more than just being that Churchman right just being a part of a church amen but it's warning you to live a resurrected life amen hallelujah warning you to be an overcomer mourning you to be able to overcome any obstacle that the devil throws at you would you like to be able to live that life Hallelujah to be able to live that resurrected life what we're supposed to be living right now come on church that's right he called Lazarus and he that was dead came forth bam ham and foot with gray clothes right exactly and his face was bound about with an applicant he was in a condition come on he couldn't even help himself right nope that's all right come on Saints right see that's our trouble we always get to a place where we think we can handle yeah and as long as you've got your hands on it you're gonna make a mess out of it exactly amen oh my God you got to come to the place where you willing to let go of that thing amen you say but I got a son and daughter and I've been praying and I've been crying and I've been travailing and I've been coming to the Altar and I want him to come to Christ do you realize that you have a token yeah right now here's the question you have confidence you know what happens to a lot of people in this message the token will become a weakness to them because they want to see the child's salvation but it might not be meant for you to see the child's salvation but it is meant for you to believe for that child's salvation because if you apply that token and you go in the grave and that voice that summons all things Hallelujah when you resurrect they will be there if that token was applied right exactly but don't let that token become a weakness to you to where you're oh my I just got to I didn't know the token will bring peace it will bring strength in your heart amen it will cause you to rest right right see the devil knows how to make you worry oh yeah absolutely mother Brown says worries can bring kids you can get so worried about something you can have uh spiritual immunity right right man you can get caught between two opinions one brother says this pastor says this one this one says that and you get caught between two opinions and you're caught in a state of spiritual Amnesia right Hallelujah but there is that will summon you to your place where God has called you to be nobody can breathe your wife can't bring you them your husband can't bring you right you can't bring your children to that place you can believe for it you can claim it you can hold on to it had him right said that's the truth brother Branham and she held on she no salvation we're fixing to come to those two boys she didn't realize what was fixing to happen right but oh my there she was in the corner yeah you know I don't think much of us can humble ourselves to come to the corner yeah right but you know what God can see your problem in the corner oh yeah just as well as he can see you right here amen but oh she said there and all of a sudden said the right word right Amanda yep and brother Branham said I give you your children yes I give you these boys in the name of Jesus Christ now think about that science that was the third of the third pull the first time it was used on a human being Brothers right now here's the key anytime God does something first time it changed that's right yeah exactly just as much Birthright right right to claim your love amen amen that's right it's yours that's right because God don't change his mind about his word all right see God can't change his mind about his word but God gave us something that's wonderful he gave us a mind that can change amen we can't repent right we can forgive right but God can't God he he can't change his mind his mind can't be changed right because if he changed his mind he would be no more different than us right right see that's what I love about God his first thought was eternal right amen why wouldn't you thought of me he said that'll do it's all to you right he didn't have to think again and then think again well I don't know red hair let's try it with black hair he loves you the first time my brother and sister his first thought of you is eternal amen see that's why you have a right to claim your loved ones you have a right to call forth yes the voice of Christ is in you right the voice of the Resurrection is living in you today and believe it believe it Glory see the stone has to be rolled back that means you got to believe it you got to accept it all right amen so he called Lazarus for and Lazarus Lazarus came forth Bale Thai right napkin on his head yeah rat in Great Clips oh Hallelujah I think we're getting a picture here isn't it well man just think about that there was just a few moments there was corruption there was built mortified his body had mortified but that didn't stop the boys he said well I don't know if God can do this then you don't believe God I serve a God that can do anything amen amen you're looking at a man right now brothers and sisters that had a four-way bypass in an open heart surgery and God touched me in a miraculous way a four-way bypass open heart surgery I'm 53 years old and my doctor tells me my heart means like I'm 18 years old I said yeah but I've got 50 something year old Parts doc but I got this heart inside of me that man I mean once it starts and getting going there may be a lot of young men in here and you might be able to outplay me a basketball you might be able to outrun me in football you might be able to but you can't outwork me yeah I can guarantee that because once my heart gets kicked in I can work 10 12 hours straight I could come home I can take a shower and I'm up to three or four o'clock in the morning because there's something about when you get a new blood flow that's flowing through your body it does something different and my brother and sister if you've got a new blood flowing to you if that word of Christ is flowing through you then it's done something wonderful just washed you and that word wash leaves them in loose all right amen and he said that same word that Jesus used is the same word he used when he rose Lazarus from the ground now I want to show something to you here I want to share this with you and uh but why would you uh help me here maybe I could get you to help me here you'll be my demonstration here are you uh just remember I don't you don't you won't be killed for this okay so yes but I want to show you I want to show you this I told you I was going to bring Lazarus yeah in front of us so I want to share something with you here now take your Bibles and turn to verse 44. and it said he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with great clothes and his face was bound about him with a neck so we're going to place a napkin over your head okay oh my God does it fit now maybe you're supposed to be dead you ain't supposed to be mean you see I'm putting this around you okay let's see this ain't nothing you put around yourself oh all right come on okay come on yeah amen come on brother see Lazarus didn't put his gravel that's right that's right right see Lazarus was affected by what somebody else said about right amen the Lazarus was affected by uh what somebody thought of him yeah but he wasn't the one that put himself in this case that's right so I'll tell you about this you hold that right there I'm dead okay all right smart-ass preacher all right now oh we're not done now it says he was bound hand and foot what that means he was wrapped around oh my look at this I want y'all to see the condition this man is in all right now watch this now here's a man that the voice of the Resurrection that's gonna be a good picture there on the internet here's a picture the voice of the Resurrection has called forth and says Lazarus come forth right right yes I'll think about it well maybe I'll go to church I heard they were having a special there but I just don't know it's a long ways to travel yeah yeah the voice said right and that did not stop a man who was in that condition right because God was calling him to another condition right and he was bringing him forth and that voice that was transcending to another dimension spoke to Lazarus and brought him back and put him in that body let me tell you something he wasn't halfway resurrected right Gloria here was a man that was dead but now he's resurrected right right but he's still bam come on brother preach he's still tied up right right exactly in the themes of his past right he still bound and he cannot lose himself oh we need some strong Brothers and Sisters in Christ come on we need some that's praying some prayer warriors we need something to know how to get loose we need to know something next what you've gone through might not have been meant for you it was for somebody else not even for you that pain and hurt and sorrow that you went through wasn't even for you but it was for you to come and be in a church that when somebody else was going through that my mother just you would have life a resurrected life praise God you can stand up and say I'll be there yes but there's a noise that called me out of that condition oh yeah I used to smoke cigarettes yeah I used to drink beer yes I used to lust after women but you know what I don't do but you know this you know that and you know you got like your mother you got like your father you're in this family I got news for you the doctors told me they said you know your diabetes runs in your family and I said well I'm not part of that family and they said well he said these are some things here that we really believe that you'll have to start taking with your heart and things like that and I don't know if y'all have seen those little glimps inside models are a little uh blood strip things I said all right then you want to put something like that in my life I'm going to do the opposite I'm going to take those strips out and I'm gonna put anointing oil in there and now I got me a cute little thing that I carry around when I pray for people I just flip it open and they just amazed to see a diabetic strip holder as an oil container well man we're forgetting about the dead here come forth sleep wake up now watch this watch this here's a man that is resurrect yeah right he's standing on the earth Resurrected he ain't corrupt no more right and these ain't what that Resurrected are you getting it right a resurrected man is now steady but he's still bound right right he was still tied up don't stop listening to the voice don't think just because you're in this message I've been in this message for 20 years and been in the way yeah that's your problem you've been in the way you got to get out of the way and let the voice speak and summons all the things in you out and bring you to the place he's wanting you to amen but now here is a man he's in this condition he's resurrected you cannot deny Lazarus was resurrected but he still found right he's still tied up come on all right but other things that people put on it okay but what everybody else has put on he had no control yeah of these things but I know one that had a greater control amen I know one that when he spoke he not only said last come forth then the voice spoke deeper and said loose him and set him free I don't believe he was just speaking to Mary and Martha and those people around there but he was saying corruption letting go death let him go nothing will be left everything will be resurrected right that's right there he is standing Resurrected in a condition and the word said Lucille amen exactly lucium come on and let him go amen now watch this watch this thank you bro here's a man yeah who is now resurrected he's been called see he's Resurrected he's now loose right he's now set three right that he can now live all right now watch this hell yeah these didn't get resurrected that's right these things are the past are dead what do you do with dead things guys you bury him right right you know bro you want to keep your dead things here Lazarus would you like to carry no no thank you you think those things smell good but now here it is Mel Lazarus stands in a resurrected form because the voice has summoned this in him oh my if we can only understand what that voice is doing that voice called Luther to justification that same voice called Wesley to uh uh sanctification and now that voice calls the Pentecost to the gifts right but now that voice is calling you right amen are you catching it yes now here's a man that stands in a Justified condition amen as though it was never done any questions just right loosed set free yeah all right do you see it you want the gray clothes no then why would people hang on to right all right brother nasty stinking things dead things all on them everything wrapped up bound up all these things cause you problems in your home your marriage your family and different things like that why would we want to carry these great clothes whole church I tell you one day we're going to Break Forth my brain clothes here amen because the resurrection was spoken here not on this hallelujah amen is what's in here right praise me to God now here's a man that stands Justified not forgiven that's right see not just forgiving right but Justified amen as though it never happened in the first place see that's what the voice has called you too in your life has brought you through a Justified condition as though those things never happen right see what our problem is is we can remember see we remember those things right but see those things are washed washed they're loosed from you Lori you've been set free is this helping you hear this story I told you we're going to bring Lazarus up in front of us do you see it Justified as though it was never done right amen Peter stood so whack got to serve at zero you know Peter was having problems with that sword because there's a scripture where Jesus said put the sword up again right yeah Jesus reached them and all that bloody mess held it in his hand and put it right back exactly Justified right yep as though it had never happened in the first place amen amen oh don't let the devil say oh this was your life and that was your life and you you know what you need to tell Mr demo I don't know that person anymore he died a long time ago the fact the Bible tells me that old man of sin was nailed to the cross I don't know him anymore I don't go to those places anymore all those dead things anymore I've been Justified amen I've been brought to a place as though it was never done to me right Hallelujah God think of a church who needs all these great clothes but there he was he was wrapped in all that he couldn't he couldn't help what he was wrapped in see your mama may have called you certain things your daddy may have said this about you right all these things like that and they still have an effect upon you but I'm telling you this is how you overcome stinky thinking you have to see yourself the way God exactly that's right are you with me Church you didn't justify you've been brought to a place the blood has lost you all right oh Hallelujah and set you free yes praise God there it is you've been brought to a place the words as though you never did it to begin with but you never did it right so it shows you he can overcome any condition right right maybe today you're in a condition and you think it's hopeless you think there's no there's no help right but nothing can be done about the situation but he says not Lazarus go forth right that is the voice of the Resurrection the same one that spoke to Luther that said the just you'll live by faith come on church it's the same one that spoke to Lazarus and said loose him it's the same voice that speaks to you in these gray clothes right right that says come forth Museum and set him free praise be the guy amen amen what was calling Lazarus forth Perfection right come on Church Perfection was calling Lazarus to come forth right the voice of the age was calling Lazarus to come forth see that same voice that spoke to Luther that spoke to Wesley that speaks to Pentecost is the same voice as speaking to you and it's the same voice that see the voice that summons all things is the voice that resists releases the place that they that you're in so that same voice that spoke to Luther and said but just shall live by faith exactly but in our message justification a deeper understanding of the word is it as though you never did it in the first place man all right man all right see in Luther's day his people didn't even hear that right but they're hearing it now right amen yeah right they're hearing it now that's right because this voice that's speaking in this hour speaking to those of us in the message is not only bringing us to a change but that same voice is transcending into another dimension my brother and sister and it is releasing them amen it is releasing them to come back Hallelujah Glory God Amen I hope this is helping you this morning right right so you don't need these gray clothes right right he's dead things of the past thank you brother I appreciate it thank you these dead things of the past you don't need them no more sorry amen amen we'll just lay them right down there all right right amen maybe somebody might with a little Act of Faith come up and just reach down and say I don't need these dead things anymore these things are done I'm living a resurrected life now I don't need what binds me I don't need what ties me up I don't need what raps the dead things in my life but see that voice that voice is the same voice right right and that voice that is changing us right yes absolutely it's releasing really that's right Hallelujah right see you stand Justified would you like to see something brother Branham says watch this I hope this is blessing amen he says uh now for instance if brother green heard that I had been drinking and I've been doing bad things then he found out that I didn't do it yeah right did he come and said I forgive you brother Brandon said if you forgive me I never done it what you forgiving me about but if I'm guilty then I can be forgiven right but I'm still not just because I did it but the word justifies is as though you never done it in the first place you were never married to that old and damn nature to begin with amen and that's what he's calling out of you to come forth that seed of God in you to bring you to the place where God wants you to be oh hallelujah amen so you stand Justified right Justified he said as though you never done it at all and then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin amen till it's putting the book of God's forgetfulness we can't we can forgive but not forget what you have to do now is take that mind of Christ that you're supposed to receive yeah and believe what that mind of Christ tells you right you are Christ is mine told him he can walk through the wall right cross his mind told him that he could resurrect he received the vision of the father and the father gave it to him and he believed Lazarus would come forth right absolutely see it's that Vision that's right and that's what you have right yes right I can't catch it for you know why because he said Lazarus right yeah it's a personal resolution right brother Branham said if he hadn't said Lazarus had been a general Resurrection so apparently there must have been just one last you were sitting there I guess right amen but he didn't say come forth he said Lazarus it's personal salvation is personal thank you Lord all right brother Grace is personal and I'll tell you something God does Grace good I fell a lot at it amen sometimes I struggle with things but God does great school glory sometimes I should forgive a brother or do this that or the other maybe I don't do it when I should but God always does great skin all right amen Glory Hallelujah that's right you remember that one right not always disgrace good right amen so here you are standing Justified and you know why all right right because the judge yes has declared yes you never did it right exactly in the first place Amen brother Brandon said you gotta turn it right yeah and see Christ say the judge has come Amen to declare to the bride you never did it in the first place and where is the first place in the mind of God my brother and sister exactly where he saw you sinless and blameless with no sin in your life thank you Lord hallelujah it's back to that doesn't just declared you never did it in the first place that's right oh he said look you can see his eyes look at his nose the Angels made up his hair there is the judge has declared right no other rage amen that's right could we have true justification right exactly and brought to a place don't let don't listen to the see Jesus never gave the devil an opportunity he never listened to the devil he never gave him a chance to build his power in his life he said it is written Satan see that's why it's good to read the word because Satan came back with the word right now but the judge has declared amen amen right that's right but you never did it right take those grave clothes off amen that's right get rid of all those things that's binding you amen ask God to set your mind free yes amen see some people can't overcome because they can't overcome this that's right right exactly they won't surrender this to the very mind of Christ amen amen Christ season the way the word says it right you are Justified as though you never did it in the first place the judge has declared it amen that's right you're free right open up the doors you're free right amen you can go home amen you ain't got to worry about going to jail you're set free amen it doesn't matter what anybody thinks man set free you are Justified look let's see what the Bible says here you wanna you wanna scripture Romans 8 and 1. there is there now no more condemnation right let's turn that let's make sure that we're saying that correct let's turn to rolands amen I hope this is blessing you here this morning are you seeing yourself in a different way amen Romans 8 and 1. listen to this there is therefore read it with me Church let's read it all together there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit did you hear what the word says there is no condemnation God does not condemn you amen God does not bring condemnation into your life he brings conviction yes right when he came to Mary and Martha Martha he wasn't there for them he was there to confirm them amen hallelujah I'm sure he calls Mary out those names are being called out my saints of God there is no condemnation yes sir don't let anybody put condemnation on you right right don't allow anybody's words to bring fear and doubt into your heart if the word says you're free you man all right the Bible says there is therefore now right no right condemnation right didn't say you're working for it right all right man because his blood has lost you yes sir his blood has set you free yes and you walk on this Earth in a different condition right exactly amen that's why the prophet

sound like his boss yeah you sound like a mean neighbor down the street but you have a power a sister you can create an atmosphere in your home I believe that yes sir you believe that yes sir I hope you believe that amen because that's what the prophet of God says would you like to see the atmosphere that you can create in your home right he says could you imagine coming in a nighttime tired weary warm if you're a farmer mechanic preacher whatever you are you come in and when you go into your little home you're longing till you can get there you open up the door and your sweet little wife stands there she greets you she's all pretty good that's right don't watch and cleaned up I face cream all over these bunny slippers baby puke all over them she says that's where you have to learn to turn the mother mode off see yeah that's right and the wife's Moto yeah and that comes through Wednesday right now that's right I'm in my business he's been fighting Devils all day long he's been fighting every kind of thing out in the world that you can imagine and you'll have the power to create an atmosphere in your home that's right right listen to what he says she walks over and kisses

him don't Nag on him because the more you pray for him and he said well you know what he goes out here and he buys this and he buys it and the kids need this and the kids need that well you know what you need to do you need to go over his head pray to Christ that's right that's right amen sure I don't know about it no doubt but when you get to the place to work you don't want to hear that right you pray for it amen he said but wait you know he just he never does nothing around the house because the problem of it is you haven't entered in to one thing that you do have it's called weakness the woman the Bible says is the weaker vessel that's right so you need to learn to enter into your weakness honey honey because some people will say well I can't get him to take the trash out I'll show you how to do it honey honey this trash bag is so heavy and I need a big strong strapping man man I don't care if he's 80 years old I'm trying to show y'all something here sisters I'm trying to say how you can create an atmosphere in your home Brown said don't ever let the honeymoon cease you enter into that weakness I mean my goodness if he sees you go see what you got to understand is a man's ego yeah once you enter into his ego you understand it right and here it is here it is he has to know you need his strength right yeah that's right are you listening to him yes he has to know that yeah so that's why it's important brothers that we live the life right yeah yes sir well she will call us Lord yeah and not oh my Lord when he will call us right I mean I will come because we have a worthy headship right right right you can't demand subjection you can't demand those things if you want her to be in the subjection leader into it and show her by you by his surrendered and understand getting into your subjection with Christ that's right amen oh my how did we get this out of Lazarus grave I'm telling you I guess it's time for us to come forward that's right it's time for us to be what God has caused amen young people God is calling you that's right oh I was so touched by the young people up here I was just so just touched just listening to him singing and see him being apart that's why so be careful young people the things that you're attracted to right because the devil knows human nature right yeah because brother Branham said he helped pervert it yeah we are right right your parents you watch your kids yep sometimes we get guilty we'll allow will allow us to just go anywhere either as well amen right but I was really touched by the young people and I was seeing their desire to serve him and I would rather see that than see them out here listening to some bunch of rock and roll or some rap music or seeing the way these kids aren't let me tell you something young kids they may make fun of you and all that but I want to tell you something they are empty right and even your young little life can manifest Christ amen exactly don't you ever be afraid to stand up for Christ because Christ will stand up for you amen no get out here and try to be so loner sometimes you hear teenage well I can't wait till I get 18 years old and I get out of the house and I can do what I want to do yeah yeah no you're gonna do what everybody else does that's right you ain't gonna be no more different than nobody if you're gonna fall right into the Trap of the world right you ain't no more special right right we come to that place we have to at your young age ask the Lord Lord I want you in my heart Lord I want you to save me right Lord I want to hear that voice that Lazarus sir brother Keith said it's the same voice Lord I'm gonna go into my room I'm going to pray and I'm going to ask you Lord to come into my heart and young people we'll do it you ain't got to be old and decrepit and come with all kinds of sins and debaucheries in your life give your life to him early see Satan knows the nature and he knows what to put in front of you right yeah because he understands right Satan is like the eskimos when the eskimos start having trouble with a lone wolf they understand how to get rid of that wolf and what they'll do is the wolf has a nature and wolves have to be in packs because one has to rip and tear right but when the moon is a loner he's he's just a troublemaker yeah he he's a scavenger and he can cause all kinds of problems and what this Eskimo will do they understand human nature and they will take a knife and they will take this knife and they will dip it and as they dip it and they dip it and they dip it and they dip it and they dip it what happens they're different in blood and they come out they have a knife it's frozen blood right let's see the Eskimo understands the nature of the wolf he knows he's a wild animal and he's got to have blood to to to to take the taste and to satisfy his taste right and they ask them oh he'll just go out into the snow and he'll just go and he'll leave right right and young people all of a sudden oh right and he gets the taste of blood right and the blood is Frozen and when a wild animal gets the taste of blood it'll literally make him drunk right because of the alcohol that's in the blood that's why launcher sticks his head in a dead carcass because he sticks his head that's why he's bald head and he sticks his head in there and he does what he does and he pulls himself out and he staggers around drunk because he's drunk on the blood the alcohol in the blood the knife is stuck here and the wolf comes up and the next thing you know he starts licking and he starts licking and the next thing you know it gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and the next thing you know he's sitting here and he's licking and he's licking and now the sharp knife is ripping the tongue of the of the wolf and now he doesn't even know the difference between the taste of the blood he was tasty and his own blood right and he kills himself see Satan knows the nature Fallen man young people he knows what to put on the internet right yes he knows how your little hearts are yep are you with me right and the next thing you know all the blood is gone and there's a knife and a wolf is ripping his tongue to Pieces because he's become insane with the taste of the blood and now he starts being satisfied by his own blood right and now he's getting more and more and more until he rips his tongue to pieces and now the next day they find the wolf stuck over the night and the Eskimo just grabs him picks him up and discards him and he did it because it's new the nature that's why your Nature has to be changed amen that's right amen absolutely right are you with me that's why your Nature has that old Nature has to be done away right exactly you need to ask God bring me to the place Lord I don't want that anymore Lord in my life Lord I find myself Lord God doing things that mommy man said I shouldn't do but I want to do it young people I'm here to tell you there's a way that you can change right right young teenagers don't wait until you've got a load of sins to bring to us turn your life over to him exactly right see because the whole thing was the knife this was only the cover right see but then the wolf didn't know the difference right right when it changed right and he become more ravaged yep he he killed his own self by his own blood right all right seeing other people that's why it's important for you too to understand amen what God is doing amen right okay don't just come up here and sing come up Sing With a Purpose right right don't just do the things because the Pastor said well do this but do it because you understand why you know the Lord has changed my life and I'm going to get up here and I'm going to do what I can do and I'm going to be a blessing to the church right amen amen right because see Satan wants to destroy your young life amen that's correct that's why I said today young girls be careful with the pictures that you send yeah careful with those things because you will find out that thing will make let me tell you something it was Facebook that took down these Arab worlds over here yeah right yeah it was Facebook that took down the king and queen of Egypt because that's what they are king and queen of Egypt and they live on a river too it's called the river of Nile well I think a lot of us are living on a river called denial right Satan knows you brother Brown says better than you know yourself yep don't play right in this hour right but the hour has come for you to come forth Amen to stand Justified as though it was never done to begin with come forth I'll try don't stop trying right right it ain't about trying exactly amen somatic shifting what God has said about you and your word amen Justified that's right that's a finished work all right see Satan knows that nature and Satan knows how to get to you yeah sure but see you have to come to that place where you say I ain't thinking that way no more right my days are stinking thinking are over right amen because I have put on the mind of Christ the resistance Christ is mine don't think on stake right Martha coming to the place in closing she said even now right yep though he's in that condition though he's in the grave those to run Lord even now Lord maybe she didn't fully understand what she was saying but you should amen that's right

she handed me she says um he told me to give this to you Joe told me to give this to you he said that you would understand that was her husband said they were divorced and said you'll know what to do

do with it right yes sir yes I don't know what to do with it right now here's the amazing thing this is a divorced woman I didn't think you could trust a divorced woman with six hundred dollars I mean this woman has had some change in her life now I knew her in the past all right but she handed me six hundred dollars yeah right you know what I was able to have the money to be able to to be able to wait for my daughter's right now so he can do anything all you have to do is believe him and trust him right amen because I'll tell you I thought it was over when I had my four-way bypass open heart surgery I didn't think I'd ever be able to preach again I didn't think I'd ever uh be able to take my little girls up just to lift them up because I've had a scar cut from here all the way down here and six cuts on my leg all the way up here I mean you wake up to that and you don't even know what's happened God is a good God Amen yes sir buddy and even in the worst time of my life when I was down to the lowest AB at that moment and I was reaching for Faith grabbing for Faith from everybody that came in the room because I'll be honest with you I'll Stand before you but on the sacred desk I was scared sure I did not know if I was going to live the next day that's what they kept telling me a blood clot can break off right now and you'll be dead tell me you don't get close to God right amen tell me you don't hear that voice speaking to you that's right that's right and I got right to the place I did not know I just I could not get the faith I needed I could not just couldn't get the peace I needed and I'll tell you what God don't care about your comfort no he don't right because he brought me all the way down where that male nurse they they shave you they strip you your dignity is exposed to everything about you is just exposed and I asked that man I said could I have my Bible and he said sure and he handed it to me and I flipped the Bible open to Proverbs 1 and 21 and it said the heart of the king is in the Lord's hands that's the peace that God can give you amen I lost my wife in 2005. and I lost two babies she was pregnant seven months had twins died just like that been married almost 20 years they call it cardiomenophony she just died her heart died she didn't have a stroke and aneurysm a blood clot or nothing her heart just died I lost three in one day standing behind us a sacred Nest at my church ministering the life of Job yeah yeah walked out the door my wife had stayed home that day I hope this is okay if I can just share this with me just just to be an open book so you see and I walked out the door my my uh daughter-in-law comes screaming said that uh Angie she was laying on the floor she was blue said that they couldn't get her to breathe she she rise and rolled back I got in the vehicle took off of the house walked in and there was my beautiful wife laying there died right there in front of the refrigerator died right there they tried Heroes to my older Sons trying to resuscitate her and they couldn't do it all of a sudden through the worst of that through that trauma and that horrible experience I looked up in a glimpse God all he had to do is give you a glimpse and this is the honest truth God strike me with lightning brothers and sisters I taught I saw two forms come out of her and I saw them raise up and I saw my two sons on the earth trying to resuscitate her and I saw these two forms come up and they had hair both about this length right there and my wife come up out of her body and she took one arm and she took the other arm and she went right through that refrigerator just like that and that was a glimpse that God gave me to help me to overcome all the lonely days and all the nights that laid ahead of me and my brother and sister that's right brother and the hardest thing that I had to overcome was where she died at that used to just tear me up that God wanted you to let her die in front of this refrigerator why not in the room over here why I gotta get up late at night and go to the refrigerator and stand over the very place right where my wife died and one day my two daughters were crying and there was just turmoil in the house and everything and the quote come to my heart to overcome you have to do the opposite yeah right when I called my girls over and I said come here girls come here let's pray and I took both of them in our arms and then we stood right over the very spot and we held each other in each other's arms and I started talking to him and praying with them and coaxing them and just wooing them and just trying to give them peace and strength and then the Lord quickened on my heart that's how you overcome the complex you have to do the opposite so now instead of that place being a place of death and despair we turn it into a place of joy and victory that's why I tell you today saints of God you can't overcome but you have to do the opposite exactly help us Lord oh praise God I didn't know I was going to say all that amen maybe that maybe that'll encourage you man help you to realize God can change any any God can bring peace glory in the time of a stand amen okay God can
