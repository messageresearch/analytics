sliding time to get home but uh you just pray that the the bad weather won't come we won't need none of that stuff amen then we'll have a good time in the lord just remember to get to know your spouse real good because uh somebody's got to unseat the uh collins's back there in the back they they're holding the trophy with the uh uh for the uh newlywed game that we played that you know about your spouse or you don't know about your spouse and you might find out things you didn't know when you got there so anyway just saying but yeah we want to take that trophy away from them we need to give it to somebody else so y'all brush up on your shoe size what colors your car what color was your first car on your first date what color what you understand just start talking about stuff like that and i won't ask any of those questions so but god bless you we love you with the love of the lord just keep us in prayer uh june's doing good she's all right i've been i've been staying away from her so uh uh gargling with lip strain and washing your hands anyway but um we'll be glad when all this is over with but you know a lot of people are a lot of people are struggling with it still so we we want to pray for them we want to pray for those people and make sure that we diligently pray that we'll keep it out of the church here and that we can still continue to have service some have been uh shut down uh from having a bunch of them in their church being out so i talked to brother claude just a little bit ago and and he said some of his churches got it and uh and they're have they're struggling with it so uh he's got a little bit of older group so they're just kind of struggling through it so just keep them in your prayers all right let's turn to john one we're going to continue on who is this son of man this is part 16. and we're going to talk a little bit tonight about headship about headship and we're going to look at a couple of things that um that i believe the lord showed us this uh yesterday while we were studying for the extra day before yesterday and uh i want you to think about something i was talking about the cloud about it just a little while ago you know jesus he stood up one day and he said the son of man has no place to lay his head now we know that's naturally but why did he say that why did he specifically say there's no place for me to lay my head think about it think a little spiritual about it but something came to me we'll talk about next sunday not this coming sunday but not now so i think he's got a place to lay his head now amen john 1 verse 1 let's bow our heads lord we stand here lord before a group of people lord that we're totally unworthy to be able to open this book and as john wept because no one was worthy the lord you appeared with a book took the book out of the hand of the one on the throne and someone screamed worthy is the lamb to open the book and reveal the seven seals thereof lord we we're living in that time of the revelation of the supreme headship of jesus christ and it's got to be in a bride it's got to be in the total revealing of the word so father we pray that as we were discussing today lord it's all right to be born again it's all right to have a baby but you need to feed the baby the baby needs to mature god is looking in this hour for a mature bride a wife not just a bride a wife somebody that knows every move he makes and and his thoughts or her thoughts and her thoughts are his thoughts father you told us it could happen and now we pray lord that you would continue to help us to get to that spot lord we're trying diligently all of us for you to have the preeminence in our life you give us a way to do it father through the message of the hour a clear path to get to what you've already said father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we get knocked around all during the day lord by satan but lord we know there's a typos we know there's a a bomb in gilead there's a place that we can go back to that we can say satan you can't come in this place satan could never go in the holy of holies and that's what you are today lord you're in the bride you're in the bride the bride is the holy of holies and lord i pray that we'll realize that and we'll take that lord and as the prophet of god said not just have a sword but take the sword and stick it right into the heart of the of the uh of the devil father just be with us now bless us keep us safe bless the ones that are sick and not here lord we pray that it all come back together in you lord we ask your blessings on this service in jesus name amen john 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word where it was with god the word was god he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power power to become the sons of god there's a transformation going on here even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word also let's go to hebrews 10 5. we've been reading this but i want to take a little bit different angle today if that's all right wherefore when he cometh into the world now remember when he cometh into the world that means that that's the baby that means jesus is coming not not the father not the jehovah not the god spirit form but he has come down to what a body the word was made flesh these two scriptures connect john 1 14 and hebrews 10 5 is telling the same thing the word was made flesh a body now has prepared me wherefore when he comes into the world he says sacrifice and offerings out what it's not but a body let's read it like this wherefore he comes into the world he says sacrifice and offerings is that what it's not in other words i don't want any of your do's and don'ts i don't want any of your your uh man's ideas i don't want any denominational ideas but this is what i want an offering is that what it's not but a bride but a bride has now prepared me amen a bride to deliver a man child he needs a bride here to deliver adam needed an eve and we knew it wasn't going to be sex but we knew he was going to have to have part of it because the eve typed the church and for christ to come fulfill the word the word made flesh he had to come through flesh and then he now is in flesh his brother daryl was talking about this weekend if he's here that he can't be here in his physical body if the world's looking for jesus that's fine he's already here though hidden in a body just like we were hidden in his body when he walked on the earth now he's hid in our body which is the bride the church and he's the head of it and listen to what the word head means the hell metaphorically it means anything supreme chief chief cornerstone prominent master lord head is where all intelligence is have you ever thought about this i know i'm kind of brother dale and sometimes he says i think a little weird sometimes do you know that every every function of your body there's only one organ above your shoulders all the other organs are below your shoulders but it's run by the one organ that's above your shoulders and it all narrows down everything you do what you're doing right now has to come from here through this narrow thing called a neck and then it goes out into your body right i mean look your nerves don't go i want to talk to my hand no it has to go nerves i want to talk to my hand right so it's not external it's all internal and if you have no heads you have no body i mean if you have a body but what is it it's lifeless that's why the denominations and i'm not talking about baptist methodist pentecostal i'm talking about denominational ideas even that we have can't have a head they've rejected the head the bible says they rejected the head listen true christians do not reject headship right they can't because that's what your new birth is that's right your new birth is submitting to now the problem is brother brown said it's getting it from here to here we got to have head knowledge but if that head knowledge stays head knowledge you're just going through the motions but listen with a soul you have a purpose yes good or bad right good or bad you have a purpose listen you're predestinated for something you didn't just come on the earth and then god made a third a third group of people that just whatever goes whatever god no you're either predestinated to heaven or you predestinated the hell one of the two there is no in between that's right amen and we know it we know that it's not stamped and sealed except in god's mind right you'll be okay with that because remember you come here with a choice and because of your choice god could predetermine what's going to happen amen we all know that but just maybe for some that's watching in online but a body a bride has now prepared me a bride to what deliver a man child that's what the bible said even the woman with the in the sun what did she bring forth a man child it came from the church all right everybody okay with that even when even that being a symbol of israel what's going to happen in israel god's not going to have a bride per se but he's going to have somebody filled with the holy ghost that's going to produce what the bible said they would produce listen every age that's why we were talking one time a long time ago we've got some methodist brother dale's brothers and methodists and we went to a a little methodist conference thing that they asked me to speak at men's breakfast and somebody brought up the church ages or brought up luther or wesley and 90 of the 95 99 of the people didn't have a clue what was going on but maybe there was one percent that did read the bible in revelations where revelations one two and three that show the church and the characteristics of the church but the more you start talking to them the more they say well see the the whole thing behind it brother john they knew we followed a man and even they denied now here's here's john wesley the great founder of the methodist church and they said well we don't follow a man methodist john wesley started your denomination amen one man right so you see how convoluted they get when why because man's ideas get thrown in just like when the headstone came when the literal body of god came jesus christ he was totally misunderstood today he's misunderstood for 2000 years since he put his foot on the earth he's not had a place to lay his head that's right always had a body no doubt he's had a body yeah brother bobby's had a body he's had a church aged body but he's not had a place to lay his head he's not had a place of headship he's not had a place to rest his head except for today today he has a place to lay his head and we'll talk about that a little bit later on um this weekend now let's go to colossians 1 verse 15. i want to thank ryan for having two wonderful girls that are in the back now and if they mess up it's it's mercy and harmony and they won't mercy just fell out of her seat i see her i'm glad we're training people because you know what this thing keeps going on we we got to have somebody to do the do the work that's why we we enjoy cross-training i love even when i was with mcdonald's anywhere i've been i've always loved cross-training i like one person do it because one person does it and he falls sick and can't come in guess what he was lost that's why god's got a body a body of believers a many-membered body not just one guy anymore he has given his self to me and you a part of his head a part of his intelligence has come to me in you amen that's what you have to do with the new birth sure he gives you life but that's not your adoption that's been brother claudine he's on the adoption series and that's what we're going to get into that's why i asked you to listen to that a couple of sundays ago because this is what's leading you can't go up the statue of perfect man without adoption the headstone cannot come to the church without someone with some authority without someone with headship not being the head right no i know we have authority god christ husband wife insert the pastor in there we know we have headship but our headships christ even if a sister is not married and don't have a husband she has a head who christ christ is her head man jezebel hated hated elijah but brother brown said that was her pastor if she would have listened to her headship and instead of ahab she would have lived she wouldn't have been dog meat who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature so in other words a body developed a a human mortal body for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him you've got this great god and then if you want to look at it and analyze it he's coming down narrowing he's coming down in a funnel an upside down pyramid he's coming down and like then what's he going to do he's going to resurrect and start building that thing we'll get to that with jerubal in just a minute okay for in him were all things created this is great god nobody can understand right all things were created by him for how can a man stand in the middle of nothing and make this that you see today i was looking at just going down the road coming from uh illinois the other day just looking at the difference of the trees up there and the trees down here and a landscape up there and down here and then you go out west and you look at that landscape who did that man didn't do that we just adapt to it but we didn't create it god created that and i was thinking of the day you know if you look at everywhere there's a river you see greenery and there's life possums skunks deer snakes everything thrives around a body of water but now something developed somewhere sometime god's got a group of animals that lives in the desert that there's no water there's places in the united states that there's only like four inches of rain a year four inches of rain a year and you go and look and there's plants and animals out there that's the master builder that's this one we're talking about right here how are you gonna understand that well he's gonna become flesh he's gonna become flesh and not have to talk to you with some you know 8 million volume book he gave us 66 books and it's eternal there's only god can do that man can't do that but god can everything in there you need is right there and it came what the word was made flesh like i said before you flip these pages real fast and all of a sudden a man steps out and there's jesus christ but guess where we got to come from if he's the head and he's the one he came to first where's the intelligence his intelligence is right here he can't do anything this bible says he can't go contrary to that but you and i can because we do it all the time but we're heading towards something we're heading toward headship to where he can have the preeminence and he is before all things and by him all things consist the spring the fall the winter the budding of the trees and all different things that's how he exists or consist of him look but watch narrow it down and he's the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead and where did he resurrect that right down here this age he resurrected down here and then the church age began on the day of pentecost the holy ghost fell on 120 people with headship that they were looking for now listen they were under jesus when he was alive and well but that wasn't their head because they didn't have a body there was no bride but on the day of pentecost there stood 120 and that was 120 that had all these things working in their life from right here down amen because they had walked with the word himself and they had listened to what he said they had went to church and they had studied a lot of things they didn't understand a lot of things we don't understand amen but the whole point is they started this thing and that's the foundation we're built on the foundation that the apostles and prophets gave us jesus christ being the chief what cornerstone to make the headstone got to have a cornerstone first because look they chopped him off they totally rejected him this is all this was gone out of here gone but he come right back down here and started where like zerubbabel he started on the foundation all right same way as we'll read a quote here in just a little bit where brother branham he kind of well they don't kind of he puts it out there that that's typing him but he does it in a way where nobody's going to understand it except us but he does when he when i'll quote i'll give you the quote in just a few minutes i thought man they didn't know who he was talking about when he was talking about esther and mordecai they didn't know who he was talking about you know why because it was withholding it was not for them it was for us to understand and he is head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead look that in all things he might have the preeminence when you put the head on top of the body the head is preeminent because you can't do anything without remember what i said with that nerve without that nerve going down through the head to move that finger if there's something severed you can't move that finger on its own you can't use it you can't use this if it's not coming from here that's what's so interesting is how can we do all that because remember the hand's quicker than the eye right that's how they do the magic tricks and stuff but the hands quicker than the eye it can fool the eye your hands can fool the eye but you know where it starts fooling you from right here because this is where the eyes the nerves come and this is where your hands come now look your eyes closer to your brain and your hands the furthest away from your brain but this is that's how god made it that the hand of god your eyes can deceive you but your hands are quicker to hold what to take that sword and jab it to the enemy amen that he might have the preeminence in other words the what the headship all right for it please the father that in him should all fool this dwell all right let's continue on now the masterpiece brother brown said let's read the red save time but the body was built by the word now watch the bible every time you see that i want you to think of bride because listen jesus's corporal body can't save you didn't brother branham say if jesus christ himself was standing right here on this platform like he said in a corporal body with a suit on just like i got on that's what he said he couldn't save you or heal you he's already done it but it has to come through his body the bride was built by the word right which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus comes on the scene that's what we have to go back to we have to go back to jesus christ because he's the head it's where it all originates from that's where your thoughts originate from that's where everything you do originates from right here everybody okay with that jesus came on the scene there when the head piece was put upon it we find in him the entire handiwork of god when he was standing on the earth that was the entire handiwork of god what was it god in human flesh that was the handiwork of god that's something he always wanted to be he wanted to be in human flesh we find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word the fullness of the word listen this guy fulfilled the whole old testament they built their religion on the old testament he was built in that word and they rejected him right they rejected him totally they didn't say well now maybe later on you'll know they called him belzybub they called him the prince of demons but now again god has the perfect masterpiece again who's he talking about he had a perfect masterpiece 2 000 years ago but he's not one again who is that that's the bride that's me and you all right let's go to psalms 85 9. surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him the glory may dwell in our land mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other god and man became one truth shall spring where out of the earth out of the earth not this earth down here oh yeah it sure tells about his resurrection that he came up out of the earth but out of this earth and righteousness shall look down oh i'm sorry troops shall spring out of the earth earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven heaven and earth is going to kiss what in jesus christ well listen when you got born again come on people when you got born again heaven and earth kissed each other there was a uniting there was a a secret that man will never understand unless you're born again you can't understand god you can't understand why because you're not connected to the head oh you might be connected to a head but it's not the one you're supposed to be connected to like i'm telling brother claude sometimes you listen to this part and sometimes you listen to this part you know the little devil that sits over here and the little you know the little angel that why do you think they got that from the cartoon you know why i didn't just pull that out of the air because that's what they that's what we and we see the same thing you listen to this guy then you listen to this guy well if there's two talking one of them's god and one of them's the devil okay and if one's off the word we know who that guy is but remember in the end time though he's gonna come so close because you know what satan is going to incarnate a pope and speak through him and the world is going to fall at his feet as he being god when we leave this place folks there's going to pope stand up and he's going to do signs and wonders miracles and the whole world is going to be deceived by whole world except 144 000 and 2. amen thank god we'll be gone thank god we'll be gone because you know what it would deceive the very elect if possible you know how i see that we're going to be gone so it ain't possible amen we're going to be out of here the whole world's going to be deceived by this one guy but why can't we take one guy and get revelation from him one guy one guy's gonna deceive the whole world but one guy is gonna save your soul and take you out of here one guy and they called him belgium they might call you the same thing all right let's go to number two god's gifts find their place he was a being on earth a being of time god actually came into time slowed himself down and entered a body a real body a flesh and blood body right and he had to eat and he had to grow we we've read the scripture where he learned by the things he suffered and being made perfect being obedient being obedient you'd think well he's god how can he not be obedient well he was a human he had a human brain that he had to work through we'll get into that maybe later on got a thought on that which means he must had a beginning therefore he created himself a body to live in now what's he doing now i want you all to see both yes because when we say all these he's creating a body well now that was two thousand years ago in the womb of mary that's okay that's the cornerstone but the headstone to the church is pure is knowing where you came from knowing that you're the body he's creating himself a body by the new birth created a body for himself that by this creation he might save the lost creation that he created that's right say that ten times he might save the lost creation that he created he created us perfect but somewhere along the line we lost headship somewhere along the line eve stepped out from headship she'd have stayed under handships she'd have been fine she stepped out and what took another head took another idea and said this is what i like better than this that's what we did born and sinned shaping the nicholas found from my mother's womb a liar doomed on our way to hell but god came to us he said i want to be your savior and you said god i need it i need it because i'm lost cause listen you didn't just come upon this idea please you didn't just come upon this idea you didn't just say no you heard the word you got condemned there was condemnation because you had the wrong husband you were living your substance was of another guy may i say right you were living under another headship under another guy husband but remember if that husband dies you're free to marry again the problem is not getting into marriage in divorce but you got to talk about a little bit here but if you just divorced that husband you had in the world now i'm not talking about natural i'm talking about spiritual you just divorce him he's still alive and he can come back and haunt you and haunt you and haunt you right but if that dude's landing i'm sorry if that dude's laying out there in the in the grave with six feet of dirt on top of him he's not going to bother you ever again that's why the new birth should be taught that way that it's a dying out it's a killing it's bloody jesus said what the kingdom of heaven is taken by white force you take the sword and use that sword kills your old husband put him in the listen put him in the grave don't go back and look at him he's dead he'll do you no good and be married to christ and that's the whole plan to save the lost creation he had to let you get married to your first husband eve got married to satan first remember she was married to adam committed adultery and took this man's idea and got the wrong seed right she'd have stayed with adam she would have got the right seed amen natural but it's also spiritual everybody all right number three see that's why in the layout of seeing church age we see that brother branham he tells us we read revelations 3 14 where it says what the beginning of the creation of god that don't even sound right amen that doesn't even sound right the beginning of the creation of this eternal happy birthday yesterday you're welcome where's your sister oh happy birthday yesterday y'all born the same day that's pretty neat happens that way oh sarah was yesterday too and so was well richard marlows was today so what charlotte's is today right no richard's worcestershire today i want to see him again i miss richard marlowe and all the others but when god created himself a body he came down and lived in it now that's what he did with his natural body but that's also what he did on the day of pentecost on the day of pentecost he started a body and he came down and lived in it listen you can doubt all you want to but you got to be like peter yes that's right peter stood up and he said this is that this is what we've been waiting on for three and a half years this man told us these things and it just all went in our head but now it's so clear amen this is that and i identified it with joy right i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh boy what a sermon he started his church like he warned them started by the new birth by god coming and indwelling 120 people and giving them the new birth and then them going out and giving that message to the world christendom today started with 120 people amen got to start somewhere he came down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god oh isn't he wonderful and i keep forgetting this quote and i'll try to bring it but brother brown said if he's the beginning of the creation if he's a beginning if he's alpha and amiga the beginning and the end everything in between you know what the in-between is i'm looking at it that's the between part that puts the god and man back together again listen we got separated in the garden of eden god didn't sit up here and go oh how am i gonna get this back together he's like i already got it figured out i've seen the end from the beginning i'm going to see a group of people that i'm not going to put in the first church age i'm not going to put them in the second church age third fourth fifth sixth i'm gonna put them in the seventh church because they're going to be what be able to be spoken to in a way that not luther couldn't do this wesley couldn't speak this way pentecost couldn't speak this way he speaks through us exclusively and i'm not talking about me i'm talking about the five full ministry and you listen i um excuse me brother daryl and i were talking about it we can't make ourselves exclusionist god will do that for you you just be look look at god he just was he just was jesus christ right he just got up every morning i'm jesus christ i'm gonna walk through and i'm gonna do what the father tells me to do right preach a sermon go up on the mountain give him the beatitudes i'm gonna get in the boat and i'm gonna be tired i gotta go to sleep how in the world could you sleep with a boat now that boat wasn't a titanic that boat didn't have like 500 people on it it had 12 13. it had 13 people in it that's a canoe and here this thing's doing this i'm sure it's there rocking and jesus is just laying back here asleep i'm sure he don't have one eye open he's asleep because the bible said he was asleep because they went back there and i said what are you gonna you gonna let us sink now listen here's me and you you got jesus on your boat you got jesus in your boat everybody this is free you got jesus in your boat you know it's jesus right you go back there and you say you gonna let us think what's the deal here we put our faith in you he goes up puts his foot on the bow says peace be still sky clears calm glassy water right and they still don't know who he is they said what kind of man can do these things well god can that's who i would have said only god can do that well this man must be god duh but they did they denied him all the way to his death right right why because they didn't have headship the head was there the head and body of jesus was there but the headship he wanted was not over his body lateral he came to show us how to live with his head on his body so that when the church rejected him buried him he could raise up and say all power and heaven has been given to me why the head and the body had united it began the creation of god what is the creation of god me and you you and i are the creation of god oh yeah mom and daddy because of the fall gave us our body kind of well-known fact but who gave you your soul god did but he got marred because you were born on this side of the fall there's no way for you to get back you were born in sin shaped an iniquity you didn't come the way you were supposed to come you had the wrong headship but now that you're born again you got the right hitchhike if all wrongs have been made right when you get born again you say oh bro wait tomorrow i gotta go to work i got bills to pay ain't got nothing to do with it god didn't save your body he didn't save your spirit he saved your soul you've got to decide remember the conflict conflict between god and satan there's no conflict folks if you take your equate you out you got to put yourself in christ but what do we do we yield to the other we yield to the little pitchfork guy on this side i'm sorry i do maybe y'all don't okay well i guess you don't then i guess i do y'all pray for me okay you love the lord all right let's read let's hebrews 5 verse 8 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered i thought he suffered on the cross no that was just a fulfillment or a culmination of what he had done the 30 something years that he lived but during that time see what i'm talking about when talk about adoption during that time remember we read the scripture where he was on the river jordan and he stood there and this spirit came on him like a dove and said this is my son and whom i'm pleased to dwell not hear ye him but he had to be made perfect he became the what author who's the author of the bible paul i was thinking the other day read the book of matthew read the book of matthew and watch him write he never was in some of those places matthew was not now look luke was with paul he wasn't really with jesus so he writes the book of luke having perfect understanding it had to all come by revelation but same way with matthew you read matthew and you go matthew wasn't there when that happened remember matthew was what tax collector or something with me or that guy we don't like god must have liked him he needed him to do his taxes i don't know but you had matthew there and and then you had mark luke and john now john was there the whole time that's why he could write a little bit different john was with jesus the whole time luke wasn't matthew was only a certain length of time but he wrote about the birth the birth of jesus was on this wife and you know what we believe what he said but he wasn't there moses in the beginning was the word we know that was paul but you take that all the way to the to genesis in the beginning god created the heavens and earth who told moses that you see how well this book's written but listen my point is that same person that fired that head or intelligence of matthew mark luke and john paul moses whoever is the same person that's inside of you there's not two people that wrote the bible one person wrote it and now that one person's inside of you why so he can build his body amen it's really simple but we make it so hard brother claude called me today and he said he heard another preacher online saying that we don't need any teaching anymore we've been taught enough well you know what i i ain't when you walk when you get up in the morning and you say i've learned everything i need to learn they are embalming your body hello have you not learned something every day well if you do it natural guess what doesn't god listen if god don't talk to you every day and i'm not talking about audible voice but if god doesn't talk to you in something what are you doing because look the intelligence look my brain i do have one i've got a ct scan to prove it and i have a heart don't call me heartless ever again i got proof when they did that cat when they did that heart cath it didn't go out my shoulder it went right in my heart and thank god there was nothing there see there there was nothing there but look everything you do every day comes from right here everything everything you do every day comes from your head so when you get up in the morning and you say brain we've learned all we're gonna learn we're not learning nothing else he's gonna say lights out heart stop lungs stop y'all stop because he's done he's finished so if we don't need teaching then we're dead and we're ready to i guess morph into something i know what they're saying and i want you to see something i'm dead serious if you don't have teaching you're going to be deceived if you have manifestation if you have people running the aisle that's okay well and fine but brother brown said when you jump up he said you better be able to live it when you hit the ground well how you gonna be able to live it if you don't know it i love andrew glover and the different ones it kind of gets you you know that's good gives you some bodily exercise that a lot of us need but when you go to work on monday and tuesday and two weeks later and all that's gone and you're sitting in a pit and all you see is the devil on all four sides you're gonna go no that ain't gonna get you out that's right you know what gets me out you know what to say what satan can't stand he can't stand the word but he can't stand you living it you know what the prophet of god said he can't stand you living it because he can't live it he can motivate but he can't live it so that's what i want to understand and that's what jesus he learned by the things which he suffered in other words growth and being made perfect now that's what me and you are coming to didn't jesus stand up one day and say be you therefore perfect or complete now how can we be complete if we don't have a head remember brother branham was the only one that could say this he said god is not complete without you that's what he come for he come to show that it wasn't just all jesus standing there wrapped up in a package many people believe jesus can is am i okay how many people just how many there's a lot of people believe that jesus was almighty god but like brother brown said they can't get him off the cross he died for me two thousand years ago but i can't help this what i do you know what he's doing they're pushing him back to calvary they're putting him back on the cross what did brother brown say i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ in other words the son of man is the one that was crucified he wasn't talking about the son of god he's talking about the son of man they put the son of man back on the cross why they couldn't get him off that's right and put him to an open chain that's why jesus stood up one day we'll not read it we'll skip through it girls you're going to have to skip through a couple of these so i can get finished he stood up on the mountain one day peter james and john was with him voice from heaven a cloud comes down enfolds them in other words they got caught up in a cloud they got caught up in the cloud and heard a voice that said this is my beloved son he's been made perfect he's done what i told him to do he's fixing to go die here ye him in other words if you're going to get it you don't play that here you him that was not staged but how are me and you gonna make it with any less that's right than that and god taking you up on a mountain mountain apart the bible says apart from the world james and john and they got it all wrong too peter stoops up and he says okay let's make three tabernacles this is a nice place it's kind of flat up here let's just make three tabernacles let's make a trinity because the bible said when peter shut up they didn't see but one guy they saw jesus only and then when they got ready to come down the mountain they were in wonderment what just happened what's going on here we were in a vision we saw you glorified the prophet of god said because he had he was had an aura around him and there was moses and elijah speaking of the second coming prophet says they didn't understand that and jesus said look tell this vision to nobody because in other words nobody's going to understand it until the son of man be risen again from the dead risen again from the dead in other words if you rise again that means you died one time and you rose again why because of what brother brown did he indicted this generation for putting him back on the cross and totally denying headship listen father son holy ghost you can't get headship out of that now look god winked at the ignorance of the people and you know without a prophet telling us that i'd have a hard time with it but you got to go back and see that their age was not the head age it could have been the foot it could have been the body could have been the arm which was a piece and it was controlled by the head but you know what happened somewhere between here and here there was a man's ideas got involved there was a another head come over father son holy ghost baptism is not in the mind of god these denominational ideas i'm talking about ours these ideas that are contrary to god's word never came from the mind of god that's what god's been working with that's what god's been dealing with down through the church ages what a gracious god when the first false doctrine started back in the first church age i'd have killed them all and started over again you know what brother brown said god should have done with adam adam could have said i won't don't want this anymore i want you to make me another one but see just like me and you and god we're inseparable even though the dirty things we do we are inseparable to god if you're a child of god eve was a literal part of adam bone of his bone flesh of his flesh when you and i get born again we're born of his bone flesh of his flesh prophet continues life of his life do we have a life centered around jesus christ are we just in the message amen the biggest problem i've seen in my 20-something years coming back to the lord because see i came up from from the 60s were man they didn't know anything there was no message church on every corner we only had tapes and we had it was just real to real and you'd only get so many and then you'd only get so many books so you had partial understanding but man was just like god sent a prophet which is fine that's a good foundation zerubbabel right as we're going to read here in a minute zerubbabel good foundation got to start somewhere but did they take god sent a prophet and take it over here to another headship and say william brown was our head yes they did when they said he was god they created another headship that's why he said he said they can't be two heads he said if you call me jesus christ you've called me the antichrist right you know what he said and i agree with him because it would have been anti-the anti-word but he indicted the generation that was then so that me and you could have a chance to realize we're not putting him back on the cross no he's not dead he's alive he's right here his brother daryl was talking about he's here we we keep hearing that we keep hearing when we're gonna start believing it he is here hallelujah and then you go home and go up i don't know if it is or not i don't know if he's the second person third person i don't know if he's still in heaven i don't know if well brother branham he's he must be god oh lordy unless you're born again you're not going to see the kingdom of god brother branham on the meanest man i know number four he says jesus's first doctrine is you must be born again get him girls that was his first doctrine now what's the first doctrine you heard when you come in the message god sent a prophet brother brown says uh the next quote he says uh i think maybe we're not getting them we're getting them to a theory is that what this is listen to most people it is a theory it's something new that you've got that they don't have and see that's not god that's not god the only people jesus excluded was the religious people of the world the pharisees and sadducees i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church to a theory is this message just a theory or is it a reality if you're born again it can only be a reality yeah but if you're not born again it's a theory we heard that jesus resurrected you know that was a theory back in the first church age that was a theory when they walked up to whoever that was pilate and pilate said or kaifa said don't don't tell me resurrected tell them the soldiers took his or his disciples took his body and tossed it out isn't that what confidence is saying today you're not the body devil's saying today you're not the body because caiaphas wasn't the high priest of god he might have been the high priest of israel at the moment but he wasn't a high priest of god because god didn't tell him that he put god on the cross and he will be condemned for that we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to christ he is the only one the only one that has life he that has the son has life and if the life of a man look that's dead be projected in you he will live the same life you will live the same life he lived that's why christ had to die and come back on the day of pentecost in your body not his body right not his corporal body his corporal body is gone he can't have two bodies here at the same time everybody okay with that truly elias must first come and restore all things that's what jesus said in matthew 17 8. let's read this one quote number six girls y'all are hired now watch him now we've read this before but let's just look at it real quick now when the holy spirit first fell on the church it was on the eastern people in jerusalem right 120. he's talking about 120 on peru that's where the holy ghost fell great signs and wonders were done by the church in the early pentecostal age of the early church that's down there ephesians or ephesus when paul was alive peter was alive john was alive luke and all the different ones then the next round of apostles cycle what'd they start doing taking other headship right well cyrenthius jesus was a light substance of god therefore he couldn't be all god he was a part of god therefore there's a holy ghost in there somewhere because it's got to come back on you that's two and then the son father son holy must be three must be a trinity the next round of apostles then came in the catholic church then fifteen hundred years watch what brother is doing he's bringing it then the lutherans then from then on down it's been a day where the light went out he's done about our day after luther was wesley pentecost in us remember the bible tells us be a dark day but they'll be light in the evening time then from then on down it's been a day where the light went out remember brother branham when he drew the church ages the seventh church age was totally blacked out he said i put a little light in there what was that little light menu because really that black listen folks that black in the church ages is not the centers of the earth have you ever thought about that that's not all the sinners that's the religious people the people that heard the word and didn't didn't hold it that's what that black part is because remember what did jesus say he said if that lie didn't you be darkness how great is that darkness think about that caiaphas the light he thought he had was darkness that was the devil talking through him and it's been a daylight enough that you could see jesus was the son of god you should repent but the real bright light of the holy ghost has never shined through these ages now go back to the first church age powerful people apostles walking down the road and their shadow healed people silver and the gold have i none peter said but such as i have give unto thee rise and walk the great things paul did all the different ones i'm just reading what the prophet said but the real bright light of the holy ghost has never shined through those ages why he's talking about the headstone he's talking about that holy ghost not the one down here they're not two you get the holy ghost as a baby remember baby baby was just born if they don't feed it baby die yet it is a baby yet it's a fountain but they gotta feed it diaper it nurture it see it at school learn by the things you suffer see i didn't suffer much in high in school but tears did he's still suffering now i didn't say that brother boyd said that he never i don't think t ever got the a's and the b's part i think he just started at c i don't throw all the way through okay he's shaking his head just to lighten it up a little bit but the real bright light of the holy ghost has never shined through these ages why they've never come to full maturity they've never had to produce a headstone or a headship like we produce not a different head but look if they take false doctrine you and i take false doctrine it is not the headship of christ can't be that's why it took brother branham to come from 47 to 63 to preach us back to where we could listen he preached the body back together because it was all separated in denomination but he brought the body back together and then what did he do he said he's here when the seals broke that's when the headstone came amen i just believe that from 47 to 63 it's just what he's saying right here there's just enough light for them to get born again what brother brown branham say what brother brown say he said go on as you are live a good simple christian life he said because if you do all these other things he said it'll twist you for the way from god why because he knew there would be ideas come thunders had to be seven men had to be this i had to be the virtues had to be this had to be that right he said go on and live a good simple christian life why because it wasn't for them they were not to produce the headstone the people that got the revelation of the seals later on is the ones to produce the headstone we're the only one that knows what the headstone's about ask somebody what do you think the headstone is if they'll say christ they'll say where's he at where was that certainly the bible said it wouldn't as the prophet said it would just as sure as he said they couldn't believe because isaiah said there hasn't been light because the prophet said now look there's been enough light to know that you ought to do right and wrong when you get born again you ought to know right from wrong baby form okay you're going to make mistakes baby knows as he gets older not to touch that thing that's hot right but you might have to smack his hand every once in a while because he's still going to reach for whatever you tell him listen whatever you tell them not to do they're going to do it anyway so the best thing to do is say look drive 90 miles an hour okay don't go through and stop go out through the stop sign go through the red lights run by the police running 100 miles an hour okay you better never but y'all do the opposite of what we tell you i never did that but y'all do lord forgive me but see that's what we've all done [Applause] so we've all done that in christianity if you can't see your christian walk in your own life you got a problem good or bad good or bad usually we remember all the bad but there is some good in there because god puts you here for a purpose he puts you here to fulfill it doesn't matter if you're full of the fulfilled the first joint of your little finger of god's little finger that's okay but there's been enough light to know that you believed on the resurrection of the lord jesus accept him as your personal savior put your name on the church book and lived the good life but as far as signs and wonders in the direct ray of the sun shining it hasn't been since pentecost now he didn't mean pentecost 1906 he meant this pentecost down here not azusa street he's already passed azusa street they've done lost it when they cabbage down god moved on everybody all right let's go to psalms 118. i will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refuse who are the builders preachers yes head of the church not the head but a head of a church a head of a denomination the stone which the builders refused like somebody said one time they're they're putting the building together and they light this one stone to get it all started right and it's you know his brother gary's a carpenter and a lot of us try to be but you lay out your two befores your tuba sixes your your blocks go over here your cement you don't start with your shingles most of us would like to but if you're going to build a house you don't you don't buy your shingles first unless you want to save some money but you don't buy your singles you buy you what foundation material cause that's the most important it ain't going to matter what amount of shingles you pay for if you don't have a firm foundation them shingles are going to fall off i don't care if you got 30-year 50-year shingles your foundation's got to be right the stone which the builders refuse in other words they said we're not going to use that we're going to start over here we're going to start over here with the rafters for the ceiling you know what he's saying they refused to use him they refused the word they refused the fullness of the word they refused it's become the headstone of the quarter in other words if they knocked him off over there in the top he just said okay i'm gonna start down here i'm gonna make it real wide i'm gonna take my blocks and i'm going to build this place man cannot build the body of god god builds the body of god through men because watch this let's skip all the way now to let's go to ezra 4 verse 1. we know we read ephesians where they're built on the foundation of the apostles the prophet jesus christ being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth into a holy temple in the lord that's me and you all right now look ezra four i want you to watch this now what is this everybody okay can i take you just a few more minutes okay now when the adversaries you don't have those do you well bless your heart pray for me i'll give you some of mine supposed to say yes i do by the way i do i have adversaries you have adversaries you live with one so do i me i'm the greatest adversary i've got you're not always now look this is when what's happening after the 70 years have i got that we're gonna get in a little bit not all the 70 weeks of daniel but remember they were in captivity what happened when they were in captivity god destroyed and scattered the temple right destroyed everything okay and they were promised though that they were going to rebuild according to daniel 70 wheat they're going to rebuild the temple right they'll be okay listen to me just for a minute because look if we can go ezra and nehemiah was the two ones that did it um but now remember they stopped in between but there's a story here hang on now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captive builded the temple unto the lord god of israel this is the lord god of israel's temple right now anyway everybody got that right here you mind you wash your hair they had adversaries listen they were god's people really they were god's people at this time in the old testament they were god's chosen people and they were told that after they were going to be in captivity god was going to scatter the adversary and they were going to go back into jerusalem and build a temple they had to get an edict from either cyrus or the other one help me bomb anyway there was two of them okay everybody got there read ezra if you want to give you something to do now what's happening there's a group of people that wants to build god's temple back and there's a group of people always an adversary that does not want that temple to be built everybody with me you with me two groups there's an adversary and there's somebody doing what god said for them to do everybody with me amen are we in 2022 now amen okay take this as an allegory everybody know what that allegory is it's a story with an underlying meaning this story happened 4 500 years ago but the story is unfolding tonight amen there's an adversary that doesn't want this temple to be completely built there's an adversary that doesn't want this temple to be completely built because you know what they know they know that when that temple's built god's coming in god's coming god's going to get into that temple and they're going to be able to do powerful things they're going to be in a place to where if they do get caught in the belly of a whale all they had to do was turn and look toward the temple and they would be saved that gives me goose bumps i'm sorry right there all that nothing else oh what what's wrong with you all that jonah had to do was find north south east and west find out which way the temple was and you know what when he got around that seaweed and he looked toward the temple he said god you promised amen that if i could get to where i could look toward that temple that you would deliver me the next morning he got thrown out in nineveh where he was supposed to been in the first place same way with me and you amen but now there was an adversary that didn't want this temple built but there was a group of people that was going to give their life to get that temple bill everybody got it then they came to zerubbabel boy he's the chief captain jerubal knows how to build this temple yeah right the gentiles didn't know how to build it jerubal had seen the temple before in all its glory and he had a vision because they didn't have a google he had it in his head he knew the dimensions he knew the colors he was all-knowing everybody getting this it took a man that knew how to build then they came to zerubbabel and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them can we help y'all can we help y'all build this thing cause we're going to destroy it once we build it ain't that the devil let me come to church with you can i come to church with you can i help you build your temple yeah i'll give you something to build it with look how sly they were look let us build with you for we seek your god liars as you do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of air shadow and king of assure which brought us up hither in other words they knew how to worship they just didn't want that temple belt satan to let you worship a lot but when you start putting the blocks on top of the blocks and the mortar faith virtue knowledge all these stones of revelation that your adversary don't want you to do that but now let me tell you something what god will give you though he'll give you as brother broom said prophetic insight watch but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of israel are not going to be fooled because they know how to build a temple these other people don't you have nothing to do with us oh hallelujah that's pretty bold satan you have nothing to hold me with you have nothing to do with us to build a house under our god but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel how bold is that as king cyrus the king of persia have commanded us then the people of the land watch this they weakened the hands of the people of judah they got in and started saying y'all take a few days off we're gonna have a couple of holidays going on here y'all take a few days off just go party a little while don't come to church oh sorry then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in building they didn't want the temple of god to be finished and hired preachers against them to frustrate their purpose you ever get frustrated once in a while once in the morning while in the afternoon and they hired counselors they didn't want this house bill the devil knows one thing for sure zerubbabel has come to show us how to build a temple and we have a commission from the king to build it amen how you like to i love this story i never read it really like that even when i was reading it let's go now to zechariah zechariah 4 verse 6. then he answered and spank unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts now if you'll realize what happened during nehemiah's time when in ezra's time they didn't finish the temple through six church ages they didn't finish the temple that's right right they let the adversary get in and put a father-son holy ghost baptism in let a trinity come in let a know an eternal hell come in let uh wait a minute let's get in the message let a seventh under virtue come in let a no holy ghost doctrine come in let a seed doctrine come in let this doctrine come in what to confound the people and it finally came to a place to where they said stop give me a sword and give me a trial we're going to build this temple and they built it with a sword in one hand because the enemy did not want them to build that temple that's why it took 49 years to build that temple because they had to go out there and fight me and you 2 000 years it took a sword in one hand and a trial in the other to build this temple but they finally got it built amen amen this is the word of the lord unto jerusalem will say not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth what the headstone not the cornerstone that zerubbabel brought forth the headstone not the cornerstone theref therefore with shouting crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it god's got no hands but your hands and thou shalt know do you know tonight and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you what brother daryl say god speaking through human flesh again do you believe that amen for who hath despised the day of small things but they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the handles of rubble with these seven church ages they are the eyes of the lord now brother iran's going to explain that with this quote and we'll stop right here musicians get ready to come when i read this quote they are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth all right let's read this right here number seven the message of grace we are all acquainted with this scripture now y'all come when when i get finished reading this we are all acquainted with this scripture that reads the bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple i will restore saith the lord the son of man will be risen again there's going to be a body built amen and zerubbabel was a great prince amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building now i want you to put on your spiritual thinking now watch spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning or this evening as we think and this great prince had determined to rebuild the house of the lord and when he did he had laid the foundation stone now watch as we read on further we found out that god said zerubbabel has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth the headstone i want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth a cornerstone paul irene this martin columba luther wesley pentecost that wasn't jerubal he never said he shall bring forth a cornerstone it was already laid he shall bring forth the headstone and we know that the scripture says that jesus is the chief chief's cornerstone and he's also the headstone now if we will think for a few minutes now watch that this seventh church messenger boy just pops it right in there this seventh church aged messenger now we know who that was was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit now rebuild the church he's not at the headstone yet rebuild the church elijah put the stones back where they're supposed to be restore fellowship listen how do we set up a church i'm sorry if we go this long but how how can we set up how do we set up a church we're going to read congress order and doctrine because the rubric told us how to do it we want to if we want to elect deacons we go back and see and read and read the book election of deacon brother brandon what do we do if a child is unruly deacons go to the parents you understand what i mean deacons are what this is this sure pastor's supposed to do this this one's supposed to do this trust he's supposed to do this we're supposed to do this as a body zerubbabel has told us how to put this thing back together and we're a recipient of it excuse me rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord not by organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit god will bring forth the church in the last days zerubbabel the prince with joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone he had laid the foundation he took the people back to the foundation in type took them back restored the hearts of the what children babylon pentecostal babies to the faith of the father showing them this is the way the church is supposed to act let's put it together like this if we put it together like this brother brown what do we do if somebody raises up speaks in tongues in a service he says oh let them go first time or two because they're babies that's what he said he said but now if it keeps continuing happening i'm just paraphrasing if it keeps continuing to happen he said you need to go to that person take a deacon to that person or take a preacher to the person say take him in the back room and say hey if you need to give a message you need to give it now he was putting everything back together because pentecost had just want to stand up and speak in tongues daddy went to a church one time where you just go in and on wednesday night or wherever they went everybody just kind of does this and you waited on god to speak through somebody what a confusion because you might get a woman stand up i got a word from the lord that's okay but you ain't preaching not in this church brother brown said no you have a pastor he's the head you have deacons elders he put the church back together and wha my question tonight what are we doing about it though did we just say oh zerubbabel that looks pretty good we're going somewhere else i ain't talking about this church i'm talking about the bride the bride body around the world what are we doing with it we've been given all this material and as i as we see our brothers that tell us that we don't need any teaching like i said before for them to say that means they have a lack of teaching what me brother claude was talking about it's you know if you say if a drug what's the first thing a drunk tells you i'm not a drunk right and that's the first i'm not drunk right how many of you had to drink tonight 2 100 no yeah none how do you know police officer stopped you how many of you had to drink up one right one beer you see what i mean we've been given the truth this frivolous thing that's going on around the world and around the message let it shed off it's just nothing but the adversary trying to keep you from building the temple of god because i promise you when the temple of god is being built god will come to that temple that's a promise let's stand to our feet god will come to that temple listen he won't come to a temple that's halfway built did he ever say well now if you don't have the inner court done i'll just come on anyway god's not that way god said you put this here you put this here you put this color of of tapestry here you put this here you put where the staves where the from the uh altar when they put you got to put certain here listen there is an order to things listen we're not legalists though but there is an order that god tells us how to build this temple and he sent us a zerubbabel that knew how to build one he got everything back together he's the head of the body the church that in him he should have all the preeminence all the preeminence sing a song brother brown said the headstones yet to come what a fellowship here now what a jewel the headship is here now you can deny it all you want to [Music] leaning on jesus safe and secure from all the lords leaning on jesus leaning on jesus leaning on the everlasting [Music] in this pilgrim way leaning on the everlasting arms oh god's given us the ability to build this temple [Music] but what are we doing about it what if they would have just said oh well we'll let the adversary come on in here and they'll trouble us for another 50 years and that's what's happened for 60 years since the profit left we've let the adversary trouble us when we got a job to do let's build that temple and go on with god we can do it if the headstones here all we gotta do is get them [Music] [Applause] [Music] together tornaire i'm leaning saying one more time lasting on we're leaning safe and secure [Music] arms [Music] but she's come here she's made and i pray now that you'll reward that effort with our healing in jesus name we pray amen you just believe okay [Music] [Applause] oh how sweet [Music] the adversary is trying to stop her from having a normal use of her hands now pray in the name of the lord jesus that you'll heal our sister and you'll touch our body lord and give her back strength in jesus name we pray amen you just believe okay leaning on jesus leaning on jesus leaning on the everlasting arms amen you love the lord [Music] he wants to give us more than we want [Music] well let's reverse that let's take it off every promise of god you know i was reading the other day and we we try to and we do we try to build faith up sure we do but brother brown said any in other words a positive mental attitude mental toward god's promise will bring it to pass that's why that prostitute could walk up on that platform and just say i believe what that man says and got a healer but a christian would walk up on the platform and get in front of brother branham and get in front of the presence and go i wronged my neighbor i run out in front of this guy they see all these things the devil starts piling it on a child of god in her mind and brother brown said they don't get their healing well i don't want us all to be prostitutes but we ought to come up and just say i believe what he said and say well no here we go the adversary the adversary will come and try to destroy your whatever your healing your salvation your walk with god but you know what they built that temple god's building the temple now and he will have a building belt whether we want it or not somebody is going to stand up with a trial in one hand and a sword in the other hand and say come on we'll fight you with one listen they were fighting with one hand putting mud on the wall and one hand that must've been pretty good usually it takes a couple of hands to beat but no they did it with a trial and once what they did it with the word of god they believed in that sword they had but they also believed they had a work to do now you go the same way you go the same way believing god's given you the word and he gave you a job to do right and you're standing in the middle hello are you going to accept that challenge i pray that you do let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us lord i'm sorry that we kept them so long but we've got a desire lord that we all see that we do have a job to do and that we're continuing on lord be in anything that comes what come what may we're going to continue on lord with that sword and trial lord we're going to build this house of god satan cannot defeat it because you said he couldn't and now i pray that what has been said tonight will go deep into the heart of the believers and that they'll believe who they are not who they're going to be but who they already are that their christ made manifest in another form called a bride thank you for what you've given us lord i pray that we're looking for more to come lord more people saved healed baptized and all these things father we asked it in the name of the lord jesus christ as we go tonight amen just remember we may have a baptism this weekend we have a couple that want to be baptized and i'm going to try to ask one of the local baptist churches in guildsville to let us borrow their baptismal pool if we do that baptismal pool will not ever be the same i'll promise you that god bless you you're dismissed leaning on the everlasting [Music] safe and secure from
