minister for seven hallelujah you mind if i say a little something first all right amen y'all know it's been a long time since i've been up here uh when the lord brought me back uh i told him that uh that i wouldn't step back up here until he told me to well i'm coming up here playing second fiddle somebody that's better than me that actually called me to it okay and another one that's sitting over there sister brenda and your sister gwen is not here but they about three weeks ago i guess they uh and by the way kind of uh kind of called me to it they uh downstairs saying why don't you get back up and sing again i'm like well i told him i said i told lord i wouldn't get back up here anywhere near the pulpit or anything until he told me to and i walked off and as i was walking outside i i said well lord i said you know when he said i just did yeah and i'll tell you what i mean it's one thing that and i think we all need to that we all need to recognize and it brought something to light in my eyes that i stopped looking at every one of you people as just you as a human being a little marlo says peggy everybody here as people i started looking at you as and to see what god's doing for you and what he's how he's coming out and each and every one of us man to where and i think we all need to get to that point where we don't see yes sir uh my failures your failures or anything of that nature it's uh we need to we need to see what god is doing in our lives and it's obeying i'm singing a song that fell by the way uh loves that i sing and it's called the land damn it okay and now i'm gonna apologize to the musicians again i'm probably gonna murder this music okay because i'm used to singing in the shower and in my patrol car let's give it a shot a country to which i am before will there be spoken time on i'm longing for you and someday shall be know i'm looking now across that old river to where my there's just a few more weary days to labor then i will take my heavenly for you and sunday you love it land anybody uh well i didn't read the program i didn't know the three people a hard axe fall right there listen i've sung this song before but it really means a lot to me we all have storms in our life and i thank the lord that he's there hold us in the palms hanging out amen there is no hiding place in the grass till the storm passes over forever i there is no need to try for there's no sorrow thou art with me is forever passing by and the storms come no more is forever yes keep me safe there you go oh amen shining in the light of your glory oh amen holy holy holy holy oh holy amen but we can sing worthy worthy worthy and good to see about that in the house of the lord this afternoon we'd like to turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading from revelations 1 and 2 peter 1. now remember the lord willing brother samson sheddy will be here with us on wednesday preaching for us and then on the night brother samuel prakash kocha for the cash's son will be here preaching for us on the night and then remember the next weekend the third saturday will be the fellowship meeting that brother so remember that and just pray that the lord would bless if you want to ride with us make sure you let us know and we'll be glad for you to ride on with us to the fellowship meeting and back all right and so i think that's all of the announcements uh bible study saturday be on justification so come and be with us and let's have a good time in the lord right father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for you being you because that way we can depend on it because you're always the same you never change if ever how you deal with each one of us you'll always deal with other people that way if we'll just allow it to happen you'd reveal yourself back there to them then surely you'll reveal yourself unto us here now we pray that you would just bless and guide each one as we read your words you come lord and have your way with each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness may we walk in you lord we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen revelations 1 you're back on where we've been we just kind of took a little gap this morning and i hope you'll take that message and study it and think about it a lot because you may say well it just didn't sound like much to me but it's been on my heart a long time that to speak and say you know that you know we could be in idle worship worse than false god amen so how do we know so we better know right we better know whether the one speaking to us is real or not just remember the way you know see i didn't finish the message but the way you know is remember it was your own personal experience but it's the word because if that one's speaking to you abram went from abram and he met god he journeyed with him he met him on different occasions and then he made him and changed his name not all in his journey but around said the journey of every christian would come like abraham absolutely right if that one that's talking to you that's led you so far we'll just keep talking to you but if it ever stops leading you to the word you want to know who's talking to it he said will he lead us part of the way yes he'll lead us part of the way and that was the seriousness of what i was wanting us to see because i've seen so many people in this message come in it and be in it a while and to see them just fall away well evidently something stopped talking because god is the same right he never changes right that was my whole point of trying to get across to unified so the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now we're going to second peter excuse me first peter one receive verse nine receive the end of your faith even the salvation of your soul be on the head of myself souls is to the soul of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that unto that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you by the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore god of the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace grace is a revelation that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word right now i want to try to not review as much today but i want to make a point of the message and we'll get to it in order to bring it down into what i wanted us to see and then the lord willing i don't know exactly how we will start approaching the uh the rest of the book of revelations uh i may choose to uh speak a little bit on it and things but it will not be in a lengthy uh discussion of each seal that's more or less maybe take a seal you see what it is see what's doing and you know go from that and uh try to go on into the book of revelations but you know now we're over in chapter five and we've been in this for quite a while and showing that you know that there was a book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne in verse one it says that book is sealed with seven seals now the emphasis most everybody has placed upon that is um the part of it where it says written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals they totally you know just do away with thinking about the seals part of it and just wondering whether it's inside or outside and uh you know that's kind of what we'll be dealing with on the daniel 70 week so you pray for us about it because most of the thing is a discussion of whether that's three and a half years left after the rapture or seven years left after the rapture instead of you know even trying to understand uh anything about the plan of redemption to just arguments over whether it's three and a half or seven and like one brother said said well just put them both together and it'll be ten and a half so that's not too good of an answer for anything you know uh of doing but you know this book is sealed in the hand of the one sitting on the throne a proclamation goes forward you know for somebody some man to be able to come and take the book and to loose the seals now taking the book would be fine but we're not interested in just someone taking the book but to loose the seals thereof is the emphasis john is making see are the angel to him and and you know and that's exactly the way it is it needs to be understood that we've got to understand what's within the book all right now today we will be dealing with what is related to us us here people rightly age time where we're at uh of the seals and the things and then we will go into the other parts of that later i'm sure of some but now watch the book is closed it's sealed right a proclamation comes forward all right and then the angel says now the the root of you know the the king has overcome he can do it right but when he looked he saw a lamb he saw a line you know calling for a line but because he knew it would tie together with redemption of the line of the tribe of judah but then when it comes forth i tried to emphasize that you know the the odd part was that you see a lamb with seven horns and seven eyes and you know that to me as i've tried to make emphasis upon is the fact that you and i must produce that lamb all right it's not just an uh well it was done at calvary you know that's fine that's wonderful because it's got to be the same lamb right all right the same lamb that was at calvary but it's the end time to see and understand our day in knowing what's taking place here in this hour among you and i and what will bring to pass the uh rapture so we see here in chapter five that the the pride is in glory so we know for certainty that this will come to pass amen in our day amen one because we've already looked forward to seeing the uh the bride and glory after the rapture so then it means it's not worth it or not we may do it it means that we have done it or it will take place now there are things i believe in the journey of the christian life and the part to do with with uh bringing about these things i believe that a lot of those things are already taking place right all right i'm not looking for one of these days when something's going to happen or somebody's going to raise up uh you know whatever and a great move starts on the basis of you know some kind of a help to get us out of here i believe the message has already been brought back i believe we must get into the message right now all right and by doing it then i can stand here and say somebody will right right mm-hmm right why because it's there in the words the picture is shown you remember the scene the prophet i kept emphasizing the scene preparing for the opening of the seven seals all right that scene has to do with you and i because that lamb comes from the church ages because it's got the seven horns and seven eyes the lamb that was crucified at calvary didn't have seven horns and seven eyes that was the beginning that was the one to pay the price but in the end time he's to come back in his people and remember the last message i was bringing to you that i believe the bride of jesus christ must become as the prophet we gave emphasis the fullness total fullness of the godhead bodily he said well how can you prove that without even a quote from the prophet i could prove it by the fact that this is chapter five somebody has already made it to a place to where this is showing it already finished right right so somebody's going to have to become the word why can't we believe that we're part of it why can't we put the emphasis upon where we're at right you know why can't we we believe this is it why are we looking for something else you know are we waiting for another bus to pull up or another messenger to fall out of heaven or some form or something no we're here at the end of all things and i don't mind making the emphasis because it's already shown it will take place but if this bride doesn't become the word and everything behind her is gone right amen that's right hebrews 11 40 they without us cannot be made perfect right so it's dependent upon you and i am no no brother leo it's dependent upon jesus christ well what do you think i'm talking about right if the bride becomes the fullness of the godhead bodily then jesus christ will be in his church here in the last days that's sensible right he will even be visible among us without being corporal but he'll be visible among us and raise the dead and we'll go into rapture that's what your prophet had to say all right but in doing that now see we we look at it and we we're kind of looking at something that is a mystery and a mystery is something that's going on but not fully comprehended right you agree with that definition that's dale's definition okay a mystery is something that's going on or being made known but not fully comprehended that's why it remains a mystery and the prophet said even a supernatural element will remain even to the fact it is revealed all right see now we've read this for 40 years right right we've read the prophet's message for 40 something years about these things all right but you know it must be somewhere that it will come to pass and as it does then we'll see the hour and time that we're living all right now to do that i want you to just kind of think with me on a line that this one that comes and takes the book is the lamb of god all right this lamb of god does not have to come now listen to me please this lamb of god that we're looking at in revelations in this end time doesn't have to come to take away the sins of the world that was done at calvary that's right all right but then it can't be a different lamb right amen you you can't have it a different land but you can have it in a different the land in a different form right amen remember father son of holy ghost is not three gods it's god in a different form or manifestation all right so here in the end time we're not looking for him to come upon a cross and die again but we're looking for him to become in our own experiences remember now i preached this over and over in our experiences can you see in your experience that that lamb has been restored to the throne in your life can you see in your life in your revelation and your thoughts are are we still just tied up in all kinds of doctrines right well we don't know whether this is right someone's so saying that situation well that you'll never get anywhere from this morning's message because if you remember it i emphasize that voice that speaks to you let's keep on speaking to you will change us will be the same thing that we started with just in a different being a deeper meaning not a different meaning so then we're looking at it and we're seeing that this lamb that comes afford to take the books would have to be in our experience that's right that's true all right if it's dependent upon us come on now all right if it's dependent upon a people to become the word and god has said that would take place already to work right then it will come to pilates amen the only difference is that we have the opportunity to be able to make ourselves available exactly maybe it's a bad way of saying it but what else can you say because it is left up to us that was the one thing of the 70 weeks of daniel i don't know we may emphasize it a lot when we get up there but i doubt it but because it don't matter the angle people ain't gonna listen to you when you say it by the way but that's where i proved in 1974 that we could pass the year 2026 and later on i corrected that to even go up that we could pass the year huh 3 000. and not break brother brown's message so don't just think that time has run out some time running out means we gotta be here now time running out don't make us eat right okay that's right that's right what makes us it is when the word becomes revealed to us you remember i kept asking the question one day could you take your revelation and go to israel and them receive jesus christ now listening to him the other day where he was talking about listening with that jew you know said that you said you can't take that thank god in three pieces give to us jews so they'll tell you right real quick where that come from so they know it comes from the catholic church right you see they studied it they know where it comes from now in doing that then you couldn't take a trinity and go there no that's right well could you take the two lords or something like that and go there or jesus wouldn't god to the river jordan could you take that and go to israel well they just laugh at you but a real true revelation of one true and living god in the correct order that's why brother run says you won't go because it ain't going to be you he said it's going to be two prophets they are the ones that's going to have that revelation and they are the ones that's going to have the signs to back it up right you might be able to go over there and make an intellectual speech to the jews but remember we had to take the rapture yet if we hadn't taken the rapture yet the gentile age is not over yet right right if it is over you and i missed it i don't think so but now listen so then why would a prophet if you're looking at the book of revelations and looking at it all over that away and seeing things that way instead of seeing that you and i must first be here on earth all right now how many years have i preached it matching pieces how long have i been preaching on we must match what this is we must be what this is when we get dire will not be a change of what we are when we sit on the throne with him when we're the book in his hand it won't be that we're all messed up here and then we're changed up here no we must be that here before we can go there right all right now see then that way you got your matching pieces yes that's about what six years seven years ago ten years ago all right 95 that's that's a view over there all right but now listen we spent a lot of emphasis upon bringing it down and we get to verse seven there of the you know the lamb in verse six for the seven horns and seven eyes in verse seven it says and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that said all right they come and took the book they don't mean the books open right we just took the book okay now your prophet made a statement go ahead brother i think but bob's on the horn today didn't give him two references i gave you a relaxing but just follow what he's saying and let's see let me do it on me reading the whole thing let's get the emphasis upon the scripture part back down because we want the scriptural part all right and he's getting into the verse and where he's talking about all these things behold and oh in the midst next quoting the scripture that is the when it comes to that that's the eighth verse right the meaning let's see let me make sure because i want the emphasis upon and when he had taken the book before when he beats me it comes to the one sitting up on the throne just get that part now watch what he says and he comes go ahead and wrote it up now when he comes to the one sitting on the throne all right now the sailing church aid the messengers kept the fire burning et cetera he's explaining it four beats four and twenty elders and all the thing look what he said now watch when he had done that watch what taking place you talk about jubilee now this is exactly the breaking of them seals and on the 99 version and on the the uh seal book from the 99 it says taking you know place when they brought it up to the 2010 or whatever they know what they call it one the new one they took it but they put it what and said seals take place it's the same thing all right he said we'll get into that silence in heaven why would a prophet talk about up in heaven the breaking of the seals when the breaking of the seals in heaven will help no one right is that sensible that's like the lamb that was stood as flame before the foundation of the world as long as that's up in heaven not gonna help anybody that have to be transmitted down to earth all right so why would he come in to emphasize here in the fifth chapter and he would say this is the bride of christ in glory after the rapture and he says this is exactly the breaking of them sevens to themselves what's his emphasis upon what is he trying to make a point for all right verse 8 and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints now that's when he took the book verse 7 he takes the book right takes a book out of his hand verse 8 you see something a scene getting ready for the breaking verse nine this group of people who not only just see this but must become this that we're talking about they start rejoicing right they're rejoicing having a good time about their salvation right but then in verse 10 it says and has made us under our god priests and kings and we shall reign on the earth all right now where's the break into the sequence that's my point that's what he said it was now this is exactly the breaking of the seals in chapter five all right now remember remember now whatever you sleep dire has to be taking place here now or it won't be there right now all right that's why i i can't understand the people of this message why of not the joyous rejoicing within their heart about the word that's revealed to us right you know instead of arguing and fussing about the little nitty-gritty points or something right you know not a joyous happy wonderful time to understand we're fixing to go there if it's 20 years what does it matter just be a little older that's right maybe i have more maturity than by the end or something might be able to preach my way around another 20 years no but listen see we're looking for something to happen or some way or instead of seeing that right here something's got to take place in this end time right here right all right now then we look at it there and see that he'd say this is exactly the opening of those seals well now according to the prophet peace i think it's 45 it's the rise of the sun may miss it a little bit it's in the right in the sun he says he is those seals he said what are these seals in other words what would be the emphasis the prophet would place upon the sin he said it's a revelation of jesus christ there's the seals not an antichrist right now that's right amen we'll get to that as we get to the seal partners actually trying to go through the seals is not revealing the antichrist i preached that for how long going within the 40-year bracket because the seal is the holy spirit the holy spirit reveals jesus christ the antichrist is seen in opposition of the holy spirit right so it cannot be the holy spirit cannot be the seal and the seal being the antichrist the holy spirit is the holy spirit that reveals the revelation of jesus christ all right now to go with the part up here they drop back to earth okay so go with me for a second and what i'm trying to say in verse eight when he had taken the book the beast and all the worship and all things are going on and they poured out the prayers of the saints and then they sing a new song right we know that's the bride but the prophet said it was right it's just the song of full redemption because this time i mean these people in the end time we see more about redemption than anyone has ever seen up on the earth right that's why i kept reading that peter there you know what they done they looked forward to seeing it be us that would do it not them you know speaking of us you said well why not something david david just just killing that goliath well that's what i told sister gail when years ago we started a sunday school class and he said well you know kind of what he won't talk to him i said i want you to teach each one of them children that they're a little bitty david with a slingshot and they can take down any giant that comes their way right that's the opening of the word let's see it in the correct order not just be good and be wonderful right but to see who you really are and so then you see him it's verse 10 then you know what's verse 10 and you'll see the opening of the seal i don't know what is the opening of seals come on the revelation of jesus christ true everybody with me all right whatever you want to call seal or whatever it's a revelation of jesus christ now read verse 10 and has made us under our god kings and priests and we're going to reign with him on earth head back to the millennium reign one day on earth ruling rain with him for a thousand years all right now there's the breaking of the seals because there's a reveal in jesus christ the revealing of jesus christ if you remember all that i've taught you if not i would go back and read listen we are the revelation of jesus christ we the bride of christ or the revelation we're the revelation of god made known for the hour that we're living where christ made manifest right in another form called the bride right and that bride can sing a new song they couldn't sing the song now come on listen they couldn't sing the song before redemption back in the ages because there was no way to get this body redeemed that's right their songs of redemption was like i said that wesley then would sing i know it was the blood when we're not saved by the blood right we're kept saved by the blood right right amen it's the life that's in the blood that saves us see they sang the song to their age in their time we sing the song the redemption for body spirit and soul our whole being right right never has been an age that the whole being could probably be brought into view right what if the rapture had taken place before this age then you would have they would have had because we would be there they would have had to have a new body because they wouldn't know how to redeem it but we're in the plan of redemption that's right the seals revealed a complete plan of redemption right i'm quoting brother brown they reveal what was what is and what shall be so the entire journey of man upon the earth is revealed in those seals right so are you chasing the journey of god through the seals or rejection the journey of the antichrist right we try to see him which one is it but you see verse 10 he says you've made us priests and kings you've made us what you was come on is that true we are what he was is he that has made us not we ourselves amen right it's the beginning of the creation of god the seventh church age revelation 3 14 the prophet said we're the continuation of that creation he said this is a revelation of god in his church and god in his church becomes so real and connected to god it can be called a lamb all right with seven hearts and seven eyes that's right can you have a book in his hand that that book can be the believers that's in the word amen yep being the believers in the word then we can see ourselves and follow it right out to the end the brotherhood said this is the actual opening of themselves now what's he talking about now because i realize even after preaching that part about it that you're probably still thinking what's he talking about you see church you are the bride of jesus christ and god told abraham one day he said how can i hold anything from him seeing he's the heir of all time well now how can he hold anything from you and i seeing that we're his bride we're his wife we're his children we're his offspring we're all of the things that are preached about back there because we are him made manifest in another form amen is he going to hold anything from us now that's right in 1963 a man went to arizona and god came down and spoke to that man and told him to come back to jeffersonville because of visions and things he said it'll be told you then what these seals are now i ask you a simple question he comes back home he preaches what seven nights or so whatever like sunday through sunday or whatever it turns out and he preaches the seals all right was those seals in the manifestation when he preached them if he was when turk were we had a lot of problems right because the fifth one is to israel and right that's right a lot of that is to take place after we get out of here and the sixth one is the tribulation period and we certainly don't want to thank you where's our yet so then there must be a difference between the actual happening under a seal that is opened up and you look at it and the fact that god could speak to a prophet and tell him what those things are you listening there would be a vast difference between it because when the prophet would stand here and tell you what that is he wouldn't tell you we're already there we don't want to be there but he told us what's going to be there just like we can look at it and see you know what we'd see just want to be there that's right you can see why now so many years i've tried to express to you that the seals are israel amen the seals don't take place until after we get out of here the first seal is the man of sin sitting in the temple of god showing himself to be asked god that's what your prophet said it was what do we see now we're going to go back in the seals as we've done back in 79 when i preached on them the first time we're just going to try to go back into them and just pick up where the antichrist comes from where it happens and what takes place you know they can't be a man of sin to sit in the temple of god join himself to be as god or the beast until he first is a saying a doctrine antichrist spirit pro you know false prophet or prophet false prophet um incarnate false prophet and then he can become the beast after we leave out here you can't be the beast while we're here let's contour the scripture that's right all right so then we can look and see where that come from and we can see where it's going right but we're certainly not back where it started 2 000 years ago and we're certainly not wanting to be over there where it ends in reality but if you see that man of sin walk in that temple of god over there wherever you want to put it if he walks in there you don't miss the rapture right so then the breaking of the seagulls is the revelation to be revealed to the bride of jesus christ right amen and you understand it the revealing of the seals the breaking of the seals that god could break do that well he broke them two thousand years ago that's in the bible the lamb broke the seal we'll get to that he broke the seal in the bible there you know two thousand years ago but a prophet could be revealed what that is and he could tell us because we are the bride so we can be told the whole journey by the way by the way and we don't have to be here when it takes place right no we don't have to be here with the stars right we see who we are just what's happening to revelation 5. you realize in revelations 5 you are going to be standing there the glorious decked out wonderful beautiful bride of christ right you agree relationship five we're already in glory come on now man supper whatever you want to put it you're gonna be there eternal body spirit soul amen yes sir but it's because you become the word here yeah right or we don't go there right now and in doing that he can say i'm going to show you now do you remember the messages yes i'm going to take you not down on earth i'm going to take your revelations i kept asking that question right yes could god take your revelation and go convert the jews with it he's going to take your revelation and come back to earth to two witnesses right amen remember how i emphasize it yes they will be told that jesus christ was almighty god right right and they'll realize they have crucified him right right and they'll say where did you get them nail prints in your hands he'll stay in the house in other words you say you your representative your people rejected me and crucified me i am the very god of glory told you when i'm late whether you agree or not that's all right i'm just crazy but when they tell them those two witnesses tell them jews you missed the right of sonship because of your rejecting me and crucifying me you rejected the wrong sonship and it went to the gentiles right now they're going to go weak because they realize they can never be a changing of the situation they'll pull aside and weep because sure they killed their savior but mainly because they actually killed their own right or some ship they destroyed their route of sonship you can't blame somebody else they won't get mad at the gentiles right because they accepted it they'll see they rejected it themselves right you said well the poor people over right now go over and try to tell them about jesus and see if they're not still rejected come on the bible says that the veil is over their heart until this time all right they can't even see the nail prints hey look say you know you now come on you go over there right now and you tell some in jews i want you to look at something now you're listening get the point you go over there now and you say there it is in the word would you agree that you just killed this man call jesus and they'd say yes come on because they did history proves it their own rules their own writings their own doings prove that they killed that man they'd be glad to say it we sure did because he was a blasphemer yeah he was he was a devil a bounty bug right did you jews kill jesus the man that you call jesus whether or not you talk about it being guard and accident we leave that out of it i just want to know did you people kill jesus and they'd say yes and said we ought to kill him because he didn't believe he was god but when they come to the realization that they did kill god it'd be a horrible time right wouldn't it be something brother marlow for you i'm making a story okay and our old brother bill does my brother bill he's he was a girl brother loved him he probably liked this story but now you'd say well daddy i want my money you owe me some money you're rich and you owe me some money bill is saved son you don't need it right now now is that not the product for some story it can't come following and richard would say well i'll tell you what i'll do i'll just go make sure i'll be doing a lot of that today right right you better not take out a lot of insurance i see some wives with eyeballs rolling up i don't have a lot of insurance right there i don't mean that wrong but get the story and there you go kill your daddy to try to get an inheritance and you find that that inheritance we had stipulations in it that inheritance would say i have other children some of the boys you immediately would be downhearted because you figure you're gonna have to cut it when it's both for five ways or something all the kids go out divide it up about five ways man i don't lost a whole lot i'm still very good but i haven't lost a lot but what if you come to the day of the reading of the will and in that wheel bill would say richard if you hadn't had me killed you would have got everything now wouldn't that be a down-hearted time because you know you're in trouble you're going to jail but wouldn't that be down-hearted and know that you killed the one that could give you something right that's right you know that's what they've done killed a man that could give them eternal life and then killing that man they lost everything right they deserve hell i'm not against the jews but they do but so does every gentile eternal turns down jesus christ deserves help no matter who we are but you just think about when they see him and they'll realize like joseph when he was appearing to his brethren and they realize ours the man that we don't know where right there'll be no saying well we didn't do this you know it's not mentioned of which one was it um the oldest one is in judah but no one is the oldest one anyhow the one that tried to spare joseph you remember one day one of the brother and tried to spare he was going to leave it in well hitler's sneak take him out read the bible remember the story he's gonna take him out and you know get him free right well you know he wasn't still feeling too good when he got there i don't guess he thought the other guy's gonna get it you remember when i tried to help you no i don't think you would do it i think you realize they were all in bad shape yeah that's right right you get one point when you get there there won't be no argument over what i've done and how i've been good and how i kept the word through the letter i've lived it i've been a jew for a jew all the way down a little argument they'll see they rejected jesus christ and then they'll realize they lost their own sonship but the gentiles received it see we're going to israel not as a person not as people but as the word of god that's been revealed in the last days those two witnesses are going to take this book that i preached to you for so long out of the revelations 5 about an open book and things how did it come open what happened how did it become a book how did it become closed because the book is closed in revelations 5. now where did brother around him get it anything to preach it from it closed in revelation 5. he got it from god at that word of the mystery that we gentiles would receive the complete revelation of the redemptive plan for all mankind by way of a prophet messenger yeah that's why it says it in revelation 10 1-7 when it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mysteries would be revealed john you remember how tried to express it john's writing all of these things and he's thinking now how can i get this back to the church but he looks back into revelations 3 14 and he realizes that's going to have to be a prophet in that age so he said he looks at it and he said how they get back he looks back and says but there's an angel that can break the word of god you see the literal happening of the seals never broke in 63. come on the literal things of what was taking place you better not happen yet with the revelation oh man the revelation no wonder that man could stand there and say i was hoping somebody would catch it he said it's been them seven angels bringing me back here for this message tonight when he got on the seventh seal those angels bringing the word down to a prophet on earth not seven angels like seven angels right not seven angels like seven spirits of god but the prophet did say the angel was the first one met him on that first night and told him what that was right that's one of the people in the message trying to make it the fact of saying brother brown met his own theophany i met his own self why do you want to go that way you're trying to make some mystery tell me what he said but forgive me for being playing i don't give a hoot how i got here that's old plain southern language i don't give a hoot i got here what i care about is what is it you come to my house you stand out in the yard you say brother dale i got you something brother dale i got you something three days later brother dale i got you something no no no bring it in the house you can't park it out in the back no cadillac in the back and we got a dodge in the front now so i got two gifts you know you have a truck in the front yard and the cadillac the backyard everybody on the internet boy they think man that guy's rich i thank god for my 2000 cadillac it's got 107 000 miles on the boat still love it oh god sitting out in the front's got 290 thousand and i still love it we ain't rich around you folks but we're rich in the gospel but get what i'm saying so revelations 10 when it says thou smite that's kings and priests right see that's what's going to israel that's right sure now actually break into the sea so it is the breaking news sure he first said it was one revelation 5 was a scene preparing for the opening right you remember we read that we preached it we preached it yes now he says this is actually but remember this ain't took place yet that's in heaven sure i don't think we're there if you think we're in heaven now i'd rather preach it the other way and i don't believe it that way they are summoning this message preaching we're already in hell here but i don't quite agree with that either they preach we're already in the tribulation i don't agree with that either right but you know this has never taken place that's right we've never sung the complete plan of redemption really we're only beginning to get the verses up you know what i was thinking the other day about this kind of not to be funny but you know right around said if you get it all mixed up he said you've got a cow up in the top of a tree trying to eat grass i got to thinking about that and i thought you know what i believe we've got the cow on the ground yeah that's right grass might not be too good right now but at least i believe we've got the cow on the ground you know in other words we're in the story that's right we're in the happening we've at least got the picture right except for the brown burn up grass you'll take care of that why not cause the cows on the ground sorry about calling you a cow but that's the bride anyway but listen folks he said this is the actually the opening of the silvers now he'd already said this is the same preparing for the opening and then he finishes up but this is actually the opening say church that's to you and me that's what's taking place now this is the actual opening of the seals right after literal things that happen underneath each one of those things you know places are sealed this is the bride amen this is the church the bride becoming the word amen and god has taken off of the entire bible not just the book of revelation not just of chapter 5 or 10 or whatever right he's taken the veil off the entire book right and by way of the prophet messenger has handed it down to his little bride that's right which would be the greatest if you were going to go and say brother donny you was going to go to he likes what's that down under australia he loves down there i don't know why because it's down on the other side you gotta look up but yeah wouldn't it be something if you go down there and say boy i got something i'll tell you i got permission from the united states to give you everything we got well you know that people would argue hey what's good but you know what a man can stand and look at the promise to die right right the only saying is hey you gotta give the belly something you promise the head all you want to yeah you know you can talk about what you're going to get one of these days we're going to have this but you don't have to feed you need a little bit of babies they got a whole lot more sense than we have but you know what they do they just start crying know what we do we go i try to do this try to do that maybe start crying the church instead of going over there and telling them all you give them what would it be though if you could pull up with attract loads of food to some of those countries that are starving today and you just knock up there and say eat to your heart's content that'd be a whole lot better with it and see that's what god has done for you and i right right he just didn't promise us these things he just didn't tell us what we're going to be one thing but please give it to us i sit down think about the things that maybe you don't pay no attention maybe we need to start a record of what god has done among us to get people to realize that god is with us you know just remember the things that have been testified lately that god is doing among us sure and i want to see more amen i'd like to fill it with a watermelon that's good but thank you some more see church what else could you and i want than what god has given us that's right amen a million dollar a billion dollar a trillion and that would be one-twelfths what we owe i think that's around 12 trillion or something 16 trillion that'd be 1 16th of what we owe i'd be gone in the hurry but to give us eternal life and let us stay here on earth to prove yep what around them said and paraphrasing he said god's going to turn loose or allow that devil to get after that bride in the end to show that she won't fall like the first bride did you mean god's going to do it yes and you remember in the scripture he said a man among you and he prophesied and it come to pass and he leads you to another god he said i've done that to try you yeah but there wasn't everything going wrong with me i've got my turn around why is it wow biggest bunch of babies has ever been i'm talking about from the pulpit to the back you see church the most beautiful thing that god could ever think of is his bride and he's got her here in the end time to prove that she ain't falling like he fell in the garden she ain't gonna fall like they did it and i see it wrong right i know a lot of people they don't like it the way i appreciate it that's all right you go get right around and study it they say oh that prided wrong did not see it wrong didn't fall she left went home yeah looked around and said quote they already had gotten the thought and they took it home with them and that caused the downfall of the little bride of christ yep all right you see we just need to believe all that amen but can you see see the book of revelations is laid out it's not before you got to move this back over here and get this over here and pull that over here and bring that over here the prophet said that the ends and the butts was in the right way listen church let me just say this and quit the seals is not a revelation of another god there's not a god there and a god here in the goddard one day there's no wonder brad and one there's only one true living god brother ryan says if it comes down to the word that it's christ in the further revelation of the one and sign god living in his church not another god same god here in bride form still revealing himself i thought we'd believe what he said in christ the mystery the brightest part of the mystery must be revealed that's right i thought we believed that the prophet when he got into the church book is where i was looking trying to find it there got it on the note the word this is the capstone revelation of himself in this generation this last days is the capstone revelation yes of jesus christ what is the capstone revelation of jesus christ revelations 5 verse 10 that he hath made us priests and kings right we are that part of god that's revealed in the last days amen to be made manifest to face satan the satan you're going to have to back off you're going to have to step back oh boy now can i tie it together for a second with this morning then has god spoke to you in your heart after all these years and say you are my bride you are the people in the end time but not another group to come not another generation the world can't stand another generation now i didn't say the bride i said the world came right right amen i mean another few years and we're all going to be without a home that's right whether you own it or not you're going to be without one you're going to have them foreclosure signs sitting on the front and the only ones that's going to own them houses is the ones that goes over and takes the lead up are the form of bringing the antichrist into being so be careful what you're signing i've told you before they're already saying that a lot of your subdivisions you cannot have no worship service in your home why because they've done past so long you say they can't do that you signed the paper yeah yep come on you signed the paper that's all he gonna do when you say something say is that your signature well you signed it just like i told you you can't start a church in this city without being accepted by churches in this city the regards one of them they couldn't get it he had to go from a baptist to a church of god or something to get permission to even have them in church right over there you say they can't do that to us don't they already have because you signed it away yourself yep always watch one thing i'm not a governmental man i'm not what is that liberal or whatever conservative or a liberal i don't even know what it means honestly i figure conservative means it conserves but a liberal just gives it away i figure that might be what it is i don't know but listen church you watch when they pass into laws especially when they're going to pass one on social security again pretty quick you need to find out what the writer bills are you know what a rider bill is a rider bill is stuck on we've got people here who work for government knows that's the law that stuck onto that law if this law prices that law passes automatic so they'll attach all these things right over there and you're going to vote to make sure you get your social security and you're going to vote away your rights that's right brother you're right we're selling ourselves off and listen i'm not talking about the worldly denomination of people i'm not preaching out there i'm talking about what are you and i going to do what are you going to do when grandma can't get social security anymore terrence said they're going to put me in the in a nursing home but what's he going to do with his money so when mine runs out he is going to run we're gonna do grandma can't get social security you're gonna take grandma back home you need to pay grandma's medical bills see it's all coming in so until you voted your way into where we are and then like me i turn and say not me brother because i don't even vote well that's just as bad amen do not vote it's just as bad as the vote i understand that i just don't know who to vote for amen i mean who do you want this next race come on they're listening to all that so i'm going to listen you know government can listen all this stuff any way they want to when are you going to vote for the president we've got are you going to vote for whoever wrongly or what who are you going to vote for i wish axonomatics had come up and started running again i might even go register to vote for him listen church that's right think about it no seals we'll get into it and see it they're going to be broken when we get out of here in reality but they've already been because they was broke 2 000 years ago that's right the bible said the lamb took the book that had to be 1895-96 if no word left well that's what it was written the lamb took the book and broke the first seal second there the same lamb broke ever see it says when the salad seed was opened so it was opened 2000 years ago all right amen revealed to a prophet that spoke to us to tell us what it is and then one of these days literally things will start taking place when the actual seal itself is fully broken you can't beat the beast until you and i get out of here all right let's get close yep amen right come on absolutely back on these things as we try to finish this part up with revelation 5 then we'll go under maybe revelation 6. and i said may hit those seals one two three four maybe get them all together in one or whatever to do but i just want you to see there's a difference a vast difference between the breaking of a seal make it known of a seal an actual happening one of the things under that seal when it takes place there's a vast difference people arguing whether the seals are broken or especially itself the bible said it was open 2000 years ago well we don't know what it is oh he was fixing to say we don't know whether this is right or not well then you're questioning the word that's right right maybe it remembers about well 77 78 somewhere 77. he said when brother brown said that he predicted i said you thought it was prophesy which was i've heard sermons preached it it had to be by the end you know ridiculed by saying that we could pass by there but we have then come along about 80. and they started in the end well we got to get out of here by what 84 or something because of the israel and the 44 and i mean 46 and and 48. and then we're arguing that you know that would have been 86 or 88. he come on down and i told you i said first off you question what the prophet was saying second off you're questioning whether dates will be correct whatever's taking place but i said the third thing when it passes 2000 you're going to question the word of god and that's on tape because now people are questioning whether the word is right or not people of this message we say are questioning whether the bible is right that's right they've already declared that the prophet was all messed up and you can't keep up with dates and times and governments so now if people are beginning to question me your total defense has been destroyed you better have that still small voice that i spoke of this morning that one that spoke to your heart and no matter what they do if they burn the bible and burn all the books they can't burn what's in mine why because it's being revealed listen what do we got brother number 116. we're floating down oh me is shall we shall be where she is is don't worry is oh get out of here oh oh girls is now oh sometimes is if oh again oh shall be is is everybody is that told me in the beginning has brought me to where i'm at and i still depend upon that one to speak to me and keep me going but it's always been the same he said well i know brother dale has been god well that's what i guess already took two or three services this morning but you know sometimes we can think god is leading us when we really don't realize it we might find out the devil's in charge but we just have to depend on him and say lord forgive me leave me and guide me help me so i can come to a place that maybe i don't stumble so much you know you know a little kid you just little little laces he took two or three steps yesterday on his first birthday without just something thrilled at terrence you know to get to do it we see you know you hold your finger out he'll walk around do we let's see you need to get to a place where you walk on your own two feet right of course the only thing i don't understand is why that when we get older we need somebody to hold their hands you know because we get to stumbling a lot and that's one of the old things right but just pray that the lord would bless us father we thank you we love you lord and we ask you now to just go with us as we go our way to our separate homes lord and bless each one give us a dime understanding bless the lord the people and just keep everything in your love let it be you father that would lead us in jesus name amen 445 for the abrams okay amen hear this man it would not pass away but still is foreign is is
