got a I want to share a few things with you this morning that's been on my heart and uh well first off I just want to take a couple minutes first off the the couple that we were praying for the young Kon and Lindsay the young that were that was in the car accident and Lindsay was in a coma where where she's awake this morning she opened her eyes the other day and was able to look around and and she recognized some people and so she's doing a lot better than this morning just continue to pray for them and Canon he's I guess they've done some procedure or something on him and to help with his uh spinal fluid leaking and so he's doing better this morning but he's still in a lot of pain so y'all continue to pray for him but thank the Lord he they're doing a lot better this morning thank you Lord it was just the hand of the Lord they were actually able to survive what they went through and so I just thank the Lord this morning just want to give you that up update I didn't wasn't able to put it out but um I know brother Ryan was mentioning that this morning and also wanted to say this morning that if y'all if y don't remember this supposed to be our the last service that brother Zach sister Lily is going to be with us and uh we want to say God bless them we're going to really miss them amen and uh I was thinking about Zach coming up here and helping brother Terrence do the prair re Quest when he was little standing on that little St up here and they come up here and went doing you service and they had the stool up here and they two of them be up here leading singing and he's growing up to be a fine young man am so God bless them and sister Lily taught me one thing in this world and she told me to uh lower my expectations so I carry that with me wherever I go I was kidding her one time after I preached and and uh I said well everybody else said I done a good job she didn't say nothing and she said well you just need laal expectation so so that's that's the one thing I got from sister Lily so but I appreciate them they they're a wonderful couple and really God bless them in your journey and everywhere you go and so just continue to pray for them as they're changing and uh also want to share this morning I got my buddy with me this morning and a lot of y'all don't know that uh brother Tim I've known brother Tim we're both from North Carolina so that's what makes him a fine fella but Tim cross but I I just want to share this before we sing but you know I knew who brother Tim cross was but I didn't I never met him I didn't know much but I knew who he was from growing up and hadn't ever met him and you know I was sitting in I was sitting in a meeting in North Carolina and they got brother Tim up to play the piano for a special and you know I was just sitting there you you think how God works and I don't you know I'd like to I'd like to know brother Tim I'd like to know him and just the hand of the Lord when Amy and Jeffrey got married they asked me to sing a song and brother Tim was the one who played the piano for and and I just got to meet him and ever since then for as long as they've been married he's been a real buddy a real friend and uh you know I just want to share that with y'all this morning because you know you give up a lot of things in the world and you you wonder where how things will go but the Lord will bless you more than you can ever imagine and so before brother brother Bob you coming this morning okay I'm just going to call brother brother Tim up this morning but I just wanted to share that with you because

some I I'm going to tell them myself here for a minute I was over in another state here I guess it was a couple years ago and it's a church and uh the brother there's one brother that always come early and he always come back to the study to greet me and uh I I heard one of the brothers comment this morning about so sometimes how when you're talking to somebody when when people are listening they're actually not listening they're thinking about what they're going to say well that that this brother's one of those Brothers um so he was telling me he said um he said brother Tim he said uh he said I never get cold he said I can sleep outside no uh no blanket no sleeping bag nothing no tobog he said my head never gets cold he said everybody around me would be getting sick pneumonia whatever else and he said I never never happens to me and and and I was joking with the brother and I thought he knew I was joking but I said well brother you you do realize there is a rare condition that only a few people are born with where they have more bone density or their skull is thicker than the average person and I said it works like insulation so they're they don't they don't get cold and and I was winking when I was saying it and and his brother-in-law was was in the room with us and um he walked out of there and about two weeks later my I and I had told my brother my brother what what had happened cuz he knew the brother too about two weeks later my brother is up hunting on his property with with our pastor and he they went into the cabin afterwards and I hope that brother don't watch this video cuz he still don't know he was in the cabin there telling my brother and and our pastor he said brother just recently I learned and he's going through this and he's pounding on his head with his fist demonstrating to them how thick his skull is so uh I got a pretty thick skull myself and my wife can tell you how many times I have to be told sometimes before things finally settle in you know sink in but uh um I pray that you know I I believe the Lord speaks more times than we realize and we're just not really listening but I pray this morning he'll move me out of the way and just uh say something to your heart that' be a blessing to you and uh I do love brother eron and I love each of you Believers I I don't know you all as well and and you're not all from North Carolina but we we're all from eternity I believe that and I believe we're going back so uh it's good to be with you this morning and my wife wasn't able to come with me um our our daughter had a we had a birthday party celebration yesterday she's about to turn three and uh so she just had a whole lot going on it couldn't come but I'm here and I told her there I'd play the piano if he would sing so uh we're you know let's just don't get in a hurry this morning and uh let's Worship the Lord and uh nothing we do is for a show but it is to express our love and appreciation to him and uh so I'm going to invite brother Aon to come I'm going to play the piano and uh he's going to sing and then then we'll go into the word [Music] okay I'm not I'm not on any that's true I'm not EO Tri I'm nothing on my own I

Jesus oh such Mercy when he was on the cross I was all his M amen hallelujah thank you Lord bless you thank you Lord what a wonderful reality amen praise the Lord May let's open our Bibles this morning morning to Matthew chapter 16 and um again reading at verse 13 I apologize for the way my voice sounds this morning I'm getting over some congestion and things and um I've got something that's contagious this morning but it's not the flu or Co or the cold it's it's something uh fire burning in my heart and I hope it spreads and I believe you come with fire burden in your heart this morning too and so um just before we read his word let's go to him in prayer once more Heavenly Father Lord what a what a wonderful realization to know Lord that when you hung there on Calvary Lord you you saw the crowd you saw those that were mocking you and jering and making fun Lord but you weren't focused on on them and Lord you the true reality is Lord you you you didn't die for the sins of the world but Lord that you died for my sins it was me that you saw Lord thank you Lord it was me that you looked upon and the condition I was in and Lord you you went there and suffered and endured all of that father God for my salvation my healing my Redemption father to be re restored Lord and replaced thank you Lord Lord as one of your children and Lord with that in mind that that is really what brings us here today in honor of the Resurrection because Lord that life has been resurrected within us and it brings us here to worship you this morning Lord to acknowledge that you are our God you are our savior you are our Salvation you you are our healing Lord you uh we are so insufficient Lord and we are we we fall so short but Lord you are our sufficiency and Lord we ask you this morning to make that a greater realization to each of us and as we look into your word may you come Lord and do what only you can do and that is make the word come alive to us father Lord may it come in and Minister Lord our needs Lord are perhaps as scattered and as diverse as the East is from the west but in your word Lord the answers are present and Lord you you have a way of ministering your word in a way that will meet each and every need and we ask you to do that and we pray Lord for these who are gathered here today and we also pray Lord for brother Wade Lord for brother Samuel Dell and for his family Lord and we thank you for the work that is ongoing Lord that uh brother brother Samuel didn't start but you started it Lord and you're going to take it on and we thank you for that Lord we're a part of that and we we just ask you Lord to have the preeminence in our gathering here today in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen I want to speak on the prevailing power of Revelation this morning morning let's read in Matthew chap 16 beginning at verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of sis uh cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias or others jeremias or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven may the Lord bless the reading of his word and you may be seated this morning now I I believe this message I have preached numerous times and perhaps I've preached it here before I don't know but it it is what the Lord moved upon my heart to to minister this morning and I I know that y'all are a blessed group of people to have a wonderful ministry here and and not only brother Samuel but brother Wade and brother Bob and and I'm I'm sure I'm overlooking but and you believe in the five-fold ministry and you believe in the ministry of God's prophet and it did my heart good to come in and hear his voice voice uh this morning as you were here in attention to that and so um uh I just I'm not here to tell you anything you haven't heard before but I'm just here to yield myself to the Lord that he could speak and so we realize uh the church is built on Revelation and every individual member that makes up that church or that body or the bride is built on re Revelation amen so and and it's not only the foundation now sometimes we think of a foundation as being something Elementary or being something you know that that we maybe Advance Beyond but uh Revelation is not just the foundation but it is the basis it is the basis that the church is built on and it's the basis that every member and every person who makes up the church is built on so God didn't build his church on an emotion Revelation is not a feeling it can produce an emotion it can produce a feeling we realize there's stimulation of Revelation but what God built his church on is not just a feeling amen but it and it's not a membership uh Christ Church is not a church you can join it's not a church you can uh be uh become worthy enough to enter you can't earn your way into it you can't work your way into it it's not something you deserve amen but it's it's it's and it's not based you know if it if this were a country club you know then you you could buy a membership or you could know somebody or you could be born into a family like royalty royalty is based on lineage right amen but this is not a natural lineage it is a spiritual lineage it is the faith Seed of Abraham amen so it it and that when that is is revealed to you then you are you are born into the body of Christ or in this church and so um I'm just trying to get a little bit of a foundation late here this morning but every Born Again believer is brought into the revelation of who Jesus Christ is not necessarily who he was was or who he's going to be but who Jesus Christ is because Jesus Christ is alive today amen now he is not in a nail scarred body revealing himself to the world in that form but he is here in the form of the revealed word and that revealed word is Incarnate in a body of people amen that have also come have been incepted if you will into this great mystical body of the Lord or the Church of the Living God and that's who we are a part of amen and so I want to read a quote this morning um from the revelation of Jesus Christ and I know you've heard this before I know I'm not it's nothing new but it's it's kind of builds the basis and and the prophet of God says now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of Statuary exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now the uncovery is not only the revelation of the person of Christ come on this is key it's not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it is the revelation of his Future Works in the oncoming seven Church ages now it is the person of Christ but it is again it's not the nail scarred body of the man Jesus it is revealing what his spirit is going to do in an Earthly body as it operates through the next seven periods or the next ages known as the seven Church ages amen so the I'm go I'm continuing on here he says the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I am not talking about this book of Revelation and you I am talking about all Revelation it is tremendously important to the church do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this question whom do men say that I am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah are one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am you see the question has to come to the individual God doesn't care about what the world thinks he he's not taking an opinion poll this morning he's coming to you he's coming to the individual do you know who I am amen and and he so uh he said but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ now that in itself is a revelation that he is one Thou Art the Christ the son this is exclusive the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon Baroda for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee in other words what Jesus was telling him him in essence is I didn't as a person I didn't give this to you right as a man standing here in a body of Flesh I didn't give this to you but it was revealed to you by the father by the spirit of God quickening this to your understanding amen Upon This Rock Amen my my father has revealed it unto thee and I and let me find my place place here uh Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven you see this has to be a basis this has to be a foundation amen that will operate that will work even when Jesus is not here in a body of Flesh because it's how he's going to build his entire church over the next 2,000 years amen so it's Revelation by the spirit Spirit to the individual believer amen amen Upon This Rock oh no sorry I'm getting ahead of myself and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so in other words you come to the realization of who you are as a part of the church when you realize who he is amen Peter could not be placed as a stone in the pyramid until he realized who Christ was amen and when he did then Jesus said and thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church amen and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now brother Bram says the Roman Catholics so brother Bram is telling us what the Catholics teach the Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter why would the Roman Catholic Church say that because it's how their church is built on a man on a man's teachings or on how he interprets the word and it changes every time the pope changes so they built their Church on a man but God didn't build his on a man amen the Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter now that is really carnal how could God build the church Upon A man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it God can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot amen it's not built in Jerusalem it's not built in Lula it's not built in Newton North Carolina it's not built in Jeffersonville it's not built in a place amen it's placing the individual in Christ you see amen it wasn't some rock line there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot and it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus there's a shocker the church isn't built on Jesus brother Tim read on listen on I got you listening now don't you it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the Revelation read it the way it is written Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and Upon This Rock Revelation I will build my church the church is built on Revelation Amen on thus saith the Lord I'm just going to break here for just a moment to say God's spoken word is his most powerful form of expression it's how he creates it's how he controls it's how he changes amen so the the Church of God is the spoken word of God Amen brought into manifestation and the spoken word of God is omnipotent it is all powerful now when we talk about prevailing the prevailing power of Revelation the very term prevailing shows that there is conflict it shows that there are at least two forces or two Powers at work but one prevails amen it shows that there is opposition it shows that there is adversity it shows that there is something trying to Hinder stop or block but the Revelation has prevailing power it is sueme it is superior amen it will overcome all obstacles it will overcome every challenge amen it there is nothing that can stop it the Revelation amen is Invincible amen it it is it is omnipotent it there it is undefeatable and so I want you to realize this this morning friends you are part of the Revelation amen you are involved in this Revelation it's still ongoing this morning Amen in 2023 the revelation of Jesus Christ is still unfolding it has never stopped and it is an eternal Revelation it will continually be unfolding itself through the ceaseless ages of Eternity amen so you are part of that this morning and uh I'm just going to go through a few examples here in Daniel chapter 10 we read and and I'm maybe the brothers are going to bring this up on the screen but I'm going to just bring you a few illustrations and if we get too close to lunchtime we'll just stop and put a hit the pause button and come back in the afternoon amen but but I I I pray that this will help you Amen in your Christian Journey because this involves you amen uh God has never stopped building his church and it's still ongoing today amen there there are still uh new new uh sons and daughters being brought into it and not only are they being brought in but the ones who have been born into the church are coming to a greater understanding of their position in Christ amen and so that will one day bring Rapture I believe that that will be the culmination of that and so I I um I believe we're reading from Daniel chapter 10 here Daniel was a prophet we know that and he was also in Babylonian cap captivity and he says here in the third year of Cyrus King of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was called belto Shazer and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and he had understanding of the vision in those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks I ate no Pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did I anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled and in the 4 and 20th day of the first month as I was by the side of the Great River which is hle then I lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with the fine gold of euphas his his and he goes on I'm going to skip down here just a bit um Let me let me move down for the sake of time to verse 11 and he said unto me oh Daniel a man great beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright the Revelation was going to change his position amen it's powerful and stand upright For unto thee see it's personal friends what God has done in this hour is personal amen it should be personal to each and every one of us and we shouldn't be able to distance ourselves we should not try to distance ourselves from what God has done in this hour I God have mercy on me here and I pray I won't be misunderstood but I hear Ministries sometimes that almost classify message people as a different category of people and I'm thinking well what are you aren't you one of us I am a message people I'm a bromite by the world's definition of what a bromite is absolutely I'm a believer of this message I believe William Brenham was the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 St Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 absolutely it's personal and when it is an attacked it is personal brother B said anything that comes against this word is your enemy and Satan is attacking this word so you should take it personally but you should take it personally take the message personally William bradam is your Prophet this is your message amen now I'm straying off my notes here but I'm saying what God has put on my heart the Jubilee trumpet wasn't for everybody but it was for Israelites it was for Hebrews it was an it was an uncertain sound to the world but to a Hebrew who who had been in slavery it was a welcome sound because there was laws that pertained to him that when the Jubilee trumpet sounded meant he was free from the other laws that had placed him in bondage so this message is a unique sound that catches the hearts of a unique people amen who are being called out of church C out of tradition C out of protestantism and Catholicism ISM and denominationalism and has called them into Christ and it is personal absolutely it's personal amen I am come to thee Daniel the words that I speak unto thee For unto thee am I sent and when he spoke when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling and he said unto me fear not Daniel for from the first day that thou did set thine heart to understand and to chasen thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come amen for thy words amen but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one in 20 days but Lo Michael one of the chief princes came to help me and I remained there with the kings of Persia now am I come to make the understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many many days now the reason I I brought all of that is to show you Satan hates Revelation how many he hates it amen it it is Public Enemy Number One to the Devil Revelation by the spirit to the individual will absolutely bind Satan completely that's right and and I just bring this as a as a little dramatization Satan had his demons go all throughout the regions of the earth doing all the things demons do trying to kill steal and destroy trying to convince people to rob steal uh Gossip murder commit adultery commit suicide spirits of Oppression depression anxiety all of these things that's what demon Spirits do that's what evil spirits do they divide families they split churches uh they they they you know they break up homes they do all of these things that's just what evil spirits do so Satan had his evil spirits roaming to and fro through the Earth doing all the things they do and and I just dramatize it this way when Daniel began praying for Revelation Satan hit a big red button in the control tower of Hell in the control center he hits a red button it's the first time this has ever happened but this button sends out a a signal and and and and the pagers if you will of every demon throughout every area of the world go off say come back to Hell immediately come back to the headquarters something has happened abort your mission and return to the headquarters so you know the Slackers they're just right on the they were barely outside the gate anyway they come in and but you know some have been on assignments quite a distance and so they they all come in and they all sit down and they're grabbing coffee and they're kind of getting freshened up and they're waiting to hear why has Satan called us here today what has happened you know they're they're kind of nervous and they're sitting there in all the history of time this has never happened and so there there you know and and what it's my you know I was I had worked for months trying to break up this home and and or this church and and and and I had someone on the verge of suicide and and you know all of these things and they're all you know kind of giving their their account of what what they were doing when when their pedras went off and so Satan finally the last one comes in and and Satan clears his throat and he says now you're probably all wondering why I called you here now he said but I I'm I'm going to tell you I'm going to give you the announcement the Prophet Daniel is kneeling by the river hle and he's praying for for Revelation and and uh one of the Demons about 3/4 of the way back said um Lucifer could you say that again I'm not sure I heard you correctly he said I said the Prophet Daniel is praying for Revelation and Buddy they get you talking about getting worked up now demons they're easily angered as it is now they're getting worked up now wait a minute I I had a man about to rob a bank I I I I had a man about ready to leave his wife and family and go commit adultery I had a church about to ready to split you know they they had what they thought were important assignments and they were it's what demons do and some of them are really good at what they do I mean there's there're senior demons they they demons are ranked you know and so they they're sitting here say you mean you mean to tell me you got me to abort the mission I was on just to come back here and tell me that the Prophet Daniel is praying for Revelation what's the big deal why would that be anything special why would that cause this this to happen why why would this cause this unprecedented event you know what's going on and Satan said well that's why I'm Lucifer and you're an apprentice that's why I'm the chief demon and you're just an upand coming demon let me tell you something if this Revelation ever reaches that prophet and that Prophet ever preaches this Revelation and that Revelation ever reaches those people and the spirit of God ever quickens to them who they are and where they are in the prophecy and what the word of God is and who they are all your efforts to make them still cheat lie commit adultery amen uh all the all the anxiety all the depression all of those other things you will be powerless yes sir Satan will be powerless against her I was looking for the quote you know what I'm talking about you will gain invincible ability that's right when the Revelation strikes you of who you are what you stand for and Discerning the two Spirits operating within the framework of the Christian church when the Revelation strikes you nothing Satan does can defeat it Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot shall not Prevail against it amen well they tried but they still lost because Daniel kept praying you see there was a determination within Daniel he knew Jeremiah had prophesied 70 years and he knew he was right at the end of that but he wasn't just happy with kind of a generalized idea of what the prophet's message and how it pertained to him he wanted to know where am I he wanted it to be personal brother Bob he want to know where am I amen where where what is my responsibility see each of us are called we each of us have a unique placing within the body of Christ and and your pastor can't tell you what that is your parents can't tell you what that is there ain't no Deacon or know you've got to learn what that is by seeking Revelation by seeking God in prayer and studying the word of God that's not just for ministers to do for it that's for every member of the body they are fed by the word of God that's how their soul are strengthened that's how you gain your identity as a part of Christ's body is by feeding on the word amen and the word places you in positioned you within the body as a functioning member part of a living body here on the earth amen hallelujah and and Satan it it it just tears his kingdom completely down amen so let me find my place here Revelation is an unveiling it is a uh it is an exposing as the prophet of God said and I and I I this really struck me because in the instance of a sculptor he is bringing something out of a piece of wood right he's bringing something out of a slab of marble or granite or stone there's something hidden in that object that it's his job to reveal so it's not just pulling the cover off of something that's been carved alog together but it is sculpting something or in this sense it's removing everything that's not the Revelation so if it's revealing Christ it's removing everything that's not Christ and if it's revealing Christ in you the hope of Glory it's removing everything that's not Christ in you the hope of glory so it the revelation will prevail the Revelation is Invincible the Revelation is Unstoppable the Revelation cannot be defeated the Revelation is the determination of the sculptor to bring out of a formless object something with Beauty something that reveals the character of the sculptor himself and he won't stop until the Revelation has prevailed he will not stop until what was in his mind emerges from what to everyone else is a mystery and then he makes it known then he declares it oh my friend I'm think thinking of how John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending from God out of Heaven as a bride prepared for her husband amen the bride was the Revelation amen of the groom Hallelujah described as a city but it wasn't Jerusalem amen it was a people hallelujah that God had carved out through Seven Ages amen by sending a message to call the bride out of the church to call the bride out of denominations so the revelation of Christ could emerge and could Prevail amen and then be revealed as the bride the Lamb's wife Hallelujah the revelation will prevail that's where my confidence is this morning so there Daniel Prayed until the Revelation prevailed there was a determination even within Daniel to keep praying and until he received it amen let me uh move to quote number two brothers I'm not real good with all these uh Powerpoints and all these things but uh let's see is that the one from the breech I believe it is Mercy give me one moment here brother sister yes okay I'm G actually I'm I'm G save that one for just a little bit I'm going bring you wow my time flies when you're having fun yes sir let me just cut loose here for a minute preach couple of examples of this Peter Peter was one of Christ's disciples chosen disciple um I love Peter because he reminds me a lot of myself lot of zeal lot of willingness says a lot of things you know out of uh just a great desire you know but then has sometimes the inability to perform the things he desires to right but you know with all that we see in Peter and so many times when he spoke the Lord would have to rebuke him or the Lord would have to correct him you know or all these things so uh but but but he was a chosen disciple and so Peter one day the Lord spoke to him and he said Peter Satan hath desired to have you he hath desire to have you I love that because it shows Satan didn't didn't have them and never would but Jesus wanted but this had to be revealed to Peter who he belonged to and he said Satan hath desired to have you but I have prayed for thee and he said that thy faith fail not because he'd been with Peter long enough to know his testimony would fail his emotions would fail his natural desires would fail but he was going to put something in Peter and he was going to put uh Peter on something amen that would not fail I have prayed for thee Peter that thy faith your Revelation fail not oh brother and that's what held Peter you see even in St Matthew 16 Peter was not converted when he made this statement but it was uh it was a down payment it was it was an acknowledgment amen that there was something there amen that was that was anchored in Peter's heart that only needed to be quickened by the holy spirit amen it's what held Peter amen when when when Judas walked away and forsook the Lord and and U and and and and denied him and sold him into to crucifixion he betrayed him but it see Jud Peter was swayed Peter was affected by the same circumstances Judas was it's not this friends God help me we're not immune we're not it's not that we don't hear the criticism it's not that we don't even face the same mind battles it it's it's not that we aren't affected by the winds but we are anchored in the revelation of who Christ is Peter did not understand why he believed what he believed couldn't even write his own name much less explain or make sense of it or or satisfy others questions but something was holding him when he could not hold himself after Jesus resurrected go tell my disciples and Peter he had he knew that something had been deposited into Peter he knew there was representation on the inside of Peter that was missing from Judas and that's why Judas could betray the Lord and then crucify himself he was he was the son of apostasy is that right right but Peter was built on a rock amen amen he he had something there that was holding him so after Peter came out of the upper room at Pentecost amen then the Holy Spirit had quickened that and made Peter a part of this body and what Jesus had said whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth I'll loosen Heaven Peter came out of that upper room and faced the same criticism and the same adversity that he had just collapsed against only days before I mean they asked the question what meth this they friends they weren't curious they were attacking what meth this and Peter Peter would have waffled only days before Peter would say oh I'm my apologies I don't know what I was thinking I you just don't don't don't pay any attention these this babbling and stuff they're out of order don't worry about you know just I'm sorry yeah that's what Peter would have done only 10 days before but this was a different Peter this was a quickened Son of God who immediately invoked prophecy these men are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that that was spoken by the prophet Joel in other words what you're seeing is prophecy manifested what you're seeing as prophecy lived amen what was spoken in the Old Testament by a prophet is now a Living manifested Word in a body of 120 Believers this is that that was spoken by the prophet Joel and and and the Holy Spirit confirmed the word with signs and wonderings signs and wonderers following I can see right now I'm not going to finish this this morning but that's but but I'm showing you the change amen I'm showing you the Revelation that is prevailing despite Peter's human weaknesses the Revelation that is prevailing the Revelation that is taking Peter's Zeal and Peter's Good Will and Peter's desire and actually quickening that into something that is unmovable unshakable it is steadfast and Peter amen who could hardly live for the cause before now lived and died for the same cause that only days before he had walked away from and even denied association with amen now friends this is what we're built on too amen so my other illustration here oh my is Paul the the Apostle Paul now we know Saul as his as he was formerly known was a great student of the scriptures a great student of the Old Testament a follower of Moses was a a disciple if you will he was a a Pharisee of the Pharisees you see how he gives his his uh his resume there as he address the church but uh you know he was destroying that New Testament Church in the name or under the banner of believing a prophet's message Moses he was a follower of Moses he was a believer of the prophet's message but he was waiting for a coming Prophet that Moses had foretold Moses the Lord thy God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me him shall you hear and Peter had missed that friends how many today are clinging to a prophet's message failing to realize what he introduced they're clinging to the man they're clinging to his statements but they're lacking Revelation revelation will Quicken the message into the person that the message came to make possible or that the message came to unveil amen this message didn't just unveil a prophet to us right this message unveiled a bride this message unveiled a people a bride has emerged Ed as a result of this message it's ezekiel's valley of dry bones can these bones live again prophesy the prophecy called the bones back to their original order and they stood up a living marching Army the message is this is the word of God it's the signal going out to to capture those amen whose ears are tuned he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit Spirit saith and when your tuned ear and your tuned heart catches that signal it quickens you and it brings you into the image of who the message unveiled to us which is the person of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and it transforms you into his image and all that he is where all that you were Fades or is sculpted away so all that is left is Christ amen hallelujah so Paul going along we know how he was doing destroying the church uh committing them to death and all those things but one day he met the person of the word that was the difference he knew the word but he only had a carnal he only had an intellectual understanding and that's good but it's not enough right mechanics are good but you need Dynamics to make the mechanics move it takes Dynamics to unleash the potential that's in the mechanics amen so one day he met the person of the in the form of the pillar of fire Paul knew the word intellectually but he never met him personally in Revelation but on the road to Damascus he met the Lord and he opened his understanding to his present day form or expression I am Jesus who whom thou persecutest I know I've preached this here before but it's worth saying again Paul never met the nail scarred body of Jesus and he never persecuted the nail scarred body of Jesus but this voice said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest showing that Jesus form had changed from a Galilean to 120 believers who had received his very life his very spirit and had been sculpted into the image of Jesus Christ and when Saul persecuted the church he was persecuting the redeemed Body of Christ you see it this morning and but the revelation will prevail the revelation will prevail Saul had a carnal he had an intellectual he had a mental understanding but he was needing revelation he was needing something to Quicken you see friends Revelation doesn't just stimulate your thinking on listen to this it doesn't just stimulate your thinking but it literally brings you into the expressed thought of God it makes you it births you it quickens you into it so that God's very ideas become active through your life that's right and that is the Revelation the Revelation is when it lives itself through you so you're now not just quoting the word you're actually living the word you're expressing the word the word is is is resounding through your life and it is Invincible it is Unstoppable there's nothing the devil can do to defeat it so Paul met Jesus he did meet Jesus I am Jesus that's right whom persecuted but not in an elard body he met him in a redeemed body and then when the Holy Spirit quickened him Saul he gave Saul his ministry as an apostle a prophet to the Gentiles to show the mysteries of God to the church Saul or Paul preached the mysteries in a way that even made Peter Marvel and Peter knew Christ in the flesh right but it wasn't Peter's placing or it wasn't Peter's position to hold the office that Paul held Paul held an office as a prophet amen so a prophet is a Divine interpreter or Divine revealer of the word so then Paul began to expound these Mysteries of the kingdom of God and how the grace of God had enlarged Beyond a natural lineage of Abraham's seed into the faith Seed of Abraham Jesus Christ amen and I love this Revelation breaks boundaries Revelation breaks boundaries it breaks geographical boundaries it breaks ethnical boundaries amen it doesn't create differentiation between black and white and yellow and brown amen but it shows amen it transcends natural Bloodlines it transcends all of those things because what is it doing it's Gathering a body it's Gathering the body of Jesus Christ amen it's a mystical Union Hallelujah it is a mystical body that the word of God is calling out to to bring them back remember Redemption brings back friend brings them back to their original state as sons of and Daughters of God the expressed his expressed attributes his thoughts manifested here on the earth you believe that this morning amen so maybe I will get done maybe I will get done we'll just touch on this and maybe this even we'll just come back and bounce back over it just a little bit I don't know that's the thing friends sometimes a minister is just as mystified by What God Says as you are amen because we come up here with what we think we're going to say and then he starts talking and we're like my that was wonderful amen but I want I want to show you I've shown you Daniel I've shown you Peter I've shown you Paul and now I want to show you our type John the Revelator or St John the Divine amen let's read in the Book of Revelation chapter 5 and um you know I you go places to preach and you think my Lord why would you have me preach that again I've preached that there before but you also find out some people didn't hear it before even if they were there it didn't really just saturate you know or maybe they're like me and they have short-term memory loss and they they laugh at every joke like they're hearing it for the first time or Amen in every sermon like they're hearing it for the first time I don't know but I I just believe this is what God would have you to to to to uh Fellowship around this morning or to be to be uh to be blessed by amen and so I I do believe and I know this is maybe uh it's everyone doesn't believe it but I do brother bradam says that John was a type of the Overcomer in each age we know John did not die a death by martyrdom he lived into his Elder years and so he he talked about how he was banished to the aisle of patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ and so here in Revelation Jesus begins to reveal himself to John as deity am mean as the oness of the godhead and then shows amen he's going to have seven churches on the earth or Seven Ages and each of those ages will have a messenger and and again we we referenced it a little earlyer this is the revelation of Christ's ongoing work his ongoing Revelation his ongoing unveiling in a mystical or a many membered body here in the earth and so John sees these things unfold in Revelations chapters 1 2 and 3 and then in Revelations chapter 4 four he said he looked and the door was opened in heaven and he heard a voice as it were of a trumpet that said come up hither so John is translated or John in a sense is raptured amen again typing the Overcomer all the Overcomers of every age will be raptured in fact they will be raised first and then the living Saints will be changed in a moment and twinkling of an eye to be raptured with them to meet the Lord in the air all right and so here we get over to Revelation chapter 5 and we're going to see something here we're going to see a prevailing Revelation amen and I saw in the right hand of him that was Christ the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man I emphasize no man no man Pardon Me In Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon i' remember it takes the same worthiness to look on it as it does to open it same worthiness to look on it as it does to open it amen but the one who opens it is going to reveal his worthiness in the ones who look on it and see the revelation of it you catch that it's beautiful but John is here and something's about to happen to John that also pertains to us I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to red the book neither to look there on so John in the present um you know if if you yall know what a real the real is or how the old pictures I mean I I know what they talked today about a slide deck hey I remember when slides were in a deck you know and shuttered and Mission reports and all these things and they but so John is watching if if you will like a a a a screenplay or he's watching something trans Inspire in a vision and it it's changing as it goes it is unfolding or it is progressing and his job was to watch amen but he quit watching he became fixated on the fact that no man was worthy he wasn't worthy none of the Angels were worthy none of the 4 and20 Elders amen uh there was every man from Adam Enoch Abraham all the way through we and brandom included no man was worthy and so in in stuck in that realization he began to weep but an elder got his attention he said John quit worried about what's going on around you and watch the vision because the revelation will prevail amen friends I'm going to tell you quit tuning in to the websites come on come on turn off Facebook and social media and get back in the Revelation this is your message this is your Jubilee trumpet the message is yours all of the rest that's going around us it's total Blackness total darkness it's Leo deia I know all that but don't look at that get your eyes on Christ get your eyes on the revealed word of this hour amen because an elder had to grab John and said weep not John behold get your eyes off of your unworthiness your condition what's happening in your church in your family in the message in the government in the White House get your eyes on what has happening in the Supernatural we not John Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah have prevailed the Revelation is prevailing the Revelation is unfolding the Revelation is Conquering every other opposing Force Hallelujah John said and I looked you know I'm just going to stop here for a minute as I know I shouldn't do but I'm going to do it anyway Mary came to the tomb one day and found it empty and called John and Peter and they too saw it was empty right none of them understood why none of them could make any sense of it but John and Peter walked away but the Bible says Mary went in again she just wasn't going to be settled she wasn't going to accept the fact that it was just an empty tomb and that was just the end of it she went back for another look and when she did she saw something that none of the three of them had seen even seconds before she saw an angel who said whom seekest thou Mary he's not here but he's risen she had enough persistence and enough determination not to follow even Peter and John who no doubt went away sucking discouraged amen despondent but she did not allow their amen lack of of Faith stop her she had a faith I left him here I came here to see him I came here to minister to him I came here to give my last act of worship to him now friend when you come to church with that determination you will see him you will meet him something will meet you there to say now I'm acting on your faith because you have that persistence Mary he's not here but he's risen friends it does take that that's right I don't know that God God honors scall wag Faith you know oh well I'm just here I'm just floating along who are you talking about if you don't have a head on collision with the devil every now and then you're probably going the same direction thank God you're facing some opposition thank God the devil is upset at what's going on in this hour amen don't bow down or bend into it amen stand up for what we know is the truth John said and I beheld lo in the midst of the throne and the four Elders the midst of the the Beast of the four edles stood a lamb and he came and took the book I'm going to skip down verse 13 and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all they in them heard I saying blessing and honor power and glory be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever more I know I got to stop I'm going to just have to now but friends John turned to see what was announced as a lamb excuse me a lion the lion he was announced as a lion but when John beheld him he was a lamb because he was John's atonement yes that's right he was John's propitiation he died in John's stead he died on John's behalf but he didn't stay dead he rose for John's justification and John realized for the first time in his life when that lamb prevailed I prevailed amen when that lamb was found worthy I Was Made worthy that lamb is God that lamb is King that lamb is priest and John saw himself in that lamb and realized for the first time in his life what the things he had experienced days weeks months and years before actually meant to him as a person brother B said he saw his name yes that's right that's it he saw his name it became personal he saw his name in the Lamb's Book of Life now this is what is so and the musicians can return this is what is so astounding to me about this because John was a beloved disciple I mean he was kind of in a different category than Peter Luke uh you know the Matthew and the others John was the beloved disciple probably closer to the to the Lord than any of the others leaned on his bosom amen stood there with Mary at the foot of the cross when others the rest the other 10 had abandoned Christ and Judas too and Jesus said behold thy mother woman Behold thy son speaking to John and Mary John was present at the resurrection knew he was a risen savior knew he was a risen Christ he was present on the day of Pentecost when the spirit of God fell and quickened him into the body of Christ as a Believer but until John saw his name in the Lamb's Book of Life he didn't worship him like he did afterwards and friends this this is what has a great meaning to me a as someone who has served God for the better part of my life I'm 45 years old I was raised in the message gave my heart to God at an early age and know that I'm a Spirit-filled Born Again believer amen but even in that there are things that as we go through our Christian Journey will emerge from the word of God to make known to us in a greater way what those things really mean to us it's a prevailing Revelation it's still carving away more of the unbelief or more of our darkened realization bringing us into a greater and more perfect light of the revealed word of the hour till one day it will literally change our body bodies I believe that with all of my heart and I know it's going to Prevail I rest in that this morning so friends keep praying keep believing keep persevering stay in the word of God and God has placed you under a wonderful ministry here to feed you stay in that amen it's going to Prevail amen keep fighting the good fight of Faith amen we'll we'll go eat beans here in just a minute but uh thank God friends when he prevailed we Prevail brother do you know that little song he became me that I might become him he became all that we were to make us all that he is why don't we worship him for a moment and you can stand this morning amen thank you Jesus he became me that I might become him [Music] by my [Music] took my I his love and he I might you by Gra just Worship the Lord now that I might become by gra he became me that I might become him my Gra he took my that I through his love could [Music] take he became me that I might become him th Gra amen I believe we' heard from the Lord this morning you appreciate it let's just give the Lord a hand clap of praise for giving us some good encouragement this morning surely what we need in this hour is revelation you think about as our brother was preaching what this message has given us this message has opened up the Bible where we can see our place in it given us that prevailing Revelation that our brother has been talking about let's just uh we're right here at the top of the hour so we're going to go and and like our brother said eat some beans and come back at at 2 o' this afternoon but let's just let's just sing it again to to as we as we go and we're dismissed go ahead [Music] brother hey
