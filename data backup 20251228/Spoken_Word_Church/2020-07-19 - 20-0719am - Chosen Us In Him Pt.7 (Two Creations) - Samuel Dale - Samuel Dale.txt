roll back like we did when we first were doing and on the sunday services we're going to have the ten and one that way everybody can get back home and doing and everything and you know and make it a little bit better and you won't have to sit around and wait and all because that way it's just it'll just be the ones that are called out to come now that's that's what we've got to get set straight to where it's just the ones that are called to come like we're going to say like eight people and set them you know and you sit in your pews and things but we need to do that and just the ones that their names are called to come to that because that way we will be doing and you won't be having to wait but we're going to start is that okay it'll be today now starting at one o'clock on the sunday service evening evening service we'll be doing that wednesday service will be we'll be officially starting to where it's just the ones that are the names are called the couple of musicians song leader etc etc like we did to start with to try to get it settled in a way that won't be too many people here and we can abide by all of those things and do it okay all right that part they forget because i announced here today and obviously some people weren't listening yeah yeah we tried to make the announcement all right so we need you need to listen yeah if your name's not called don't be in the sanctuary right yeah because that's so we're just trying to do it back like we was so everybody got it if your name is called you come into the services and it'll be rotated some to where we can to do the best we can but if your name's not called don't come to the services because that's we're trying to get everything set where we can do it up here and get it to where we can just have those services and you know and all it's no no problem but we don't want to don't want to uh aggravate all of these things because remember all of these that are coming up now the different ones there's more in and it's more people being affected by it more families and things so let's put it back down to where we were to ground zero to where if you're not name's not called don't come and especially if you're sick don't come and do and even uh the uh the governor is going to try to enforce the fact of wearing a mask that was in yesterday or dave ford's paper that he was going to try to get it to work everybody in georgia will be wearing a mask so that'll that'll be left up to uh doing it and you know if they make it a law then we must abide by the law or else we may be subject to be arrested because see they can come in here at any time right now and just walk in because that's the police department gonna do it all right now after the evening service today we're going to have a baptismal service down at terrence's right brother wants to get baptized so we're going to do that and go down and be there for the service i'm going home as quickly to get through with the service to you know be with my wife and all and try to take care of her because she's having problems with the breathing and so just keep her in your prayers that the lord would touch her okay what else have we got uh

vacation so that will put it to work and fall back to her be my i'll be waiting myself for a while do we get things straightened out and get all of these through of how many you know days you can abide by it and do all you can do okay all right so everybody understand let's need anything else uh okay everybody got it now we start this afternoon one o'clock so that way you don't have to hang around and do a whole lot of things and if you want to push it a little bit start at 15 to one or do something you know if you want to come a little bit early and get started a little earlier then whatever you want to do to where you you can do it and and all that that make it uh available for everybody okay all right we're going to ephesians 1 and then we're going to revelations 3 14. yeah if you need to uh your tithing or anything offerings or just give it to terrance and whatever you do this you can handle that it was handled for there for a few weeks and everything run okay people mailing it and doing whatever they're doing so that'll that'll take care of it okay father we thank you for this day and we ask you now that you would just be with us as we try to minister your word lord and under these awful situations of life but yet still we're able to exist and be able to communicate and to bring forth the word and it can go out on the internet and travel to many different nations and things lord in it all to where that the people can hear if they want to and then they'll be available to our people to where they can click on and we can handle it if there's anything lord we need anymore we'll try our best to do it and get everything running in your order and your ways because we're not afraid of this thing we're just respecting the government the the things the people and doing everything to do just the best we can do and just leave it into your hands father we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen all right we've been reading this on ephesians and probably keep on for a little bit anyway so we'll just go to verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places where in christ according as he had chosen us in him all right when see we're not getting back there nailing it down yet we're wanting it to linger inward i don't know where to be right way but i want to bring it slowly and gradually progressing into the point of getting back before the foundation of the world all right so i hope you understand that's what we're doing because that's where we're having to go to to find out where the choosing was done and where was it done before the foundation of the world that we would we should be holding without blind before him in love okay now let's go over to revelation 3 14 because that's the day we're here the message of this day and unto the angel of the church of the lady of siam's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now if you don't understand what we're doing ask somebody to get everything into order to where we can operate and uh do because that's the point all right now we have been dealing for quite a while on predestination talking about it and seeing how that god does his predestinating his ordaining his for ordaining how that he does his work and he does not uh do it in the basis of doing anything wrong by it or doing in saying choosing one and not choosing the other he does it by our own by our acceptance if we we don't accept him as our savior then he will not take care of the problem that we have but we are put into that order all right and we've been dealing with that about for knowledge because how does god predestinate he predestinates by his foreknowledge now that way you could as long as you i hope you've followed it if you haven't asked me questions about it whatever to do because we're trying to get it to a basis of understanding because i'm a firm believer in foreknowledge now by foreknowledge i can take then the message now i'm not saying smart adequately or anything i'm saying it and the best i can do because 50 years studying on something you ought to know a little bit about it okay and we've been studying the message and and comparing it and bringing it down and i see no contradictions in things i sleep slip with the tongues now we're going to deal with something today that we're going to talk about two creations and you know to try to get an understanding because the reason to do it you say uh what's the first creation all right if you've read christ's mystery god reveal you'll automatically say angels right because that's the word he uses there but if you are listening to masterpiece et cetera you may find something else if you're going to questions and answers you will go back far enough to find out god was his first creation that's according to the way you're reading and see that's what what does it and people misunderstand when you say you know you say what's first creation i say god says first grace no it wasn't the angels in his first creation well now we're going to get into that to try to understand because uh if you get don't get nothing get this there is a natural creation and a spiritual creation amen so we're going to talk about two creations all right a natural creation and a spiritual creation god created natural what which would be tangible or uh uh you know things like that and he created a spiritual people in things all right see that way when you read the christ of history and you're reading and he says the first is angels you say well well well that brother said it was was was a spiritual here he's he's angels well it'll it'll come out to the right place you know if we'll just settle down and listen to what the prophet is trying to bring in the scriptures is trying to bring unto us to see it because see we've got for the part that we've talked about the uh foreknowledge that god foreknew all things the scripture says all right and he predestinates by his foreknowledge that way he doesn't pick and choose so now let's don't get it when we get back into the mind of god and back on up into whatever boy he he chose me you know well see we get into all of that we get our thoughts in involved and and then we miss the whole thing you say yeah but uh have you accepted him no i haven't i didn't need to accept him i always was eternal now what kind of a doctrine do you have you have the doctrine of the quote basics of the people of this message that they believe you always was eternal you always had eternal life you come with eternal life you don't need to be saved you say well where's those people have do i have to play the tape for you i mean do i have to go with you and sit down in the pubic side of you and say are you listening did you hear what he said he said i see well i'm just trying to make it as silly as i can to where you'll think about it you ought to listen listen to what i say i want you to listen to what i think amen we were listening pretty good there the other day we caught wade two times on and changing the days of the week didn't we he wound up take making the first day of the week being monday done it twice in one sermon well he was and everybody laughs at me because i goof up you got your day you're coming to it so just hang on all right no problem we're just looking at it and saying okay let's get it let's get everything try you know to the right place all right now so then foreknowledge goes back and you remember we emphasized that part how far does foreknowledge go back as far as it can be as a matter of fact it can go back so far until it can come all the way back around and make the circle and connect together and go back to eternity right yes and see that way then we're not having to worry about it we're setting into the basis of understanding but by foreknowledge that way you will not predetermine something thereby then you'll you'll go with the prophet where he said god didn't desire anybody to be lost he wanted everybody to be saved all right but said they won't be why because they won't make the choice right so it's left up to me in you not god's problem now here was the lies we got to that the foreknowledge of god then goes back into the mind and i tried to emphasize this for 50 years i've been on doing this god's mind in his mind he knows everything that would ever happen will happen has happened all of that god in his mind knows that well see then everybody is in god's mind i emphasize that a lot because see i've heard a lot of people say that why if i was in the mind of god i'll be there well that's no more than a presbyterian baptist predestination if i was preordained i'll be there if i wouldn't i won't well see that's no different to to do it that way all right but see being in his mind everybody's in his mind he thought of everybody okay thinking of everybody and what everybody would do then it's determined by that all right now this is the statement i've always made it may not you may not agree with it but i love it see then i don't want to be just a thought in god's mind amen that's right amen amen i want to be a part of the one that done the thinking amen that's right i want to be a part of the one that done if i'm part of god and i can only be part of god by the new birth to give me eternal life making me a child of god and by doing that then i become a part of god and being a part of god i'm a part of the one that's doing the thinking all right that's as simple as i can make it i've always tried to to simplify things and not confuse people see see then i want to be a part of god's mind because then i can read that that we read over and over chosen us in him amen all right then it's just not saying chosen us it's chosen us in him it's got to be in him doing the choosing part of it all right he chose us amen that's where we've been over and over god chose us we know that but see then we had to choose the fact of it of the point of accepting eternal life and choosing that to where we would choose to we had to accept him as our savior amen all right and see then that gets away because if i always was eternal what i need a savior for that's right see then you realize that what you're getting back to is you're getting back to the mind of god right before the foundation of the world and then you're not picking and choosing you're not trying to do those things you're trying to just be what he says about us he chose us see then we have to accept the choice we have to agree with his choice okay now listen to what i'm getting to the point now see that way i can think about the point not of something that it makes me some great something to think oh i was chosen before the world well god knew before the world judas says carrick would do what he'd done but you know what he had to let him come and do it the bible says jesus christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation world but if he hadn't died two thousand years ago for our sins he would still be lost things has to come from a re to from a thought to a reality so that's what we're talking i'm going to be talking about see two creations one is a spiritual creation the other is a literal or or whatever words you want to use for a material uh thing that it's real all right so then that way we can keep it in a straight line and like i said then we won't be confused then we won't read christ a mystery well brother dale just don't understand god's first creation was angels well you know what that's right because that was the first part of the physical situation of coming to this way so i can you know see i can talk to you about like that because that's what i think but yet the first creation of god was god himself we'll read that in a minute and get started well god created god when did god create who is god what no it simply means just why i read revelation 3 14. the beginning of the creation of god did god create jesus and jesus created everything that's what your your trinity runs too no he's the author or beginner a coming forth in two what does a birth mean what does a birth mean a birth means a coming forth into the a baby is burst out of his mother's womb into reality into a world all right he's coming forth into okay amen and see that's what you do with the new birth the new birth is you're coming forth into amen right it's not something you say well this is the word that you don't get the idea when we read these things that the prophet is so massively confused i'm saying this ahead of time where you won't be confused when you get there you'd be surprised now i'm just as honest as it can be you'd be surprised how much you could do try it sometime talk to somebody and just say what was god's first creation but it was angels he said no no no yeah i got where the prophet said okay but if you got where he says other things too have you got to the genesis 1 26 man where god made man in his own image but get the point now let's start to the to what we're talking about see then for knowledge goes just as far backward as it does forward it's no problem because it's reality but it's in the mind of god all right and he can't change his mind about his word all right so we covered that where the king asked for time and god gave it to it did he change his mind no by his foreknowledge he knew all before the foundational world he was going to give that man 15 years he knew that right so when he sent the prophet to him to tell him he's going to die that's right he wound up got better live 15 years but he died that's right that's sensible lisa it's right the word is right god don't change his mind but we look at things and think it looks like it's changed no god don't change his mind amen his thoughts are eternal all right now let's just get started on something to where we can today and then we'll can try to continue our thought go ahead with number one brothers and we'll now if we get any problems back there remember we're kind of sure you know anderson's the only one on the pole today so he's gonna have to be running this one going that's what's gonna and i ain't going back i tell him how to do it because i don't know how to do it okay but look what he says he's coming down from the book the message called job and all right let's go down now adam in the garden of eden when he first sinned amen now what god had a way of redemption for him right quick just as soon as he sinned god made a way of redemption amen amen now are you thinking about it god had a way of redemption for him you realize this may not mean unto you but it does to me in the point do you realize when adam and eve sinned do you realize one split second without an atonement or some way for that to be covered they'd have died right there sure that's right come on you tell me that's not true i'll stand here the rest of the day and tell you it is true if there was not something to cover the sin when adams and eve sinned they would have died immediately because sin cannot stand in the presence of god you agree i don't mean the message i'm preaching i just make a point that's just common sense all right see then there had to be something already in existence to cover that sin because watch what he said it's just just as soon as he sinned god made a way now he didn't listen he didn't see him run around through the garden and sing and do it and honoring three weeks later finally god caught up with him that's not the point the point is one thing before man sinned redemption was already in in view that's why the prophet said read it on that line god always had a plan of redemption and that's been through the blood once ever since the very beginning and dawn of time perceived in the mind of god before the world ever come into existence a plan of redemption amen i try to illustrate that for you to think as quick as adam and eve sinned had there not been something taken place they would have died because sin can't stand in the presence of god god already knew what he was going to do he already knew the prophet said that adam and eve would sin well why did he make them then because there was attributes and things that had to be brought into view all right see then their god was already made the atonement we look at the atonement as when he killed the animals and put the skin on we said well that was when he made the atonement he's already in his mind before the world ever begun jesus christ had done died in the mind of god before the world ever begun you agree that's what the bible says so then if he'd already died the atonement was already made that don't make you you think about some how wonderful our savior or god is that he never waited till we went out and done all these wrongs and then finally one day he said well i better get down there and do something about this that won't work one split second in the presence of god sin would cause that person to be annihilated amen but see god in his mind had done made the plan amen god in his mind knew exactly what he would do he made a plan he made the plan all he was doing was waiting on us to make the mistakes right right he'd made the plan and had to plan god always notice god always had a plan of redemption so before we ever sin god already had the plan made amen amen he knew we would sin so he'd already planned it before the foundation was that's why the bible said that he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world amen and that was in his mind it was not a physical reality of the crucifixion that was done like 2 000 years ago right there in jerusalem when he paid the price right but what if he had never paid the price physically amen what would we know what and the mind of god i've always was you can't tell me i know it you can't tell people you forget it you can't tell people you can talk all day long it used to be one brother he'd he'd come up question me about something and i spent hours trying to express it to him and talk to him you know and showing him the prophet and when he gets through you know what he said well why'd he say it it was always about something brother branham is saying and he said well why'd he say it well there's no way to express anything to him so you just finally get to the point that you just say forget it all right but now listen god's always so what in his mind in his foreknowledge he already paid the price so adam and eve was covered by the blood then physically finally it came into reality that he paid the price with the blood that come into reality it had to because if not it would have just been in the mind same thing with calvary it finally come into reality that god would come down in human flesh and live and give his life for you and i you know that's not it just in his mind you you want to get everything in his mind i want things into reality because i want it to be something to work that i believe my religion has a tangibility that's just the way i believe it now i believe my salvation is real it's eternal it's real all right and that way then i don't have to worry about it to see whether it'll work or not because it already worked he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and there's where the choosing was at now got this with the prophet there's where your choosing came into being your choosing came into being when he in his mind saw what he was going to do and he chose us in him well this is why i love about it if he was chosen i don't have to worry about it that's right i know he was i know he was chosen don't you amen but the main thing is to know whether or not that i know whether i'm chosen or not well i believe it was you can't tell me i wasn't saved why are you arguing about it ain't nobody trying to convince you neither way i mean but just remember it's got to be brought into reality see something real all right now think about it god in his mind he could look backwards forward doesn't make no difference because he could he was the infinite he was the eternal all right it was in his mind were we were we spirits then they asked the prophet he said no he said we were nothing he said was just in his mind all right he said figuratively which to me means figuratively means he's expressing it to the basis that it's coming from a spiritual to a natural it has to be in a movement form to word that it comes into reality and that's what we want it's a reality all right that's why i said now all right so which comes first now did the spiritual creation come first or did the literal creation come first then well i don't know well i'm just asking you a simple question that's why i love the message the message has the answer it may be confusing to us in mass understanding i guess but still it's true okay go ahead to number two and let's see this is taken from christ as a mystery god reveal and look what he says now god's secret here i go again i've read enough to understand on christ the mystery brother branham covers the coming of the lord the seventh seal the thunders all in christ's mystery now this is why i love it because he's he didn't say if you don't understand the seals go back to the seals or go back to daniel 70 weeks or go back to this he said if you don't understand to see if go back to christ in history because it's a complete plan of redemption amen all right the seals the seals the complete plan of redemption right okay it's the simple point of understanding salvation and what it's about so look what he says he had before the god secret mystery he had before the world begun back in the back part of god's mind now that's really going back there in it front part is what you think with that's why the bible says that you can have the mark of the beast in your forehead not something stamped up there not 666 wrote out no that's not it it's in your thinking it's your eye your conception and your thinking is in the front part of your brain all right science tells you that go read a little bit see then it can go back to where you're going into the points of goes back into the back part in other words you're going back as far as you can go so that's what he's saying before the foundation world back in the back part of god's mind there was something he was trying and was going to achieve now listen so is that true what it said he already had a plan of redemption it already was there look what he says he had a motive in doing it what was his motive in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star atom molecule or anything he was god now listen to the terminologies and don't get confused see he said he was god before the foundational world he was god now watch him but he exactly wasn't god at that time now see don't get confused about the point just listen to what he's saying because god is an object of worship see there was nothing back here to worship him so you didn't call him god you said well what'd you call him the best thing you can come up with is self-existing that's the best terminology they can elohim or el ella elohim you ever noticed brother runner would always put those together l ella elohim he'll always lay him into order to coming out to the word self-existing all right so there was a time god dwelt alone he was self-existing all right now if that's true then there was nothing back there with him so where's the trinity come from how many gods you got i mean if it's true that he's self-existing then it's not just one i don't care what your concept or thoughts is there's just one because there's no way to put two or three in self-existence who existed before who existed and who created who no just listen because god is an object to western and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind amen now the back part he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love in him was to be father now watch that we don't get it today watch that point in him was to be son and him was to be a savior and him was to be a healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god before the world were there at in his mind amen in his thoughts that's right his concept or whatever you want to call it he already knew exactly how everything was going to turn out satan didn't pull nothing over on god in the garden satan just helped him work out his plan but now this is right if i don't get to it i'll get back to it sunday you need to consider one thing there's a lot more to our thoughts of the word father than to just now we're going to read where the prophet said that in adam and eve he could be father he could be god by creating angels see we want to make you say well what are the attributes healer saga there was a lot of attributes that could be displayed you realize he could have been a father of adam and eve he was because he created them and you know that was before sin entered the picture sin didn't make him a father see we get all of these thoughts in our mind and we try to instead of listening and thinking considering what the prophet is saying and then one of these days you'll realize god did send a prophet amen [Applause] realize that that's a wonderful thing to think of what are you doing because you're going to get in a minute where i'm going to read to you where brother runs says the first creation was god himself now finds you a theologian to figure that out for you find me a doctor of divinity and let's see if he can talk on those terms but a simple little prophet could talk it's just just like he's saying there there was a time that he wasn't god well what do you mean he's been god the whole time you're not listening right god is an object of worship there had to be something come to worship him that's what brought his attribute into display sure he always was god he always wasn't self-existent he always was jesus he always was that was his name always been his name all of those things let's see to think about it but see we talk about we say well what was the attributes savior healer etc we don't even think about father father was his first attribute he did not he did not have to let sin enter the picture to be a father amen he did not have to let sin under the picture to be god amen right so we're backing up further than just i hope you're listening because see most of what i've been trying to do to back you up to work that you'll think about foreknowledge but now see we're back in past four knowledge well maybe i shouldn't say that one but you think about it we've already taken one step back past four knowledge if you're listening adam and eve made him father he didn't sin didn't make him father sin made him a savior sin made him a healer you know et cetera et cetera okay now listen they were in so my opinion now look at him so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels well see we got first thing he made now all right natural and spiritual angels are not uh fleshly beings we know that we realize that part they're not tangible fleshly beings but they're closer than just a spiritual part right because they're closer into reality so he's just explaining it first he made angels and they worshipped him now he's god in another message you'll see that he'll say he created in his image and bring forth that's what i'm trying to get you to keep from being confused and maybe finally i'm sorry i'm as honest as i can be about it sometimes i think i do confuse people by trying to make it so simple make it so simple until i'm just going to play like this until really when the prophet explains something they ain't no other way of explaining it amen my ideas and your ideas ain't no good on trying to explain something when your prophet is the one that's bringing to the view right we can have our concepts and thoughts but be careful right just don't let them run aground right what did he say so my opinion the first thing he made was angels and then they worshipped him and that made him god and he started from there as in previous messages i've tried to explain it break it down and now then when angels begin to worship him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there wasn't no sun there was no moon there was no star no nothing then he was god as he asked job where was you when i laid the foundation of the world see when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shouted for joy where were you it was way back before the earth because listen in god's great mind he had a purpose he had a hidden mystery now he had a purpose in other words to let himself be expressed he didn't just want children running all over the place and them to have nothing to understand he wanted to express himself okay that's almighty god he loves us amen amen glory brother's going this afternoon let's go through and get baptized because he told me he said i believe this is a place where i need to go to church i need in other words get his life straight line up go get baptized and start from there start serving god to do the best you can from there on all right why because something is talking to him right he may not even understand my point of saying but something has caused him to turn his way and come this away all right hallelujah see that's a reality okay let's go ahead in his attributes that's his thoughts he had his thoughts we're still in christ a mystery i ask you to read it and you'll hear him in there talking about his thoughts his attributes his good and that was what it was that great hidden mystery that god had a plan and a purpose to let himself be displayed he wanted his children to come into being his offspring you know okay maybe not using the word children but it's offspring he wanted them to come into being he had them thoughts about him and he wanted it to come into reality he had it in his mind before the world ever begun what he was going to do and what was going to take place you didn't accidentally get here to church today that's right come on right down he says to the present hour that we're living now i love that one i like for things to be present tense you know amen i mean me and danny we can sit down and we can talk about there's a river up there in tennessee that man you're talking about a beautiful river i mean oh lord it's way underwater from here to the back of the church and it's just beautiful water running down and this one and you can just then we talk about it we've been there but we hadn't been there i couldn't talk to him about it huh but we've been there that's reality that's something becoming real see i want my salvation that way amen amen i want it to you that way that you got something real you're not just some concept or somebody's idea this is not this brother branham stouts amen come on brother that's right i hope you're understanding that amen if he was a prophet it's the thoughts of god to come forth amen us to understand because we never understood it come on church i mean i sat back there in the baptist church and i always did study the bible i always read and studied it and i believed it but i always had that wondering how did i get here what am i doing here i met god when i was 11 years old you couldn't tell me there was no god forget it but see i didn't know how to get to that god and i kept my travels through time traveling up going to church and doing and listening but see one day i heard a prophet he started talking about god in a way that nobody had ever talked like that no man spake like this man and he started talking about it and i started looking i said well lord i found somebody that knows what happened when i was 11 years old because i saw him but to try to explain it you can't explain it because you try to explain it to people oh you're who you think you are you think you're prophesied no i'll just stay like it is it happened that's right you you know you you do it all right but now listen his thoughts there was nothing with him but just his thoughts back before the world self-existing just god alone but he had thoughts now we've gone down into it maybe in a little further you know what he was lonely you know when he created man he made adam in the garden you know when adam was by himself you know he knew exactly how adam fell he knew adam was lonely because he'd been lonely he wanted somebody to fellowship with but he couldn't fellowship with the devil's children so let's don't get over into those former thoughts or whatever you know oh bless god i always was eternal i don't need salvation well if you don't need it you ain't gonna get it is there any plainer than that if you don't need it you ain't gonna get it cause you ain't gonna search for it all right let's see if you want it it's there for you amen thoughts god had a purpose and a hidden mystery he wanted to display himself to his offspring now he didn't come to save the devil's children no but you can't discount the devil's children and say they're nothing and you know everybody oh that's a serpent seed over you ever really run into them you know oh that brother there he's serpent seed he don't believe like i believe he's serpent seed yeah like i've always told you i don't mind saying that i don't care if you run my genealogy all the way back and put me standing right there as a direct descendant from cain that don't bother me none whatsoever because it's a spiritual happening first that's a physical happening right amen okay his thoughts but he gets in his mind what he's going to do what about god sitting down with his thoughts thinking things over now come on listen he says i can go this way but if i go that way then that would be me picking and choosing and i can't do that if i go this way i can do see no i can't do that his thoughts is not that he sat down like me and you and thought about it and tomorrow he thought about something better next day he thought about something better and next day he thought about something better we finally get around to doing what we got together he didn't do that his thoughts is eternal he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways his thoughts were eternal so what he thought of right that's why we can say tonight if we i mean today if we have the baptism of the holy ghost we have eternal life amen the life that was in god now dwells in his people we're an offspring of god amen thoughts of his mind he knew exactly what it would take to contact you brother see i can talk to people when i know that they're coming towards salvation because i can remember what i did because see i sought god oh i done everything i sought god especially after meeting him back there when i got into 18 years of age and things like that i've told you about it and you don't agree with it i'm sure you think i'm crazy but i'd go out in the world of sin and do wrong and come back home and just feel dirty this lord i don't because i knew there was something somewhere that was a whole lot more powerful than i was someone was a whole lot greater than i was all i wanted was somebody to take my hand what did brother run said about job said he wanted somebody to be able to take his hand and take him to god that's all i wanted i used to talk to them old deacons and things in the church there and i was 23 years old as a deacon and i remember sitting there one day and they were talking about you know this and i said well you know they're saying deacons because in the baptist church now you might not think this is true but go ahead check with somebody the baptist church the deacons run the show and we had the full authority to run the show because that's what we was and we decided what to do it didn't matter what the preacher decided he was voted out the door if he didn't like what we'd done he went out the door i was there sitting with them and they was explaining that to us one day that the deacons this is an explanation the deacons in other words donny there's the pastor the preacher you know and he gets off the baptist doctrine see we get together he's off the doctrine okay let's go and we go to him and we say uh you're off the doctrine so you leave or straighten up your doctrine you know get this right he had a choice of straightening it up but if he didn't he went out the door because we were the deacons you know what i told him one day i know i'm sarcastic i know sometimes i love it and sometimes i hate it but it's all right i told him one day i said you know what i've been reading the bible a long time and i said the only thing i found in the bible that the deacon was supposed to do was wait on tables is that true in the book of acts come on go he's taking care of the widows and orphans and everything you had a little little but you really were just waiting on table well of course they didn't like that but that's all right but you see church i've always wanted to see god know him in reality and when this prophet started talking about him i knew right there i knew another thing that i've explained to you over and over as a deacon at 23 years of age joined the church when i was about 18. foster went through my salvation you know that thing repentance and to do it you know what when i heard this prophet talking about god i knew immediately i did not have the baptism of the holy ghost he was talking about nobody explained that to me nobody took me aside and showed me where i knew right there that i didn't have what he's talking about i didn't get all upset and all frustrated i just said well lord there's only one thing to do i'll just start searching for you somewhere down the road you'll meet me well he did yes i come into this message and all in two years in the message before i ever claimed the baptism of the holy ghost brother motor he'd say brother dale i know there's something he said but i know you're not one of these that's trying to find tongues or this that or the other but said there's some reason that you can't get this right i said you're exactly right i don't know what the reason is he said well the thing i suggest you do is one time he said you stop trying to figure out anything and accept what the word says that's right amen that you just read the word and accept what it says and i walked right into the baptism with the holy ghost my wife received at the same time right side by side amen two years everybody tell me well you've got the holy ghost you come into the message and that's what most people think i come into the message i got the holy ghost i know i got the holy ghost because i come into the message will you are you going to tell me that judas wasn't in the message that's right now don't talk to me about things satan that don't work but listen god dwelt alone with his thoughts but he knew in his thoughts what he wanted to do are you listening in his mind what he's going to do he knew exactly what it would take to contact each one of us he knew exactly how to contact you you may have sought god right okay that's fine but just remember he's seeking you the goodness of god the bible said lead us us to repentance okay listen but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts listen that's his desires now watch it now it's a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word then the word a thought when it's expressed is a word a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's god's attributes then it becomes a thought and then a word amen you thinking satan pulled anything over on god no he helped him amen he helped him doing his plan okay listen he gets in his mind let's see i know i ain't going to be able to get very far but because i want one thought to get to you spiritual creation comes before physical i'll do this then i'll back up on these notes sunday and bring it back we don't have a physical creation than a spiritual one that's not that's incorrect you've got to have a spiritual creation and then a physical creation right all right and then as we do let's think of something how great a prophet could express something go to number nine brother i'm sorry it'll take you a minute to pick it up go up to number nine which is questions and answers on genesis all right if god created man in his own image in his own likeness what kind of a man did he create we know this we've read it right a spirit man that's genesis 1 26 and 27 let us make man in our image and our likeness and let them have dominion et cetera a spiritual man a theophany for words which is a body and thing now listen a spirit man now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation what i said you you get confused but you back up and listen after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now for the question the brother had asked you give him dominion of the cattle now see you look up here and you look at it read it made all the creation you're following genesis correct natural creation you create a world he created a test he created that he finally come down created animals and things like that and then it looks like he flops over and creates but find me a day that he created man he said well there's the sabbath okay we're going along with you but the scripture don't say that it's the sixth day the sixth day was the creation of man see because genesis 1 26 and 27 is not a natural man that's a spiritual man natural man was created in genesis 2 right genesis 2 read your bible he created a natural man a physical man an atom then he took a rib and created eve that's genesis 2. so what come first did he create the world first now he created angels for one time he created many things but the one thing is listen to what he says god give dominion to the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man not the physical man the spirit man but in his making up there he made a man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the beast to feel just like the holy spirit leads the believer today see he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creation of god physical man but he made him a spirit man first amen right listen the first creation was god himself man that's i'd like for a theologian to explain that one thing then out of god came to logos which was the son of god amen out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and words with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the logos came forth to man amen but think about what he's saying god's first creation was himself now i got the quotes here where brother brown said that people think that god created jesus and jesus created everything else he said that's incorrect he said that would be god creating god he said that's not true okay we'll read to that later but think about it what does it mean of god's first creation with himself was he non-existent come into existence did he none exist and he created himself no that's why it says that in genesis i mean in revelation to this day what is it revelation 3 14 the beginning of the creation of god that's right not that god created god that's incorrect that's no thoughts but the fact that he stepped forth now there's a quote in here we'll get to in a minute where he says out of the logos came the son he said he gave birth to his son well go back then and think about it here's god in the beginning self-existing nothing existing with him totally all self-existing and then all at once something happens not another person gets involved but he does what he said he wanted to do he wanted to express himself so his children could understand him so what did he do he just condescended amen is that simple yeah now not that he left god and went down to god another no no don't get all that involved and you're thinking just think about what i'm saying and listen he was in existence all alone and he knew that he couldn't be comprehended like that he knew we couldn't do that that's the words of the prophet he said the eternal god can't be comprehended by the natural mind so what did he do he just condescended descended if you want to use the word just be careful too much descendant but he just stepped forth into another form which was the word his thoughts had been spoken let there be they were material to him but there was his coming down his condescended he just stepped down into another form and became the word amen now we're in john 1. in the beginning was the word the word is with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that goes in from jesus into a natural creation right he goes from a spiritual creation man to a natural physical creation as to him and well that's exactly what god is doing here he's just condescending he's just stepping down condescending toward humanity and there's no humanity there because they ain't even molecule ain't nothing in his mind he knows exactly what he's doing and he just takes another step carnal i know but he's the spirit man which is first which is first spirit man spirit man begins to condescend towards a natural reality okay as he begins to descend he just takes another step and he goes into another form is that colossians who in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but took upon himself the form of an of humanity he just changed his form that's what he did he he didn't have to jump down condescend no he just started moving our way we ain't getting started we ain't even come into being yet right he starts moving and as he does in his mind he just looks and he says if i make man this away he'll fall if i make him predetermined then there's no way for him to fall but i can't bring forth my attributes he's got attributes his savior healer no but don't forget the one thing called we ought to back up to it don't forget one thing when adam and eve come into existence he didn't have to do anything he was a father that was his family he was a father right there he didn't have to let sin enter the picture to be a father he was a father as quick as adam and eve come into existence in his mind he knew that what he would have to do right now listen he knew in the garden that if they'd sin he would have to make up a situation right through his blood that's right he knew he was going to have to do that he never come into this haphazardly not knowing or under no he knew exactly what he was going to do and that's what i said then when sin entered the picture it already was covered adam and eve was already covered by the blood atonement that was not physical but spiritual amen his first creation was himself he just stepped forth into now what did he do with us he just started creating not creating like making something out of something that didn't exist he just started bringing us forth that's right that's what he's still doing he's still bringing us forth going from a spiritual creation to a natural or in other words into reality spiritual he could make man in his own image come on he made man his own image and a spiritual being he didn't make man in his own image he made the man in the image of animal the physical man the two the genesis ii man is in the image of the animal something that was real but he made something spiritual first he condescended himself now what did let's see how is it he didn't send a son to die he came himself we think he sent a son see we're still trinitarian no that almighty god that we're talking about just kept condescending kept condescending then he come to the earth and he knew he needed an earth he just spoke the word he knew he needed this he needed that he just spoke the word he just kept speaking kept bringing it forth and then he brought it all into being then he just started from there in the natural of bringing it all the way down to where we're at now it's it's our father trying to reveal himself to us and he says let us make man who's he talking to not to another person he's thinking within himself i can give you quotes if you want him for whatever you want but the brother said he was talking to the to the animals how to make the man then he's saying he's talking to the angels then he says he's talking to himself that's what i've asked the question years ago there was a doctrine called son of man everybody was dealing with son of man son of man and i came in here and one day and i asked a simple question and maybe i shouldn't i saw all right i was not trying to be a smart cat sticker and i asked a simple question i said why are you dealing with son of man when you don't even know what the son of god is the son of god was god in human flesh do you realize that that son of god was the logos the theophany the word amen was the son read your bible get in schofield and read a little footnotes for him you'll find he knew that much so theologians knew that that first form of god was the logos was called the son of god he's real he just started coming this away he just started stepping down a notch as we'd call it or revealing himself to mankind come on musicians real quick think on these things we won't quit on this we'll just keep going but just remember in his mind in his mind what a wonderful thought of the mind of god that he could think of me and you his children isn't that something his offspring we are the children of god amen right there's a lot to the son of man remember the prophet said the only way he could be the father he wanted to be was to be the son of man we'll get to that one because i've been through that he became the son of man to be the father that he wanted to be the father he wanted to be was not satisfactory with adam and eve standing there because he knew that they'd fall yet he loved them and cherished them and protected them you see they come into full fution or reality when that god died on calvary to release that life to come back in me and you as to be the children he wanted us to be adam and eve never had to go through a new birth they were created the way they were but you and i have to go through a new birth to become the children the children of god to thank his thoughts but stan what we got brother [Music] [Applause] [Music] he invited us to come behind that veil and receive christ [Music] [Applause] we have heard [Music] that was the wonderful way they said it peace i give you my peace [Applause] [Music] we have his [Music] anybody have a need just come and let's [Music] believe heart to god and go today and get baptized got to follow him amen okay now let's just say one thing in this way a simple prayer you just pray and we'll pray with you but you just say god just forgive me just forgive me for what i've been in all things and you accept me because i accept you as my savior and just make that's that's simple and just say thank you lord for saving me and then just walk into him and let him take care of the rest we'll do the water baptism we do the other but the main thing is you just say father i'm sorry [Music] i'm sorry for the life that i've lived and what i've done and you just say that to him right now and get it to letting him know that you are on him depending upon him to do that and now let's pray father in the name of jesus christ we bring our brother before thee today he comes with a broken heart lord your goodness has drawn him to repentance you accept his repentance that he's repenting to you and saying father forgive me and come now and cleanse me and take away my sins let all be well and i'll be fully done and let me walk lord in you because that's what we desire just follow after him we pray we believe you and we thank you then we'll take him home to the water baptism we'll go on as much as we can and do everything we can but the main thing is accepting you father saying thank you thank you father in jesus name amen amen god bless you anybody else simply saying father i'm sorry help me forgive me
