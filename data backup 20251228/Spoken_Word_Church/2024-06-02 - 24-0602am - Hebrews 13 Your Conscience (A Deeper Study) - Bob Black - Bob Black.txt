sure good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and with our precious friends and loved ones could have everybody here this morning let me share my screen I'm I just want to if they could pull that up um we were we are about to do a lot of traveling so I just wanted to go through the Sunday school schedule for the next month and this is not sealed in stone but if we have to move anything

we'll be up in Ohio preaching for brother Isaac and them so um get brother Ryan to do that again as well um to exercise the gift um so if all is well nothing will change if we need to we'll we'll adapt as needed um we've been uh we wrapped up uh the book of Hebrews last Sunday um and Paul was just kind of talking about conscience there in that last chapter um but before we get on to another topic let's just circle back and just talk talk about conscience some more and uh maybe maybe nail it down a little bit further get a little bit deeper let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful for your word in this hour Lord God to guide us and give us something Lord to know how we should act and how we should do Lord God how we should conduct ourselves I thank you God for that conscience that still Small Voice in our heart that gives us that little pride in which direction we should go and how to how to how to guide Our Lives Lord we ask Lord that you'll just be with the services this morning Lord and that you'll be with Brother Richard preparing back there Lord God and be with our hearts Lord Jesus to prepare us for what you have in store for us today Lord bless us now we pray in your name now one illustration I'm just going to read this little scripture and and we're just kind of going to go do a little study and First Peter chapter 2:6 we know that this is a scripture we're familiar with wherefore also is contained in the scripture behold iay and Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded and you know one place brother R use as an example of your conscience that it's like a little a four corner cornered stone that you know it's in your heart and it's it it'll rub and PR away and if you don't listen to it it will just kind of smooth out in there until it's not having any effect anymore that you just kind of push it away but God has given us uh I I think something in there to kind of poke at us when we're when we're doing wrong and George Washington I put this quote in there real good that he said labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience that when when when you feel that little proud of something that you you need to listen to it now you know we might ask the question why why what's so important to listen to the con to your conscience what's so important to listen to it it as long as I get what I want as long as I achieve my goals and this those kind of things and what does it matter uh so let's just kind of Labor that point a little bit it's a sign listening to your conscience is a sign of genuine faith in 1 Timothy 1:5 it says now the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart and have a good conscience and of faith unfeigned and we well as we study this out and go through the scriptures you'll find out that your conscience listening to your conscience actually actually has something to do with your testimony and maybe I maybe I should have uh named this the title of this sermon this morning uh it's it's about the journey not not about the goal the the details are so much in it's about the journey uh and and your conscience is about your journey how do you react to situations and how you react to things in life and how you as you're going toward your goal how you how how you approach things are you willing to steal and light lie and cheat are you willing to to uh kick somebody to the curve to achieve your goal or are you willing to to do it in a way that matches what God's word says it allows for confidence before before God when you don't have anything in your heart that condemns you then you can you can bring your petition before God boldly and you can come at that's what 1 John 3:21 says behold if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward God and I can have confidence when I'm bringing my prayer before God because there's nothing between me and my savior nothing between me I've made it all right if there's it is anything then lay it before God and say God forgive me forgive me of what I've done and and and oh you then then you can really have confidence to approach things in the right way and it's necessary for Effective service 1 Timothy 1:19 says holding Faith holding your faith and a good conscience I I'm doing everything right everything that I know how to do right I'm doing everything according to what God's word says if God's word says I need to be baptized and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to do that if God says I need to be born again I'm going to struggle and and what you go through the process read my Bible and pray and and and and uh until something happens until God's word becomes a reality to me I I've done everything that I know how to do have a good conscience what which some having put away concerning Faith have made shipwreck and we know that's the case people preach for 20 30 years and holding out down in their heart that they don't even believe the message we've seen examples of that where you they're not preaching from a good conscience they don't even believe with what they're preaching and how can you have have faith and effective service and really lead people in the way that they should go if you don't have a good conscience it's a witness to others when you have a good conscience and you know that you've done everything right and you know you've done everything by the book following the rules then it's a witness to others in 1 Peter 3:16 Says having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ and when you have a good conscience and you're walking according to the word and you're you're uh you got something against your brother you asked them to forgive you and you come with humility and your whole life is about trying to trying to do things right and and and and and those kind of things then it becomes it becomes a witness to others and now you can kind of see how it builds up to where your conscience is related to your testimony because if you have a good conscience and you're a witness to others and others can see your life and the way that you're concerned about doing things the right way then it becomes a witness to others and it's a matter of obedience and pleasing God in Hebrews 13:18 says pray for us for We Trust we have a good conscience and all things willing to live honestly now that's the scripture that we finished in Hebrews 13 last uh Sunday that Paul is is talking about how that we should pray pray for the the leaders of the church and so forth because that that we want to have we want to do things in the right way and conscience what it means is the English translation of that Greek word I I don't even I have have a clue how to pronounce that U that that looks like a puzzle to work out but it what means a a word in classical Greek referred to knowledge now now look out conscience has these two meanings knowledge you know what you're supposed to do but then it's got something else your self judgment you know what you're supposed to do but then you look back and you're judging yourself did I do the right thing how how am I going to move forward knowledge especially the knowledge derived from reflection on one's past deeds and so again this is about your journey your journey is the important thing where how how you go about things how you go about life that that uh promotion you want to get at work how are you going to do it how how you going how how are you going to go about the thing the appraisal of these Deeds determine whether the conscience is good or bad Hebrews 9:14 says how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and Hebrews 1022 says let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water now there ought think that God can take your your perverted conscience that you were born with that you don't even know how to do things right and everything that can that can wash it and cleanse it and change it so that you start living by a different standard not the world standard where the goalpost matters more but a different standard where the journey matters more and what I mean by the journey matters more is because when the Bible says Thou shalt not lie that matters more than where you're getting to that matters more than that cookie you're trying to eat as a little kid that when the Bible says Thou shalt not steal that matters more than than getting that cookie you're it's the journey the journey matters more than the goalpost and conscience if if we really dive down into those two me meanings it means that moral knowledge the inner voice that t helps you to distinguish between right and wrong and your self-judgment conscience also involves the act of self-reflection and self-evaluation based on our understanding of right and wrong and then we got the the illustration that brother Randon would use he'd say consci your conscience is like a stoplight when you see the stoplight you know you're not supposed to go but if you run the stoplight then you can look back I I shouldn't have done that and it's that that that condemnation there and Hebrews 8:10 says for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord now there's a stoplight I'll put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people he'll actually put his laws in Your Heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you know what you're supposed to do right 1 Corinthians 4:4 says for I know nothing by myself yet him yet am I not hereby Justified but he that judges me is the Lord and 1 Corinthians 10:23 says all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient but thing all things are lawful for me but all things edify not so there's some things in life that we've got Liberty as a Christian but there's boundaries about the thing the choices and the things that we can make that as we as we do things we realize I I shouldn't have done that that's your conscience speaking back what what is your conscience is your journey matters and there's these two views of of of of of uh of conscience that using big words here but really what it is there's just two views one is that the journey matters someone with a deontological focused conscience might feel a strong sense of Duty to follow certain moral Ru rules like always telling the truth now this is the I believe the Bible Way the Bible says always tell the truth don't ever steal don't lie just stay with what the Bible says and the other one is a consequentialist view which says I as long as I get my way that's the main thing it's focused on the outcome conscience in the Old Testament in Genesis 42:21 says Jose Brothers acknowledge their guilt for PR treating him saying we are verily guilty concerning our brother in 1st Samuel 245 you know there's two places where David Came Upon Saul and he had a chance to kill him and one place he took the water jug and he took the um U something else from him and he and he ran away and in the other place he had a chance to cut off a piece of his robe and it said now you think after all the things that Saul had done to David Saul had uh uh put him on the front lines you going to marry my daughter I'm going to put you on the front lines and and I'm going to try to kill you you got to bring me back aund uh proof that you killed 100 Philistines and and uh Saul Saul was just terrible to David but there Saul there in that little cave David had a chance to kill Saul but he withh withheld but but he did cut off a little bit of his robe but even that even that poked him in in his conscience he was like it says here in first Samuel 24:5 his heart smoted him indicating a sense of guilt and moral or moral discomfort now you read even you you heard even in that sermon that that brother R was just preaching brother R was saying don't don't do you got you got to watch your life that you don't do things that make you regret like he was he that little thing he did when he was a little kid uh against somebody against one of his his uh Little Buddies there you got to watch to to make sure that you have a pure conscience so that you have confidence with God so that your petition will be answered so that you have boldness with him in Proverbs 20:27 it says the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord searching all the inward parts of the belly in Romans 14:22 says hast thou Faith have it to thy self before God happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth and he's qu talking about eating meat offered to idols and so forth he said he that douth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin so in other words listen to your conscience if your conscience is telling you that it's like we were using an example if your conscience is telling you that's wrong to put up a Christmas tree you don't put up a Christmas tree if your conscience is telling you that it's it's wrong to do something you stay as far away from that as you can because to do otherwise you're you're not listening to your heart and Daniel chapter 3 just another example you think about uh how it's the journey the journey that that really is the main thing and there they had an opportunity they were the whole other Nation the whole nation was we going to bow down to the prophet to the image of the Prophet but they because were listening to their conscience refused to bow down they said if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up and they you know you're when you really feel strongly about something when when when something comes up before you you're like I I'm I'm standing with what I believe that's how these three Hebrew children were they they didn't know what was going to happen next but they were if I get thrown into the fire no no matter what happens I'm standing right with what I believe because I cannot violate my conscience I cannot go against it it's and there there it becomes it's your testimony because your conscience begins that that still Small Voice in your heart begins to guide you through your life to know how to do and how to act and how to how where to go where to go to church where how how to behave yourself at work it's guiding every aspect of your life that why Cliff Bible dictionary said conscience is an innate characteristic found universally in men that becomes active when one reaches the age of accountability when you can make a choice in Deuteronomy 1 139 it says the little ones that you said will be taken captive your children who do not yet know good from bad they will enter the land in Isaiah 7:16 before before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right speaking of speaking of the Messiah before he gets old enough to know what's right and wrong the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste talking about Syria and Judah so another words you you come to a place where you know what's wrong and right because God has given us a conscience to lead and guide us and to direct our paths you think about Daniel when they they made that declaration nobody can pray you can't make any prep uh any any any prayer any petition to anybody outside of the king but Daniel was he felt so strongly in his heart I cannot violate my conscience I'm not going to listen to man I I'm I'm staying right with what I believe I'm not deviating to the right or to the left and he threw open his windows and he and he got down on his knees and three times a day he began to pray because he was bound by his conscience and his conscience actually guided him into his testimony his testimony was I'm listening to God and Martin Luther we used that example last time that Martin Luther standing there in front of the Catholic church and he said I am Bound by the scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the word of God I cannot and will not recant anything since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience in 1st Samuel 26 there's the other example of David coming into Saul uh that him and abishai abashi was his is uh standing there counseling him won't you go ahead and just kill Saul but David's response was my conscience won't let me now you think about that that that David God had told David that he was going to be king but he's like not like this and David said furthermore as the Lord liveth the Lord shall Smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perish the Lord forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed but I pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his bolster and the cruise of water and let us go so there your conscience becomes your testimony right in 1 Peter 2:19-20 it says for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully now if you got a real strong conscience it doesn't matter what befalls you in life doesn't matter what somebody does to you at work or maybe even at church sometimes but you're you're held captive to that that you cannot go against conscience if the word of God says that you can't lie or steal or you know act UNT or all the other requirements all the other standards that are laid out in the word then you're held captive to that and you cannot go against it for what glory is it if when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God and Hebrews 9:9 says which was a figure for the time present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience that's what the word of God the effect that the word of God has on the believer's conscience their heart to make them be in subjection to the word and there was nothing under the law that could do that that could perfect you as free from guilt that could take away your guilt there now there's a there's a pure conscience a conscience that is free from guilt you know that Christ Jesus has taken all your guilt and shame on the cross and died and his blood has cleansed you because you believed in in what he did and you can come and and boldly take the communion because you're you're free from guilt and there's nothing between you and your savior and nothing between you and your brother and you're free there's a pure conscience our conscience was originally perverted in John 16:2 it says they shall put you out of the synagogues ye the time cometh that whosoever kth you will think that he doeth God's service now there's a perverted conscience somebody that thinks they're doing right but they're doing wrong what a that's a strange thing isn't it in Acts 26:9 even Paul himself said I thought with myself that I ought to do do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth he was thinking that way he needed his conscience to be cleaned up and and purged in Titus 1:15 says unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled but it can be clean and Hebrews 9:14 says how much more shall the blood of Christ be through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and in 1 John 1:9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us cleanse us from all unrighteousness oh you ever felt that way when you when you get down and you just lay all your problems and all the things you've done wrong that day before the Lord and and you come up you feel you're cleaned out scoured out washed out and Psalm 199 says where with us shall a young man cleanse his way how you going to clean your way how can you have a clean conscience by taking heed there too according to Thy word and you take hold to God's word and that will purify your conscience we read all the scriptures last time where Jesus said sanctify them by Thy word Thy word is truth you want your conscience cleaned up Let the word get a hold of your life and get a hold of your heart it'll clean you up so you think about things differently so you begin to be bound like Martin Luther to the word that you begin to be bound like like David was to the word where you maybe you want to do something different but you're bound to the word and the word's got your life and it's what's guiding you in Matthew 5 232 24 it says therefore if thou bring thy gift to The Altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee leave there thy gift before the altar so if you're bringing something before to God but you got something against your brother go make sure that your conscience is clear first and go thy way first be reconciled to the brother to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift and Acts 24:16 says herein do I exercise myself to have all always a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men now that's quite a statement isn't it that Paul always was working to have was trying to have a clear conscience toward God and toward men to not have any impediments with his anything that would prevent him from having full confidence in the calling of God in his life and what he was here to do and and and to be able to lay anything before God and have God respond to him because he wanted to have full confidence and Romans 12:2 says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so cultivate a pure conscience and we'll be closing here on on on this in Acts chap 24:16 if the musicians want to go ahead and come forward it says herein do I exercise myself we just read that to have always a conscience vo of offense and Romans 9:1 says I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that your conscience is bearing witness and 2 Corinthians 1:12 says for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in Simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly abundantly to you word and there's a scripture that says the testimony of our conscience that your conscience a clear conscience becomes a witness it becomes a witness to others and a witness to you that you can look back on and say well my conscience is clear and it becomes a testimony to you God bless you Saints [Applause]
