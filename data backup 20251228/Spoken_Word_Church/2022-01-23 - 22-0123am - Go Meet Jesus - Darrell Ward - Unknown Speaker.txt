till the storms have passed over who do i run to when the winds of sorrow there threaten refuge in those times of tribulation when my soul needs consolation i go to the wrong i go to the rock of my

the lord here and the testimony and the singing so we'll appreciate it come over here next time i get the microphone um i just want to give a testimony um and two years ago memorial day on memorial day of what when 2000 right so memorial day of 2020 i got here memorial day and the lord opened up a way for me to get out of the sin i was living in and um i thought that wasn't going to happen because i was i was deep gone i was so far gone i didn't think god was gonna forgive me anymore i thought that was it because i knew better and you know in the word it says when god tells you not to sin anymore or worse the thing will come upon you he means that and a worship thing did come up on me the last situation i was in and i just thought it that was it i was looking up testimonies from different people to see if god actually forgave them when they went so far but he did open up a way and i just want to um i thought i was a i was a vessel of dishonor i was really a vessel of dishonor and i was thinking when i was deep in my sin that lord i don't want to die being a vessel of dishonor because you're either going to be a vessel of honor or dishonor when you leave this earth and so i was like god please help me i do not want to die with that title on my name on my soul in my life a vessel of dishonor so when he got me out of everything it took a minute it took a minute for the fear and all these different things that was on me to actually leave the situation i was in and i felt this was the right time to share this because it's a lot of young people here and you guys are going to go through things hopefully you don't go through some things i went through but i've been through a lot but um the last situation i was in i was involved with a a very handsome guy very nice guy but behind the scene of that was satan so satan will give you things that will be very enticing sin is always not going to be ugly satan knows what you like but god also gives god also give permission to satan to try you to test you so you can go through things as well so he sent this this handsome man my way and it was everything i wanted in the flesh it was everything i wanted in the flesh i mean i had the house the the gifts the flattering the cars everything looked good on the outside everything looked so good if you was outside looking in you would want what i thought i had okay but the bottom line was it was a trap it was a trap with my soul it was also not only a trap it was a a trap in a way that you i couldn't get out unless god took me out of that in the midst of that we also have a baby my baby is still there and i'm fighting going through custody battle right now so um i was praying when i was in the midst it was together for 13 years on and off so it was a real i was very wrapped up in it very wrapped up in it um but there was red flags all over the place it was all type of red flags i knew i wasn't living right i knew it but i couldn't get out of it for him he didn't really know it because he's he's living in the world he's when you don't have god in your soul or whatever just like adam and eve adam knew when he when he gave in to eve eve was deceived so in this situation i knew i wasn't deceive i knew what i was doing but i was miserable i was so miserable that oh lord you know you got to get me out of this because i can't get out of it on my own i couldn't anyway he made a way long story short he made a way out um i'm going to hurry up i just want to share some of the things that i've been going through that god delivered me from um okay so this was a situation um i work i do cleaning so i got to go to customers houses okay so it's this guy that i work for not anymore um but he was coming in with a lot of flattery okay a lot of things i've dealt with a lot of things in my life so this this man was coming in with a lot of flattery this just happened probably a week ago uh he came in with a lot of flattery giving me stuff very nice um i went to his baptism he got baptized and everything i wasn't attracted to him at all not like that because i know what god just got me out of so i wasn't looking for that at all but he was really nice he invited me to his baptism he got baptized in the name of jesus christ he wasn't a message believer or anything like that but i went just to support that he was getting better i was like wow that's good so anyway um he's a single guy but he was always really really nice and really really offering me things and and saying little things like wow you look good in my house and um you you know just saying little things you know and sometimes you kind of hear it but you're not paying attention to it so anyway the lord kind of started opening my eyes and making me aware that you know be careful this is the same guy told you that was calling me beautiful and stuff and god change him put it on his heart and stop calling me that and using my name this is the same guy so um the other day you know he was saying little stuff you know you look you look really good in my house you know and um just different little things so i started just to kind of feel a little bit uncomfortable so what i did i left and um you know before i left he was like you know i'll take you know if you ever want to go out just let me know now i already corrected him before about asking me out i'm not there for that i'm here to do a service and that's it so this time when he asked me before i left um he was like you know if you ever want to go out again just let me know so i got in my car i got home and i started thinking about it like man i just told this guy i'm not interested in going out i'm not you know i'm gonna have to just let him know a little bit harder now because i was kind of nice about it at first um one thing i want to add is be careful of flattery be careful because what it'll do it'll kind of break you down when they're really really nice it'll kind of break you down where you almost don't want to be mean to them or you don't want to be you don't want to stand up because they're so nice you know so be careful of flattery and when they're kind of giving giving you too much you know giving you too much attention or you know unnecessary attention and stuff like that i think that's a that's a trap be careful unless that's your husband and you courting you know it's different it's a different different level um so anyway i caught him up i'm going to hurry up sorry i called him up and um i left him a message this time and i said i'm look i told you before i won't be asking you out i don't need you to ask me out i am not interested i don't even date customers because it's sloppy and just some things i said to them and i said i mentioned this to you before and i feel disrespected and i won't be coming back if you can't respect where i'm coming from all right so anyway he sent me another message back and apologizing oh i just want to be friends and you know i won't do that anymore so anyway uh what happened with that is the lord just put it on my heart like you know don't even go back at all because this will happen again because this this guy's living in darkness to them it's kind of crazy that you're even coming off like that because he's just a man you know but the spirit behind that they don't understand why are you being like that i'm being nice to you i'm offering you stuff well you know what's wrong with you in other words you're kind of crazy to them you know when you come off like that in a way so um i was like no this is dangerous and the stuff i just came out of i know to be way more careful um to not just give into that kind of flattery um i'm no match for satan and i don't know what he got up the sleeve but i know enough to know from my experience to be careful of that um so that was that was that situation that happened one more thing is i just want to add while you guys are on your walk or whatever you're going to get tested sometimes in different ways when you're not expecting it it's going to come out the blue sometimes you're going to get tested for example it was a situation i was i was at a grocery store and i picked up some items or whatever and um it was a young guy there the cashier the cash you know the cashier and uh he was wringing out my items and he wasn't sure how much a certain thing cost so he was just kind of like go ahead with it don't worry about it i'm like oh here we go i got to correct this now here we go okay so um i said no no no i want i want you to ring that up he said well i'm trying to hook you up i said well are you the manager he was like well no i said well i don't i don't want you to hook me hook me up to what what you want to hook me up to some so i'm not getting hooked up in those saving traps so um i said no no just bring it up for what it is and um he's like i'm just trying to hook you up i said like i understand you know young i understand i said when before god got ahold of my life i would have loved your hook up i want to be ex you when you're coming back to work again so i can get some more hooks up you know so but this time when god starts strengthening you you start being more aware of little traps and stuff you know don't hook me up to none of your devices nope so um he was like wow okay um it's kind of like god put the light in you and you start putting you giving them the light i don't know what it should be is you should do it this way because you can lose your job and everything you know so anyway god start giving you that strength you need him he'll give you that strength you need to keep going to be bold to be honest with people instead of flattery and okay yeah sure yeah you don't want to be that way that that thing will trap you up so um you want to be able to be bold and honest with people they appreciate that more than just being a yes yes yes person you know they appreciate your honesty it'll save them you know so it was like a light bulb came on in his head he was like wow okay nobody ever confronted me i mean okay so anyway i gave him five dollars i'm gonna pay you to do the right thing next time like for real like yeah for real so um um that was that was one incident the last incident is this all these things just happened not too long ago so i want to share it so i don't forget i was at my job i work at a hotel part-time as well uh sometimes they have snacks there and you can get them but i get them and i pay for them if i don't have the money right away i bring the money in the next day so one of my co-workers um she was there the next day and i gave her a couple dollars for some of the things i i got the day before she was like um yeah i got a paper that you know you don't have to pay for this stuff i said well is it okay for us to just take it or she said well everybody else doing it and i do it so i was like well i don't want to be like everybody else you know and um you right when you correct somebody you can feel that odd feeling like okay all of a sudden you separate from what everybody else is doing so you got to feel those little odd funny feelings like oh i'm different i'm set apart i feel weird all of a sudden but no embrace that because it's actually building you up to become more and more stronger for the lord you want to stand up you know what i'm saying it's every the whole world is full of darkness so whenever you stand out be prepared to feel funny when you're correct and what's wrong okay all right that's it [Applause] that's why it's so important to look for that character of christ in people because character only comes through victory and victory of battles and overcoming amen if the brother could pull up the song in the back before um how great is their god they could pull it up in the back on the screen we'll sing this before our brother comes this morning hallelujah he's great there's none like him a man he works in every facet of our life and testimony was just you know kids there were just singing this little light of mine sister rebecca that's that's a wonderful testimony that you're being a witness and i encourage each of us wherever you are don't be afraid to stand up for what god's doing in your life this world needs that testimony people need to see god in you and it's those little day-to-day things that makes that impression on out here in the world where they say something's real in there she's not like the rest of the world i see something different and eventually they'll see christ amen let the lord do that amen how great is our god sing with me how great is our god and always see how great how great is god oh how great is our god sing with me how great is our god and all we'll

out your power and love as we sing holy holy [Music] holy holy holy [Music] hallelujah you know it would be if we had a desire to see him but there was no way to do that how miserable we would be but the evidence that we can see him is because we have that desire amen if you have a desire to get closer to god that's the evidence that you can get closer to god or the desire would never be there what a wonderful thing it is to be a christian amen what a wonderful thing it is to have light in the midst of darkness amen to know where we come from and to know where we're going what a privilege we are this morning to be able to gather here in his name the name above all names amen we just counted an honor to be with you we certainly enjoyed speaking with the young people yesterday and i bring you greetings from my pastor brother donnie reagan from up home he wanted to make sure tell everyone he said hello and so we just counted an honor to be here and we trust something to be said to help you and encourage you along with the lord for truly that's that's that's why we come is just to put our shoulder to the wheel with brother samuel and brother wade and to press on for the glory of the lord and whatever you have need of this morning i i want you to look to him and believe for he can do all things he does all things well amen what a faithful high priest we have this morning if you have your bibles turn with us to the book of saint john chapter 11 we'll start reading at verse 17 and it's just a simple little fault because really that's the only kind i can bring but we trust it to be a blessing to you and that the lord will just speak to our hearts today john chapter 11 verse 17. certainly enjoy the song service the testimony and the this little light of mine that's wonderful just to see the young people i remember when i was a little fella down home i got to sing in that song and forgot how it went and i said i'm going to let my light shine all over johnson city amen so praise the lord things what you remember sometimes you know john chapter 11 verse 17 do you love him amen the bible says this then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already now bethany was now unto jerusalem about 15 followings off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming she went out and met him but mary set still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee and jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this amen let us bow our heads i want to speak to you this morning on a simple thought of go meet jesus heavenly father thy word is true we commit this congregation and ourselves into your hands for your glory in jesus name god bless you saying she may be seated this morning i want to call your attention back to verse 20. amen i thought he said just lay your coat in the floor he said no put it on the chair amen i lost some of my hearing when i was in the military i was with the airborne artillery up at fort bragg and fired the big guns and so i lost a little bit of my hearing and the the va gave me some hearing aids i guess i need to wear them amen i want to call your attention back to verse 20 where it says this then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming she went out and met him but mary sat still in the house now brother sister i i believe this morning that these two sisters represents everyone that is in this building this morning for the way i see it we can do one or two things we can do like martha when she heard that jesus was come she got up and went to meet him or we can be like mary and set still in the house you see you're going to do one or the other jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name i will be in their midst now many people come to church for many different reasons but i want you to know that when he comes he comes in the power of his resurrection he sends healing in the form of his word he comes to pour out the holy ghost he comes to fulfill every promise that he made to the believer he comes to bring deliverance he comes to bring healing he comes to bring forgiveness he comes to bring joy unspeakable and full of glory when jesus comes the temptus power is broken and when he comes we can either get up and go meet him or we can sit still in the house but i say to you this morning let's not sit still he's here his word says he's here then let us get up and possess what belongs to us this is our day this is our hour this is our time to shine in the light amen the promises of god's word for today they are for the believer they belong to us as caleb said give me my mountain amen give me what god has given me it belongs to me amen like that sister that was in the communist country that wasn't allowed to have church and so a baker he was a believer also and so they he would bake a certain kind of bread and the believers knew to ask for this bread and so the sister went down to the bakery and asked for the bread and she broke the bread and inside the open of the bread was the revelation of where the meeting was to take place and on the way to the meeting she was met by a communist soldier and he stuck his rifle with a bayonet right up under her chin he said where are you going she said my brother died and i'm going for the reading of the wheel she goes to church and they sing songs and they rejoice somebody repents somebody gets the holy ghost somebody got saved someone spoke in tongues and a prophecy and interpretation went forth they had foot washers and they had communion and oh my i like services like that don't you and so on the way home she was singing the holy ghost is mine joyous mind healing his mind all mine and she ran into the same soldier and he said what did your brother leave you she said oh he left me everything. every redemptive blessing belongs to the believer then i say to you this morning let's not let the devil rob us of none of them amen i say let's get up and go meet jesus you see jesus is the answer to every problem you have you say i'm sick well then get up and let's go meet jesus i'm discouraged and get up and go meet him amen you see all mary knew that death had come to their house sorrow and fear had all come to their house and it's sad to say but that's all that some people ever see is darkness and sadness and depression and negativity nothing ever works out right and nobody cares for me that's all some people ever see but mark the caller revelation hallelujah mark the caller revelation that caused her to get up and go meet jesus you see in our bible study this morning death had struck the home of mary and martha and no doubt they thought how could this happen to us jesus is our friend he slept in our spare room he's he's set at our table we're message believers we've left everything to follow him how could this sorrow come to us how could the doctor's report be so bad we're his people we should never have trials we should never have trouble every day should just be blue skies and smooth sailing every day should just be a picnic those are nice thoughts i like a good picnic but you see the problem of it is jesus never promised us that come on somebody he never said we wouldn't cry he never said we wouldn't have sorrow he never said we wouldn't suffer he never said we wouldn't get sick he never said there wouldn't be pandemics he never promised smooth sailing he never said there wouldn't be storms oh hallelujah but he did say i will never leave you nor would i forsake you then no matter what i face today i do not face it alone amen hallelujah sometimes god allows things to come into our lives like our sister was testified of god will allow things to come into our lives so that he come to us and show us just how great he is amen you may have a great cancer you may have a great trial you may have a great problem i'm not denying that i'm just here to tell you this morning you're god's greater amen i'm not listen to me i'm not taking light of your suffering we have real tears we have real pain i know what it is when your back hurts so bad the fire shooting out the end of your toes and you have to pray to even get out of the car to pump gas because you can't hardly get one leg in front of the other because your back is hurting so bad real tears real pain real problems oh hallelujah but a real god who's bigger than all my problems who's bigger than all my fears come on somebody our god is bigger than anything their enemy could ever put upon us amen hallelujah mary and martha in this great time of sorrow in this great time of need it was their darkest hour think of it mary and martha left alone their mother was gone their father was gone and now lazarus was gone and just them two girls left alone in the world their brother was goldie he was the breadwinner he was their protection he was the one who was going to make sure the rent was paid he was the one they leaned on he was the one that promised mom and daddy he'd take care of him and now he's gone and there they sat in sackcloth and black veils weeping and mourning over their brother it was the darkest hour but i want you to know that's always when jesus shows up amen that's just the way he does it brother sister this may be the darkest hour you've ever faced in your life and if it is i've got good news for you this morning get ready for your visitation hallelujah it was the darkest hour that the woman with the blunted she would ever seen 12 years of bleeding and it would not stop and the doctor said they couldn't help her and the prophet said she sold her farm but in that dark hour when there was no essential oil there was no herb that could help her then jesus came along it was the darkest hour jairus had ever saw his little girl laying dead oh my and the mourners and the whalers in his house but then jesus came along the darkest hour the disciples ever saw when ten thousand demons swore they would drown them that night it was their darkest hour that jesus come walking on the water oh my and it was the darkest hour that martha and mary had ever seen it was that dark hour that martha got word that jesus had come you see martha realized the answer to her sorrow the answer to her darkness the answer to her fear was jesus amen i know you think it's cdc but it ain't she realized god had a way provided and jesus was the answer for everything she was going through he's the answer then he's the answer now and if there is a tomorrow he will be the answer tomorrow jesus is the answer amen when she got word that he had come she got up and went to meet him he reminds me of blind bartimaeus sitting there on the rocks of the walls of jericho and he wore a beggar's robe that identified him as a blind beggar and set it in the sun tried to get a few pennies he got to thinking about his life you know sometimes i think it's good if we just slow down and remember remember what god has done for you remember how he's answered your prayers remember that night he come to you and delivered you from alcohol or delivered you from drugs well hallelujah sitting there in the sun he got to remember it he thought i used to have some doves what happened to those doves oh i remember i remember my little girl got sick i remember and the doctor said she was going to die and i went behind the house and i lifted up my eyes to get over i said father my little girl's sick i need her lord i see the world through her us i hear a bird sing and she tells me what it looks like i smell the fragrance of a flower and she describes it to me she tells me the shapes that the clouds make and the blueness of the sky don't take her from me lord she's my little girl if you let her live i'll give you my dubs and he took she got well and he went he said i gave those doves wasn't long after that and my wife got sick perhaps it was a pandemic perhaps she got what the girl had i we really don't know but so he goes out behind the house again and he lifts up his eyes he said father my little queen he's sick don't take her from me lord i need her she puts my plate exactly the same place every time so i can find it my cup is always at the same place she washes my clothes she cooks for me i need her lord if you let her live i'll give you my lamb you know the prophet you know the story the prophet told us in those days the lamb was a sea and high animal like they used the dog today and so he goes down to the temple and on the way down there he runs it to the priest he said where you going bartimaeus he said i'm going to the temple to give god my lamb he said you can't do that you need that lampshade here take this money go buy you a lamb he said but i never promised god a lamb i promised god this lamb and if i keep my promise to god he will provide a lamb for my eyes and sitting there on the rocks he thought what made me say that oh thank god for inspiration that sometimes strikes us and we will say something we don't even realize that we're saying what made me say that that god would provide a lamb from my eyes and sitting there thinking on the ways of this lamb he begins to hear a noise and all the commotion and being blind he said would someone please tell me what's going on some kind soul said it's jesus of nazareth the lamb of god he's come and when blind bartimaeus heard that the lamb the lamb the provided way he began to cry out to jesus jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and someone said hey hold your peace we don't like none of that shouting around here if we like what's being said we just nod our head and if it's really good we just raise a hand hey there's something every time you hey there's something every time you make a move towards god there's always somebody there to stop you young people someone said hey hold your peace but the bible said he cried the louder and jesus stood still you see it wasn't his voice that stopped jesus there's more than 150 yards away and all the commotion he would have never heard his voice it wasn't blind bartimaeus's voice that stopped jesus it was his faith that stopped jesus and if his faith can stop jesus your faith can stop him this morning [Music] jesus stood still and they said be of good cheer he stopped and he's calling for you now blonde barnabas is left with this decision that every one of you is left with this morning he's left with this decision either sit still on this rock or get up and go meet jesus he was left with the decision jesus had stopped and was calling for him now he has to make the next move so i'm waiting on god maybe he's waiting on you so the bible says in verse 50 that he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus he got up and went to meet jesus casting off that old blind beggar's robe i'm not going to need it anymore notice when did he cast off that blood see in those days that the beggars wore a different robe that identified what they were a paralytic or a blindness or or leprosy or whatever they wore a robe that identified their disease so when you saw the robe you knew this man was blind by the robe that he wore but notice before he ever got to jesus he threw off the blind beggar's robe because he said i don't need it no more i've got a lamb i've got a lamb provided for my husband can you see what he saw he was blind as blind can be and yet he sees more than 99 of people sitting on church views he saw a lamb provided amen and i say to you this morning can you rise up and step towards the promised word for your day cast off the fear cast off the asthma cast off the high blood pressure cast off the back trouble i don't need an arthritis robe i don't need a depression roll i don't need a glaucoma robe hallelujah i've got a love provided for everything god's provided way for us the prophet said that was god's provided way was to go meet jesus that's right you got sorrow in your home go meet jesus got sickness in your home go meet jesus got covered in your home he didn't say that i did go meet jesus got heartache in your home go meet jesus hallelujah if you've got a need for anything go meet jesus go meet him he's got all the remedy and then the prophet says he's got all the remedy everything there is and then he says he ain't got the remedy he's got the cure he's got the cure for anything we have need of this morning then if that's true why are so many people sick why are so many people depressed why are so many people so beaten down they can't even say amen in church is the word wrong or are we wrong are we living beneath our privilege have we let our problems get bigger than our god well glory you see if god provided a way for us to go meet jesus then there has to be a way for us to do that god ain't no indian giver god ain't going to tell you something that he can't produce he would have never told us to get up and go meet jesus through his prophet if there wasn't a way for us to do that so if god anointed his prophet to tell us if you've got a need for anything go meet jesus then there has to be a way for us to do that in this day that we're living in you see in order to meet him you got to know where he's at if i told you meet me tomorrow and i'll buy you the biggest steak in lula georgia what's the next thing you're going to say we're at that is if you want a steak you see what i'm saying so if we've been given instructions to go meet him you've got to know where he's at you see he said in a little while the world will see me no more amen but you but you who's he talking to you but you shall see me how lord how will i see you you see if there's a big biblical question there's got to be a biblical answer and jesus said the world won't see you no more but you shall not could be not hope so not maybe but you shall see me how how will i see you then he answers it for i'll be with you even where in your for i'll be with you even in you yes then where's he at he's right here with us hell oh god open our eyes and let's see he's here it's not somewhere someday some happy day no that day is today amen you say we want to see jesus how many wants to see him then you can only see him in the manifestation of his word that is promised in the hour you're living in you see if that door opened back there and somebody come up this aisle dragging across bleeding everywhere a crown of thorns on his head women would scream men would faint and that wouldn't even be jesus i'm sorry he never promised to come like that in this hour he's already done that come on somebody i'm going to preach for an hour whether you're with me or not that would not be jesus and yet people would rely more on that than the reality of the word that's promised for this hour you've got to see the word for your day if you see the word for your day manifested you have seen jesus for he is the word amen hallelujah hallelujah jesus said i'm the vine you're the branches therefore the only way god could speak this morning would be through my lips your lips my hands your hands my life your life i'm the vine you are the branch yes he doesn't bear fruit anymore he just purges his church and the church bears fruit then what kind of fruit would it bear the life that was in him would be in his church making him the same yesterday today and forever it'll bear the same kind of life that he bore when he was here amen hallelujah hallelujah amen the vine cannot bear the fruit it's the branch that bears the fruit as it's energized from the vine and christ is our energy your lips is his lips when you're energized your hands is his hands when you're energized from the life of the vine your hands it's his hands i was in nicaragua a few years ago place how far i don't know if brother lewis louise was there with us that year or not right at the end of the service it was going to have a prayer line that night but there was just so many people i thought we'd be there for hours and so i said we'll just have one mass prayer for everybody in the building so i told the people just lay hands on one another and the pulpit was the kind a little bit i was elevated off the floor and so just as i told the person lay hands on another we'll just have one mass prayer and just as i started to bow my head to pray i looked back at about halfway back on the end was a sister and something spoke to my heart and said go lay your hands on her so i jumped off the platform and started walking back and when i hadn't started praying people would started peeking you know to see why i hadn't started praying and when i got back to where the sister was she had her hand up in the air i just reached up and grabbed a hold of her hand and we began to pray and when the service was over the sister said can i speak to you and it's through danny torres he he helps me when i go to their interprets for me so brother danny was interpreted and i said yes ma'am and she said tonight when you've told the people to lay hands on one another to pray she said nobody laid hands on me and she said i thought what's wrong with me that nobody would want to pray for me and she said i began to cry i said lord why won't nobody lay their hand on me and she said i no sooner said that then a voice spoke and said i'll lay my hand on you and she said that voice no sooner spoke then you put your hand in my hand now am i jesus of course not but it was my hand he used to touch her and it's your hand he'll use to touch your husband to touch your wife to touch your brother to touch your sister to touch your daughter come on somebody your hand is his head when you're energized your lips is head lips when you're energized from the life of the vine you see his ministry his ministry is in his bride which is his body we are his body on the earth today question answers the seals the bride will be flesh and bone of christ bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit then where is he he's right here with us now oh brother i want to see jesus just look beside you you know we've been wearing these masks i hate them don't you buddy i hate them i wore them in surgery for 18 years i worked in surgery at the va hospital wore their mask every never thought i'd have to work to go the gas station so i was somewhere preaching and i stopped to get some gas went in to get me some chips that's why i look the way i do cokes and chips and i was standing there by the potato chip rack and this guy comes walking in with a mask and he must have been a local because when he walked in the cashier looked over she said why john you've changed your mask and when she said that just something struck my how about shouted past the coca-cola because i thought that's right that's right remember the prophet of god talked about the play where that one guy had three different parts and he would go back chase and change his costume and come out it was the same guy all the time he just changed his costume and don't you see the god that dwelled behind the mask of jesus that saint god amen is dwelling behind the mask of the bride today he's just changed his mask oh hallelujah hallelujah he's right beside you he's in your mother he's in your father he's in your brother he's in your sister amen let's go back to mary just for a few minutes jesus speaking to martha in 11 23 jesus said unto her martha thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection in the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this martha do you believe this and she said unto him yay lord that's what we need to say ye lord i believe i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world verse 28 when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly i never noticed that until the other day when i was studying this and they just jumped out she goes to the house and calls mary secretly you see the message of him being here wasn't to everyone that was in the house it was only for the one that was chosen to receive it my god that ought to make you say amen the message well why is this there's enough people in lulu georgia to pack this house out but it's not to everybody it's just to the chosen amen y'all believe that don't you does not the scripture say i have chosen you she goes martha goes to mary who's sitting in the house in the gloom and in the doom and in the fear and in the tears sitting there all depressed sitting there all discouraged standing there all tore up her life upside down and martha goes to mary secretly saying the master has come and he's calling for thee and the bible said as soon as mary heard that she arose quickly and came unto him you see martha the church the woman types the church martha comes to mary back in the message not that he's coming but he's here and martha comes to mary who's still sitting in the house and says mary listen to me i know you're hurting i know you have sorrow i know you feel depressed i know you're nervous i know you feel like your world is caving in but mary listen to me stop crying for just a second listen to me he's here and when that revelation struck her heart she rose quickly and went out to meet him listen to me little bride i know it's a nervous time an unusual time a dark time an evil time a lawless time a time of unrest a time of division where they're trying to divide us do not let them divide you we are one in the spirit i say to you little bride in this time of darkness and unrest listen to me he's here amen god's body uniting as his bride being one him and christ together has the spirit working in the flesh of the church like it worked in the flesh of jesus the spirit working in the flesh of the church like it worked in the flesh of jesus christ because it's a part of his body twain one they are one not two but one husband and wife are no longer two but one and christ and his body is one and the same spirit that was in christ is in his blood his body that unites them together with all the word and god living in there himself manifested christ was the mystery of god revealed oh god was he poured into christ and all christ says he has poured into his church god poured himself into christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed and all crisis he's poured into his bride and the bride is the revelation of where he is in this hour amen where is he he is here that's the same as it is today listen to this quote it's listen to this quote it's the same as it is today there is so many people today that love the lord and don't realize listen to this quote many good people today they love the lord and don't realize you can tell them about it and yet they can't recognize that he's alive forevermore tonight and that he is here in this church tonight good people sitting on message pews that loved the lord and yet they failed to recognize that he's here he is in the midst of us and will be till he comes in the physical corporal body you say brother what are you saying i'm simply saying this he's here but he is coming there's a difference between his appearing and his coming he has appeared in the midst of his people the son of man ministry hallelujah continuing in the bride god manifested in the flesh not just of william branham but in the flesh of you brother samuel brother wade these other brothers these sisters that was his purpose that was his desire that the god above us would be god with us would be god in us what is true fellowship two fellows in the same ship christ in you the hope of all glory think about that think about that he's in the midst of us and he will be till he comes in a physical corporal body you know i heard brother biscuit say one time that christ will be just as real to you as your faith can declare him to be some people see christ every time they come to church because the faith declares he's here some people never see him because they got their eyes on the world that's all they ever see amen you'll never see him by intellect you'll never understand him by intellect it's not something we learn it's something we experience amen that's what we need more than anything from the pulpit to the back door young and old from two to eighty we need an experience with christ this message is not a bunch of do's and don'ts this message is a life that's lived hallelujah christ in me christ in you it suits you see my brother my sister what it is it's christ in me helping you and it's christ in you helping me what good is it to have a congregation without a pastor what good is it to have a pastor without a congregation we need each other that's why when we come to the house of god we should say amen to the word we should get behind the word you should get behind your pastor and when he brings the word you should say amen we're in this together we need each other amen got heartache in your home go meet jesus got a need for anything go meet jesus go meet him he's got all the remnant everything there is the prophet said he ain't got the remedy he's got the cure and when mary heard that jesus said come notice when mary caught the same revelation that martha called it brought the same results hallelujah there's only one holy ghost huh brother man didn't get a different version than what you got we all get the same holy ghost by one spirit are we all baptized into the body of christ amen when she got the word that jesus had come when she caught the same revelation she got up and went to meet him listen to me mrs brother sister i'm not talking about jumping up and running the aisle you want to jump up and run the aisle that's fine but when you get through run and live it i'm not talking about just jumping up and shouting but i'm talking about letting your faith go let your faith get up believe god for the impossible don't you see my brother my sister when you believe god for big things you're telling god i believe you're a big god does not the bible say you have not because you ask not does not the bible say seek and ye shall find ask and you shall receive knock knock and the door shall be opened unto you did not jesus say you have not because you ask not and when you do ask you really don't believe it's going to happen and therefore you don't get it well brother dale i prayed and i pray and god just ain't answering my prayer god don't hear my prayer that's a lie the devil's lying to you the bible says in jeremiah 33 3 call unto me saith the lord and i will answer thee the trouble is sometimes his nose are just as good as his jesus amen well gloria i'm going home i'm going soon why sit you in the house friends i sent you here this morning why carry your problems back out with you why care your fear of getting coveted back out with you why don't you leave it here this morning and take his faith faith in jesus faith in his word faith in the power of the holy ghost can i have just a few more minutes listen listen to me i thank god for every miracle that we have on tape don't you i love to sit and listen to those things herbert say just yesterday i think it was that he called a man out that was blind and god opened i know the man was deaf and god opened the man's deaf ears and the man spoke you know he's beginning to talk back to brother branham and he got ready to leave the platform and brother ben said wait a minute you got a problem in your life it's cigarettes and i thought the grace of god wouldn't be no good to tell him that if he couldn't hear it but god waited till he opened his ears and then told him i love to hear those things don't you i love to listen to the discernment you're so and so from a certain certain city i looked up the other day brother ben called somebody out told him the house number of their house and the street number and the city and you know what i did i googled it it's still there matter of fact it's for sale if you want to buy it and i thought that's the grace of god called a woman out the other day said you live an apartment i think it was apartment 2 15 and a half [Music] not three quarter not one quarter a half that's god i love to hear those things but i'm so thankful that i don't have to go back to 1965 and see what god done but the same god that done that through the prophet is doing it today through his bribe amen he's doing it right now working through his body on the earth making saint john 14 12 a reality verily verily i say unto you the works i do share you do also and greater more works than this shall you do more works because that day it was one body doing the works now today it's a mini-membered body all around the world that christ is manifesting himself making himself the same yesterday today and forever and i'm so glad i don't have to go back to 1965 to see what god does but that same god is doing it today amen if i could just take just a couple of minutes before i close i know some of you sleepy so it's warm and getting sleepy i'll try to wake you up i just want to share with you just a few things that i've seen my lord do i had nothing to do with it i was just there when it happened but i saw it i was in pennsylvania there's a sister there by the name of sister betty who had glaucoma that was so bad that she had to wear sunglasses because the lights inside the building of the church hurt her eyes and she was going to go see an eye specialist on monday about the glaucoma and she was sitting there on a sunday wearing sunglasses in the church and that after the service she came up for prayer and me and the saints of god prayed for sister betty sister betty goes to that eye specialist on monday he examines her eyes you know what he told her whoever sent you here needs your eyes examined needs their eyes examined there's nothing wrong with your eyes oh my why he's the same yesterday today and forever i was up in oregon i was sharing that testimony of what the lord did for sister betty there's a man sitting in the back with cataracts on both eyes and he said there and he told me after church he said i just raised my head and said god if you can do that for sister betty you could take care of these cataracts on my eyes and see he testified in their service he said i was sitting back there and i said that and he said god is my witness the canadax fell off of my eyes why he's the same yesterday today and [Applause] thank forever i was in i was in france i preached a little message the lord gave me one time for the sake of one and there's a sister sitting right here with his brother sitting and she was on a cane her hair was shorter than mine had big old earrings and pants she was a catholic somebody invited her to the meeting and when the service at the end of the service i just felt sorry for her i thought poor woman on that cane so i just went down and she she was standing there with her cane like this and i just laid my hand on top of her hand and i said something like this father this poor woman no that's had a rough life she probably don't even understand what i'm saying but god if you find favor in your shot take her off that cane that shouldn't have to use it no more and i just went on she didn't understand a word i said she spoke french i spoke english somebody asked me one time said you know a foreign language i said yeah english it's foreign to me we didn't even understand each other i come back to church the next morning the sister was back and she said i want to testify a catholic testified in a message church and she said i got up this morning said i didn't need my cane and i was there in march of 20 just before the pandemic broke excuse me february i was in there february of 20 just before the pandemic broke and that sister since that time has repented been baptized in jesus name received the holy ghost her hair was way down her back she was wearing dresses and the last time i saw her she was vacuuming the church i said i said sister every time i see you you're getting younger and you're under [Applause] the grace of almighty god i was in russellville kentucky you know where that's at by the way i was in russellville kentucky there's a sister there sitting in the back of the church and i was preaching and all of a sudden she jumped up and started praising god you know thoughts go through your mind while you preach it'll be nine people be be 90 people stand on your feet shout the devil show you the one sleeping you know these battles go through your mind and she jumped up and just got to shout and sat back down i thought my lord she got happy and in a few minutes she got up and went out i thought what in the world you get a blessing like that and then leave church all this is going through my mind while i was preaching and then a few minutes she'd come back and sit down i thought wow that sure is strange well when service was over she came and she said can i testify i turned to the brother he said sure she said i've not even told my husband he says i had a tumor on my breast i said i had an appointment to go see a doctor and she said while the word was being preached i just started receiving it oh that's it friends you've got to receive it for yourself she said i just started receiving it and i felt a sting go through my body and i jumped up and started praising god she said then i went out and checked myself and she said i want to share it with you all the tumor is gone [Applause] i was in ohio and a sister came up for prayer who had a tumor hanging off the back of her ear that was the size of an egg and when she walked it swung and she wanted me to pray for her and when i touched that thing it made me so sick i thought i was going to vomit it just made me sick to even touch it but this woman's faith was so great and i thought this tumor we're fixing to have church this tumor is fixing to fall off right here on the floor we're going to have us from church tonight so i prayed for her it wasn't me it was her faith her faith was so great but i have never been as disappointed in my life as when she turned around and walked off and that tumor was still there didn't understand it brother we're saying i thought how could that be that woman's faith was so great brother david silas some of you know brother david saller just a bosom buddy of mine and i was talking to him i said david i said i don't understand it why did that not fall off they said i don't know brother daryl well i guess the lord heard me whining because a few days later brother wayne lost and some of you know brother wayne law says he called me from up here in the house i said brother darrell so there's a sister upper and said do you know brother daryl he said yeah i know brother daryl she said would you tell him that two days after he prayed for me i was walking through the house and the tumor fell off in the floor that's my god

folks this is why we use the fivefold ministry and we believe in the full fivefold ministry sometimes you know you you hear one certain person you hear me or whoever you know we're plowing along but we need somebody to come by and remind you remind you of who you are and what promises you have that we might forget every once in a while that we have when we come to church so thank god let's give brother darryl a big hand he absolutely poured his heart out to us and we love him with the love of the lord and we thank you all for coming uh sisters if y'all want to go ahead now listen we're going to eat but it's just going to be since there's so many people here it's just going to be like a little brunch all right so there's some sandwiches and soup down there so don't consider this lunch this

walked up here but lord you said through the foolishness of preaching that you would talk to us lord you spoke to us through that vessel today [Music] now i pray that you as the prophet always says he was tired and weary and numb he said for days after a service when you took over lord i pray this should bless our brother daryl lord and give him strength lord for his journey home just be with each one that's here father sanctify the food that'll nourish our bodies and we'll have enough for the people to eat father we pray that you'll just be with the ones that are sick touch our ones lord that are in congregation we father we pray that you just reveal your word to us more than anything and we know who you are and we know where you are we just lord we need to pile on the love just a little bit more become closer to you father lord i believe today we've become closer thank you for the services yesterday and today with the youth lord i pray that you would protect them lord put a hedge around them that satan won't get them at that tender age lord but that you will ask lord and they'll come running to you as our brother said lord we pray that you'll just be with them now take care of them the little kids all the way up to the adults father in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you're dismissed [Music] you
