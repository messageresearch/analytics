word revealed in our hearts and lives forgive our sins bless us together in you remember the sick among us Lord father we pray that you would just touch each one because you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we just commit everything into your hands Lord and just have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to each and every one of us in Jesus name amen remember to pray for uh Scott and Donna and and uh Steven and Janice you know they went over somewhere they were going towards Egypt I don't know exactly where they got to where they're going but they got Peru going Peru all right and they uh wound up with some kind of a infection that they got some kind of a bug in their stomachs and things and they had to come back early but just remember because they all sick and and problems you know of that so just remember they said it was some kind kind of a what did I call it what go I just talking to Brother Gary about it told him what it was it's some kind of a bug it gets in your stomach and you know so just pray that the Lord would bless them okay Matthew 19 we've read these scriptures but uh we just keep reading it until we get down to where we want to be okay Matthew 19 3-9 the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him now want it's tempting him right words they wouldn't right they wasn't concerned and somebody trying to tempt somebody doesn't care which angle they approach from they'll do anything they can to trap you if they're trying to tempt you and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife or ever cause he answered unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no longer TW wi but one flesh what therefore God ha joined together let no man put us under they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and to put her away he sath unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another commits adultery and who so marry her which is put away does commit adultery all right Deuteronomy now 24 verse 1-3 when a man had taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes because he have found some uncleanness in her let then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it into her hand and send her out of his house and when she has departed out of his house she may go be go and be another man's wife and if the latter husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement and give it into her hand and send it send her out of his house or the latter husband die which took her to be wife you going down reading theand is not to come and take her back you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have got up to the point of tonight what we want to deal with and we'll get back to it in a minute but what we want to deal with tonight is is the Matthew 19 so just go ahead and keep that up brother um Anderson of Matthew 19 because we want to emphasize some things on the verses and and follow after exactly what is being said but now remember we've covered what is a marriage is when you're engaged and we're not talking now listen I want to make it plain to you and I have it in here a couple of times we are not talking about what the world calls a marriage or divorce or anything that's right amen we are not even con being concerned with what you know the word divorce means this and the word marriage means that we're not concerned with any of those things that's right we are not in any way attempting to explain it by natural terminologies we are trying to explain it by the scripture all and the prophet's message okay now in doing that then don't get tied up in well I don't believe this means that well if we're going to believe and that's the emphasis I placed upon it if we're going to believe the prophet you know all right let's believe it amen if not let's forget it right amen but if we're going to try to follow this message and believe the prophet when he said that as far as God is concerned when you ask the girl to marry you and she accepts that you're married amen he said the law gives your right to live together and all like that and he said you're married no matter whether you take the vows at the altar or whether or not you consummate that by going and living together you know or whatever you're doing that those are things in other words secondary going with it amen so we've determined that what a marriage is is The Vow you make unto that person all right then we covered a what a divorce is and see it makes me kind of laugh because I remember a Little Rascal's things and they were talking about their mom and dad was going to get a divorce and I don't say this for a joke I just try to make a point and all of the kids was trying to figure out what was a divorce and uh this finally this little black boy he said I know what it is and they said what he said I was down there the other day and said there was a wreck on the highway and said that policeman said that was the worst wreck he had ever seen so that's what he thought a divorce was was a wre on the highway yeah you know so that's what a lot of people thinks a divorce is yeah or what a marriage is you can go to court and see that I ain't never been married at one time well what about going to the other County you you might be you know and two how many times have you been engaged all right now but now listen then what is a divorce irregardless of what you would think about the word divorce you would have to agree with a simple terminologies of what a divorce is if a marriage is your vows that you made to one another then simply a divorce is to deny those vows or take back those vows in other words you you wrote down that the courthouse that you made your vows you were married they call that to give you a license Etc you know all right then you'd go back to the courthouse and the courthouse would say they're wanting to take back the vows they made to one another you say well that's not in the wording no but that's what's taking place right just be sensible that's what's taking place sure you get a lawyer and you pay him 1,500 bucks to write you out a piece of paper when all you got to do is go tell her I don't live with you no more I don't take back what I said to you that's what a divorce is of course good judge of life actually doing that he's got to get paid too you know that's what I say we're not arguing about the world says about what he anything said that's right and also when I get on in here in the fur I've got it written down another time to say it like this we are not discussing this upon the basis of what organized religion thinks sir or what the churches agree with that's right we are talking about what the Bible says and what the prophet says the Bible is saying unto us all right amen that way we're making our statement upon that basis and if we can't believe it that way then how in the world could you ever believe in the grace that's right amen if you're not going to believe him up to the grace how can you believe in grace right well I think he was a prophet maybe he was a prophet I don't know but well blessed God I really believe him on that marriage and divorce Grace now Butz I needed that well see that's the way we are that's how silly we turn out to be you know but listen church I hope you understand what I'm trying to bring bring so let's get started on this and as I was ending up Sunday or doing Sunday I want to reread a couple of things back to you and read them real fast and not spend no time on it but I want you to follow with me of what I'm trying to say and where we're trying to get to on this position of of a divorce and tonight we'll be talking about uh in other words who can get a divorce all right so we will have to review back over and in Romans 7 1-3 we have uh well let's keep this up right here let's keep this but I want you to I want you to see this all right Matthew 19 3-9 the Pharisees came unto him tempting him they did not believe him to be who he was they were tempting him to try to trap him right MH right right trying to make life of him right to show him up yeah as to not know what he's talking about so they were tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause now that word every there would be any cause right every cause all right now as I said look what he says immediately back to him and he answered and said unto him have you not read that he which he went right to the scriptures which made them at the beginning made them male and female he never even answered their question it was not even worthy of discussing he didn't argue debate with it I've got a couple of things on what I preached back under and the the brothers commented a couple of times least he called me brother I thank you that but uh you know I ain't going to comment on the Internet or on on the here and argue with nobody if he hears this he's waiting on me to say something so if he hears this I call my house and come see me be glad to see you you know be glad to talk with you but I ain't going to argue here I ain't going to argue you on the internet cuz there's no argument about it I just going down the road and forget it all right but now listen Jesus said that there was no such thing as a man being able to put away his wife right cuz even if you've never thought of it on this course I try to give things natural and then go back up the in the beginning was back before the sin in the garden right all right so you got to go back to the beginning so you know what the prophet has said in marriage and divorce indivisible union he said you go back to the beginning he said that was when there was male female yep there was no such thing as a deer with a hole hire them or a man with a hole hire them or or you know whatever anything else it was just male and female so he wasn't even answering anything of their point when they said can a man put his wife away forever cause now first off I want to make myself blunt Moses never gave them a right to put other wives away for every cause that's right I want to see that in the Bible no all right I want to see it in brother R's message where he says he did sure I know the quotes that brother Ram has made and you read them it sounds like brother said see there give right to put them away for everything no read right back before then cuz I've been over these and over these and over the and you'll see that he's saying they are saying right all right so now Moses never gave them a right to put away their wife for just any cause I want you to remember that we're talking about that this message is for the end time people it's not for the world they're not going to listen to you talk all right first off then there's nobody ever had an understanding that Moses gave any form of Grace of marriage and divorce I want to see a commentary even says it all nobody didn't understand Paul and do you understand Paul we going to get to it after a while we won't right now but do you understand Paul and what he said and can you tie it together with the grace of marriage and divorce right and where is it in Moses gave the writing of divorcement right I mean I want I want somebody to show me because i' I've studied this for 40 years see because you got to find out what you're doing you can't just go in Corinthians and say Paul don't say in Corinthians said okay now you take your wife go home with him everything's okie dokie right he doesn't say that brother Brown was the one that brought that into modern day terminologies are saying now it's the Delights of the message we'll make sure to get it in here and then it's Delights remember this message and this grace of marriage and divorce is only for the Believers of this message amen that's right it is not for the denominational world it is not for it is because of a supernatural Revelation I tried to make it plain there the other night it's there Sunday it's only because you've received a revelation can you understand the grace and receive it because the grace is there doesn't mean you have it do that mean you are saved before you received salvation no you received it didn't you right we going to have to receive the grace of marriage and divorce right and if you don't know what it is how can you receive it right right you can't take this out to the world and say I want to explain it to y'all come on in here and we'll tell you how to get things straightened out leave them bring them into the word yeah man that's right and then we can talk about marriage and divorce it is not something to be explained to your neighbor no wonder they make such light of us that's right where are you going to find it in the Bible you say let's God Moses gave a right to divorcement H gave a right to I want I want somebody to sit down my study with me and just give me the scriptures and show me how that's marriage and divorce Grace that's what we're going to deal with tonight he just just show it to me where it's at if not you're just saying brother Brown said it we'll go out there and tell them go here to the church next to us not throwing off on them they they know brother br but go say brother R said so and so yeah he said well we don't believe it that way see we're A peculiar people amen we're an odd bunch of people I'm talking about the Believers in this message to believe that God sent a prophet amen and if he sent a prophet to us then he gave us Grace that is a prophet a prophet is Grace to the people I know I've heard it preach and it's true a a prophet is judgment to a nation yes but he's grace to the people right right amen all right amen but now get in there and let's just think about what he's saying so Jesus doesn't answer him they say can a man put away his wife forever cause in other words can he just put her away any time he wants to for any reason Jesus anchored it he said from the beginning it was not so right right okay so they back off he's going down explaining what happened in Genesis and how they're won talking to the Pharisees so they see that they can't go the approach they're going so now they're trying to make light of him but verse seven and they say unto them why did Moses now watch they don't bring up for any cause right read your scripture they said why they say unto him why did Moses then you know the scriptures don't you you know Moses gave a writing a divorce look they say unto him why did Moses then give command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away they never mentioned what CA then you better get off of that that cuz he done answer them up here if you go back to the original read it over and over in the prophet's message marriage and divorce and invisible Union and watch how much he emphasizes that it wasn't so from the beginning it was just one man one woman that's right that's right and they were one physically yep right and one spiritually yep and how could it now watch so now he's going to answer them see he didn't answer them up here you think this is not an answer if you're reading it look at it read it sometime just sit down and read it plain language he didn't argue with him he just told him it wasn't so no they said can you put him away forever C he no other words what was he saying no cuz from the beginning it was just one right amen other words he was saying Moses never gave you that right cuz Moses was my Prophet that said in the beginning it wasn't right now they get down then they say why did Moses then give her a commandment to put her away he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so that's right that's right now watch did God give a Grace in the last days because of the hardness of our hearts now I know you're quoting in your mind so that's good that's what I want you to do he said because of misinterpreted theology is that correct well wouldn't that exactly what Jesus was saying under them your misinterpreted theology is what caused Moses to have to give a granting of a Grace and I believe he did I preached to you when I believe he did because how did Rahab the Harlot wind up to be able to marry that Israeli General and right out of there come the lineage down to Jesse right right towards Jesus Every Which Way it comes which really comes to Joseph you know that right but you see what I'm talking about the whole text of the whole point is Jesus is telling them Moses never gave you a right to do that you wanted it you got in trouble he had to come up with an answer and he gave it we'll get back to that that in a little while I want to hold that point and I want you to think on that in no way did Moses give them a right to just do for anything right amen we're going to read some things the prophet had to say about whether or not a Believer should be put away I mean an unbeliever excuse me we're going to read whether or not he says it cuz his wife don't cook and do everything just right they could put her away he said you can't do it right flatly he said it this way he said even if she puts me away I'm still married to her that's where you you don't listen to brother Dale and what he's saying some of you may have got a divorce from your husband or your wife but have you checked out to see if the other side got it we it's got a divorce well if it's not a two- party you could be still having some technical problem sorry but is it the truth that's right I'd rather know it and get rid of it here didn't have trouble down at the river right but now listen so we're saying that this does not apply whatsoever of marriage and divorce to the worldly systems of their thinking neither does it apply to organize religions or religions in any form and he said it was only we'll get back to it after a while only to his followers that's right that's right that could receive the grace of marriage and divorce I'm sorry I don't mean to be blunt but mean to be blunt enough for you to think it over it ain't for uncle and aunt and sui and Mom and Daddy sometimes you got to think it over because they were not here to receive it no they don't know how to receive it this is not a blanket you throw out to a church even n you say everybody in here is under this blanket no it ain't it ain't no blanket it's an individual of fire that's right yes sir down some hard right all right but just remember where we spent our time at who P up Romans 7 I think I put it on there for you but you know what it says in Romans 7 I don't think I'm left it on my notes so they may have a little trouble getting do you know what Paul said in Romans 7 that her husband must be dead amen yep does that sound like Grace let's just read that I want to make sure everybody understand it follows Romans 7 no you not Breen for I speak to them that know the law how that the law have dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulterous though she be married to another man okay so we got it up all right now so then doing that the husband must be dead right and then we covered that there was no and I want to make sure come on these tape I keep putting these things back on because somebody come along and click on and they just hear one tape and they wonder what in world you talking about all right go ahead with number one on their notes and look what we're we're still back on what we were talking about now that brother Brandon said there is no grounds for a woman to divorce her husband and marry again that's right if she divorced her husband according to Paul in Corinthians it will get to another while she must rest remain single or be reunited back to her husband there's no ground for a woman to divorce her husband and marry again right right now we went through that cover that you don't have to live with him if he's a dirty mean guy right you can separate from him because Paul said if they do separate yeah but they don't give you a right to remarry well you mean my my husband he was mean he was beat me he your pra for you got it all right that's right amen right if You' have prayed for you got him you would have wouldn't have wound up with a smelling you know what brother around said about the the lady said the girl why did you well he had such pretty feet and he smelled so good he said I'd rather him have shoes like a car box and stink like a something I forgot what he used the word horse or something and be a good boy about it right amen but you see we were the one that messed it up all right so look what he said now we'll just read these F so we won't have to wor about for marriage and divorce brother randman explain paragraph 227 see she has got a living husband no man can marry her cuz what she does and who she is she's got a living husband there is care what she does or who she is she's got a living husband there's no grounds for her at all but it's not said for him because it's her not him get it you have to make the word run in continuity see nothing saying he couldn't but she can't see calls it her not him that's exactly what the Bible says causes her it's not stated against him to remarry but her why Christ in the Tope right now I will say this up front brother brandom never gave an okay for a man to just be able to divorce his wife for any cause and marry again amen we won't cover them today but a man has a perfect right to put his wife away for cutting her heart that's right honored of God the prophet said to do so but he cannot remarry for that cause right amen so that's plain is there that we won't get we're not wanting to get into that not we're want to cover one thing what about Moses was they right when they said Moses said they could just put them away for everything see Jesus was telling you Moses never said that that's right they made him say what they wanted he never said it so that's the point all right with the next one kill on marriage and divorce paragraph 243 there is one Christ and many members of that wife notice he can put put us away for Spiritual fornication false Doctrine anytime he wants to but how dare you try to put him away and make it the man can put away his wife and marry another but not the woman put away her husband and marry another I see all the types and shadows going to the next one just want to get those points notice the Bible plainly says here that her first husband must be dead not just put away he's got to be dead that's paragraph 151 of the invisible Union 65 11:25 right go on to the next one Paul here is given an illustration this invisible Union paragraph 35 in our scripture about the law and Grace and illustrating like marriage and divorce this passage is very seldomly preached on because it more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce of how that he's trying trying to set in order here that we as as a church can no be no more be married to the world and to Christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it then it could be for a woman to be living with a husband while she's got a living husband he said now I have my thoughts on that one more these are just showing you there's no grounds for her all right and we're going to get them to Paul with this scripture in a little while I may do it now I don't know I'll have to look back and check this is marriage and divorce paragraph 230 now you notice in First Corinthians 7:10 Paul commands that the wife that is that divorces her husband to remain single or be reconciled not to remarry she must remain single or be reconcile be reconciled back to her husband she cannot Remar she must remain single but notice is never said about him all right so now as I said we're going to get down when we get to it we're not going to cover the male show in this pig everybody would think we are and say well a man he just what he do for anything you can't do it amen I want to show to see where the Prophet says you can I definitely want to see where the Bible says he can right all right now let's get down to something when they were tempting Jesus they were not wanting the truth right right or it wouldn't have been stated they were tempting him you didn't say they just asked him a simple question you know they Shar Us in the heart no they asked him tempting him trying to trick him track him do whatever they could all right see they didn't want the truth right they just wanted to show how smart they were yep that's right amen don't you know that Moses gave us a ride of divorcement to put away our wife and marry again and watch the first point was can you divorce your wife for any cause second Point kind of weaken down just a little bit got to from the ever cost and said you know Moses done that now remember how many times brother around emphasize this point that they said we're moses' disciples right then those Pharisees when they're always saying we're moses' disciples we follow Moses we don't know about you right well then why didn't they believe Moses right why did they not read what Moses had to say that's right Moses never gave him a writing of divorcement forever call that's right sure he gave him a message of Grace but here's something I want to drop damn is marriage What is marriage and divorce how is it to be handled now this is the way I believe it so you whatever you want to do I believe marriage and divorce is a one- Time given thing that's are you following me whether you agree with him or not that's okay that's that's your business I'm just making my point about it I believe marriage and divorce is given one thing now no I didn't say now don't misunderstand me and say it was given for one person I didn't say that I said it was given for one time right see then you can't just take it and say well I divorced this woman here because of this and I'll divorce that one for this and I'll divorce this one for that and I'll divorce that one for that I'm sorry I I don't I can't see that I'm sorry if that's the way you believe it that's your business I'm just telling you how I believe but brother random when he gave the grace of marriage and divorce what did he say and we'll read it at the last of the message he said God told me to tell you to go on as you are but not to do it again that's right now so evidently Grace is allotted for only one thing you know we don't have a blanket given to us in Salvation that we can go out and live like the devil and everything's covered because we're in The Bride of Jesus Christ we've done been through that and proved it see grace is not just a blanket throw out and you just go live like the devil but the blanket covers you and you go divorce one woman and then you come up with a second woman and you come up with a third woman a fourth woman something what are you doing well the prophet said it was Grace well Grace now listen Grace are we Catholic Catholic believes in being um forgiven before you do you can go down and pay and go out and do right now if they don't like that the people listening in can just argue the point that's plain language about what you do right you can just go down and pay it off and then go do it well I don't believe in that amen Grace is not for future sins amen Grace is covering of the past sin or the things that we have done right and if we do again we have to repent right is that right amen so then the grace of marriage and divorce wouldn't be just a blanket throw it out to where that this they would say well well just come on down here and you know Moses day and bring us a couple of caves and a few little something to eat maybe a little gold and we'll just we'll sprinkle a little salt on you and turn around and send you back that's what the Catholic Church believes they actually believe believe that they sprinkle s on you turn and send you back and that you're totally a virgin going back just like you was when you've started that's their belief they believe in restored come find out you find some people in this message believe that too that's right but that I mean that's silly amen so now remember what I'm saying Moses like brother brandom like Paul was bringing a Grace for what had taken place right now yep right what had taken place not what is going to take place now follow me what I'm saying we wasn't back there to hear Brother random when he told him at the Tabernacle right but when God reveals it to you then it's for you that day are you listening amen it's for you that day but see those sitting there that day if they didn't believe it was for them it wasn't for them either even though they heard the verbal words from the man's mouth right neither is it with Moses or Paul and our brother randam it is not to just say well you know well bless God it's just the Grace we're under grace now don't make it disgrace right right see they wanted the fact that they could put their wives away for any cause or every cause right Ain that the way mankind is he wants to down the woman did Brother random did Paul ever say anything except for what the conditions they were found in right now give it to me if you got it that's right did they say it was for just anything now there was a lot when Moses and brother Rand and Paul said it yes there was a lot of things that the grace they gave covered because it had to be given for there but remember what I'm saying it didn't cover the next day it covered what is prior to then amen all right see now let's go to First Corinthians I got that on the brother let's go to 1 Corinthians 7 let's see so now let me say this statement to you and I don't mean this sarcastically I mean for every one of us there was not one of us I said while ago knew that Paul said anything about the grace of marriage and divorce right until we heard the prophet right right we didn't know Moses gave a Grace of marriage and divorce until we heard the prophet tell us all right now he tells us that it's in Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 but I would like for you to read that with us I hope I can get that up can you get it on that brother they'll get it they'll get it up a little bit sorry and watch his answer and see if Paul says it's for any reason uh 1 Corinthians 7: 10-15 there you go they're getting it all right now watch and unto the married I command watch it yet not I well that's is not his grace of marriage and divorce no yet not but the Lord let not the wife depart from her H husband Romans 7:1 MH we just covered that right but if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife right I want you to find for any cause in here right am I want you to find just for any reason whatsoever you can put away your wife and marry another one and it'd be all right he said well she not a Believer well we're going to read down through here below this and then we're going to read what the prophet says about that too I want you to find the grace of marriage and divorce written within here can you do it but to the rest speak I not the Lord now we know it's got to be something doing with him right right okay if any brother ha a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him y let him not put her away any brother that's got a wife that believe us not so now Paul is doing away with all of the things they asked brother brandham in the questions and answers can a man put his wife away cuz he don't believe un believer and Remar he said no why cuz Paul just said that right right now what he's still saying what he said and not the Lord and the woman which had an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him or the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were their children unclean AR watch but if the unbelieving not supposed to be Christians one of's a Believer the other one's an unbeliever right now I want to preach on that one of these days what is Believers right come on amen see the way it's preached in this message just about it it's preached that the girls and boys here in this this church has got to intermarry each other they can't go out somewhere else and find them a wife that's where a lot of people believe CU you're marrying outside the faith well I wonder what happened when Joseph when George Smith was a Baptist I believe that's right now he hears this and said he's not that's what I thought they said the brother R was letting them down what is a Believer see a Believer then would be categorized as being someone who is a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ not a believer in Buddha Hindu Muslim whatever I'll get back one of these days every get time I'll preach on that a while because what is a Believer right but if the unbelieving depart let him depart okay him a brother or sister is not under bondage in such case but God has called us to peace all right then he goes on down to explain you know the different things right but where's the grace where did Brother random in there I mean where did Paul say now the Lord met me on the mountain and told me to come down here and tell you to go on as you are remember what the prophet said because of a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of the seven seats right I gave it to you Sunday or Wednesday where that brother Ram covered about three times two times I know in conduct order and Doctrine he told the people that asked him about divorcing or whatever to do he said remain as you are you will hear from me later on this you remember that this past Wednesday I mean this past Sunday he said remain as you are don't go out do anything why because he knew a Grace could be given but he couldn't come up and give it until God called him out and give it neither could Moses neither could Moses give it right now I know I'm going to be running slow tonight I may have to continue this Sunday but that's okay go ahead with with number six on your notes brother cuz what I want to establish now in about five or six quotes is things from brother Brandon that will show you that you don't have a right to just put your wife away for any cost whether they're not good whether they're not good good home bodies you know or whether they're not uh even they're they're unbelievers right now we just got do with Paul said if they want to remain let them remain now where was Paul saying I just divorce him because an unbeliever go find you another one no no no now remember whether it be Moses whether it be Paul or whether it be brother Bram the grace of marriage and divorce cannot be contrary to the word of God absolutely right not saying that the word would definitely emphatically State sometimes but because that would be God's mind transmitted down to mankind of what he was really saying right Amen in his word right so now look what he says he's talking about 1 Corinthians 7th chapter 15th verse all right in answering these questions are the best of my knowledge and I'll try to answer by the scripture first one is found I believe in 1 Corinthians 7th chapter 15th verse so we'll try to get over to that and get to the scripture Now 1 Corinthians 7th chapter 15th verse and I suppose the person's present now now here's the way it reads all right now what they done the question we'll read it on down here in a minute the question is can a unbeliever can a Believer put away an unbeliever plain language like that okay we'll read that in a minute but if the unmarried depart let him depart a brother or sister is not under bondage in such a case but God has called us unto peace now that's simple plan right if they depart all right now watch brother Brandon what he's trying to explain now he's explaining there can't be a contradiction it can't be saying that you can just go out and throw them away or whatever you want to do cuz you're going to be contrary to the scriptures watch him now and now 1 Corinthians 7 15th verse now the question they ask brother bradam does this mean a sister brother is free to remarry cuz that's the question is no now he's talking about an unbeliever he ain't brought up nothing about no cases of of uh fornication or adultery he's just talking plain about an unbeliever all he says no so you don't get this question here in what he's saying I talking to brother dick about something the other day and I invite you to do that sometimes go into conduct order and Doctrine especially and just read the question and turn around and read brother Brown's answer and sometimes he don't even ask answer seemingly the question the person asked now he's explaining why he's going to explain to you when we get through reading that Paul was answering exactly what the person are speaking about exactly what the persons back there was asking and that's what he was doing see sometimes we ask a question and brother R would answer the question and and you'd look at him and say well you didn't answer my question yes he did right he answered what you had in your heart right I know a man that denied that brother Bram that he was raised from the dead in brother br's Ministry don't you you think I want to believe the man no I believe brother BR am amen you have another brother that told some things about the dreams that brother brandham had but you better remember a prophet would see the dream see the dream you had and tell you the dream that's right and say why did you leave this part out you know why he left out you wanted to you didn't want to admit what was going on in the dream look too much against you you ever done that so let's see if that's what he's doing does this mean that a sister or brother is free to Remar no so you don't get his question there and what he's saying they're not free see that would make a contradiction in the scripture and the scripture does not contradict themselves at all see now let's you see like you can make the scripture just by reading one verse say anything you want it to say to fit our thought but you've got to take the thought that they're talking on all right so now what he explains it to brother Neville you know if I I say boor you got to find out what's about to board now all right so he goes on he said sometimes the Bible contradicts itself people say see sometimes they say the Bible contradicts itself I want to find it it doesn't he said he's been around for the Holy Ghost is the revealer of the word no contradiction see if Paul is writing them people saying you ask such and such a thing only he isn't just saying you ask it he's saying that other words what they meant what they were trying to say then here he turns around and answers them back which is contrary to what they asked he's picking up their thought and answering their thought brother Rand was picking up people's thoughts instead of answering their question he picked up the thought of what was about the question and sometimes he's been for minutes on one question and you'll never in the 45 minutes be able to name him down and say he said this but that's what he said I challenge you to do that they ask we do so and so and so Paul turns around and says something else see looks like it's a contradiction it's not and if you just read the whole verse the whole chapter you find out that he's he's trying to expl explain what they've wrote him so was is everything we try to write him all right here's the question is a brother or sister in the Lord now what is a brother or sister in the Lord can Remar can marry or remarry and be free if they leave their companion to marry again see that's more of that same question part of was could they do and put it away just watch it unto the marriage I command yet not I but the Lord let not the wife depart from her husband see can't do it cuz he says no he says no to what a brother or sister can Remar marry or remarry and be free if they leave their companion to Remar again that's an part part of could day if there were unbelievers go back and read it in the book and then you come on down and he's answering he's bringing their question he says no you can't do it and look what he says unto the married yet not I but the Lord see let not the wife depart from her husband see but and if she departs let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife that's the Commandments of the Lord see the Lord one said it wouldn't Paul but to the rest speak I and Paul coming with his grace now not the Lord if any brother ha a wife that believeth not now he's going to answer now watch this subject if you read it on down before this and on through the chapter you'll find that they thought they thought if we married a wife and she was if I got married and I become a Believer and my wife wasn't a Believer let me put her away oh no that isn't it you can't do that that's right if any brother has wife that believeth not and she'd be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away that's exactly right you said well I'm I'm marry a woman and then or whatever look what he goes on down and say that's not because of marriage and marriage that's because of unbelief words it's not a problem it's not something you straighten up it's because of unbelief not Remar again see you stay with her course you can go on and be Sanctified all right other unbelieving wife is Sanctified notice and if the unbeliever sa the people say bless God you got to get rid of that woman you got she's an unbeliever or you know tell the the the woman you got to get rid of that husband cuz he's an unbeliever now now if the unbeliever says now this is Paul's Grace I want you to read it over and over in Corinthians 7 10 through 15 and on through there first Corinthians this is Paul's Grace that he's giving if not show it to him in the word cuz it's where your Prophet said it that what and if the unbeliever says I'm not going to live with you any longer you've become a Christian to a man tells his wife the man now tell his wife because he got saved and going to get out of the world where we was once in I'm going to leave you now there ain't nothing you can do about it let him depart now he just told you let him depart or her she or the woman who say to her husband I'm not going to mix up with that bunch of Holy Rollers I'm not going to do this I'll separate and leave you don't you leave leave the church you let her leave see and a brother our sister is not under bondage in such case that is if your companion is putting you away and wants to depart for for it excuse me depart for it that's right get the mic away you don't have to just hold unto them if they're wanting to leave you and they're going to leave you for the cause of Christ let them leave but you can't remarry that's right right now that's exactly right let them leave he ain't talking about what they do or do down the road afterward he's answering it exactly right if they decide to leave let them leave now they go get killed down the road you got a different situation they go out something else happen you got other things to deal with right he's answering it to the point right let them go ahead cuz you're not bound there see but you can't remarry but God has called us into peace see not that you can remarry again he's already stated that but you don't have to live with an unbelieving husband or an unbelieving wife if they're not willing now notice what he said if they're not willing and if they're with him now say now you go on to church and which woman just said all right you go on the man said you and if you want to go to down there that's your business you want to go to your church you go ahead for me I don't believe it and I I'll do everything anything for you I'll not stand in your way you go ahead then you just remain there knowing not that you're SA Sanctified life will sanctify that unbeliever causing them to become a Believer said just remain right there go ahead but now just to say I brother brandom I got married my wife's an unbeliever here's a sister over here I marry I'm going to leave this one and marry that one oh no no indeed somebody told me that word there how many times it was Fe brother you looking for indeed I thought he said indeed indeed listen your vow is until death you separate and there's nothing else in the world permits you to marry in the Bible until your Comm companion is dead that's right the only ground is there's no remaining nowhere at all except the dead companion that's all you can't make it contradict itself so just read the verses before and after and you'll catch then what he's talking about now this what it means here and that see he explained that first y right does this mean that a brother are free it's no no he explained that first there's no such thing as any believer ever being reconciled in remarriage again with a living companion in other words you read that one is conflicting in your mind it's all right there's no such a thing as an unbeliever ever being reconciled to to remarriage why because they don't have anything to bring them they're not Christians all right with a living companion so you you can't just go back and put this back to that and that to that and do this that and the other all right do you understand all right do you understand what I'm trying to say amen that's Paul's Grace right according to brother Brown y now can you read in there and see the grace of marriage and divorce in 1 Corinthians 7: 10-15 can you actually see what's taking place see because Paul wound up in a lot of trouble and we know Moses was under the day of polygamy now the marriage Grace of marriage and divorce never stopped polygamy right it kept on going until Christ came so it was a straightening up of what had went wrong all right now Paul coming into the Corinthians right the book of Corrections cuz that's what it means he had trouble with them why because they was married a lot of time they had a lot of wives because the polygamy was still going on and you know remember the women over there and Paul said what did the word come out from you only they was preachers under those old U heathenistic worshiping of idals and things and they thought when we preach back there we'll just preach over here and Paul says no way now that's right that don't work see Paul had a lot of things he had to deal with he had a lot of situations right that had to be dealt with and I loved it when a brother come here and you may not agree with this somebody out there and that's your business okay but I tell you what I I thoroughly rejoiced when old brother the arasmus was telling about when they was over there in Africa orever where he's from there and they found those people that just living in the ground they didn't know who Daddy was who they just lived together they just no marriages or no nothing they would just and they want to be Christians so they went out there and started talking to them about being Christian Chans well after a while they finally got around to W really be Christians they just went out there and said okay who's your wife 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 you know I don't know they said they told him said pick you out one cuz as of today you're going home with one wife and you ain't going to have no h of dust and I I enjoy that I thought that was wisdom you say well I don't know where I thought it was wisdom because they had wisdom enough to be able to halfway try to straighten something out right now I've always been this too Paul in his day when polygamy was legal up until Christ came right and then the Corinthians they were still dealing with those things did Paul pick out tell them you pick out one woman and go home with her and throw the rest of them in jail now I don't think so I don't think so got my own opinion okay plainly opinion if I had it to deal with you know what I'd say so pick out which one of them is your wife and you go home with that wife singular and you don't fool with them others but you will make a living for them others until things can turn different because you are a Christian claiming to be you mean you're going to throw away nine wives or 14 kids by each one of them or something and throw them out into the world no you'd want to do the best you could to supply every one of them a living but you couldn't live with with one of them cuz polygamy is wrong in the New Testament yeah just put that in don't charge you let you have it let's read a few few things let's see we went down through and we got to these what are we on number six number seven what number did we get to We got down to number seven okay this is uh as it was it was not so from the beginning 1959 uh paragraph E8 they were talking on the subject of divorce as you see the previous part of the scripture was teaching they said that they had a Commandment that the woman should be put away for any cause Jesus said Moses did this because of the hardness of your heart but it wasn't so from the beginning we have to go back and find out what the foundation is all right pull up the next quote but that shows you that you got to go back to the beginning to find out back in the beginning would be one husband and one wife back in the beginning was one dog one female one horse one female you know what I'm talking about that was before time even started but just in case that you want to try to pull some other smart elic stuff brother brandham said eve would have been burned for what she done but Adam didn't put her away yeah never were right come on is your mind clicking he had never right to but he didn't do it we're going to find in a minute brother around and said if you want to that's the way clim stat all right let's go now he talking about the little woman at the way him said she was living with her six husband so you see it's wrong when you got a living husband is it and so forth and going on just for any cause put a woman away and marry her and go and marry another and marry another and marry another one you shouldn't do that so he said see he said now really I don't know whether she was even married or not but go on to the next quote we're not concerned with that marriage and divorce paragraph 84 Jesus in our text invite us to go back to the beginning for the true scriptural answer now when he was confronted with this there was two things in view the priest said to him can a man put away his wife and marry another for any cause who he answers it and Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning who he answered it no you could put her away for any cause right now the other part of the question was what and then they said Moses suffered us a writing a divorce which put her away for anything they wanted wanted to he said that Moses did that because I'm letting that string string a while because of the hardness of your heart but from or at the beginning it was so the question all right go on to the next one let's get these out of the way and then we'll get down to what I'm trying to preach let take a Hebrews chapter 6 Book 2 paragraph 303 and listen to what he says accepting me to BR as my wife was what love done for her what she does in appreciation she's a nice woman stays home takes care of the children and lives a good true life that's not because we're not married we are married but she does that in appreciation and she runs downtown every day and took in every 10 cent store and up and down I thought about Walmart and up and down the street and never wash the dishes or anything else we are still married watch you absolutely when I took my vow that settles it she's my wife as long as there's life in us she's my wife that's her vow but appre but what appreciation she does for that she stays home what she stays home and takes care of the children and tries to be a real wife I could run out and be gone all the time just getting about over the country and let her High starve or anything let the children go without something to eat we're still married right if she even divorces me I'm still married as long as there life in my body I took that vow till death we separate that's right we're still married but yet I make a poor excuse of a husband she's made a poor excuse of a wife so if we love one another we stick together and pull the load together okay amen going with the next one questions and answers 62 paragraph 109 I am not true to my wife because I'm afraid she divorced me I'm true to her because I love her there's no other woman in the world but her that's the reason I'm true to her not because if I done a mistake and they thought I did something wrong come to her say mey Hunley I didn't mean to do that she'd forgive me now you going to see grace you going to see Adam did forgive Eve okay I know she would I'd forgive her I love her and I I'd forgive her now this is a prophet talking from a heart not a prophet talking from a letter of a word right I don't know where you understand that that's okay but I wouldn't do it for nothing I love her too much to do it it isn't because I didn't tell her I didn't think she'd forgive me it's the idea that I love her too much to do it first place and as long as I love her like that I'll never do it and she loves me that way everything's okay all right going on to the next this is for marriage and divorce paragraph 307 friends and then I'll close let's see all right let's get this because we'll see what it's talking about friends and then I'm closing you can go from this that's when this has been revealed to me what I'm going to tell you right now so don't miss it now I'm speaking to our followers only I said that while ago and I said I come back and read it who has fed me in this message not the outside bear me record of this before God just to this group only right now we are found in this mess because of misinterpreted theology is that right that's why you women married the second time and you men because misinterpreted Theology and I want to show you something that he told me and if God our creator was questioned to question and he was here on Earth Jesus Christ and when his delivering Prophet came forth Moses down in Egypt to bring the children out of egyp Egypt he put them to put them in the promised land and Jesus said here that Moses seen the people in this condition and he granted them a writing of divorcement because the situation was what it was wait Moses found such as let them suffer no need of you looking to try to find that in the scripture it's not there right okay so you a little trouble not in those wordings God permitted Moses that Prophet sent to the people to Grant this writing of divorcement to them and in 1 Corinthians the 7th chapter and 12th and 15th verse in the New Testament Prophet Paul who met the same thing in the church and spoke this this is I not the Lord that right because of the divorce situation our do conditions SK it wasn't so from the beginning but Moses was permitted it and God recognized it righteousness and Paul has had a right also had a right when he found his church in that condition but now you believe this to be true and believe it to come from God and by the Vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought me this far this far should not God upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more go with your wives and live in peace for the hour is late the coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things down don't you dare try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you're married and God bore me witness of that on the mountain that I should say this I could say this a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals and this is a question in God's word let them go on as they are and sin no more now for a few minutes as we close out I just remind you we wouldn't have known about the grace of marriage and divorce for Paul but brother ROM had told us where it was at and then in Reading even what he said we cannot take that and just apply it Loosely or whatever right we can't put it just in a situation and just say oh he had it whatever brother randam said would have to be the same Grace that Paul said right and the same thing that Moses said would you agree with that right I don't like that fly flying around but it's all right maybe he needs marriage and divorce too but now listen where is it in the Bible that Moses gave the right a divorce as I said it's hard to even find Paul now where is it in the Bible that Moses gave a right in divorce all right now go ahead and pull up Deuteronomy 24 it's going to have to be related right in there somewhere y to be able to understand it because this is the only scripture in the Bible that the divorcement is used in a bill of divorcement other than in Isaiah I gave to you the other day Isaiah says where is her to Bill of divorcement for your mother all right now can you read that and see the grace of marriage and divorce just be honest now look at it can you really see the grace of marriage and divorce Yet brother Brown said Moses gave it there when a man had taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes because he had found some un cleanness in her let him ride her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house where's the grace there okay I didn't give it to them to back up but if you will turn to Deuteronomy 22 scripture we used the other day and explaining some things and I just left it now if they want to find it and try to back up there in Deuteronomy to find it but it's Deuteronomy 22 and we'll begin reading about the 13th verse if they find it during the time then we'll look at it if not we'll stay on this if man take wife and go into her and hate her and give occasion to speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say I took this woman and when I came to her I found her not a mid then shall the father of the dsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the DS's virginity unto the Elders of the city in the gate and the Dam's father shall say unto the elders I gave my daughter unto this man to wife and he hateth her and lo he hath given occasions of speech against her saying I found not thy daughter aaz and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity and they shall spread the cloths before the Elders of the city and the Elders of the city shall take that man and chastise him in other words if he ain't right they're going to whoop him right and they shall inmense or make him pay a fine him in 100 shickles of silver and give them unto the father of the dsel because he has brought an evil name upon the ver Virgin of Israel and she shall be his wife and he may not put her away all his days BL so they're picking it up now all right and so we go down to verse 20 okay we just explained that if the guy says you know I married your daughter she wouldn't have made no in the Virgin they bring forth the things to prove her virginity and if they can prove it then they go whip the old boy a real good time and and then they make him pay the father a big chunk of money and then he can't put her away right now so we go to verse 20 but if this thing be true and the tokens of her virginity be not found for the dsel what then they shall bring out the damel to the door of her father's house and the men of her City shall Stone her with stones that she died because she has wrought Folly in Israel to put the in to play the in her father's house so shalt thou put away evil from among you all right now I don't think it' be necessary to read the rest of these things but you read it when you get time he goes up and down giving certain answers about situations and you know that each one of those situations if it was proven wrong about the woman she was killed right see Moses stay with the word brother brandham stayed with the word right before the grace came right right he wouldn't even he wouldn't even do his own son's wedding see Moses you read in there you'll see Moses and they took him out and killed them now you remember how we went into numbers and went through the vows and things my point is to get this to you Moses had already given them the law about marriage and how it was constituted and what it was then when he found them all so messed up by their misinterpretation of the things that he had said now come on folks brother brandom in what he was a say and you read marriage and divorce real careful and you'll see that he says real Christians real elect people people sitting out there with all kind of marital problems they said what can I do he wasn't talking about this worldly people he was talking about real good people Moses wasn't talking about this every little old Israelite Moses laid down the law he gave him the word brother random had given the word and I hope you're listening then you can see the grace of marriage and divorce and what Moses said and you'll see it what Paul done cuz you show me anywhere else in the Bible I don't mean that wrong I mean it right I want to see it cuz I studied 40 years trying to find I can't find no more than that Deuteronomy 24 where he's he gives them a right of divorcement because he didn't give them a right of divorcement in Deuteronomy 22 take him out and kill him pretty straight wrong was wrong they took out killed him man went wrong go over the numbers and read all them things we just read that part down there the show that if he accuses the woman and he ain't right then they work on him but where's the grace then in the scriptures pull back up Deuteronomy 24 now and really read there's got to be a Grace lying right here in these verses but where else we going to find it if you can find it I want to see it I'm honest now sure that's that's not sarcastic that's as honest as I can be in my life I studied 40 years on this thing and I want to see it if you can find it in there where Moses is it's okay to do this or what this and you know that look when a man had taken a wife and married her and it come to passes find no favor in his eyes because he had found some uncleanness in her let him write a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house didn't say the kill her no right chapter 22 he's saying kill her now he saying send her out send her away divorcement is only used two times it's in those two verses right here and right here and it's used in Isaiah whenever I gave 50 something use one other time the word divorced is only one time and that's Jeremiah 3 and 3 and 8 uh divorce excuse me the word divorced is used four times six times in the Bible it's used three and the new 3 and old I gave them to you but watch let him r or reil or divorce me but what would you do if you came up with a situation you're Moses now and here we come up and there's a bunch of us come walking up and they say Moses we got this problem what should we do should we kill these women or what should we do he said you didn't understand you never understood the things I brought to you and he went before God and he said God what did he do now would it not be that Paul was saying the same thing Moses said I emphasized that while ago Mo I mean that yeah Moses said the same thing brother random would say that go on as you are remain as you are now look at the grace that's extended to this woman now I know they've argued that there's no name I'm not going to argue with nobody if argued this next verse and when she had departed out of his house she may go and be another man's wife I've argued with preachers on that that they said well see there he's telling her it's okay I said you are wrong he is not telling her to go do it he's saying she will do it he's not saying she may go and it's okay with me no but that's what got it all messed up with all them different marriages and different situations Moses what we going to do around and said there'd be people saying said Lord what can I do do I divorce her do I leave her I same thing had to be in the days of Paul right the same thing in the days of Moses hon his hearted people sincerely wanting to know the truth not just a bunch of junk that's you don't think I'm right I'm still going to make it like that junk of Pharisees that come out of the believe in the Bible certain way right right cuz they simply reminded Jesus that Moses gave him a writing of divorcement he said it wasn't so from the beginning he never had to answer anything else but there's no such thing as divorce why would a true Christian want to divorce his wife or a true Christian woman want to divorce her husband why for what reason that's right amen my whole point has been for what reason would you want to do this or do that but when it was misinterpreted theology that we didn't know the truth then there's a lot of marriages took place and what are you going to do you better run to the grace of marriage and divorce believe right cry out and pray God reveal to me that it's me you're talking about but see the reason to say that this won't work out he watch the Bible is right and when she depart out of his house that she may go and be another man's wife that's not okay for her to do it watch now and if the latter husband this number one guy and then here's number two guy he goes out she gets married if the latter husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement now he ain't got no right he ain't he can't plead number one case number one case the man has an exact right because she's unclean number two guys she ain't unclean so now you see they just started a bill of divorce and Moses knew they'd do that then they just started for any cause number two God didn't have no uncleanness of number one does so keep it in line number one number two okay and if the latter number two husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement and give it into her hand and sendeth her out of his house or if the latter husband die number two guy dies Y which took her to be his wife her former husband number one which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife that's right right come on after that she is defiled for that is abomination before the Lord and Thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the Lord thy God giveth to the from the earth amen it's not dealing down here but what's dealing up here this up here is a woman that she gets married and he finds some uncleanness in her something wrong referring to sexually wrong right okay that's right other words she's not a true virgin he puts her away he's got a reason to put her away and he's right he done it right you say well looks like that when her second husband married her then he come along and he would die I like the way it says that if the latter husband die why couldn't the first husband take her back now follow me right brother Brandon quoting him if I done something wrong number one my wife would forgive me but now what if his wife divorced him and married another man right uh-uh he can't take her back then that's right come on he can't take her back he can't take her back because she mad had she remained a true woman and then come back one day the goodness of his heart might could have took her back but once she got married to guy number two she was totally defiled and cut off from him right amen so is it with the denominations right you following me so here's the grace of marriage and divorce which is a word of God to the truth if she hadn't left and went off they could have come back together sure been a problem but it could come back Eve done that and Adam took her back right now that uncleanness go ahead brother and give a definition of it I like do this in front of kids but we got to do it okay amen now watch that word uncleanness if he finds some uncleanness in her it's the Hebrew word strong concordance 6172 now if he's find some uncleanness this is some uncleanness fits right here nakedness nudity sh shame pudenda pudenda if that's the way I'm pronouncing I'm trying that's right implying shameful exposure nakedness of a thing indecency improper Behavior exposed undefended figure te now you remember what the scripture says Deuteronomy man's taking a wife and find some uncleanness the Berkeley version of the New Testament says and comes to her dislike having found something improper in her now these are other translation right the lza translation says because he had found some o evidence of open prostitution right in her all right see we' solved the problem I hope in having you seen the grace because God did come down on Israel and okay what this doing and say go on as you are don't try to straighten this up leave it alone go on as you are and we know they messed it up and all of that cuz they've done the same thing in this message right they've messed it up all around the message but brother R said okay to do this okay to do that now go back and read the book but I'm just trying to declare one thing how simple it is women sisters girls don't let them boys touch you in the wrong place because that's what it can simply mean if you voluntarily now not somebody we've covered in the message all right boy grabs a girl rapes her that's not her problem no that's his problem kill him right it's not her problem cuz she couldn't help it but she's in the city and won't cry they killed her cuz she KN some where somebody could hear it or in other words she didn't go around and tell somebody somewhere see so the word uncleanness is nakedness nudity shame pudenda pudenda implying shameful exposure now you can look on down there and see what the word pudenda means all right roll that up toward make sure everybody sees it brother we'll listen on up Enda the external genital organs especially those of a female okay the external which goes down to the VV word from pudenda means the external T female Galia how you genitalia genitalia external organs right that uncleanness there doesn't have to be sexual intercourse that's right that's right girls don't let boys touch you in the wrong place don't do it you may have a problem if you allow it to be done right if you're fighting and it you understand what I'm saying brother Dale is trying to be right not to be wrong about it it's just allowing a person to Simply touch your organs is an uncleanness that's right you or to tell your daughters that and keep telling them over and over about it right cuz a woman can go to the bed and say I'm a pure virgin like Wade was talking about what they're doing now todays that they're claim that the girls and boys are not having sexual intercourse they're just having oral sex you know that way they go up to the day of their marriage I'm a virgin just remember this is supposed to be Christian things this is not to the world this is not a garbage can this is where we ought to be right in the Lord amen because see the man might have a right to put you away right abely but the main point I've been trying to make is one thing not for just any cause amen Moses had already laid down the law that stated a man would be killed for them things or a woman killed Paul said can we sin that Grace May AB he said God forbid Paul never was going out there and just saying everything's all right Moses found the people in that condition and said I'll give you a bill of divorcement then they started using it for just anything the real true Grace that the man brought don't you think that it would be a broken heart for him to come up just like I said whether it's the right or not you agree different that's all right Rahab the Harlot was allowed to marry that General and right out of there come the lineage coming down now did she do it just by haphazardly or was it the fact that maybe that Soldier loved her took her for his wife and then went over to the priest and said what can I do is any way sir that I can straighten this thing out he said there's a Grace if you can believe it a Grace for you if you can believe it you can really believe it not for everybody everybody won't take it that's right because if you don't go through the opening of the seals how in the world can you have a revelation about marriage and divorce but yet people come into message and two weeks into the message they're already so holler and I'm free I've got M marriage and divorces might straightened out how can it be straightened out if you don't know what it's about right you think it tears my heart out of you that's right I want to see people right and do what's right amen but you see we don't want to go the correct way brother randam said invisible union he said that old husband has got to be dead amen there's no problem no problem with a woman Mar another man if her husband's dead but remember what we brought out the other night and kept on bringing out it says only in the Lord right well I just going to marry anybody want to only in the Lord you're not thinking way that's right you children that's in this message you order to try to find a wife in this message amen he said well others didn't know I all right don't run around because somebody else did try to find you somebody in this message Amen to be your wife that's right but wait on who God sends you amen right am not just run off start hunting for the first one h wait on the Lord amen told you I got in trouble by saying I didn't like for girls to be married at 16 and four kids but 20 couldn't help it I just meant it but if that's what you wanted 16 and married that's all right that's your business you know but don't come up at 20 want a divorce right yeah he try to find some way of an excuse to get one I remember Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning let me quote brother random did he come on down to say it he said and it won't be over there it won't be David over there with a thousand life you said well who's he going to have don't ask me cuz they're not born again Christians that's right you're dealing with an entirely different group of people that's right right yeah do you see what I'm talking about Moses gave a Grace that's right they made it all kind of things amen but he told them people how to get rid of things and straighten it up and he said don't kill them don't kill them just send them out yeah and that woman went out she's the one that went out done the wrong thing by finding another man and marrying him the church truth is the truth I hope you understand come on come on let's stand again I hope you see the truth now Sunday the Lord willing will get into more or less who can divorce you know as far as we know it can't be the woman divorcing the man right we get in there what grounds a man has a divorce the title of the night would have been like a requirement for a divorce requirement of a divorce is to find something wrong you know and go and do it but mainly I would want us to see the grace cuz I've been studying this thing for over 40 years on one thing to find out where Moses gave a writing a divorce man I knew it was in Deuteronomy sure cuz that's the only place it could be cuz there's no other scriptures on it but then the Lord spoke to him and told me where it at told me I to bring it to you tonight the best I could do to see that Moses gave those people he straightened up things for them but he didn't give them a right to just go do anything he only straightened up what they had done behind that's right Grace straightens up what we do behind it doesn't straighten up future don't go pay for penants to to go out and do something wrong let it be the truth Brother Sam that uncleanness on the woman I sit in a court 20 years ago and this guy was charged with breaking his do do two two doors and uh they had two guys GC colist there and proved the both of them said for the state and for the defendant that they had been raped you know you know what I'm talking about interraction right what constituted rape in the state of Georgia is touching yeah all you got to do is just touch your female wrong right that's right that's that's why you leave it alone that's right don't don't touch in the wrong place tell your kids to not let nobody touch in the wrong place so now if you don't volunteer to do it is one thing but if you volunteer to do it that's right and how would these kids there talking about W and say I'm not joking you I had to person to send me a note that he said their wife confessed to them that she had never had sex with a boy but she had allowed the boy to handle her and she had handled him you know to a finished Climax and I I wouldn't answer what could I answer I don't know I'm not the authority but you see say you mean I got to go back now and tell my husband right that's your choice that's your choice well do you want to go back and talk to him about things like that cuz that's what I've always told you when it comes down to a wedding I don't ask questions right I ask have you ever been married before or have you ever been engaged and then I say you must go now and talk over your life because when it's stated in the marriage to let them come forth and out and you know say or forever hold you peace and I'm glad I said said that where remember uh Robie and Ruth wants to redo their wedding vow Sunday okay so if anybody else comes along wants to get up the idea we have a lot of done whatever but Robie and Ru wants to do their I think it's their 20th I believe that's right 20th or 20 something wedding believe might be 20th they wanted to do their wedding V so I'm glad I preached all the night to find that out and remembered I supposed to tell that all right let's 194 really anybody have a need the alter's open the nations are Israel
