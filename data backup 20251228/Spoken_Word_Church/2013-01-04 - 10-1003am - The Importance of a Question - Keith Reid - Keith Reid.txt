what i'm going to do is die today aren't you man this time i'll ask brother collie if he'll come when the responsibility will all stand man good morning good morning we're gonna read this morning from uh first john both chapter no i think you know both chapters i was thinking this morning driving up out the town we're asking god for things that he's speaking loudly telling us what to do but we keep hearing we keep going a different direction never what did he tell us to go now time i thought this for a couple weeks i was trying to listen to a certain message brother brown preached but every time i put the recorder on i ended up on this different message so finally i stopped and listened to the one i kept it in lebanon and had lots of great things in there that god had on divine healing you know that we're trying to see and it just we need to stop sometime and listen amen what god is saying and that's what we're trying to hear already amen let's read this 4th chapter beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirit whether they be of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even already is in the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are god you're with us he that is not our god hereby holy the spirit of truth and the spirit of heaven beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god this was manifested the truth i mean would manifest the love of god towards us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him be loved if god so loved us we ought to also to love one another hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he has given us his of his spirit whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he is in god is our love made perfect that we have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world we love him because he first loved us and this is men that we from him that we who love god love brother also amen god bless you let's busy the number 51 inspire book glory to his name down at the cross where my savior died glory to his name glory glory to him is glory to his name glory to him fountain that saves from sin i am so glad i am is is me glory to his name glory to him is wonderful hey man let's turn over to uh 139 i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk the pilgrim way man that's 139 this farmbook i see is hallelujah yes i'm for the spirit has control jesus satisfies my souls hallelujah well there's no bursting for the things long ago oh oh oh hallelujah yes hallelujah that's wonderful let's turn to 524 every promise in the book is mine is it yours this morning every promise in the world is my is is is amen and you know what you know i read the bible and tried to one time to read it fast as i could you know it'd take you quite a while to read it but because it's a big book but you know everyone's a promise and it's mine so then i love to read it but i like to read it slow and where i can get to the meaning of what's there right amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord we had a good time last night at the bible study we had a large crowd too it was really a large group and we had a wonderful time i was shipping together last night and all brother sister reed got to be with us so had a good time and do it but we're just glad to be here this morning glad to be able to say that we are his children and we've come to hear from our father all right then we believe that what as the ministry speaks unto us that is hearing from god true amen so let's just believe it that way everybody knows brother keith read and let's just pray that the lord would bless him today as he would bring the word of the lord unto us because that's what we gathered for let's sing then open the eyes of my heart because that's what we want to do i want god to open our eyes of our understanding to where we could see him just talking a little bit more and letting more of them come on in is coming up from the sun just good but just just remember that and pray that the lord would bless our brother okay amen let's sing unto the lord i shining in the light of your glory holy shining in the light of your glory pour out your power here oh open the eyes of my praise the lord amen it's glad to be in the house of god this morning amen we're glad to see all the brethren amen and um just come for fellowship this morning amen you know i tried i mean say back home you know if somebody comes in you know you are on the trial amen we just come to fellowship around the word of god amen praise god that which is already being spoken and proven amen has been said over and over and over again so this morning i'd like to bring you greetings from the church spoken word tabernacle in lincoln jamaica and um brother brady over in farm town said to um bring his greetings to you all and um so we just want to extend that this morning just glad for the open invitation in lula amen and we've developed to be friends and the gospel and brothers amen and like precious fate amen and i thank god for you and for your stance and the word of god this morning amen i'd like us to eternal bibles in the book of saint matthew chapter 24. amen just like to even really glean over things this morning that we have said before at home and we've been true and um you know just like to encourage your heart and the word of god this morning amen praise god i mean certainly we don't preach outside of jamaica the way we preach in jamaica and so you forgive us for that amen praise god and um i remember um you know we brother tim um has been my friend for years and we've always stayed at their home and um you know we were talking one day and um his wife says she said sister cheryl said um she thought that when we speak to each other we were actually speaking french because they didn't understand the word that we're saying well it's that kind of french that we speak back home but it's really just a broken english amen praise god so we just thank god for all things amen praise god amen said matthew 24 let me just read from verse one just like to read a few verses down and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see that all these things verily i say unto you they shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the mount of olives his disciples came to him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and watch her with a sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take eid that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ i shall deceive many and he shall hear of wars and rumors of wars and see that he be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famine and pestilence and earthquake in diverse places all these are the beginning of sorrows may we bow our heads as we approach the author this morning our gracious god and our father lord god we come to your god believe in you the lord god you are the alpha and the omega lord you are the alpha of our faith this morning and lord god you are our omega lord god you're the one that says open your mouths and i was filled with words therefore lord god we rely not on our own intellect this morning but lord god you know every heart and every vessel that is gathered there this morning lord god you know our needs even more than we know them this morning heavenly father we pray that you take the lumps of clay that you are foreordained and lord god may you use us oh god for your own glory bless every heart remember the sick and the afflicted and the downcast and the dispossessed lord god we pray god by your mercies that oh god you'll be with your children in the troubled world that we're living in bless us now as we look to you and believe you in jesus name we pray amen and amen praise god you may be seated i don't know if everybody reason with themselves and in their heart the way i do but um you know most times the things that i preach and the direction that i go to you know might be i was traveling by myself and i was thinking amen you know something comes in my mind and i begin to reason on this thing and think about it and think what the scripture says and you know bring it to the message and and all of that and and the next thing you know it is something that i'm going to be speaking on right now but you know i mean god deals us in in many different ways and um you know there was something that i was dealing with back home and you know this morning early in the morning i was up early and i was just thinking you know meditating in my heart and the word of god and this thing came to me the importance of a question right you know and that's what i'd like to speak on this morning you know i remember my early years and the message um you know i get to realize that um there were some things you know practice that you you should not do in the position that i was in you know if you see if you ask questions somebody says oh you know he's asking questions and it means like that he's questioning what we believe but bravery you know brother branham said question makes a strong church and i believe that as a believer you've got to ask yourself questions about even your own standing with the lord and so you know i was thinking about this as a you know as i thought you're the importance of questions to a church you know my experience does not might not be your experience of but we find that you know even in our own thoughts if we hold on to something and we never question ourselves then we'll never go any further but even when i claim that i hold on towards the word of god i must question myself like is this really the truth right are you with me now we find that medical science i mean it is based upon questions right you know they they've got a way that and they've dealt with a certain thing one time and hey you know question arises as they begin to research more and i mean more light shine on the things that they're looking at so because there's a question they move to another level you know one time in normal signs it used to be that they thought that the world was flat and everybody feel that when if you travel so far in one direction you're going to reach the end of the earth but something happened and they realized that if you start at one point and you keep going and you're going and you're going you get back to the same point that you were before i mean so there's an improvement in knowledge but the world is not flat but it's work wrong right amen you know brethren the word of god is not based upon the same concept right because it's based upon the divine revelation of god that if a man is a revelation that comes from god he has really the mind of god amen and god is never learning right he's infinite and his first thought is always this thought are you there with me everybody comes to us by revelation when we first earned it and we have it in a concept right and we ponder these things uh hey as you move on with god then god begin to show you and add to your experience amen i remember my early years in preaching you know i started out preaching in you know going with people that were going to the prison and you know we would have meet with the inmates and you know we have a service and you know one time we went and you know there was a a lot of women that takes part in that ministry so whoever the men were then they were the ones that take the lead and so this time we went and um you know one brother went and he went to place guitar and everything and you know there's an experience there when you go through these great big gates and they they close them and the the evan metal begin to shutter it just does something to your nerve and so my friend went with his guitar and when he gets there he realized that you know the tears was just running down his eyes to realize this this fast place and the waste of human life and he just couldn't stop the tears so they said you know brother you've got to preach so that's how i start preaching amen but that was an early experience but you know i traveled to america the first time and i i went around evangelizing and i was at a certain place preaching and i preached the way i always preach and you know i never used to use a quota i did read a few books and and all of that and the brother came up after it preached and he said he said brother i mean you mean to tell me you've you've left from all over the ocean and come here and that was all that you've got to say and i'll tell you what and you know the brothers are with me and you know the ones that took me i was a you know i was just a young man and you know they begin to try to defend me and says you know you should not embarrass the brother like that and so but i tell you one thing it never really embarrassed me it challenged me upon the word of god amen that you are to study the bible to study to show yourself a proof of god a workman that needed not to be ashamed because what we have brethren is that god has sent us a prophet amen you open the word of god to us i mean what is it if we take that word and we put all the books in their places on the shelf and we've never read them and then we go by our own intellect to try to present the word of god are you there with me everybody then we realize there is something in this world right amen brethren i'll tell you every change of life every change of dispensation it started upon questions are you there with me hallelujah and we found that when john the baptist came on the scene even there was the scribes and the pharisees and the sadducees and then all these uh i mean but john came and he came with a message that did not necessarily agree with what they were saying in the day even there were questions that they had and god was going to answer these questions uh him and brethren you know sometimes uh maybe we come and we all want to agree with one another we all want to say what each other say amen but when john came on the scene he came with a message that was radical he came with a message that was different he came with something that let them question their own standing in the word of god him and john him as it came there amen look at this man dressed in rags hallelujah amen john he said and hold the hatches laid onto the root of the tree they never heard that before or you who tell you to flee the rock to come yet brother branham said looking at them in that day you couldn't put a finger on their lives but god was going to bring a change amen are you there with me amen then men begin to realize that there was more of god than we have and they begin to move with the light of god when jesus came hallelujah you know the people are on the great expectation they were looking for a deliverer they wanted a deliverer and if they wanted somebody to come and to remove this roman power he may stand in the position and then hungarian israel would have their king their only power but jesus didn't come for that purpose amen amen we notice the church ages all they came on your brother bran us he said in every new church age begins because him and men begin to fall away and remain begin to question him in what they had amen and god begin to reveal to them you see braver in in question is an inquiry yeah and brother brennan said in that message deep call it onto a deeper he said if there's a more of god to seek after there's a more of god to receive amen are you there with me even if you sit there and never search for any more than you have you will never move from where you are are you there with somebody remember you've got to question it hey man see there's more that i can receive amen when brother branham came out on the scene remember now the turn of the century aiming in jesus street has started him in a brand new move of god and the gifts of the spirit was now in the church potentially amen they begin to move forward amen there were tongues and prophecy and healing and they began to believe god for what the scripture said in the book of acts are you there with me and the church now moves to another foundation and where god was fixing to do something and then god rolls up somebody in the baptist church right in the cradle of the day amen and you know somebody asked a question hey man what about his life because of the ministry god protected that gift and then brought him a certain way amen he questioned the baptist church he read the scripture and he told dr davis he said that when you baptize me i want you to baptize me according to the book of acts yeah right hallelujah god was to do something here all these established churches heyman of the day you had to be in the ransom but somebody came and stepped out of line somebody asked question of the church that there was no answer and so what you've got to do every time there's a question answered and there is no answer that you've got to go seek out and find amen hallelujah is this all that we should have or should there be more amen i notice in the early church the bible says that when they came together they dispute for days upon matters of the word of god and you know in all of those uh they never went away well a few times you've seen the little things uh you know that paul and barnabas they they and they moved to one direction because they were all upset and with the question and the answers and all of that really yeah him and there were men that came in that says hey except you be circumcised after the manner of moses you cannot be saved and they said upon this we had great dispute and people had their feelings hurt hello but what did they do at the end of it right it was moving them on another plane are you there with me right so there's gonna be questions and challenges upon what you believe right now i find this if i don't want to be questioning what i believe it means that what i'm holding on to is really shaky right oh yeah amen hello somebody amen but at first before you actually have got to ask myself because i need to know if this is a truth hallelujah so what a question does it changes the paradigm upon which you believe right amen if there is no question then what we have is a consensus and conformity right of the assumptions and the values of the practice but somebody must step out of the ranks you look when the prophet left off the scene i mean what it was what was the ministry it was the acts of the prophet right well if you never fished with him if you never answered it you had no say hello because that was a paradigm to agree together and every man that stand on the pulpit was merely solving puzzle you know when you give a child a puzzle and they put it together the first time and then what they do it's finished so they pull it apart again and the next time they're going to do it they're going to solve the same puzzle yeah and if you said well if you take a child and you said well i'm going to learn him now technical skills of his motor actions of putting things together and so you buy him a nice puzzle and so today the first day he put the puzzle together and tomorrow you pull the puzzle apart on you he puts it together again and the next day and you do that for one year you know what happened to that child and his mind is deformed right right exactly are you there with me in his mind is the form because he never go any further than he was before brethren can i say would you give me leave to say that in your christian experience might be spiritually there are many deformed people in their spirit because they never challenge the word of god or never move out of the paradigm that they stand upon amen and so what we have is concepts and the values of how we dress and conduct ourselves and the practices that we have in the church but brethren we're in a quest not to stay here we're in a quest to get out of here so something's gonna happen somebody's gonna step on the line and tell me something that will change my money exactly right that's right when brother brennan preached the seals what he did he went to question and answers and you know they said well well these questions never match what he preached but i answered the question what could they ask because the position that they were in when you're true preaching the seals they had no more revelation than they had when they started to preach it exactly hello and brethren you got to be honest with yourself it took you years to even start to conceptualize the things that he was really saying back then hello somebody and i tell you i took up all notes that i preached on and i've looked at it again and i said my i start to write more things to it because i see more light upon that very verse and that very quote that i've read before amen you know so somebody comes along and they said i mean i have you ever read christ the mystery of god revealed well i've read it 10 times why don't you read it again right exactly right hello somebody well why don't you read it again and update your experience in the word of god i mean somebody said and then what about marriage and divorce but i've heard that already i mean but why don't you read it again hello somebody and update so jesus was not afraid of questions so here it is the glory of jerusalem in the day was a temple that solomon built if there was a visitor in jerusalem you couldn't leave the city without seeing this right and so they begin to show him this building they need to tell him and when he was dedicated the priest could not even miss him right because the glory of god was in the house that day oh man what a story and jesus i didn't heard that they thought that he would have said my oh glory let me go in it let me read upon the history jesus said see all this there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be pulled down right my hello exactly it's challenging now right the pride of the city is challenging now that which they stand upon and so what it does is generate questions because you seem to have something that is different brethren i'll tell you what i'm not afraid of something that seems different right but you've got to test it by the urine right now you're there with somebody hello because i tell you if you can't stand up to this you've got to put it out right right amen your people say well we we know more now than brother brennan knew back then if what he had was divine revelation then that was the mind of god right and you're telling me that 40 years after god has learnt more hello as god learn tomorrow hello somebody am i right but yet there was a lot said that we just never get it you've got to be honest with yourselves hello and you know i said well when i see this hey man you know the 1985 when i came in but i need to look at it again yeah hello somebody amen because the old experience that you had if that'll bring you to a camping off you wouldn't be here this morning but god has more for you right right and that's why you're here so bravery let us realize that god is still in the fixing business you still working on me to make me what i ought to be hallelujah so we've had normal times right hello and we really glow in there the normal times that we have where everything was instability right yeah you know you know nothing happened that caused a star or a change or a challenge of what we believe right and brethren i came up and women thank god for false doctrine because they let us challenge how we believe and tested by the word and see if these things are the truth sorry glory bro i i tell you the true believer you ain't got a fear false doctrine you see brother unfair and then i'm getting to thoughts i gotta fear that all right right do you know what you've got on the inside yeah right that's right and you know the only reason you don't know what you've got is because it has not been put to the test right amen hallelujah so they asked him the question three simple questions when shall these things be now i'd like to say that scripture has double meaning and yet jesus was standing right there with them and he was answering their question but yet there is still a portion of that question still hanging today right when shall this when shall it be that there will not be one stone upon another right if there is a bible question there is an answer and i'll tell you one thing i've learned is that when a question is you you know i i've got that with me if somebody asks me a question i start to talk it's not a strength it's a weakness because sometimes you start to answer before you really consider the question i know you're you're mad of god well you're different from me but i i tell i'll tell you that's the way i am if you ask me a question i started to say something amen without sometimes even considering the question right jesus tell them he could have simply said for under titus in 1870 he meant this is going to be destroyed but yet there was something for the believer at that day he said matthew 24 15 jesus began to tell them and yet as jesus was telling them what would have happened in that day there was an element of that for you today right amen amen right you see i'm praying that your flight been out like winter or in the summer day when they were the door of the city with the gate of the city will be closed either it's in jerusalem very niconda and they also let not come down and take his stuff out and i'm gonna flee into the mountains amen and all that had great significance but he speaks of the abomination that make a desolation when you see it standing in the holy place hello somebody but right there on that spot of rock that's holy ground from god there is a mosque of omaha may i say that christianity today has no place in jerusalem exactly because it's the abomination that make it desolate but then you go back to prophecy and you know that it's going to be moved out of its place hello somebody and so when you see these things fixing to happen it's not the end but it's coming close to the end right right you know the bible speaks as jesus begin to tell them i wonder how much they understood from what he was saying that day right and maybe all the understanding they had was to write these things down but aren't we thanking god that they did amen are you there with me somebody right you know the bible he says simple things and when were ready for for nation shall rise against nation he said brother keith but but today we're the world is stable yeah you know brethren i find that the time when people think that the world is stable it's the greatest war that there is right you know we said let us talk about the wars of our day yeah you know i was reading that the the u.s economy has always had a trade deficit in other words you are taking in more than you are sending out right and you know if you've got a business and you're buying in more than you're putting out then really you're in the red right brother branham said this nation is busting you're right hello somebody right now you said well look at all that we've got i mean i traveled over jamaica and i was looking at the us economy that is always in the red yeah because you consume more than you earn right right and i was looking in 1990 and 91 when there was desert storm they said it says that those were some of the few years that the u.s economy came out of the ring yeah right yet we say but that's times of war that's not the real battle right i know somebody but when you think it's peace and safety you know why you flourish that time because the allied nations were giving to america and they gave you more than you spent and so you came out of the red right but ever since that time this nation's economy is in the red exactly right hello and i i just show you a simple way that it's happening there are things that we're not looking at when we trade as nations you know i mean you you go and go back home and look in your cupboards and take all the products that you consume and look where they're made right look at the things that you love to eat and find out where they come from that if the borders are closed hello somebody if the borders become closed and you don't realize that your governments are closing down the borders and making heaviness about the nation but if they close the borders you're going to really suffer because you can't produce enough of what you're consuming hello somebody but you go to another nation go to china and you said oh but we are exporting to china and go find the american product in china it's there but where did they put it they put it where the people can't get it right and so what is it it's a battle a train right the nation shall rise against nations and kingdoms shall rise against kingdoms but you take a nation like england where the head of state is the queen but you know in actual fact the queen is just a figurehead that the house of lords in england which is a law-making body consisted of over 600 persons that the state had to feed them and care for them and they were there because of their lineage and positions and all of that really and so when tony blair was in power what he did he cut that down they were carrying as a nation too much baggage and so kingdoms against kingdom and politics were to listen to amen the the iraqi of the palace but the ants are turning around why because brethren that's prophecy in the name kingdom and many countries the kings of satan i speak ahead and feed from the people but what do they contribute to the people there is an inanimate somewhere and we think that the system of religion is set up to protect you you know somebody yeah we said oh why is it to that we don't do like the others do we don't go away they go we don't partake of the things that they partake of because god sent us a word advice in this day to wake us up and let us realize that the only ones that will not be deceived are those names that are written in the book amen amen find out where you're standing today find out your position he said this is the most deceiving age that there is hallelujah and so the first thing jesus tells them take heed that no man deceive you and you know peter must have been looking at john and says hey but but it's just us hey are you going to deceive me well i'm going to deceive you so what is he really saying yeah hello somebody right well what is he really saying remember right now brethren we take it within the framework of the church and you know back home i just had about six funerals in a row and so every time i started to preach there was a dead body right there before me and so i was scared other people would get in that condition but you know within the framework of the church you've got to watch it people said well you know i i nobody say anything bad about me until i come to church you know i i live a good life i i mean i always had friends but you know they they tell me they said brother another kid you know this happened to me and you you know what caused it brethren yeah brethren did this to me i said but it's a trying on your face and you know i'm not a guy who's very sensitive to things i said i said you want to talk about somebody talk about me because i'll tell you if you're a christian somebody's going to talk about you amen you know we want somebody to say the good things about you hey i'll tell you one thing the good things about you there's nothing to hold a conversation so they're gonna find something that doesn't look too good it's just the experience of a christian amen and so somebody leave the church and he said hey well what's your problem why you leave the church you know because they didn't really agree with me and they said this about me really hey i want you to find a house where they don't say nothing about you it's a spirit of deception i know somebody we want everybody to love everybody and everybody to say nice things about somebody oh britain i'll tell you what might be the things that are said about me where i am who i am today right exactly are you there with me you know i remember an experience i had when my boss called me he said i i'm i'm not reprimanding you he said i'm just trying to counsel you i said okay sir so i sit in the chair and you know in everything that they do you don't know it but there's a psychology to it and he sits in a real small chair and what he has in front of is a large big chair and so he said sit right there and so he's fill his chair but in your chair it's so wide so you look like like a little grasshopper to this monster there's a reason why they do that and so he began to tell me he said you know he said keith he said people say that uh you you always stuck in one position you you you don't really change you said uh and um you know we feel that um you know you're not really open to new ideas and and things like that and so and you know he begins to counsel and i sit with him and i listen to him carefully and um when it was true he said uh do you have anything to say i said i said no sir thank you very much and um you know i left and so you know i know what he was doing he thought that well i really haven't known i really get him because he says um i'm not going to reprimand you but that's what he's trying to do yeah and so what i did you know i went out and i i said well i've got to examine myself and i got to see you know what i need to do to improve what he says i'm not trying to find out if what he said is the truth or not because that's where we make our mistakes many times we're trying to search for the truth of what somebody say about you when what you ought to do is to work to improve right what the person say you are exactly because you know i i might tell you brother where if i said to brother i said bro you're just a guy that is hardening the past you know from the time i know you you've never changed you know brother wade could go to my big brother uh some another brother and says you know brother brother keith said this about me what do you think he's trying to formulate opinions to agree with his feelings and so you know what i did i i went and i i started to you know i've left college for that time might be uh 15 years or so so i said maybe i really get ruled in my thoughts so i go back you know and i start studying again and so you know the other day was leaving and he said to me he said keith he said there's something about you he said whatever you have to do you deliver it and you deliver it before time i said thank you sir and he was leaving now and you know you begin to tell me all the good things and you know he said i said sir i said remember the day when you you sit and you talk with me i said i took everything that you said and i began to improve on them really he couldn't believe it he couldn't believe but you know brethren that's what we ought to do that's what we ought to do you know we're trying to find an approval yeah for our position right right you know brethren i think what we we said well one thing i know i said well i i got the word and you know if i stand with anything i've got the word you know i need to be careful that in me having the word i stay in the position that i'm in with the word and not move on in the world are you with me and so bret i'll tell you a challenge will come from every side hallelujah let no man deceive you by any means one thing we know the elect cannot be deceived hello somebody but you know you can take everything that they say about you hello you know somebody said one time well your brother keith is a legalist and so i begin to go to find over the meaning of that really and i try to by the fact try to fight to justify that no i'm not because to be a legalist is this no i i don't need to do that right right i just take what you say and i begin to use that as a stepping stone and question myself upon these things real life now brethren as a believer you never have the approval of the masses don't try to get it hello somebody or if you fall on the line with god remember i tell you there's something there that's gonna challenge your faith to let you read the word brother brad said amen i'd rather be having tried to receive the holy ghost having already received it they have to be thinking that i've received it and i i got it right seeking to know nothing right as though i know nothing right that i might learn christ right for many shall come in my name saying i am christ i shall receive many many great anointing many great and in standing up on the concept that we believe but brethren challenge these things amen if a challenge come by the world what do we do do we say well i mean they're trying to challenge it hey let me prove it more let me prove it more go back and see if these things could be the truth right you know what i'll tell you one thing we never usually take time out today to listen to each other right we really don't listen to each other you know i i believe that they believe this and i and they believe that i believe this and we we never could have come together brother dale and said well let us i want you to speak and why you believe about this thing really you know one thing we don't know if you invite the minister over to preach a meeting you you don't tell him that hey man i want you to preach on this particular thing you said well you know i want you to come and just preach whatsoever in your heart well i've invited brother dale and i tell him i want you to preach on this specific thing this is what i want you to preach on hello somebody this is what i want you to preach on don't come preaching whatever you feel like preaching where you little i wanted to preach on this because we want to be challenged on what we believe right right and if i never heard anybody say it outside of what i believe how will i have a challenge to where i'm standing i'm trusting i'll help you this morning man hello you said well well i don't want to hear what they're gonna say but brethren i'll tell you what brother dave over the years somebody had to step out of line somebody had to say something that was even contrary to what everybody else believed and then men begin to seek out these things and see if it's the truth hello you know they said well well when joe coleman preached about the thunders but your nightmare that was an opening of a door right yeah of somebody to get into the message and to say what the prophet says hello somebody amen it's a question whether it was right or wrong but it opened a door that somebody's gonna stand up on something all right and if you challenge what somebody else believes then what do you believe about us right amen the importance of a question challenge it it's an inquiry and there's an inquiry about something we need an answer into it hello somebody so he asked about the grammar question one of the greatest questions i've seen halloween all the volume of condacorn doctrine what about the translation of the bride yeah right what about it exactly and brother branham said something that was really so simple he said it's just a change amen just a change and you say oh what about the translation of the breath it is just a change oh yeah there's all kind of change you know if i buy something out of a 100 bill i only cost 40 then i'm going to get back some change you know it's just a change but he went on hallelujah amen right and when he went down he talks about abram himself amen who cannot bring forth seed because there's no life of conception it's just a change right he's still with a question now but it's just a change just to change what's in you now yeah right a question hallelujah come on with me so simple right now just a change when he went on right glory what is this change hello amen and abram and sarah could bring forth the sun because you know she was born all right you know she couldn't bring forth seed hello right amen but he said god did something amen it turned abram to a young man again i turned sarah back to a young woman oh you mean it's just a change right we're still in the change now but look at the change and what change abraham you see what abraham now now in this way brother branham said what he had he kept walking amen he kept walking amen and as he walked are you there with me somebody as he walked he didn't mean putting one sec before another right as he progressed and in the old testament the bible said abram believed god that belief is faith he had faith in what god says sorry hallelujah and as he kept this faith it materialized amen that's the change but what tells you oh it's a metamorphosis amen it seems like what it wasn't before but yet there was something there right that god was using that which he had his faith hallelujah what a change it's going to be brave when i say what am i'm talking about this and i still haven't tried to figure out what the prophet really said right it's just a change that i believe god glory i remember as a young man when i was in high school there were days when i i just felt the power of god on me then there was something come over me i wanted to be prayed for by christians i just know that there was like a call there was something i need more of god and i quit going to church you know but i know that there was something there somewhere i'll tell you another experience in jamaica we have what we call the revival people spiritualism and i remember when i was a child they came into our community and they came to my house and i told my mom they said you know what one minor one time he came and he you wanted my mom to give me the little young man because there's a call of god in his life i don't understand these things hello yeah i didn't i didn't live like a christian i didn't do anything that i was supposed to do are you there with me but for yeah there was something there that i didn't understand right but then god began to materialize that experience the god that i was searching for he there were things that i mean i'd see them do and there was something about it but i just don't have the desire to do that yeah it's just convict me if i do that because there was something there somewhere hallelujah and so i i i came to a point in my life that what i started to do i start to ask questions oh yeah i read the bible yeah let no men fool you through philosophy and very deceit after the things of the world and not after christ and i began to ask questions of people i thought that should know and i know if there's a question there somewhere there's an answer but i didn't know where to turn yeah right i didn't know where to turn to find the answer but god works on two ends you know i remember when i first met henry brady at school you know we live in inland and he lives by by the beach and i'll tell you what an holiday he invited us to be at his house i mean we want to go his father is a pastor they go to church but hey that don't concern us really we want to go to the beach i think we go and we we we we we give moments and sit there in church and listen but then tomorrow this is a real thing and you know friends that we used to travel with and go there together everybody are still the same way today yeah right and something got a hold of me right it's just and god's gonna take you out of this that you are in this morning and how will it be brethren i'll tell you what we're gonna stand one day in the position of almighty god hallelujah amen the dead saints that are gone before us they're waiting on us amen for this change yes sir are you here with me amen and the prophet of god said it's just a change it's just a change but look at the vast hallelujah i mean aspects of our lives that this change has encompassed it's just a change but breaking what i know these are the words that i believe now right that might be i struggle with the lying there in the bed and i go to the public and i preach a message and then i go back home in my corner and i'm challenged yeah right and i say to myself i'm going to change direction i'm not going to continue with that because i don't know if they're getting it i don't know if they see what i see yeah i was preaching oh he was saying and thus said the lord can never fail but jesus he never said no say the lord right you never said this said the lord he said but i say unto you but i say unto you right and brethren do you know that they are sayings that you've got them on the board now there are i love that amen are they waiting on you right are you there one brother branson and when we get on speaking terms you know i thought when i first heard that that you know when i first heard that some of us ministers weren't even talking to each other when you get us speaking terms i thought that it meant when we start to talk to one another hello but then i walk a little bit more i realize when i begin to say what he says i know somebody and i believe that bride one day just the change right what is the translation of the just the change and i believe we're getting one day where this change hallelujah and even the dead saints that are waiting amen hallelujah will hear your voice your voice and that loved one that you lay down there in the grave and you say oh he's not there that's just a cactus brother bran said hallelujah amen amen that god will come down picks up that glorified body and when these sons appear before you again i thought that i seen brother son so yesterday i don't know but he just seemed like just the change amen hallelujah all right and what is happening to you right now one day we're going to say but paul says what brother branham said but i say right amen and the missing limbs and the problems in our feet and the blood pressure that is going up and down and the sugar diabetes that we can we the doctors can't bring them under control one day you're gonna hear him out just a change just a change because somebody asks a question right yeah amen amen amen waiting on another question remind me one of these uh hallelujah women saturday nights when when you get there on the downstairs of a meeting that is not really important it's just bible study yeah some little believer or you say oh it's just brother so and so who is that it's just brothers also you ask a question you don't have to answer that we ask a question amen hallelujah if we understood the importance of questions we would have gone back and welcome what kind of person yeah ask this question what kind of person it was that asked a question like that and all the seals were preaching and all the questions were my accent oh brother brown said also whether it's 700 or 7 000 is this a new revelation that you've got uh yeah yeah brother abraham well why when should we wear our sleeves you you know if brother brandon if your wife does this and her husband does that well what should we do brother brandon should i continue preaching what kind of person asked this question right right hollywood that encompassed our lives not that question he answered it my brother told me one time i was looking at the code what brother graham said he said he said oh that's just a cod that's this question an answer you you can't elevate a question an answer to a question over a quote yeah i didn't know that i i didn't know that until i heard him saying because i i never even thought of that right at all but that's what he says yeah hello somebody right amen just a change that brethren within that change you're walking and one morning between six and nine and when you went to bed you you took your vitamins and your medication and you can't cure it it can't bring your healing but it's a holy place the doctor tell you and your faith and confidence in your doctor this world let me go to bed yeah and the next morning and what he says just a change you ain't got it no more right because the power of gravity is the power over you no more something changed hallelujah and the ones you heard but somebody asked a question oh hallelujah you said oh you know we were a bible study there there were some questions but sister so-and-so asked a question yeah you know brother dale had to go back that night and he couldn't sleep i don't know i guess might be all preachers is like that yeah but you pace the floor you think about it and god really wants to bring it to something but you you've got to go back and and look somewhere where he said something and go to the scripture because you have no peace until you have that release right right it's just in your change the brethren do we realize the tremendous responsibility yes what we say to one another one day one day your body will be released of all the sufferings of this time i remember i was preaching there in church just a few weeks ago and i was sister staring mom she was sitting she always said to my right and you know there's people it's kind of like you're aiming connor and so you always focus on them amen because they they kind of give a little bit of approval right yeah and i was preaching about this and i said what job said and she threw her hands in the air and started regis she said you know so she she don't believe she have the fit to make the change she's gonna go by the grave i was preaching and something just got a hold of me i felt so strong about it i said mom and i tell you what and that blood pressure that keep it going up and down and up and down so you ain't gonna worry about it no more because it will all be all right two weeks after two weeks after yeah she was there sitting said she was watching a preaching tape with submission and she just got upset she feel like going to bed and she stand up on her feet and she said jesus and she felt right back there and that was it she was gone amen brethren it's just a change and it tells you when you see these things hallelujah that my change is in preview came back and i tell the church so we talk about these things and we said the dead saints that have gone before us they're gonna come back and when you see them then you know hello like jesus resurrection and they appeared unto many i said who is it that's going to be on that side for the deal you know you've got some that's gone and on the other side to god you're not certain you're really not certain where they stand with god yes they serve god for many years when you come to the summation of their lives you question right yeah that's a little truth right but when you know a faithful one that's on the other side it's an advocate you've got when i see you again then i know right i'm in the change what a question brethren i'll tell you what as you read it question yourselves we're not questioning god because god has already given it to us amen but we're asking each other amen and what do you see in what you say do you really believe it brethren it doesn't matter what happened to me i believe the word is true amen i believe brethren that the dead saints are gonna come and walk on the face of the earth and i believe we're gonna have a body change amen and i believe that problems that you've got in your bodies know i know they're gonna leave you because brethren we can prove them by scripture scriptural proof and the reality is right there before us all right amen right hallelujah amen the importance of questions it brings on what god want to say to you exactly so they asked jesus a question you know what he did he turned around and asked them a question right and when he asked them the question you know what they did they begin to murmur the answer that they already know yeah right but if we say he's gonna say yeah right because they already know they are concerned but they want him to say something else yeah yeah right right yeah what do you want to hear this morning right what do you want to hear hello somebody right you want to hear that you can live anyhow when you still make it hello you want to hear you can stop exactly where you are and walk out and say well i'm predestination i'm gonna go no further if you were you would continue in your position i believe in the end of the display brother branham said god knowing what he would do hello you said well i can stay home i don't gotta come no more i've got i've got enough tapes i've i've heard enough how many times a scroll was read in nazareth before he came that day but that day when he came he found the place where it was written right there's a scripture that was foreign for that day amen and when he speak the words many young men had read the scroll and sabbath mornings oh yeah but they look at one another and said never a man right of all the priests by succession that we've had read the scroll never again amen read it like he writes hallelujah but some hypocrites was in the congregation that went back to say but we know his mother and father yeah you see they're trying to discredit right hello they try to discredit the one with the revelation right because if you bring this credit on the one with the revelation then the sheep might be scattered let no man deceive you by any means amen right hello somebody know you you know if you can know something about where gail you said well i'll tell you what he can preach but i'm going to listen i want to know something about samuel dean now with this credited person and when he preached yeah you're trying to find an excuse to pack you off into hell all right amen let no man deceive you i know somebody your question is not to discredit but your question is to open the door hallelujah that more of what is there i might have it right but when i reach that point brother branham said there is a predestinated position right now when we get there we're going to leave out of here oh so let us leave the principles let us go on to perfection let it challenge you oh i don't understand a word that he said when you need to go read right hello you quit because you didn't hear understand the words that he said hey somebody at least you know something about yourself that you don't know if you don't know go find out right bravery this is not the day of ignorance all right that day i'm in there and just pops hello somebody i mean this day's a day where you say what's in your mouth amen see what god has given to you let us put it to the challenge right amen my brother burns the greatest anointing is for when a man utters and he's found wrong by the urine yeah to add grit right hello somebody i'm gonna quit to admit to admit that i i didn't know what i was saying right admit that he's wrong that's a problem with god that i didn't know hello somebody and i need to find out i need to find out do you think god knows what he's doing god select his church the way god wants it amen i know that in lindsay i'm not the best preacher but you know what i know god called me for that position hello and so hey they can challenge me on that that's their business but i know god called me for that position i'm going to worry about that you just don't know your position what god called you for and once you agree with god hallelujah then you were in agreement with all men all right hello somebody you know i turned the brothers back home i said i want you to study and come take the sunday school because we want to ask you we want to ask you concerning what you're saying right because we're not trying to discredit you we want to know because god is a fight for ministry hello somebody questions brother bram said makes a strong church are you here with me if you've got a question listen there is an answer and sometimes i might not have all the answers you matter all the answers but the answer is there somewhere right yeah maybe it's not time yet right hello somebody right now man today was a little bit more we're gonna see about what he said about the change but until we get there we keep walking like abraham and we know as we walk it will materialize around our experience of reverend keep walking keep walking in the light of god that you've received because let me tell you it's going to take a radical turn the direction that you're going in to get us out of this pistols that we're living in you know because honestly some of us don't want to come out yeah right that's right you know your business just take off yeah your life just gets set yeah you just have to live the american dream yeah oh what do you want to get out of this but god is appointed time and when god get ready you gotta move are you okay with me so britain asks a question if it's on your heart people say well if i ask them that they're gonna think that i'm not with them no but a question because somebody asks a question we have more light on the word of god and that life that we have on the world is changing our bodies right now are you here with me amen questions can be disruptive but questions can be true i told the church last week i said you know your wives that got the husbands that got up with it seemed like they've got the devil all over them and they begin to ramp and rage and shout in the house you said you just simply asking a question did you pray this morning it's a good question yeah but you better know who your husband is before you ask him that question after if he's a true christian it will come will calm him down amen praise god but we're here because we want to ruin the lord amen we're working on that change right and brethren i'll tell you we're not afraid of any challenge right because it's all of that challenge that god hope himself to us and reveal our position all right in the word of god may we buy our heads everywhere hallelujah i know many would like to be remembered this morning lord remember me lord lord for the questions of our heart this morning lord maybe there's somebody here this morning that has pondered for years something or god they don't understand in their own lives the law that spirit affair has caused them god not to say for the releasing of god by the power of almighty god lord jesus might be the change of our bodies he's in our mouth to this morning the lord jesus as we look at these lord we see john coming on the scene he didn't come for popularity because lord what he said would push all men from him the lord god there was something that you gave him and there's something you have given us this morning heavenly father we pray that oh god somebody would come to that position of god to realize that lord god we've been pressing in the right direction but lord god there's still more that that's got to come out because lord god we still can't see god how you bring the healing of our bodies but yet lord god we're looking for an eternal healing of our bodies that we will seek no more the lord god there is some that's got to go by the grave but lord god the fear of death is still holding and lord god what will we do until oh god that fear has been rolled away lord god we believe that revelation will clarify our misunderstandings so lord god give us that spirit who got to listen and to seek after and to search lord like you tell them go read the scriptures for in them you say that you've got eternal life and these are they that testify of me oh god we pray that there's something this morning that was said that would challenge our hearts to get back to the world that which we've already seen and that which we have already said that oh god that which you want to say you might stay within us bless us god remember the sick of the afflicted the don't cast the lord god and in this in the midst of this troubled time lord god those who've lost oh god the joy of their experience the lord god your spirit will be with your children as we walk on into this metamorphosis bless us god as we thank you for everything and believe you in jesus name we pray amen amen musicians would you come i was thinking while he was preaching on it and that thought come in my mind you know a question that always has one of two reactions and you can call them chemical reactions or whatever you're gonna call them but it causes a reaction in your body it's either the fact that you become conscious that something you need to work on or do as the brother would say and that would bring a tearful attitude with him our questions will bring a snicker in your heart to say i already know that so questions and things will always do one of the two things which one does it does i don't really know that see that's a reaction in your body do we need to work on it right enjoy the message amen 5 30 5 39 anybody have a need me away from holy spirit me among you later don't worry about it the holy spirit will always keep your transition straight it may take a while yeah but it will bring you to the straight point away you know a question come one time in heaven when sin had entered the picture and said we'll go well you know what it caused someone to come the question or someone to come right don't never worry about a question because i never claim to have all the answers i have a lot of questions myself but i claim to know one who has all the answers yeah that's the point you remember my story it's not a person that studied that knows everything because you get all messed up it's a person that knows who to go to to get the answer to that question see that's the way we want it to work so we know who to go to though we go to the lord make sure you tell our brother how much you appreciate the message looking forward this afternoon and believing that the word of the lord will be given unto us right father we thank you for today we ask you to just bless each one and we truly believe lord that questions does make a strong church because it makes us realize realization and to get out into our own lives and see is that right that people are saying about me am i right am i doing this questions in our heart and lord then always you'll be there with the answers we love you and we thank you just give our brother rest that he may be able to ministering to us this afternoon have your way down goddess forgive our sins and lead us in jesus name amen you diss me and spread one foreign foreign and i'll see you in the rapture me foreign dear my loved ones let me say that there should be is day
