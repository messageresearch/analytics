negative so appreciate the Lord for that and so we're gonna just keep doing what the doctor wants us to do and waiting on a good report so I'm leaving everything will be just fine fishing what's that yes but nobody wants to nobody wants to have anybody draw it I've always told them that if I felt like that if it was it was natural for them to draw blood God would have put a valve in just you know I don't know I don't mind if you get stuck but don't come out of needle with me like I always told them I ain't got a tattoo and ain't never had one and I didn't think I'd ever get one because I didn't want anybody saying they were gonna stick me a million times with a pen for Anita I didn't need that so just appreciate the Lord let's just look into the scripture tonight and I know brother Dale mentioned we were actually brother Tim hymns Sunday and but just one member of G Martin's family and brother Martin he was 85 years old pastored New Testament church in in the Hickory area of North Carolina since 1963 and he was a real soldier of the cross and had the opportunity to minister to church and really precious people and you know they just without without a shepherd right now and we know the Lord is the shepherd they'll just remember them I know that he's a the Lord delivered brother Martin a number of times over the last little while he's had a lot of problems with his blood pressure and art and he got an infection and they were trying to clear that up and if they if he could have got over that they were going to put a pacemaker in and the other day brother Richie Douglass sent me a text message saying that the blood flow to his intestines had quit so they called the family and but one thing about it we know where he's at this evening so appreciate the Lord and and you know you look back over you know real soldiers of the cross been been in the way for a long time and been a real test testament testimony tool to a lot of us and just appreciate them and I'll just continue to remember them in prayer and he'll just Nelson brother Kim Hughes he's getting ready to go overseas and I was so got to talk to him Sunday and he's getting ready to leave and so certainly won't remember them he's going to Germany and he's going big he's going to be going different places and everything so I'll just remember them appreciate the ones that are on the on the field going in and doing and you know like I said if you can't go send somebody and it's certainly one thing we can do is we can pray for them right amen so just appreciate that and let's just look into the scripture this evening go to Acts chapter 1 and very familiar Scripture and y'all just pray for me this something's been on my on my heart for a while and you know you try to find you try to find what to say sometimes and sometimes you just can't get away from it you just keep coming back and it's the fault kept coming back but it's like well Lord what should you know because you're looking for more than just just the fault and the felt just stayed and say and so y'all just pray for me the night or just help us because I do believe God called us to be a witness and so you know if God called us God equips us right and you know if you don't if you see the hour which we live and one of the things we look at you know if you see the hour in which you live and see the condition that the world is in if you look at the life of Abraham and one of the things that that struck me was you know God told Abraham because Abraham was a friend of God that he said how can I do anything unless I tell Abraham about and Abraham went forth and he told God because he said he saw the judgment and the wickedness of the people he said I'm gonna destroy them and you know Abraham he just said were Lord that'sthat's the Word of God just go ahead he went to God and he said Lord he said if I can find 50 they said we Sparrow he said if I can find 10 righteous and he said he said I'd spare my pinion he had a burden for the people and the question is do you and I have that same burden so let's just speak to the author before we read the scripture this evening our Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful Lord we just love you for all that you've done for us Lord you sent your word and you healed us Lord you delivered us from our destruction though we know that the devil is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but Lord we're but greater is he that sent us than he that's in the world Lord we know that you equipped us to fight every power of satan and we know that it's just going to continue to to go and just continue to get worse but lord we know that we're fortified behind your word and all were just so thankful for that Lord we just pray tonight you just give us ears to hear and hearts to receive and mouth to speak Lord Father that we just just look unto you and Lord let us just get out of the way and Lord you come and speak tonight father just use my just use this vessel the Lord and I just want to just be yielded to the Holy Spirit tonight Lord for each one is sick and needing tonight Lord that are afflicted farther I know that you've already finished it at Calvary and all we just pray that you just lift the people's faith tonight Lord whatever received the receive whatever they have need of lord I just pray for the Martin family tonight Lord father you just be with the church there and the family as a comfort in it as a God Lord Jesus because we know that you're the ever-present help in a time of trouble you're a comforter and or just make yourself real to them and father we just pray for the ones that around the world the different ones we just pray for brother Akash should be coming in Sunday Lord we just pray that you just bless each one Lord the ones that are on the foreign fields lower the ones that are going lord I pray that you be with him and anoint them and bless them but we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Acts chapter 1 verse 1 says the former treatise have I made of the lawfulness of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the disciples whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which says he ye have heard of me for God truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord without this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth Amen god bless you gnight you may be seated and so just won't speak about us being a better witness and you know the this if you look up the word witness you know there's there's three times three aspects of being a witness and you know many times the first the first part of being a witness an individual who being president personally sees and perceives the thing a beholder a spectator or eyewitness you know brother Branham said you know a witness had to be qualified because before they could actually get up and speak they actually have to be in the proper accordance to the law to be a witness for whatever they're going to be witnessing and so they actually have to have seen it or heard it or whatever it took to be the witness so that's the first thing that has to happen second part it says a person who gives testimony as in a court of law and that's actually speaking what you what you've know but the third one is kind of what I want to get on to a person or thing that affords evidence affords means to supply to provide and so when we look at that because as an example of this is you know the dead being raised we know in the Bible it talks about the dead being raised we know God raises the dead because you know we know in the Old Testament for example you know I know if y'all can find it y'all let me know but I can't find any place in the Old Testament where they were ever given the Commission to raise the dead but we know Elijah Elisha raised the widow woman's son but he didn't have a commission for that but you know what he had he had the ability because he had the power of God upon him to a do that and he went in and you know he was actually able to you know you know raise him from the dead Elisha was able to raise the shuma night woman's son you know and she was the one that didn't have a son but you know he was Elijah was able to speak to her until you're going to have a son when she didn't have one in the one and then when he died he was able to come and raise the boy up from the dead and we know that also that Elijah program said that Elijah had such a quickening power the scripture tells us about that a dead man was thrown on top of Elijah's bones and he came back to life so we know in the Old Testament but nobody ever said you're going to raise the dead but you know what it took place and then we know later on in the New Testament we know that you know Jesus came and the disciples were watching him and you know he raised the the widow woman's son and I think it's the thing that's called name is the city there and you know he was they were had the funeral procession coming on and everybody was weeping and everything but you know Jesus came by and raised the boy up and then we know that later on when when the last Jairus came you know his son his daughter was very sick and then we know later on you know the the servant came and told us that don't bother the master she's dead well you know that wasn't a problem for Jesus because you know if he hid or raised the dead before and he was a life he did it wasn't it wasn't a problem for him so he raised it and then the third one we knows was a Lazarus was raised Lazarus was raised up so we know that and so we know looking at her being a witness we know that it took place because the scripture accorded it and they saw it and then because they saw Jesus display that power but the third one we know was when Jesus in Matthew 10:5 and they have the scripture Matthew 10:5 he said these twelve Jesus sent forth commanding them saying go not in the way of the Gentiles or any city of the Samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel and as you go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand he'll the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely you have received freely give so that's the first time but that I know of in the scripture unless y'all know something different that that's where they were given the Commission to raise the dead so they know to see that they had already seen it because it had been I witness to it they had been given the Commission to it because Jesus done it and then he gave them the Commission to raise the dead and we know that they did so that's what that's what it when he talks about a person that affords the evidence it's not just hearing about the evidence it's not just witnessing the evidence it's not just talking about the evidence but it's actually performing it's actually doing that and so that's what that's what they actually done they actually were able because Jesus gave them the Commission he showed them and you know he said don't go to the Gentiles but he said go to the hot lost sheep of Israel go to the house of Israel and preach this message and raise the dead and then so when we know in the scripture later where does give us because this was just to the according to the scripture this was just to the house of Israel but we know that in John 14 he says he said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also he said if you've seen me do these things then it's given to you to do the same thing and I was to go to the whole world and so we know that when they took that they did go to the whole world Jesus says he said greater works than these shall ye do because I go unto my father whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son he said if you ask anything in my name I will do it so he gave them the Commission in total to ask in my name he said whatever you do do in my name because I've commissioned you to do this to go into all the world Matthew 28 tells us so we're going to take this gospel into the whole world because and then do these things that I've commanded you to do so here's this Commission it was given to them that was given to them to go in all the world and preach this same gospel and in Matthew 24 he says and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come so we know that there was a there's a time that this message has to be ministered but they you know it's talking about the continuation of the book of Acts you know there's not been an end of the book of Acts why because it's still going on why because the same power they laid in the book of Acts is here today I mean how people are looking for something and I was a denominational preacher too the other day here they were talking about having the Holy Ghost and you know and you know they want to have the Holy Ghost but they don't want to have too much of the Holy Ghost well we want we want to have the Holy Ghost because we want to be sealed but we don't want to do anything outrageous I don't know whether you're going to be able to do that what we just want because he's like I want to take part of the word but I don't want to take all of it I want to take I want take the prescription I want to take part of the medicine but I don't want to take all of it I don't want to be cured I just want to feel different you know many people they just want to play around with it and hold on to something but not too long after that if you don't go exactly by the prescription you end up dead so you have to follow exactly as brother brother Bentham said you got to follow dr. Peters prescription because he gave it to him on the day of Pentecost he gave them the exact prescription to follow the attendee game you're going to follow that prescription then you can come to life eternal just like he said when Jesus told them baptize in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost what other thing is it do you know what the name of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost is because Peter turned around Gerald the day of I on the day of Pentecost as if you stand there and you think about what happened on the day of Pentecost see when he when he went out there you know Jesus told him said y'all must tarry till you be endued with power from on high and so they had to stay there but it was a promise to them and we know that later on they went in and they were there you know when they got into the description times I got him one Accord they got in and I got into a place where they were supposed to be but you know what they had their mind on that they had their mind on on receiving the promised I don't believe when they went 120 in the upper room they all had 121 different ideas I believe they got into a place where they all got one mind because when they got in one mind then the mind of Christ could come to them and that's when the mind of Christ came and he filled every one of them with the sound of a rushing mighty wind many times people people wonder why they can't get the Holy Ghost or why they don't get what they want why because I never got to that place where they actually get into one Accord and it's a one accord yeah you get them you get in with crime but it's just you and him if you get into that place then he'll come and meet you you know when it comes to the day of Pentecost and there they were and they were he was preached and Peter was preaching to them and telling them about what God had done and you know they thought it was you know a bunch of drunk people and you know crazy people out there but you know Peter said this is that that was spoken by the Prophet Joel you know the people what you know when when the the Jews had come to Pentecost to the feast of Pentecost you know they had a feast and things that they had to take to do in the in the feast of Pentecost you know they had all the the men had to come and gather and you and one of the things that they would do is they read the scripture one of the things they celebrate was receiving the word but you know they came and they were celebrating these things and all the things that took place on the day of Pentecost you know during during that feast time and here they are and they're gathered and they're speaking on the word because that's what they've done here because they rejoiced in Jehovah and what Jehovah had done but you know the thing is is they had missed because here they are talking about the God of Abraham and the things that he had done and the great things that he's going to do but the thing is is they had actually missed him coming because he he had come and Peter was saying see I don't think these people are drunk you'll think these people are crazy they said but y'all stay in here and read the scriptures and rejoice on what jehovah has done but I'm telling you today this is that that was spoken by the Prophet Joel this is what your home I has brought and y'all missed it he's standing in the midst of the day and this is what he said this is that that was spoken of and he would pour out his spirit and these are these are the this is the the outpouring this is the effect of it and they missed it but you know in that time he says you know they were 3,000 received it there were 3,000 that were pricked in their hearts that Peter could give them the prescription to what to take place and you know many times on the day of Pentecost when we look at we look at Pentecost we look at and see the first thing we look at is the pouring of the Holy Ghost on 120 in the upper room you know and I think it was early in the morning when that took place and then when they staggered out the door and the people heard heard the words the word being preached in their own language as it went forth and then you know they were pricked as Peter and the eleven stood up to preach when they were preaching the word and then the people received it but you know the thing is why don't you know what took place most of the day of Pentecost baptism I hated that that struck me another day I heard somebody say that you know if three thousand were saved and believed and were baptized there was a whole bunch of people getting baptized you know what struck me was we talked about having faith well you know the thing is a lot of things take place but you know somebody's got to get out there and do and do the manual labor you know if they were if they were twelve men if it was Peter in the eleven which was 12 if 12 had to go out there and baptize three thousand people you know how many that was 250 a person if half if half the men if half the people in the hundred of the 120 which is 60 if they were 60 baptizing 3,000 that's still 50 people each person was baptizing yeah and you know that takes that take a while if you had because ain't never had to do that but I mean I know some of my brothers how about you know they baptize so many people in arms ready to fall off and they have to get somebody else to help baptize them you know because and you just on and on can you imagine trying to baptize 3,000 people so we talk about what goes on you know we just we just talk about the good things of Pentecost and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost but you know that was that was amazing thing what place on Pentecost was baptism but you know we see that as we look through here when he saw and they were pricked in the heart there was 3,000 of them that received this and then you know they continued on from there and all through all through the Bible that the disciples going from place to place preaching and carrying this when now they had 3,000 people and you know I don't know how much they heard and let you know because you know I said part of that 3,000 could have been some of them that you know the ones that Jesus had appeared to they might have had more words you know but somebody had somebody had to expound the word to one more than just what Peter received but you know there was other ones that had continued on and there was 3,000 people that had to go out and share exactly what what had happened to them because if you stand out there and you've got 3,000 people out there in the water getting baptized everybody's want to know who these folks are because you know they go out there and they say what john babbitt was trying to drown people like turn the river years ago and now they got a whole bunch of these other crazy folks out there trying to drown people in the river too but you know what it was something that had to because if something really took place in in them it'll is like us if it took place then you know what it's got to be shared it's got to be it's got to be something that's got to come out you can't just hold it down and try to hold it back because it's going to come out so y'all just pray for me Jesus says and Mark has a couple other scriptures over the redirect quick mark 16:15 says and he said unto them go you in all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and first John 1 says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen of our hands which we have looked upon in our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare unto you that ye also have also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with the son Jesus Christ and these things write unto you that your joy may be full so we know that the word because when they speak of the things that they've seen you know what they've experienced and then they are going to express it to the other ones to show them what what took place in their life because they want their to have the same joy that they have because if you if you're if you mean you can't have you can't have the Holy Ghost not have joy you can you know because egos about you know if you receive that the Holy Ghost you know there's a there's a whole group of fruits of the spirit the you know that you receive that so you know here these things are the wheel don't we be full and you know we want to have fellowship around this things because we want to tell you what we've seen and what we've witnessed what we've experienced because you know they've seen many things and you know about handling the handling these things and we've seen these things but you know we want to declare these things unto you and that's the same way it was all the way through the scripture the people have seen it and they've heard about it and they've read about it but they want to express it and show and be the living expression of these things be expressing exactly what it was we know that Jesus said in Luke 19:10 he said for the Son of man has come to seek and save that which was lost so we know that these things are to be declared and he said we come to seek and say those that were lost and brother Branham said in and the enjoy is a secret believer in 1955 he said being that this is more or less a faith message a faith message of divine healing secondarily he says our first motive of these meetings is to save lost souls no matter a body no matter how bad they're bedridden how sick they are some day they've got to die and if they're made perfectly whole tonight they've got to die if they're made perfectly holdin up but that soul which is immortal when it's kneeled will live forever divine healing as many times it said that healing service are just just all the stress but on physical healing he says if you'll notice about 80 percent of Jesus ministry was divine healing but divine healing is like the bait that's put on the hook you don't show the fishes of hook you show him the bait so he gets the bait and the hook to suit that's what we think about divine healing God sets in the church great signs and wonders to get sinners conscious of his presence like the gift of speaking in tongues it's not for him that believeth but him that believeth not it signs to the unbeliever in today we have plenty unbelievers so you know if God has called us to be a to be a witness you know he sent these things in order and it give a equips us well if you know if you can't see the world in the condition that it's in and you know many times you hear people talking is and they're so non on about things and you know because many people have just you know they read this the read the scripture and they read the message and it's you know we know that we know the world's full of cannon fodder and when we know we know well you know the bride is being called out and you know but we talk about these great things but the thing is is you know are you and I interested in saving all souls are we are we interested in looking for lost souls because you know Jesus come to do these great things and we talk about all the great things that Jesus done you know we want to do great things but the thing is is he said I came to seek and save those who were lost nor are we interested because it is the same today as it was then the same yesterday today and forever so if he was back then doing that then he's doing the same thing today and let me tell you something what we see the condition that the world is in today it's a lot worse than it ever has been and you know he said they said the world is full of unbelievers but you know do we have that same desire do we are we stirred up about that you know I was reading in the in the scripture you know there in Ezekiel none I mean you know the scripture there where it talks about the angel got went forth with the inkhorn you know he went through and he said he said they told the destroying angels that they must hold themselves he said until the one that had the ain't corn the angel to go forth and he said they were to mark those that siding cried for the abominations done in the city and he said they must mark them and you must give them time to mark those and brother Branham said he said how many people tonight in this city would be marked by those he said if they sighed and cried for the abomination done in the city he said back then we know that that that was a prophecy that was already fulfilled because we know that when he said it took place when Titus came in and destroyed all the people those were mark were able to escape but those that didn't the destroying angels came in and destroyed them and you let me tell you some precision we're facing a greater destruction and you know we know that you know we talk about what we're just--we're just like Enoch you know are getting out of here but you know what there was a message than Enoch had that Enoch had to preach to the people and he stood there and told him that he pleased God he had walked so close to God that he would pick because it was God made manifest on the earth that he was to speak to the people and maybe nobody else caught it but you know what they saw God on display and you know when he came to a place that he pleased so please God and his walk that he just walked right off of the earth and let me tell you brother scissors that's exactly who we are that's our type is to please God so much and become so much of Jesus Christ in place today that we're going to walk right off of the earth because you know the thing is is what we still gotta just like Abraham been the children of Abraham the children of Abraham we still got to go out there proclaim the message that there's a way of salvation to a group of people says lost and dying nothing where we have people that just come and sit on a Pew or whatever but they've got it they going to know that they know that they know they're going to be behind that red that veil that they know where it's just you and God they've got to come behind the bad your skin to walk into the Shekinah glory not just some idea of it but we've actually got to know it to actually believe that you actually tell people you know what there is a way that's the way that you living is not going to make it no just pray for me not brother Brent said this is a message from the inside man he said you know you would you like to know what I think the greatest need of the church today would you like what I think where I think the blacking is is no soul travail the people are not broke up enough there there's no burden seemingly you give me someone that's so tore up almost lost souls about lost souls that they just cry and are wanting a revival so bad till they could hardly eat just simply can't he said if you read the history of the world in the religious history you'll find out that it always I'm taking that kind of spirit to bring a revival that's right see when Zion travailed or travel takes a better word why then she brought forth children see you have to be tore up it's the atmosphere of anything so are we do we actually have that travail do we actually because what one of the things that that's you read all things and and you see things and you know the there was there was a man that I've done just a little bit of studying and got to see a documentary on it and you know was a man by the name of Dwight Moody and you know you look at Dwight's life mr. Moody's life and you know here's a man he was not he was not tough well well liked her people didn't think much of him you know he he was a very ambitious man I don't know if you know some of you may know some of you may not know that he was a shoe salesman they said he was the best shoe salesman three States so shoes like nobody else when to come up with the idea selling shoes at a train station he first started selling shoes he outsold every shoe store in the city and he had such an ambition why because he that's that was his that was his passion one day a man spoke to him about the love of Jesus Christ about salvation well you know this man was foot you know that it didn't it didn't do away with the man's ambition but you know what he got something that was real and you know it started started a lot moody up so much that you know he went to the you know he won't anyone to tell everybody what he had he had have had to go and find and just let everybody know well you know they wouldn't they wouldn't let him have they wouldn't let him teach in the church they didn't like him well enough he wasn't he wasn't suited and he wasn't educated he was not in the clique so he didn't get a place so he couldn't do anything so he asked him what he could do so only thing you do he'd go out on the street sell shoes and tell everybody about Jesus but you know they said one day he come in they come in the church and he asked them he said can I have five rows in the church he said I want these five rows he said I want five rows he said why because I want to bring people to church well you know he took up me filled up five five rows bringing people to church well they would let him preach but you know what he brought five rows of people filled him up got them into church the next thing you know he had ten rows in the church next huh he just kept bringing more and more and more he brought so many people in because he had something that was burning on the inside of him he said he filled up a whole church they had to give him his own church when they gave him his own church then he started preach here they talked about all the different people that booti preached to I guess Hindman him and Spurgeon were probably the most that preached to more people than anybody knew they didn't have to have a radio or TV or tapes or books or anything like that you know they just got out and preached to people I know that I know that Spurgeon put all of his and you know he was able to take all his sermons and actually put them in book form and they sold them but you you're looking at what Lloyd moody come through you know nothing nothing deterred the man well because he saw the need of the people you know there was a time where people didn't want to go to the slums of the city the poor and the beggars and all these people you know that's what people that booty went to and he went in and you know they were they were kids and you know they credit moody ibly was was with creating Sunday school you know he went in he just started you know because the look is you know he had candy and that's how he was able to get kids in but you know he had a desire to feed and you know because he was able to get those kids he got their attention but you know what he wanted them to know Jesus Christ why because there was somebody that loved them they lived in that they lived in slum and people they just like in India you see people living on the street and dying on the street they never get in anything better than what they were born with but you know what they were something that Dwight Moody burnt with and he had to go out there and tell those people listen God loves you and he's made a way for you that when you leave this world you don't have to die and just go to hell there's a way made for you and I believe it was made me wrong but I believe it was Moody was was the there was a maybe I may be wrong but I believe it was a it was the lady that was in his church that you know she would you know because he wanted everybody to have this and it took it took this little girl that that you know she didn't have anything but she wanted to do something and moody's sent her out there you know to talk to everybody and you know she found a little boy on the street that didn't have anything and she just went up there and talked to this one logo every single day and told him that Jesus loved him and Jesus you there was somebody that you know you don't have anything your poor your parents hates you you look at your life but you know what there's a place beyond this mortal veil that you can go to and God will take care of you and you know and and so when he went home he was so excited he told him the story about you know this girl telling about Jesus and if parents were so upset they beat him well you know the next day you went out there and she talked to him again well every time he'd come home he gets so excited he get a whipping and these parents were just beating and you know one day he was a knew that he was going to meet that girl they told him so why don't you go ahead and beat me now before I go to go see that girl because I want to go hear about Jesus but you know they were so stirred by their son's testimony you know what they got saved you know the thing is do we have that same desire do we have the same burn to have the same zeal well because we say we have the same Holy Ghost or maybe we just don't we just don't yield to the power of the Holy Ghost to allow us to do that and everybody says well we're just living in the time we're just leaning well you know what it doesn't matter you know what because Noah stood out there for 120 years and freaks to nobody but you know what he burned with that zeal and he went out there and every you know what he put his faith into action because you know he didn't have to just stand there and tell them God is going to send rain why because he went out there and built the are they set up for building our well you build their crazy contraption for why because you're going to see one of these days on their fulfillment and you're going to need that but you know they didn't believe that but do you and I have that same zeal because it's a does it burn in us the same way not just and then you know there's Spurgeon and John Wesley and and the different different ones all down through history enough didn't want to try to get in all of it you know that you read their lives and you see the zeal that they had and they had hardships and problems and everything that they had to overcome but you know what he didn't he didn't dampen their zeal it didn't dampen the fire that was inside a number of years ago there was a there was a man that and I don't don't he leave his name right now Anderson I think was his life thing but he might he uh he was a missionary and he kind of like Moody he was he was not well educated didn't have a lot of things but he had such a desire that was burning inside of him to reach people reach the lost you know he didn't have anything and a lot of the doors closed on him and he didn't figure out he was going to get anywhere but God opened the door and you know the thing is is when all the doors started closing he couldn't figure out why things were happening but you know the thing is is when the doors were closing the doors were opening and he didn't see that he became he became a missionary to India he was in and it was a missionary free and India for thirty years and in this time you know he would come home every so often and and they would raise funds and you know tell everybody about what was going on in India and you're trying to make sure that they had the fun to do the things that they were doing over there one day we he was in the United States and he had went to one church the Sunday morning and was traveling to another church for the evening service and he happened to be passing through in the Midwest and seeing this great big we feel just white for harvest you know is ready and you know he said that he saw this great big wheat building and when they were going through there as he as he continued to go he saw the he saw a cloud of dust and he couldn't figure out what was going on so he kept going on and and he saw the cloud of dust got bigger and he just and he so he kept going on in the dust and finally he got out there and he's seen on the combines everybody was trying to harvest the wheat and he couldn't find it so he stopped and asked one of the one of the farmers there has stopped and asked him and he said well he said well why are you all doing this he said you know it being on a Sunday so why are y'all out here he said I figured y'all are all church-going people he said I figured y'all would be in church and he said well we work but he said we got off we got a report he said of storms coming our way and he said you see all this weed out here he said it's ready for harvest but he said that storms coming and he said you know he said if we don't get this harvest in he said it's going to be lost and he said we could see for people from miles and miles everybody in there trying to get the harvest in and he said sir he said you seem like a nice man he said but I got to go he said because we got to get this harvest in and he started going down ray said well god bless you he started going down the road and he said it went along as he went down the road he said he started there started rain falling and then it wasn't long he said the hail started falling and he said it was so bad he said you couldn't go anywhere he couldn't see now there's just death you know just destruction everywhere with the hailstorm and he was down there praying that God would watch over the people and everything and he said God told him then he said he said mr. Anderson he said don't go back to India he said the United States is the ones that needs the missionary he said why because there's a storm coming and he said the church is not in the harvest he said we're not stirred to get in the harvest let me tell you brothers sisters there's a storm coming and people don't realize it and we've got people that stand around and they gathered their message books and they talk about the prophet and they look at different things but you know what they've not come in to enter the inner Vail they've not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost they've not come in but you know what they've got an idea they've got a thought they read books they've got belt buckles but they've not received him if we don't who's going to do it brothers and sisters where though we're the end we are the ones that are going to finish this up we can talk about having a faith that's going to rapture us out of here but one of the things that God called us he never took away our commission to preach to the law and I know that the third pole is to the totally lost but let me tell you something that stirs inside of you to make sure that they hear you can't save people but you got to make sure that they know we've got to make sure that they know let me tell you brother sisters is burning in my heart I can't I can't put it out I don't know I don't know what to do but you try to find Lord what's what's your will for us who do I need to speak to what do I need to do sometimes I feel like I've tried to yes I felt like I've tried to push my way into things and I just don't feel like I'm waiting on the on the Lord but you know what you know my brother branham said one time he was standing there and you know he was asking God said what are you going to do about it what are you going to say about it and God told brother Brown said what are you going to say about it he said I'm waiting on you sometimes we try to find the mind of the Lord and and what do we need to do what is it that God wants us to do because you know what God called us to this and he equipped us for this we're prepared our demands speaking and he was talking about the power of God and what's been given to the believers what's been given to the bride and we've been that we've been equipped we've been given everything that we have need of he said it's just like he said it's just like the electric grid he said you know people don't understand you don't have to understand what a generator does you don't even have to understand how the generator gets power you don't even have to understand how the wires are run you don't have to understand voltage you don't have to understand anything he said you don't have to understand the Transformers you don't have to understand that panel over there because you know what there's somebody they knows how to operate that generator they run the wires they run the Transformers out there and step the power down and they put it in that panel over there somebody run wires in that panel and put breakers in it and somebody put switches on the wall but he said the problem is he said we're standing there looking they said we don't even flip the switch he said to why the power is there but he said are you going to reach over there and grab a hold of that switch and flip the switch brothers and sisters the power has been given to us that's the reason in acts one where he read that he said but we shall receive power when the Holy Ghost is come upon you well we've got that power because it's the Holy Ghost and fire it's the power of the Holy Ghost to do what he came to do because what he said when he gave us the Commission he gave us the power to do that and brother the scissors we've got to go out and I don't you know it sometimes I don't feel like I don't want to what to do but I know God has called me and I just go stand and say Lord I know you're calling me because there's a fire inside of me that I can't call I can't put out I can't quit because I just feel like sometimes I'm on fire and there because but you know there's so I want to do something Lord I want to make sure that everybody knows and maybe it's just me but let me tell you brothers and sisters it's burning me why because I got two boys and you know what I want them to know Jesus Christ I want them to know who he is not just about him I want in them the knowing many people have come to place they know about God but they don't know him they don't know him in the fullness they don't know him that many times of you know we've just seen these things and let them just happen to us but is it real has he taken up his abode in you or we are we on fire to spread this gospel have we seen as the scripture tells us when Jesus raised from the dead he came to the he came to the disciples he came to the ones that followed him and he made himself known with infallible proofs of his resurrection do you and I have those in fallow have we seen that infallible do we have that infallible proof that he's risen from the dead so we should be rolling fire and burning tonight God has given it to us I tell you tonight oh I don't know what to do sometimes but I know he's real and I want you I want you to know that he's real I want you to know whatever you have need of he's here to meet it we've got a lot of lost got a long lost family but do we do what we need to for God to use us to get a hold of them that's what I want to know right because I want to be used of God I want to make sure that there's not one person you know there was them there was a man on the on the Titanic and he worked with Dwight Moody and he was a minister and you know he went out there and the Titanic was sinking and this man went out there and you know they thought they told us that you've got to get in the boat you've got to get in the boat you're too valuable because you've got to run that you've got to run the moody church and there's so many things that people are looking for you to be a leader and he told us said no he said he said I can't get into a boat he said until I witness to every person that I can about the great lifeboat that's going to take us into glory and he stood there and as that ship was sinking and everything was going on they said he stood on the bow and he was standing there with a Bible in one hand and a finger pointed to the heaven and he was just screaming out as much as he could as loud as he could to everybody to reach and save yourselves through Jesus Christ because he is that one that will save you you know after the boat had they had a they had a memorial service later they didn't never recover this gentleman's body and and they went to they were and the moody church they were having a memorial service and it wasn't a man who stood up in the back and he said I hope I'm not out of line but he said I have something to say he said this demand the chore that I can't think of his name but they said this Minister that you're having the memorial service to not four he said people don't know what happened to him but he said I do he said I was trying to float on a piece of furniture and it was a man hanging on for dear life in the distance and he kept yelling out to me said son do you know Jesus son do you know Jesus and when he and he said he prayed with me the sinner's prayer and when he done that he said he was so covered in ice and in the rain he was so frozen that he just end up slipping off and he slipped off into the water and he stood there and he said I'm that man's last convert and you know things like that just just strike you because you know God never called us to go out like that but you know sometimes the neighbors know does everybody know people that come in contact with you because you know sometimes it's it's not people people can see your life and they know you're Christian but do they know that we talk to them and let them know do you know Jesus not just not just a folder an idea but do you know Jesus and everybody's like we do you know who brother Branham is do you know do you know the seven seals do you know these different things know you know Jesus have you ever prayed for God to forgive you of your sins you know I've got friends that you know they have this mentality and I know you do too they have friends and maybe family that have this mentality that you know they're trying to find something and you see people it's like well you know I'm a good person you know I believe in God and I go to church and you know and they're trying to give their reasons why they think that you know there's there's a formula there's a way to get in and you keep trying to tell people listen you don't have anything that God wants they just want your soul it's not your good works it's not your good looks it's not it's not how smart you are or anything else about you but there's a soul that's on the inside of you that's what God names and yes you're not ever going to be good enough and you're not ever going to be able to do anything good enough but if you ever come to the place where you come to this place where you can say god I am nothing and you're everything there's nothing that I bring I don't have anything just like just like Cain and Abel there was there was a blood sacrifice today that Abel brought because Cain is trying to trying to bring something that he had had work to do he had done something he had had cultivated something he tried to make something but you know what it was never going to be but when Abel stood there and said there's something has to die for me there was a blood sacrifice given for me and that was the revelation that it took and that's what it takes for you and I we've got and you try to share with people listen it you're not going to ever be good enough and you're not going and it's not group your good works just going to get you in it's God and only God it's not God and anything else but my question is do you know Jesus not do I know the message do I know the Bible you know they talked with brother Branham that said you know so you don't know your Bible he said no but I know the author real well do you know Jesus we've been called to be witnesses and that's that's what I want to note for you to know yes I'm not perfect but I am in him but I want you to know that you know every day I wake up I'm still claiming the blood I have I haven't a sacrifice that covers me you know what you and I we have to do the same thing but do you know him do you know him and the power of his resurrection if you don't he's here because I want everybody to make it and so tonight I saw stand that's what that's what I want to share with you tonight it's just been burning in my heart for a while bless you I want I want to be used of God and maybe it's just one one act you know brother Brown said he'd train a man for years and years and just using for six months you know John spend just about his entire life in the woods and the wilderness come out for a short message I believe brother Brent was the one that tells a story about Dwight Moody about the about the woman that Felton had the burden on her heart to have a meeting and she got a stable or whatever it was and you know how to minister come in and preach and all that that whole meeting there was only one that came to the altar and in that meeting was was the white moody was the one that came and gave his heart to God you know many times people look at that say well you know that wasn't much of a what much of a meeting didn't stir anybody a lot of things didn't get you know a lot of things didn't happen but you know what all the work that Moody done the rest of his life she received part of that so brother sister said it's not what we do that's big or small it's that that we give our all God does not ever going to ask us what we done did we do something big or little or whatever God's just going to ask us one question were you faithful yeah god bless you're going to go ahead oh and have any for a great speak into each one of us know for sure [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know how that is your that all is well then
