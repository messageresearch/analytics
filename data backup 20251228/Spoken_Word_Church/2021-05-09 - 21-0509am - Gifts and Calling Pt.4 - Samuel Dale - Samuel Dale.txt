========================================

our clouds may rise and stormy winds may blow [Music] but i'll tell the world [Music] wherever i go that i've found the savior and he's sweet i know he's sweet i know he's sweet i know dark clouds may rise and stormy winds may blow but i'll tell the world wherever i go that i've found the savior and he's sweet i know um good morning it's good to see all these smiling faces here this morning it's just like a renewing of life to come and see everybody here my family it's good to see everybody here this morning we're going to read from isaiah it's kind of a i've been studying a lot it's going to read isaiah 28. um i say 8 through 21. and this morning before we go to the reading of the word let's just thank the author folk precious heavenly father we thank you for this day and we ask you lord to forgive us of our sins and thank you for your grace and mercy coming unto us and father thank you most of all for the word that we hear lord hear and for the lord just coming forth father and we just ask lord that you listen on our ears today and just quicken the word that we hear father that we may manifest that that you have set for us father and lord god we ask today that you just touch and bless all of those that couldn't be here today that couldn't make it through the door brother mark and brother al and sister hannah and the struggles that they go through the lord out in life for the health problems and issues lord but strengthen their soul lord and that'll take care of all of that and we just asked you to touch and bless each one that's not here today and bless brother wade in the ministry today up at brother scott's and asked you this morning to touch and bless papa seek he's preparing to bring the word to us father god that we can be attentive and hear the word and

be with us now and join the service and bless it lord god we ask these things and bless the opening the reading of your word we ask in your name jesus christ amen as we read it's kind of a odd scripture to me it's not really odd but it's god's word but to um we always want to read about the good things all about the grace and the mercy and all the patent on the head and stuff but listen his word is solid it's all we have it's the truth and for everything that goes out there's got to be something that comes back and for that that don't come back wasn't meant to be to start up with so there's judgment in this word we don't want to be here for the judgment folks so as we read 28 8 for all the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place claimed amen for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here little and they're little to whom he said this is rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear my god wherefore hear the word of the lord ye scornful men that rule this people which is in have made a jerusalem with death and with hell are we at agreement when the oath flowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have lost our refuge therefore thus saith the lord behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste righteousness the hiding place and your covenant with death shall be disenold and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it from the time for the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself on it and the covering narrow that he may that he can wrap himself in it for the word of the lord he shall be worth in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act thank you for the opening of the word reading of the word you may be seated let's turn to number 187 in the spiral book you try f that god should love a sinner such as i should yearn to change my sorrow into bliss not rest till

and then we'll be doing that and then he'll be going on up traveling a little so just bless them and give them a safe journey back we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen now we've been on this for quite a while and i'm going to try to finish it today and then we'll just say okay if you have questions we want to try to get that next sunday okay questions and answers next sunday for what i've been speaking on if you will and get that all in order uh and doing okay now we've we've picked up this point or thought and been considering it for us and it says verse 29 of the 11th chapter for the gifts the many gifts now okay and calling of god are without repentance all right now the gifts and one calling but many gifts in the body of christ there's many gifts but there's just one calling make your calling and election sure you know what you're doing also we're working on getting the things fixed up we're gonna have some two boards back here where you can be able to uh see the scriptures and things as they shoot up instead of just having this one screen because it blocks off with some people and and and things like that where you having to sit but we're going to try to get that done but they're they're working on getting it in order okay now let's go to the ephesians 4. we'll start with verse 7. but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now god led captivity captive that's right but he also gave gifts to man all right now now watch those gifts okay now he ascended now that he ascended what is it that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave now what are the gifts that he gave we'll get into it we've been running through it there's nine spiritual gifts in first corinthians 12 that lists the nine spiritual gifts that's in the church but then he hears something special and he gave some what gifts now gifts that's what he's talking about right because that's what he said he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men what to give and he gave some apostles some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry or the edifying of the body of christ for how long till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god and to a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ why what's all this to do that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in white to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word terence said it was a visitor so if it's somebody you come here one time you're a visitor you counted a visitor but you come back you're not counting the visitor you're just part of us you know that that all works in that order okay now we've been for quite a while trying to cover and i want to read some things and then like i said we'll try next sunday if lord willing if you'll do it if you'll just write out your questions and you say well i i can't right question well just write down what in the world are you talking about well there's no problem what are you talking about what are you doing what are you saying you know there's no problems with it we'll we'll try our best to be able to uh cover these things and doing this is message number three picked off of what we've been talking about on predestination we may go back and hang another message or so in there later because i believe in predestination i believe you're predestinated by foreknowledge god is not you know picking and choosing he predestinates by his foreknowledge but remember now there are some things that goes in there that we must understand because all of this is transpiring in the mind of god before the world ever begun all right so then we get our predestination back in line but what i want you to think on today is the one thing we've been driving hard and i don't want you to miss this because we're going to be talking about the the church and its operational parks and and seeing it and then getting into the what he said he gave some apostles some prophets some pastor some teacher or he gives you what you have need of all right now is that understandable he gives you what you have need of all right some people they had there to have a they you know i'm going to say this and and lay it out in the right order now but then i'm going to come back just to because see every church every church has to have a pastor all right every church you know has to have a pastor every individual must have a pastor i've had ministers to even make remarks you know of i ain't going to pay tithes to no minister well all right go ahead you're not in the body of christ now we're talking about the body of christ we're talking about what the word says so it's not what i've got to say it's what god says in his word all right see everybody must have a pastor you know what he brought around him even said who was it the woman there in the bible said uh elijah was her pastor whether she believed it or not all right well see she didn't want no pastor well that's the way a lot of people are but now you tell me how you're going to to be able to uh follow the word of god well i i don't like nobody that i don't i can't find nobody well i agree with you to a degree yeah i agree with you to a certain degree there's a lot of these churches i wouldn't go to there's a lot of them i would not sit down in that call that my pastor because they're off the word. but that's worthy he said he gave some yes he gives us what we have need of now the prophet said it's god would take if somebody's got a question you got a question about he said god is obligated to put somebody on the pulpit to answer that question all right and there's your five full ministry okay and see we're going to get to that in a minute and and lay things out but i want you to understand what i'm saying me that i'm saying whether you believe it or not that's your business but see everybody has to have a pastor because how would you work without one that's right well i don't know then go find go hunt till you find one god's got one out there somewhere for you if you want it now we're not talking about flim flames we're not talking about just any kind of garbage cans we're talking about a true fivefold ministry that god gave now let me ask you this because i've got the quote that runs right straight to it do you believe the baptism of the holy ghost is the gift of god of eternal life that's what the bible says now it's the gift of eternal life what is the gift of eternal life through jesus christ all right so then we're not talking about just this that or the other it's not your idea it's not my idea it's not doing and it won't give me no more money for me to stray it hard and straight than it will if i say it weak enough so i'm going to say the way i have to say it because that's the way i've always had to be far as anything else we ain't worried about it but see i'm telling you this church must have a pastor if you don't believe this if you do not believe that i am the pastor of the church well then go somewhere else that's not a problem that's just a flat blunt statement a point it ought to be find your place because he gave some apostles he gave you what you have need of it's out there somewhere for you but see you must have a pastor all right you say well well brother dale what how do i how does pastor pay tithe i've been through all of these things up and down over all the years so i don't worry about it i pay tithe i have to pay tithe because that's part of my duty well who do you pay tithe to i've had preachers to say that you pay it to yourself now boy that'd be the right hand in putting the money in the left pocket and moving it over and getting it back and well that'd be something wouldn't it these minister brothers that minister here they get paid to minister that way i can pay my tithe we have something comes up overseas or something that is a needful thing i can take then from my part that i have have put aside and i can send that and we send a lot of money out and you say well is that tithe well why not because it's something we set aside in the bible they had a a um the high priest was in charge of everything right you got to admit that or you're going to argue yourself to death about it you know the hype the high priest he's in charge all right so then he would divvy out of what it was needed he would take care of everything now somebody else is helping him he's not the only one got the money in the bundle and going no no there's offices set up and things like that but yet he's in charge okay see then when you come over into the new testament see then you see that the pastor is in charge he's in charge because he's the one to be doing it you say well well brother dale uh i i don't have a pastor i've got a prophet how are you going to do that now what a man is and what he's doing is a different thing what gifts are is gifts and all like that sure we haven't but what are you going to do see if you don't pay tithe you're not a born-again believer that's what i said i'll just make it straight and blunt and then at least you won't misunderstand me you know because i'm putting at that blunt to where see that we say well we're we're this with that no we prove what we are if you don't pay tithe you're not a born-again believer i play on this over i ain't going to argue with you about this that or the other but i'm going to tell you this away and put it blunt and plain one dollar received means 10 it don't say in the bible if you get it for this or get it for that there is two things in the bible you can't tithe on you can't tithe on the price of a well can't be done the bible says it you can't tithe on the price of a dog well brother dale i raise dogs and sell them you don't want no i don't want to tithe off you raising dogs and sell them because the bible says i want what the bible says we'll take care of the rest of it from our home you say yeah but well that's what the bible says now see then that would get us to the basis of of having understand it if we'd believe it and settle down to it and just be that and let it go and you know but setting things in order you know getting it to the bases see then every church must have a pastor all right now listen it's going to get down to try to hard charge things to try to understand it doesn't say that every church has to have a teacher it doesn't say that it has to have an apostle or prophet an evangelist but every church has to have a pastor because that's the rules of sitting down you say well my my pastor is brother so-and-so and he's he's a he's a teacher well what are you doing here well he's up in new york it's all right for me to send my money to new york the brother so and so it ain't all right in the bible but it's all right for me to do what you want to with it you can burn it because it ain't going to change me all right is that blunt enough it's not going to change me in anything that i do or don't do paying tithe is an opportunity it isn't it is a a uh what you call it it is a necessary thing to do but it is also a wonderful opportunity because if you pay your tithe he'll open the windows of heaven now come on i don't know if you you think what you want to but just remember you get a dollar one dime of that goes well brother dale i'm gonna do it this way that way now you're going to argue with god in the bible about it all right you say well i don't have to pay tithe on this to pay tithe on that the only two things in the bible you don't have to pay tithe on surprise of a or a dog now everything else does that well if i sell my home you sell your home and you get an increase you tie the increase you don't have to tie the whole thing you tie the increase we're sensible we know what we're doing we know what it all lays out to be you get things from people they give you an inheritance well i got an inheritance off the family well you're supposed to pay time come on church my boy said that time you know what it told his daddy brother dale never did preach on driving and the first thing the the time that his daddy came to church i preached on tithing but you see i wind up preaching on tithing of your time your talent your life you're praying you're worshiping you're singing you're doing money is just a little monetary thing to start with but if we don't keep stuff like that straight how can we call ourselves christians there was baptist we were in the baptist church we paid tithe you say well do i pay tithe on this time i ain't gonna argue with you about what you're talking about and that's exactly what you're wanting to do you're not wanting to say what's right you're not wanting to agree with the word that it says pay the tithe you're wanting to argue over how to do it well do it what you want to it's between you and god sensible between you and god not between me and you and god i ain't in on the show i've always said it and you don't you know this is the truth i just assume buy dinner for a millionaire is to buy a dinner for a parker he said well no no no no no no that dinner i'm i'm saying that's just the way i am because you see i don't honor one thing over the other all men are the same with me it doesn't matter you can't have let's put it this way let's start with the point you can't have a five-fold ministry without lining up starting with the pastor first now wait a minute the number so and so over in corinthians is in summer so this number goes in this way and then apostles and then prophets and then by you know it's fifo ministry irregardless so the tithe goes to the pastor that solves the problem now what he does with it is his problem it's not your problem it's his problem what he does with it if he don't handle that right then he's in trouble with god all right but you say well then i'll just pay my my tithe to the we we have a a teacher in our church i'll just pay my tithe a teacher that ain't according to the bible right there's only one man according to the bible that can teach either that's jesus christ you pay your tithe of jesus christ yeah but how do i pay my tithe to jesus christ when jesus ain't here you pay it to the next thing to him now you tell me now i'm not saying nothing other than just plain language but you tell me that brother branham could make a hundred dollars a week and spend fifteen 1500 a day out on the field somebody was giving money because he was the pastor now that's the way i count him account brother you want to know who is my pastor who is all of our pastor the elijah of this day the lord jesus christ is all of our pastors then you come down to as we tried to cover in a sermon or two there then you come down to brother branham well i sent my money to jeffersonville you can't pay tithe to a tape recorder quit saying you're going to send a jefferson but they'll sell you i'm sending it to somebody at jeffersonville because you can't pay tithe to a tape recorder you're going to do anything at least get your statement right i mean so well i just send mine to jeffersonville they do whatever you do what you want to do with it then but how is that your pastor you got to go through the local assembly to have a pastor so then what do we got we got a mixed-up mess is what really we've got because you ain't gonna get it running right the reason i don't preach on tithing and things is because it ain't gonna change nothing what i say today it ain't gonna change it's going to make you call each other this afternoon and want to know about this or that or the other or this week well i think this i think you think what you want to i'm just telling you what the word of god says we've got one pastor that's right we had one pastor in william branham his message is now our pastor because it's through the holy spirit revealing the word that was brought by the pastor and if you catch me off of the pastor off of the prophet's message you come and tell me we'll sit down and discuss this thing you say well i don't like the way you operate the church well it ain't none of your business is that blunt enough go somewhere else ain't none of your business what we do here because you're not in charge i'm in charge to line up everything i can by the message of the hour right then the 54 ministry has to line up with the message of the hour see then everything has to be lined up according to the word of god which the message of the hour is the word of god right that's why your high priest was the only one that was capable of receiving now they didn't get what i'm saying don't go to all playground with me get sensible when they brought in the money they didn't pile it all up in a high priest that turned no there was people at helps and governments and things that went away that there were people that helped him and took care of it he probably never seen 90 of the money or even 100 of it maybe you know as the high priest he had people to help him that's why the bible talks in corinthians it gives you a line up coming down and it says and helps and governments and things because that's what we all have helps and governments all right you see what i'm talking about see when you when you do you try to explain something and people well you're just trying to do this i have seen the europe coming in pace that i gave away more money than most of you made and you know that is true there's no argument because i do what i want to do in the glory of god see then i do everything i can to give it all i know but you but brother dale you you you think i should do that you think i should tie this as a one dollar game 10 cent i can even go stronger brother asked me one day he said should i tithe the the money that i received it when my wife died anybody got question answers to it you know what i'm talking about he he had he had insurance you say what do you do well you tell me why not i ain't going to argue about what to do i'm going to tell you why not right yeah but that's getting it and see that's what i mean you're not gonna listen we we've said and had meetings about this before i'm just playing see i'm trying to show you one thing if we'll do it correctly god is in charge but he's in charge through a line of a chain that goes through that you've got a five-fold ministry but you start every church with a pastor you don't start that church with the teachers and things like that they're in the body of christ they're they're offering they're in on complete control of the pastor come on you explain it i'll give you the prophet but you tell me in the bible now let's keep it in there he says should i pay tithe on this one dollar game one day i'm tired yeah but you're getting this too too touchy about this especially when you're talking about say uh something that i received this word an increase you know of an insurance policy or something i'm just being played you tell me we'll be glad to give you the pulpit and say this is what sister so-and-so says you know but you know yourself i wouldn't even get up and answer it with that but i'll give it to you because i ain't trying to get rich off of the tithe you know how this church operates right well a lot of you don't because you claim you don't but you know more about it than i do cause you're nosy that one was rough that was too hard i guess but you see i'm responsible not only for your soul i'm responsible for god to god about your natural life did brother branham snake make these statements he said the pastor is the burden barrier well he gave someone how did he give them he gave a fifo ministry how to give them we can we can follow the tithe payer because we can take it to the pastor right and we can say well if we deal with this with a pastor but what about the other four ministries all right what about the other four apostles prophets you know teachers evangelists see they're responsible to god to find out what the five-fold ministry is supposed to be and they're supposed to get in that part of their job and do their job i mean you've got four more ministries there what are you going to do well don't you think that the apostle can and the teachers can receive tithe if they're a pastor of the church again that didn't come out right did it show me how anybody other than the pastor can receive tithe you say what but but you just you're just making it just making it plain always open for confrontations because i'm going to argue with you about it if this church had millions of dollars in the bank wouldn't change a thing to me i'd still preach the same thing or if it had two dollars in the bank i'd preach the same thing but you see i'm trying to get us to think about why does he say he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and teachers all right he gave a five-fold ministry all right now did you understand what we were trying to bring out last week or or this i pick hand-picked a few out of the notes for the past couple of services three or four for you to think on and i want to just read them to word that we can can see you know what is it go ahead pick up number one let's just read these things and see what brother branham said is odd the things that he says he covers the nine spiritual gifts in the local assembly but they don't come predestinated eternally because the gifts in that five in the nine spiritual gifts can operate one time and never operate again we're going to get down to something's going to stir your hair a little your spoon what is it you say aaron it's going to fall out of your bowl because we're going to read what the prophet says amen and then let's see if we will if we believe it all right now look what he says from jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and macon then before you could do it now god does that then he sends people into the church such as preachers teachers evangelists gifts of healing don't mean the man now can heal you it means that he has faith in what he's talking about and proves it by the bible all right after that there's prophets that seers all those gifts are without repentance they god sent to that office gifts are this are sent by god now keep that in mind because that's what we're dealing with the five-fold ministry where either one of the five it's an office sin of god all right look how it gets god sends that office's gifts are sent by god for ordained of god and they're sent into the church they're born in you then tr them traits are born in you when you come to come to this world you just find your position now that's what i spent four sermons three sermons trying to get you to see that we're trying to find our place finding doing and what it you know find your position find what you're supposed to be get what your partner's doing do what you're supposed to do all right and all those things are in the kingdom of god and all of it's for the reflecting of the church to bring us together now listen office gifts the president of the united states is in an office he's got to abide by his office it's a position set up for something whatever you're doing and like i said president of the united states sheriff of the county or whatever it is whatever you want to would be setting up it's an office it's a gift the holy ghost is the office but it operates the gifts but remember the holy ghost is going to be the officer of all of them that's right but it's without repentance you don't repent to get a gift you're either born with it or not born with it and everybody is born in one way or the other with the gifts it don't work it doesn't mean you're born again to have gifts you're born with gifts but there's gifts in the body of christ that not necessarily are less important because the bible plainly tells you you know you say well this ain't important the bible plainly tells you the the last lesser amount of at least one is the most important of all so we ought to get that straight and that way it won't blow her head up so big that's right the least you can be is the best you can do because that's what it's supposed to be but gifts gifts in the in the bible are offices he gave us the new birth that is the office of the baptism of the holy ghost and he knew we would need leadership and helps and things so he gave us that new birth and putting that new birth together and it'll come out to be a church and then everybody should find their position of what they are you'll find your position was that what he said in there but listen go ahead and get to the next one sir as we would see jesus go away number two when jesus came on the scene the bible said that he was to be a prophet moses said the lord your god shall rise up a prophet like and unto me and israel always believed that they're prophets because that was god brother branham was god to the people not brother branham we'll get to that in a minute it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god right it's not the person brother branham didn't come predestinated eternally from god he said well i've heard you might think no i didn't make it he was predestinated eternally because it's not the fifo ministry is predestinated to bring the message as well as the prophet is predestinated that's one thing we don't dwell on a lot but i try to put it in the right place irregardless of what ministry you've got it still has to answer to the prophet then that has to answer to god so everything is answering to him so i what always believed their prophets because that was god identifying himself in human beings see he would go in that human being and speak to his people i believe that about it brother brown said it's hard to separate the man from the ministry he said that way you'll make too much of the man because it is not the person that comes pre-designated eternal but what did he say in the church it's the word or and seed was a predestinated seed for every age a predestinated word forever age a predestinated group of people forever age a predestinated 5-4 ministry forever age it's predestinated god sent it nine spiritual gifts we'll read in a minute they come and go but the fifo ministry is not so the fifo minister is predestinated eternally now listen not the man the seed he's bringing the word he's bringing or let me say it this way can i add something without you blowing your head off about it why not write a little word in there where he says the predestinated word or seed why not put a little word there called an office the office is operational part of the holy ghost into your heart and life it is not you the baptism of the holy ghost is not you it's christ in you the hope of glory right well now how can you separate the crisis in you from the christ you can't ain't not even trying to leave it alone but you see regular gifts can operate in the body of christ and they're wonderful they are ordained of god right they're there for a purpose but it is not the word or seed left up to them to bring the messenger to each church age brought the message the fivefold ministry was to line up with everything he said now everything he said that was right let's be technical we don't line up to something that oh so and so over here priests that we don't believe in it no forget it cast that out but let's get into it in the way it's supposed to be himself in the bible always that's the way that he identified himself was in his prophets they were just ordinary man of course they were born for that purpose now what as we know there is local gifts of the nine spiritual nine gifts in the church that's first corinthians 12 lists the 12 of them i mean the nine of them aren't now watch there is local gifts of nine gifts in the church but there is offices of the church and that god that's predestinated or foreign god has said in the church apostles then prophets and teachers pastors evangelists and so forth that's god's gifts set into the church then there is nine spiritual gifts that operate in the local body of the believers and they must be checked what you don't check the fifo ministry you don't check the profit of the age you mean i i i don't work you show me what you've got a right to check me with come and let's do it with this you want to talk to me about checking to see whether what i'm saying is right or not you're to have it in you enough to know that i read it i don't just guess it and play with it i read it so if i read it to you it's what he said at least right because now look nine spiritual gifts that operate in the local body and of of believers and they must be checked by two or three judges before they're to be given to the church because sometimes they would be wrong but notice these prophets now okay going back to the old testament prophets going back to the brother branham being a prophet going back to the church age messenger of being a special person whether it be paul iranius martin columbo special person for the word of the age that they're bringing not like brother branham no even agaves again was brought around and speaks high of agaves but agaves was nowhere close to paul right right right but paul was nowhere close to the elijah of this last days that's the way i believe it paul was wonderful and great and the messenger to the whole new testament is laid upon the apostle paul let alone the church at ephesus but yet he couldn't bring the seals he couldn't bring the things that needed to be brought it had to come through the malachi 4. so we've got it laid in right order okay notice these prophets as they were born like in i believe in jeremiah here god said before you was even conceived in your mother's wound i ordained you a prophet over the nations now listen you say but that is predestinating you're playing with the word predestinating you're not listening let's read it again before you were even conceived in your mother's womb that's back before the foundation of the world you're going to see one of these days what i'm trying to tell you and it's going to open this church up empty it or it's going to bring together what we're supposed to have i'm a firm believer in the fifo ministry i'm a firm believer in that but i'm a firm believer in all the local assembly operating as a local local assembly i'm a firm believer in the nine spiritual gifts it's supposed to be in the ever-born ever uh assembly nine spiritual gifts operating but i remember you can call and use it for the perfecting of the saints they're there they're wonderful but if you look at what i'm talking about then you move up from that that part has to be judged what he said that has to be judged has to be done but the fifo ministry is not judged we're going to judge us with hey come on now now come on brother they are you know smarter than you think or dumber one you know brother dale's saying one thing for certain it ain't me and you that god gave to the church sorry he didn't give me he gave a gift he didn't give any of you fifo ministry he gave the gift he gave the office he gave you the to the church but it's not you it's the office you're in he honors his office come on you see moses was born a prophet in john the baptist 712 years before he was born he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness isaiah the prophet speaking to him see it's not these gifts are born gifts god placing them in the church what gifts he gives the nine spiritual gifts but the nine spiritual gifts are i don't like to use the word unimportant because it's not that it's just it's a a point of what one section does and compared to what another you know group does and the best way to compare it is is the way the prophet compared it and when he said that the nine spiritual gifts has to be judged but show me where he said the fivefold ministry had to be judged and we're not talking about the man that's what i was saying a while ago that's what i was getting to what i've been getting to what it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god but word or seed or office did i add anything to the message office an office of god that ain't no little room over there that's the pastor's office you know mine's been moved so far still a lot of times i forget where i'm supposed to go to and then we had went back there one time they was all fussing around here that's why they added on that over there it didn't bother me i had enough room to wear that it was really funny i was in a little bitty place packed up in the corner and we had this lady all of you know the stories about it but this lady came in and she was telling them up here at the front and said i want to talk to the pastor well i heard her back there and i just stepped out i said solve the problem in other words send her on down tell my wife to come with her i had a big office i had an office with a chair that i could barely turn around you know and that lady got in that doorway and there was no way for me and her boat go back out that door you know so i had to talk to her you know i had to tell her because she's saying we need to lift up jesus i said if you'll hang around a little while you'll find out we do i said just hang around go sit down for a little while need some money we'll give you a little money go sit down oh we need this i see how you're sorry you need that but you'll find out we left up jesus christ the one true and living god well but i went through the godhead and just a little bit and first thing i know she was out the door well i didn't argue and fuss with her i just quote the bible to her what you see is she was in my office mine was getting crowded with her in there and peggy standing in the doorway but it worked out it always will i ain't afraid of something like that it'll always work out you just start talking about the bible right and watch that demon just start backing off of you okay come on but listen gifts are born gifts god placing them in the church you think about that as your fifo ministry now i'm talking to the church now which i've already explained see we're all fivefold ministry we're in the body of christ i've got to have a pastor right i'm the pastor of the church but i got to have a pastor what have i got i got all these five full ministers i got these ministers who do you pay your tithe to when somebody comes through from somewhere i give them money i do this i give these brothers to minister because i've got to what would be a pastor that wouldn't honor the word enough to do what it says but you want everybody else to you can't send your money i've had people here to tell me one brother one time he said you care if i give my uh give us tithe money to this brother i said give him everything you got i think no problem just give it to him but i said now if you're asking me what's right now we're going to change the story right right if you ask me what's right then you have no right to send it nowhere else the everything is supposed to be operating from that one single right yeah but what about the other four the other four has to offer has to answer to that pastor and the other four should be called in see i call in people i see something you know we have a wonderful ministry here we have a great situation we've got four ministers besides myself uh that works out good you know we can just schedule the different weeks and things like that but i also think and sometimes and i think well we need you know we used to to bring in until all this virus got hooked up but we you know i used to bring in ministers well i i'd get to thinking about so and so i just called him once they come down and preach for us because i believe in the faithful ministry i believe that's where i get my i get mine from the prophet's message by way of the faithful ministry now can every one of you ministers say amen to that i get mine from the fifo ministry that's got it from the prophet that way all's involved right that's why he gave some a prophet some apostles see so you'll see sometimes you watch these brothers minister you know and you watch especially brother say we'll use brother aaron he don't mind he'll get mad at me but you see him he'll be up preaching and he'll be just going away and about that time he hits that rabbit trail and he just runs away over here and he get off over here and he gets to running this away and don't worry about he'll come back you know right awhile you'll see him line back up well see something was going on i don't think it to be him chasing rabbits i take it to be that god is leading him to go over here and then to move back and bring it this way you watch these ministers one message they'll be on fire they're really on fire next minute they're slow gradual well if you'd listen to them and let them tell you in a hurry just like i would do you think man oh man that was the worst sermon that i've ever preached you know i mean you're just down and out you just you go outside and i enjoyed that message brother dale i've been studying on this right here and then you thank me that's what i told that sister that time when she she was telling me some things you know what i was doing and all i said you needed to preach tonight let me sit down because she done a better job explaining it in five minutes and i did an hour and a half i believe in gifts working i believe in gifts working through the body of christ the women the men the children i believe in that and that's not building one above the other but all right you see what i'm talking about maybe one time aaron is up here he's far borrowed he's he's an evangelist the next service he might be slow you'd look at him and you follow him he's doing a good teaching job tonight he said didn't change his office you hear brother branham right he'll be preaching away in one message and he'll be just on fire in the next message it's real slow he's gradually going and you know which one are you going to say is most led of god most of the time the one that everybody thinks he ain't led is is the one that's being led right right yeah so you just do the best you can see five full ministry he gave some apostles it's not all made for the pastor just to be the only preacher that's not made for that so now listen to what i'm saying for a minute and you'll get it right and you'll see i'm trying to honor everybody when i'm sitting back there in that pew looking up here every who's doing that preaching is my pastor how many of you give me that honor well see you're my pastor while i'm sitting there feeding on the word what because that's the five-fold ministry it's not all made for one it's made to operate as a body of christ read the the corinthians and the arms the legs these are supposed to move everything's not a hand everything's not an eye everything's not an ear read those things you might get a good understanding of what's going on because i've got to have a five-fold ministry i called in people when others around me and say what'd you get that for well i wanted to you know it felt like it it's always been wonderful i can say this with not bragging or whatever i've called in people here to preach at this church that i knew there was doctrinal issues that i didn't agree with them but i knew they would help you and i had one time that i know of i've had one time that i had to come back behind the man after he left and correct what he taught to this church now that's an honor maybe they honored the old boy enough to say let's stay away from that you know he'll straighten it out when i leave but you see what i'm talking about i think when brother aaron is preaching he's our pastor for the night you thought i was doing it all on the pastor didn't you i'm putting it where i believe the word puts it so we need something brother bob is going to preach this afternoon i'm going to come here and sit down and say god feed my soul this is a member of the fifo ministry that is to talk to me i may be the pastor that's all right but he's whatever is needed this afternoon he is to bring that to the congregation and that puts the whole 54 ministry to work you don't listen to types enough if you don't understand what i'm talking about because you know brother branham a lot of times he'll just be on fire but then in the next message he just i've always said this but it's it's the now the hear you him messages now we know what that's supposed to mean and connect and hear him but get your titles and look at all of them and get the tapes and listen he ain't always preaching on adoption he's titling to hear him you think oh that's an adoption let me get that and that's the doc no he ain't always doing that he's just saying here god which is an adoption message right glory but still he's just not trying to bring down this over here and this over here and you listen to him sometimes and you think well i've heard him explain that over here one time over here a whole lot better than that well you don't know who's there and who's listening or what's changing it because it'll change it you watch you watch it up here sometime that's why i walk back and forth i go this way weight goes that way see uh bob he's getting he's getting a bit and now aaron he hangs in the middle really because he's so big he can't move around he's you know he has to stay with his feet anchored what you see i move but you know why i move sometimes these preachers can understand it the laity don't agree with it but because you don't know you start out in a service and you see a preacher and he's preaching away and he's he's doing pretty good he's right in the middle you know he's doing pretty good night while you see him and he starts and he starts moving over and he'll try to move back he'll try to go this away and it just don't work he's got that notch over here and he comes back over here and he's preaching you know what happened the pool has come to that one side maybe one person maybe one person is pulling and that gift is trying to answer that question talk to that soul of that individual through that gift which is in an office that's just trying to explain gifts and ministries and stuff you can't do it because we're odd people but get to the point of what i'm talking about you if you have a need you just pray all right and you just you just keep praying about that need and about that time brother louise will call and say i'm not going to be able to preach this weekend i'm scheduled but uh they're they want me to come here to interpret well we always honor that it's okay go ahead you know you know that might be the will of the lord for brother bob to preach that night you don't think like that and god went through all these other things to get that one minister here see it's an office a gift a word a position because that's what an office is it's a position it's something set aside you're in that position nobody's in that position it's not a room sitting over there somewhere it's called an office that's just examples it's a person that's in that office you see that's where i don't it doesn't bother it never has bothered me who i preach in front of yeah but brother dale when when brother moat was here i believe it i give honor to where honors do to me brother moat was the greatest teacher in this message outside of brother brown for this age and time i ain't talking about down in this and that brother vote was a teacher in the body of christ i believe that and i believe by me honoring that he and god honored me and he pulled me into positions and things by that right i believe that all right some of you just to show you the difference brother mo he had his way and we were we were over a certain place and and this brother got up and he said uh we're glad to have brother molten with us here tonight said he's he's uh he's gonna come said you know how he is that he's he's deep in that word that he he teaches and he does and it's that and the other and he said now tomorrow night we're going to have see what was coming tomorrow night was a man that was really built up high moving going you know and jumping and shout he said we'll shatter all over this place said we'll shout up down these aisles and we'll run aisles and then he just realized that he'd opened it up the wrong way on that side and he was degrading brother mulci so this is where he said it he said brother moat's telling us about the word and said tomorrow night we'll know what to shout about he got it back together but listen church a fifo ministry an office think of that now now let me illustrate it all right then we have bob terrence wade who's that how many deacons we got three and we've got three deacons all right that's an office see that's an office they're set aside for a certain thing all right but that doesn't make it to where they can preach it but it makes them the bible said apt to teach they can do things they can come into and teach and and do this and that and the other through the deacon part because that's the bible but that's an office all right now just the esther plays a piano in the nine spiritual gift line that's an office but it's not an office to take her all the way up to where she can come out and preach they'd be getting out of her office she has her office she has to do you have your doing this is lisa she handles the the uh the secretary treasurer part that's an office in the five in the nine spiritual gifts but it didn't put her into the preaching ministry well yeah it can be an office but it's an office and a uh what would you call it just a form to be used because the prophet was explained he said he can take that and use that gift one time and never use it again but he doesn't say that about the five-fold ministry that's the point i'm trying to get each one gets greater and greater in uh the office use and more settled in what that's happening in that office all right you've got to take a a deacon he can teach in the capacity of that part he can do that part because that's part of it but that don't make him a preacher well yeah god can use him because he's a deacon he's set aside for that part and can be used all right but the next part is another office higher form see to come into the fifo ministry and come on church i don't mind saying it i know it you don't like for me to make these statements but there's a lot of pastors in this church i i mean in this message end time that i wouldn't drive two miles to get them here and preach because i don't agree with them huh and then sometimes i wonder how you could listen to them because i'm wondering don't you hear what i hear but i've told people so and so said i never heard him say that well you must have went to sleep because that's just exactly what he said there the other night i told one sister one time i said you shouted all over i thought i was helping her doing because i was her pastor and i said you shouted all over the place that night and that brother was preaching and i said his biggest portion of his message was era i mean even bad you know error well she solved the problem i wasn't her pastor no more she didn't come back no more well that's what i'm saying to you see you you gather to whatever is feeding you're feeding on that's where the i'll give you a fivefold ministry but what if you don't have but a pastor well he can do fulfill no now don't do that don't don't run off and say he can fulfill all of them now brother branham could i can't brother branham could fulfill all the five-fold officers i can't and one minister by myself you can't either that's as blunt as i can put it but see you can move over into a gift part of it and things can work i can go out and and minister to somewhere and go to a church and not preach you know i'm not out there well if you don't like it around here you ought to find you another pastor my number is someone said john's okay you know no you say that's really it is but it's getting the point across at one time we've got to have the five full ministry see you thought i was just talking it the other way taking parts to try to explain it there's no way to explain god in his works works what he's doing he uses what he uses you must look at that and honor it i wish you would go now i'm just serious as i can be about it because i've been just a few little places but i wish you'd go to some of these foreign countries and look how much that pastor is honored look how that minister is honored in that congregation well if it right no we're not talking about that i tried to make that plain to start with we ain't talking about garbage can fifo ministries we're talking about what's supposed to be the real call of god but i'll give you the quote where the prophet said as you honor your pastor so god honors you well brother dale you want me to pat you on the back no but it does feel pretty good i mean you know i do like to hear it every once in a while brother i enjoyed that message i didn't give them one word well that's no problem but you understand what i'm talking about put the the word office in there with the fifo ministry because that's what your profit i got a bunch more here not enough time to cover but covering it the gifts and how the gifts are working in the local assembly brother brown said a pastor would have to answer if the gift was not working in that assembly well i'll have to answer it that's that's why you've never seen me set nobody down i had one incident this brother he said i can speak in tongues anytime i want to i said not according to the bible the bible says as the spirit giveth utterance i said besides you're just speaking in tongues i mean just speaking in spanish and he got upset and left well it must have been right but he was just speaking in spanish and everybody was thinking he was speaking in tongues and i don't know one word except c but i had enough sense to know what he was doing see church i'm trying my best to to get you to see the part that you need to honor and what you need to not honor right we honor god's word and the truth that he brings to us through the fifo ministry that was brought to us by a prophet of god we're not looking for another prophet to come to be able to do that we are not looking for the fivefold ministry to raise up and take the place of the prophet because it will never work but we are what are you looking for i'm looking for the body of jesus christ to rise up i believe in the body of jesus christ as being god himself operating in the church that gives honor to everybody men women children everything amen because it is the body paul spends his time in corinthians read there i was telling somebody the other day about it it's hard sometimes me to read corinthians especially in the early parts of the first corinthians because he seems like he's just telling stories it just seemed like he's telling this it's telling that and you got to get on over into the book before you realize hey he was telling the story he's telling stories about me he was telling what i need to be operational but you understand do i need to read any more about offices or do you want to just you go home and type in office and put in ministry but it'll cut it down you go to office you're going to have a sling and just put ministry brother brown says there's five ministerial gifts there is not one pastor and the rest nothing no it's all the same yeah but the pastors are not the deeper ones i can quote i know what brother brown says about an adoption where your pastors want to do this out in the other but said that teacher he set you in order but i also remember some more where he said your pastor is ordained to lead you through i know how to quote the rest of that he said if he's ordained he put it in the correct order your pastor is ordained to carry you through if if he's an ordained pastor if he's not he ain't gonna carry you nowhere with the fivefold ministry is jesus christ now i'm going to end it with the best way that i can say it honor the minister minister when they're preaching honor the ministers when they're preaching because you're honoring god pray for your ministers not just a pastor pray for the ministers of this church but pray for the offices and the things pray that god will lead us all and that way there won't be no big eye little you i counted an honor to be able to be associated with the end time message but there's a lot goes with that that we would not honor totally but that's not the message something that the holy ghost won't honor is not the message i don't care who brings it to me you or who it is it's not but just one message there's one messenger the lord jesus christ we're just the offices he uses to minister through but you know we are talking to his wife but now when i sat down sitting and ministered up free i become feminist in the body of christ because i am not a pastor sitting there ever who's bringing the word is the pastor you honor it that way and you'll see god will honor you come on musicians you can read but if people don't listen they're not going to pay no attention to you anyway offices it's while they're getting ready but there is five predestinated offices of the church we would see jesus 1962. but there is five predestinated offices now listen of the church apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists that's what god said in the church what the holy spirit that's the office this is the holy spirit okay nine different spiritual gifts all right in every local assembly nine different spiritual gifts then god has said his gifts that he has foreknown for each age and has placed them into the church we find that there's five of those gifts first missionary information all right first is apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors those five god-given gifts is in the church so each of you people now listen so each of you people who have a godly pastor has a gift from god in your church a shepherd pastor means shepherd what greater honor could it be see there's those other gifts that comes into the church right and after the pastor now after the pastor then there's evangelistics come in then there's teachers come in and then there's prophets come in and then there's apostles come in all these together working together with the gifts keep the church re perfected and clean and ready for the coming of the lord see if you'd like to read these i'll be glad to give them to you they're all in my desk thing in there anyway you want them to just see a gift i count the baptism in the holy ghost to be the most important gift that could ever be received by any individual the new birth i hold out i believe that i believe as long as we'll let that operate here we're not promised to everything to go away and not be you know and not have troubles we're going to have that all right but church listen while we're in the i don't know what we're in right now i don't know because it's not to me maybe to understand but there's a kind of like a lull in the religious realms things now that people are just things are not uh beating and banging like they do sometimes but see one of these days they're gonna come after us it may be five years ten years maybe 50 years who's worried i ain't care i won't be here but you just remember that i told you the one thing that i've always wanted a church to be is ready just be ready for everything to take place standing in order i remember in the baptist church there they used to preach that about the armor you remember you know the story and what it is in corinthians in other words you've got the armor of god you put it on i heard that preaching many times i got where i didn't want to read it because all i could do was rest play for this and this for that and i earned for a reason i didn't see a thing in the world that it was talking about to help me in the body of christ but then like i said one day i read a little further and i begin to see the baptism of the holy ghost is that shining armor that you're clothed in let's stand go ahead what we got remember brother bob be ministering this [Music] evening [Music] lord jesus makes everything [Music] [Applause] anybody have a need the
