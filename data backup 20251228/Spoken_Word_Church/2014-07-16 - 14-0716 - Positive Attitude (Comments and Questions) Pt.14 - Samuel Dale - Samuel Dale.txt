Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading Hebrews 10 we'll just try to speak for a little while and then we'll have comments questions and answers or whatever on to what we've been talking about we're not ending this up it's just a point of stopping kind of you're in the middle on faith and we really haven't got to what I wanted to preach on when I started talking about the positive attitude so uh you know maybe we'll get down to it and do it and but glad to hear of all of the good reports and things and uh we pray the Lord would bless remember the fellowship meeting now will be at brother Pageant this coming Saturday 3:30 we will be leaving Wade's house at 11:00 that'll give us plenty of time to run over and get about to eat and make it back in into where we need to be all right I know you've already heard that brother Gibby's report turned out real well we thank God for that uh little baby IA they didn't announce it because we was wondering but she's in Gainesville so that's great not having for rying them having to travel so far backwards and forth but the Lord will take care of it but we were wondering where she was in gains whe are still down in Atlanta but we thank the Lord for that that it'll be all right everything will be in in the way it's supposed to be because we believe it right amen uh I know you've already praying for the Jeff family the funeral will be the viewing will be at 1:00 Friday and the funeral at 3 so just remember that U glad to have sister Trudy and sister Nala back with us so they made it back to the States and you know we we thought maybe you might might get over there and try to decide to stay over there or something so it's back to the States we're glad to have you that all announcements I it's must always miss something all right Hebrews 111 Heavenly Father we thank you for the day and the hour thank you Lord that you would choose us that you would draw a bunch of people together and that you'd get us into a place to where we can hear Thy word we ask you to just come on the scene now and make that manifest in our hearts and lives we've heard tonight many testimonies about your your what you've done Among Us father we pray that it will bring Faith to a place that we can just walk off this Earth because that's our desire in in you is to just have your faith in Lord because we know that it's all in you come on the scene tonight and speak to our hearts and you be the answer to the questions and thoughts and comments and let your loving grace be with us thank you for the things that you've done Among Us Now come and make your man self manifest as we go on into Thy Word in Jesus name amen okay Hebrews 11 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrificed and Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was was not found because God had translated him or before before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him now think about that without faith now and what have we been talking about all of this time about faith all right not just a belief or a thought or a concept or a Doctrine it doesn't say that it doesn't say you can know God by those things but without faith it is impossible to please him we'll get back to these later in another message or so for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I didn't give them any notes to quotes to pull up just some things that we I have here to where keep kind of a thought together in mind because I just want to speak for a little bit and then uh you know then we'll turn it over to you for the questions and comments and and things and we pray that you will speak out and don't worry about uh you know some people have always said like this well I don't know how to ask a question well I don't either so we're both in the same shape um you know you say but my questions are silly you know or foolish or childish or well if you got one you'll keep it until you get rid of it so you might as well get it out in front and get rid of it because there's going to be a hindrance until you do that if you got a question it'll always be there I don't care what you do it'll keep coming back up all right but we've been talking about faith faith and found that it's not a myth or a thought or an idea because the word faith there runs to just believing or belief or doctrine or idea or concept but it doesn't lead us to where that we can see what it's really saying faith is the substance of things that you're asking for right now we were speaking a little bit down at brother Joe's the other night and U you know some points about faith and uh see we we think that we don't have any faith in brother brandham he says he said that's where our trouble is he said it's it's simple he said it's symbolic back there in the Old Testament of the little weed that grows and says it just grows everywhere and say they took that and applied the blood with it he you know and uh he said it's a common thing we see we have faith but we've let hindrances come in our way to hinder us to be able to uh exercise it uh to put it into action to uh you know to let God make it manifest but it was like I was saying in the message the other day if there's more people to come into the body of Christ you know all right more people to be saved come into the body of Christ then God's not through creating right and see he can't be through creating because I believe that you and I somebody will take the word in the last days and speak it a glorified body into existence ever how you want to say it or speak us into eternity whatever because we have to speak for healing we have to say by Stripes I'm Healed now do you really think about that you know think about that you don't have your healing you know you're sick and for it to come into being you must speak it right and are you with me you must speak that healing we see then people say well I don't know where I'll ever be able to come to speak the word well if you ever spoke your healing into existence the healing can't come until you speak it salvation can't come until you speak it well why you know why are we so hindered upon and looking at Faith well I just don't have any faith I just you're here why are you not somewhere else why are you not out in the world and all of the things for some reason you know why don't you put that on the basis of saying well you know we've been speaking the word a long time because we're talking with Brother Gary this morning about it so I believe we must exercise our faith you know I mean you go down to the gym and you walk in you know and you grab a 400 lb barbell and you stick it up over your head and do it about 10 times and lay it down and walk out i' never heard of that happening unless somebody's been working out a whole lot somewhere else you know in a way you know what I'm talking about see it just don't work that way you got to exercise your muscles or they they'll start deteriorating put your arm in a sling leave it there for a couple two or three weeks you have no strength see all right see then it's not to have to go out well I'm going to exercise my faith I'm going to go out and speak this don't that's not that's not what I'm talking about I'm simply talking about just living a daily life being a Christian walking in life and just you know and then when something comes up you say well Lord by his stripes I am healed well now he's waiting on you to say that well is there any difference in you saying by his stripes I'm Healed are you calling flies fleas and frogs into existence that's Brother D now that's just that's just going a little bit too far no it ain't going far enough right did we talk about faith but it's so simple until we pass over it trying to find it and it's kind of like I always illustrate where you're talking about the you know uh the stone that you can't find you got a football field and ain't hardly a Grace PR of Grace in it there's one rock laying in the middle and you're out there for hours trying to find and then you stumble over it you stumble at The Stumbling Stone the thing you're looking for and the only one they are there you know you say well that's silly I agree with you that's how silly we are because we're trying to make things be something that they're not well the spoken word was only for brother brandom and the Lord Jesus now I want the scriptures and I want you know the prophet's message for that well if I can't find it then every who said that's a liar is that blunt enough shouldn't be any problem should it all right but you see we don't think about the things that have actually went on in our lives down through our lives and the Lord leading us and guiding us moving us from here to there or something bringing us from other churches to Lula you know bring this from other states to Georgia but yet we don't think that we don't connect that to the Christian Life why not do you do you follow me I mean had it ever really doned on you for you to be healed you got to say it because God can't make it manifest unless you say it all right sister Gil you mean you've been speaking the word about your healing and you sure I'd love to speak the word one day wouldn't you would you love to speak the word one day and there all your life you've been doing it you spoke it for your salvation come on you got believe in your heart confess with your mouth you mean you spoke your own salvation into being yes but just keep practicing you know what now that doesn't mean I've got to go out every day well I'm going to go try it I'm going to go try it Lord I speak a squirrel into existence see you getting Plum silly what if Satan comes along and brings an illusion into your mind and you wind up with things and you really got a problem if you need a squirrel you speak a squirrel right what you have need of my car is not running too good Lord would you make it to where that I can get to the service station you know I'm running low on fuel would you make it to where that I can just get to the place but brother Dale that's not speaking the word now I'll give you the pull pit for you to explain it you just made your own comments in your mind or wherever you made it come on the pull Pit's open explain to me any other way cuz you're going to come right back and face one thing you can't be healed until you say it you can't be saved until you say it well I never thought of it like that well that's what I'm here for is to make you think you know just to try to get you to think is my job I'll just try to do the best I can if I hurt your feelings doing it I'm sorry but you see we're looking for some great miraculous I have never spoke the word and I just gave you two illustrations that is in if you're a born again Christian it's got to be in your experience that you spoke the word yeah but that just leaves it for everybody it is for everybody the prophet when he was quoting those scriptures there where it says when you spay to this mountain be moved he said that's for anybody it says if you say doesn't say got to be a prophet priest king preacher whatever or a prophet's child or whatever you want to be when are we going to get to the basis that we're going to start believing that we are his offspring and we have been speaking the word ever since we started into the kingdom of God come on may I quote the prophet he said if you don't have enough Faith to speak about your children he said then I doubt if you have any faith for your own salvation now how you like that one is that what he say it well then why don't we speak the word and go forward you know just move on just move on with the Lord and just whatever comes in our way just walk right on and don't be afraid of the devil coming with some thing to put him in front of remember he's a bluff anyway he can't do anything to you until God allows him and that's for a trial and a test for our benefit well brother D you know understand I just like to be able to speak the word okay you'll get one day what I'm talking about you'll see what I'm trying my best to bring into manifestation brother Dell are you trying to get us to speak the word I'm trying to get us to see we have been speaking the word a long time let's just keep on and I don't like the word practice but that's the best word I got because practice makes perfect cuz I've not been a fanatical to go out and speak something into existence you know I'm not talking about going out and doing things I'm talking about just letting what's in you take over and for whatever needs you have I've been pointing to that for a long long time about 40 something years to get you and I to realize what we have in our possession by having the New Birth the position that puts us in by having the new birth CU what do we found out that only Christians have that six sense all right only Christians have that six sense but you see that's where then I have to you know that's my part I reckon in doing it I have to break down things for us to comprehend because that leaves a blank spot in your mind when you say that only Believers has a six sense and then you know somebody did speak the word you know like I was bringing out Sunday you say well can a sinner speak the word he has to speak his own salvation he has to speak his own healing it's not what somebody somebody else speaks for him right but we know and for sure those Old Testament Saints didn't have the six sense into being like it is in the New Testament all right it was there working we read you and talk to about it where Moses brother R said had that six sense but it wasn't a birth in his life but it was a connection to his soul his inward being that he believed God you remember we gave it to you where the deciples didn't have perfect Faith right message perfect faith brother R said they didn't have perfect Faith he said they had Jesus with them as long as Jesus was with them that perfect Faith couldn't be in them right the little woman she had faith for the time for her blood issue and it stopped but she didn't have the new birth and brother R I gave it to you the other day on the maniac of gatera where he said let me just read that one Adam had the Holy Ghost potentially that's right all the prophets as they was moved by the Holy Ghost but the St John said that the Holy Ghost had not yet come for Jesus was not yet been glorified that's John 7:39 Jesus was not yet glorified so the Holy Ghost could not be given to give a new birth that was the kingdom Jesus kept speaking of that they couldn't understand that was what Nicodemus couldn't understand that he needed to be born again amen he had a pretty good sense of Faith he got to the master right he confessed that we believe that no man can do the things you're doing L God be with you a lot of them made those positive statements coming from their inner being but they didn't have a new birth back there all right they didn't have the Life of Christ because Jesus had not been glorified see then the least in the Kingdom according to Matthew 11:11 or 11:13 the least in the kingdom is greater than John the B Baptist no would it say it like that he said it like that because it was true cuz even though John had the holy ghost from his mother's womb he never had the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the way or form that it was brought on the day of Pentecost he wasn't in the Kingdom he was a messenger of the Kingdom but why can't we believe that but to realize then the great thing that God has done because he's given us a super sense he's given to every Born Again believer a super sense that belongs the prophet said to that believer only doesn't belong to everybody but everybody don't have the new birth all right but it belongs to every believer he said the only class of people that has the six sense is a born again believer he said well you just said Moses had Moses had it under a potential form come on can I quote the prophet he said said if we believe under the blood of bulls and goats that a man could speak flies fleas and frog he said what about under the blood of Jesus Christ he made a difference between That Old Testament person and the New Testament person right but see that's that seems to be the hardest thing to do but I knew that when I was in the Baptist Church cuz I could read I could read and realize the least in the Kingdom a newborn believer is greater in the way God wanted it to be than even John the Baptist why can't we believe that and have faith in that come on church I mean you remember we gave the quotes where that you're controlled by the six sense and gave out it it was the armor of God you know the armor the the thing we put on the love joy peace goodness meekness long the stature of a perfect man but when are we going to start believing that we have it instead of believing that one day maybe we will you remember when I started the series I said those in the Bible that ever had a manifestation of things with people that had a positive attitude that's all I'm trying to get you and I to have and would that be wrong to have a positive attitude and brother Gary's daddy said they told him the first day in medical school that if you don't hinder your patience they'll get better like I've always said you go into the doctor and he says you got this disease he said we got a appeel for it but he said we've tried it now on a thousand cases and only one lived and that's it's not too good of a of a bat and average as we call it right but if they say we seen here that 80% of the people who take this medication get over the situation what are they doing building up your confidence building your faith your belief well see I thought then God revealing his word to us God revealing his word to us is what stimulates our faith because what did we find faith is a revelation Revelation is the word of God revealed to you and see then in that when I see something that that comes alive out of the Bible to me the that builds my confidence because I know and realize he's given it to me for that you Brothers was in service you didn't go out the first day and they say there's a wall you're going to get get over it no they started out doing a few push-ups and few pull-ups and a few little Runnings and you know and then right a while you run back by the wall and and you see the guys that's are ahead of you and their their their training and all you know that you watch them and you see them they they just over the wall ain't ready yet exercising what are you talking about brother Dale how do we exercise Faith by reading the word of God right by studying the word of God by listening to tapes and praying and right no that just going into our mental part well it's got to be in there before it can be revealed all right see then faith is a revelation and it belongs to only one class that six sense Belongs to Only One class and it is what controls you because you cannot have that six sense until you're born again I'm just looking down the page if you want me to give you the par paragraph number that was paragraph 53 super sign I got 57 50-59 of the super sense brother BR talking about the the super sense being the Holy Ghost and he says the devil can't touch that sick sense he can't touch it if he touched it he'd get born again is that sensible we're going to we to get into and I'm getting ready to turn it over to you for question and I we're going to get into these so read the the Hebrews 11th chapter and think of these that it says by faith Enoch by faith Noah by faith and we we just try to take maybe one at a time or whatever we want to run through and uh just speak about it but just remember the basis remember the basis of what we were talking about in Hebrews 10:38 Paul is explaining that the just shall live by faith all right and then 111 he tells you what faith is if you took the definition remember of Hebrews 10:38 took the definition of faith or even in 11 one to take the definition of faith and you find out it's a belief a Doctrine a thought a concept or something you know an assurance and God knew that's where we would be so he told us himself see Paul was was looking at it the just shall live by faith but those that turn back and those you remember coming down you remember 38 39 of the 10th chapter but then he stops and he says faith is the substance things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen then he starts and he's defining what happened with the people who have that faith but he concludes that in the end and he says but they without us cannot be made perfect you know my understanding of that maybe is carnal I guess but uh if I was falling off of a cliff and on to a rope uh I wouldn't want Jonas to be expected to pull me back up he try you know but I'd want somebody a little stronger would you and as I said about the service I thought what they done was is they trained you upwardly until the body begins to develop to the point that it can stand the pressure and then they'll put more test in front of you and a lot of them you failed I'm sure but you know after a while you got where you could get over the hurdle right but one day you graduated well see this is the only graduation we're going to have in this to me is when these old bodies are changed then we'll graduate out of this situation you know because it's a never ending thing Faith the six sense the word of God being revealed whatever you have need of you should say it well now I remember so and so that done that and I been there with you been in churches where they tried to get people to practice it and that's the reason I don't like that word practice but it's only want to have but you know trying to get to people I remember one brother was going to speak a an ALB old groundhog into existence well I never did understand why he wanted an albino groundhog because it ain't worth eating to start with it wouldn't matter where they black green or blue or white but he he was going to speak on albo Groundhog well he said that's what the Lord told him now there's where trouble comes in that we get an what you call it an Intuition or thought or an idea and we build it and then we we try to make that manifest when well you say and here's the way we do we say well I spoke Lord for an albino groundhog but I killed a brown cat so I guess the cat was chasing the albino groundhog and I just killed a cat see we try to prop up everything right you know why not just be honest and flat and just forget it I sitting on a deer stand one day and I don't mind telling you this and I sitting there thinking and I thought Lord I could just speak a deer in existence and I could shoot that deer and I'd go back and tell them what I done and about that time this little voice come along and said sure there's a lot of eyes in that you know I'd speak it I'd do this I'd go back and tell it brother brandham never done it that way right it wasn't I'll do this I'll do that it was I done this and done that because I was challenged to do so then what do you have need of you need squirrels speak them into existence but brother Dale you're trying to make us all prophets uh can I quote the scripture let's see was it Paul or was it who was it one of them said I would to God that we were all prophets is that Paul I believe that's right now if I'm wrong on that but I I may be paraphrasing it but I think that's scripture I would that we all be prophets or maybe it's one of the Old Testament prophets speaking about it you know I'll find it okay I thought God wanted all of his children to be his children to be like him and you know what he only spoke as was needed when you realize what I'm talking about you'll see brother randam didn't play with a gift to practice like I was using the word practice to try to go out and do something ahead of time he just waited and God used the gift well that's what we're supposed to do right you don't pray for rain in a monso season you you've heard me say that a many a time you know it's raining like everything and you get out and say Lord I call for rain no I call for it to stop you know if it's raining real bad all right but you see that's what we think boy I prayed for rain we got rain we tell it ahead of time you remember the time I spoke here and I said July and August are driest months but this next two months will be the wetest months we've had it was on record in Gainesville Georgia that it was but you see I was just taking God as his word and just saying what I thought he said what are you listening I turn it up back to you are you listening are you thinking about it correctly that faith is so simple it's just so simple until we stumble all over it trying to find it I don't want you to raise your hand or comment or do anything I asked my wife a question the other day but I just want to illustrate something with it in the creation Now I'm just illustrating something that will help the next message or so in the creation on what day was the World created you ain't moving because you know there a problem don't you but write down on the page in front of you what day the world was created all right everybody got it wrote down I've read lips and heard voices enough to know that a lot of you are saying that the world was created on the first day was not World wouldn't created it on the first day if he did you made brother ROM a false prophet you know why because brother brandom said well it says in the world was what is the wording there in Genesis let's go back yeah but let me go back to the let's go back to that I'm just illustrating a point because that's what I asked my wife a point that see we see things like this and we see things the way that it's done and we think it's a revelation and it's a great thing but really it's just an actual reading of the word that's how simple it is in actual reading of the word the world was not created created on the first day the world was created in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period so the world could be billions of billions of trillions of years old you ever heard your Prophet say that but see if the world was created on the first day you'd make him a false prophet or a liar there because he'd be wrong go in Genesis and read it in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth just period that stopped right and watch and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water right that's still back through eternities and eternities of eternities and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and and God called a light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning was the first day it's a simple fact to read the word of God I'm illustrating faith and how simple it is once it's made reveal or thought come to you do you think well the world was made on the first day no the world was created without form and void could have been billions of years and that's why they Tak prove that there so many billion years old or this or that or the other but when they start putting a man back there they got to do it by carbon content or checking his bones and things and like I was reading there last night brother BR said if you had a bone that was thousands of years old he said it couldn't be it wouldn't be preserved too good he said because it would just be gone away you know see that's the problem they're taking the dust and the dirt that's collected around the bone and they're analyzing what's on the bone and it's showing that it's billions of years old that's true the dirt and the things is true it's billions of years old but they're taking that carbon content it's really coming from the dirt and the ashes and the stuff around the bone or on the bone that makes it look like the bones that open bone ain't but 6,000 years old right see now we got the Bible in the correct order as an understanding and our faith is correct now you can have faith in the Bible as to say the Bible doesn't say the world was created on the first day and we only got 6,000 years or six days it doesn't say that he said the heavens and the Earth was created and it literally says our Heavens remember Paul spoke of the heavens of heavens and they asked brother brandham a question that brother brandham is it more than one world he said there's worlds of Worlds worlds of Worlds letot of them out there in space floating around called Mars venis lot of Worlds it's all CU Genesis says worlds are created what are you trying to illustrate and get ready for the question I'm saying what I've tried to say to start with that faith is very very simple but it is the word of God once it's brought into light you know and you'll see that it can't be said any other way because the way that it's said sometimes is to Blind some and Open the Eyes of others but it says the same thing and faith is very very simple it's just believing all right but it's believing the right thing right it's waiting on God to reveal that to you what is the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you you remember how we brought the quote out brother R said that that six sense is the same six sense that God used to create the world well then why are we so stumbling at the point of thinking about creating well let just not for us I want that quote I want to see that I want to read that in the Bible but it's not there so go ahead it's not going to change you because you're going to think that it takes God to be able to break that down to where your eyes can see all I can do is speak and try to open them show you how simple faith is but he says in the beginning God created heavens and the Earth period just stopped brother R said he let this thing float down through there he said then in come the ice ages and the things and they can prove that happen he said that's how that great big Grand Canyon was cut it wasn't just water running over a rock see then it's very simple brother Brown said it like this he said well he was a prophet that's right but he was a man of simple thoughts he said they're trying to go to the Moon said that doesn't make no difference said when they get there they ain't going to find nothing you know what they got there they found nothing just as simple as it could be you say well the Lord showed him that did the Lord show him that or was he speaking words from his lips that God was allowing to be you know sometimes it might not be you because I'll put it in plain language if it's me trying to speak it won't happen that's practicing trying to get it to work but if he says it I don't worry about telling nobody see I'm the kind of person that'll tell you now if that don't happen then the Lord didn't speak to me I'm not going to prop it up you know well it should have been this or could have been that or maybe it was that no like a man made a statement one time about somebody and he said because they'd went against him and he said let's just wait and see what'll happen to them people Brother Richard if you live 10 more years there going to be a lot of things happened to you you right it might not be because I said it it's just simply because it's going to be but yeah we think it's something then something happens look at there but what they don't see is is that when you think you're trying to bring it on somebody else be careful you're opening up a door for it to come on you open your blinded eyes to the point that you try to call down something on somebody else it'll come back on you but are you going to admit it if you got the six sense you don't have to worry about it who's first six sense Faith the new birth Faith the baptism of the Holy Ghost Faith something real a substance get Danny and then we'll get H coming up the line okay well here I go y'all you started out by said you didn't know how to ask well I probably don't know how to ask but uh you talking about the Blank Spot earlier and we well most of us here know that uh when I was in the hospital three weeks whose Faith was that to carry me through exactly exactly wouldn't Danny no but you know it is tough yeah not knowing what happened for 3 weeks don't know who you talk to what you talk about who come to see you and the way I understand it I mean you and Brother Dean Jo some of y'all were there almost as long as I was and uh get all about Fai been simple well that's a good thing because I'm a I'm a simple guy y'all forgive me in but the last thing I remember before I fa is I saw how uneasy or how uncomfortable Jacob was being on the roof for me I'm not I'm I'm I've been out on tree limbs on roofs I've been I've been everywhere give me up four five stories what I N I might get a little nervous but I mean nothing like that really bothered me and I saw how uneasy he was and I took my hat off and I bow my head Lord take care of us yeah and when I ask the Lord something I believe right I'll get it and I know this might sound a little little odd but for five weeks I'm in the hospital I don't know that I ever prayed once because of medication or what have you but uh it had faith I guess to carry me through this right even though I didn't know I mean I you know I still don't know I don't have a clue for three weeks what went know but uh faith is simple and just when you ask when you ask the Lord for something believe right and me me I do right good way of putting it is believing him believing that you that he'll do what you ask him well there's not a daddy in here that wouldn't do everything he could for his kids right but the think see that your thoughts was on him Jacob not on yourself see and just simply thinking and believing see we don't think about that being you know that that was God working his way out bring it to a place we just think it's well something it happened I don't think so I think he works out a lot of things in our lives that we don't know nothing about simple Faith Brother Sam you know I've worried you to death over the last couple months since I've been coming here well since my daddy died I've had a lot of troubles issues and problems to go along with I guess living in this world I was talking to my mama up a little further about being so simple it's funny you preaching about that tonight because last night I was on the phone my Mama saying Mama faith and believing in God is so simple we get lost trying because we step over we go past it we look try to look and see something that we shouldn't even be trying to see it's just simple as getting on your knees and asking God to reveal reveal it to you my questions I tell my wife every day we get up honey we got to leave here we go in faith we trust God that the day is going to work out be it a bad day or not if we trust him at the end of the day we'll go to bed and night feeling good about what we've done and that's the way we've been living now for a good while and it's funny that yesterday afternoon my sister called me and then her boyfriend called which is the kids is Daddy and they're all fighting well I tried to talk them down tell them look you need peace you need to pray before you talk to my sister I told my sister you need to ask God to give you the words to talk to the man because he don't know what is right you know and then my mama called me back that night and said hey everybody's peaceful here you just you just like you was telling us a while ago we got to speak it into existence we got to tell our friends we Susan is one of the greatest people in my life I call her and I worry that poor lady to death because I need to hear myself say what I need to believe I have to you know she listens to me she lets me voice what I feel inside and sometimes she correct me if if she don't feel like I'm right and then she'll tell me to call Brother Sam and I've called you several times with questions I don't want to mislead somebody that I love very much I've watched my daddy for a lot of years correct himself and walk away come back and talk to Mama because he loved her enough to C about what he told her you know and she loved him enough to listen I want that same love right so I'm willing to give it to get it and it goes with all the people in this church I love every one of y'all y'all have been really good to me and my wife I'm I was I laid in jail and I asked God if I'm supposed to go back to that church when I get out of here you put me back in there he put me in a house over there with no rent a place to stay for me and my wife and this church has filled that house up with everything we need we've got no reason not to be here and be grateful and thank God every day for every one of y'all and that he's even acknowledged that we're here on this planet yeah I'm grateful for that and I need for all y'all to know that I love y'all guys who'll be next what do you think about faith Annie I've had a lot of things to happen in my life but one time uh Samuel had this Uncle he was lost as lost could be he cussed and never went to church or anything that we know of and they lived in South Carolina so he got real sick and they had him INT in intensive care so Simon's sister I usually would not have went but she didn't have anybody to go with her so she was going over to see him so when I got there they wouldn't let anybody go in because they just go certain hours in intense of care so they said well since y'all are out of town we'll let you go in so he was on all kind of you know tubes and wires and everything else so something just hit me I knew he wasn't saved so when I walked in all I could get to was his toe I was at the end of the bed I just touched his toe and I said Lord just let him come out of this hospital and get saved and they said after he got out of that hospital they lived in a meal Village they both worked in a cotton mill or something they said he got out when he got out he went to all the churches around all the neighbors and in one year the Lord took him so I thank God that he he got saved before his life ended and see that's Faith just to believe what you asked for I've told you before about him that he chewed to backa real bad but he chewed it all day and he swallowed every bit of it that's how bad he was something happened in that hospital room he never chewed again never chewed another bit of tobacco after he left that hospital and he done that all his life cuz I remember when I was a little kid watching him getting sick because he swallowed all that down he never spit out his tobacco until he got ready to eat that's how bad it was on him he chewed to Twist tobacco not plugs old twist but after then he never chewed no more but see all of us can testify and the things that had happened but do we realize that who was doing that was it you asking or was it just the thought come to you to ask not you that speak us what scripture says it's the one in you speaking are we going to believe it that sister Trudy the the one who just got back we can call her the got back Trudy now um I just wanted to give a little report on my mom's situation and it also has to do with faith as well um while I was there now my mom is not a Believer as yet um but because of the prayers that com from this church she don't know it yet but what I'm getting from her is that she know that God is working in her life MH and working with her um I'm not going to be in a position to like push on her because sometimes it get a lot of negative feedback um but knowing that she said that I felt like you know it's working is a wheel within a wheel just going and I just want everybody to continue praying just not just for her healing but mostly for her salvation exactly um she's the only thing I have over there and I just wanted to be to make it amen um I just wanted well most of you know my oldest daughter pervine does a lot of work in the Middle East and you know I've prayed worked with my kids all the time that they're growing up but her job a lot of times I pray extra prayers for her but I just wanted to tell you about one time she was telling me when she was in Egypt she U she always liked to get out early in the morning and walk or run you know before she starts her day and she was doing that she's I think she was in a bedin village but she was going across the desert following a road down and she said she saw a truck coming down the road and it was full of a lot of young men and uh when they saw her the truck stopped and they all started to get down and she was looking around and there was nowhere to go and nothing to protect her and she was getting scared said you know what am I going to do now and she said then all of a sudden they all started running back to the truck and scrambled inside and she looked around and there was a dog beside her yeah and you have to understand in Egypt they don't have dogs or very very few a lot of cats but hardly any dogs and I asked her why they ran away and she said because they're afraid of dogs they think dogs have demons basically and I said did you see where the dog came from she said no and I said what happened to it she said it followed me all the rest of the day back to the camp and then in the evening it just walked off she said I don't know where it came from I don't know where it went right so if that's not the hand of God right amen that's what we believe you'll be there who'll be next that right I used talking about while ago about practicing going to the doctor they wants me to take two blood pill blood pressure pills so the last time I went to uh to the doctor I told him I wasn't taking those two I was cutting them down to uh a half each yeah and now I'm down to just a half on one and you talking about practicing well I call it exercise in my faith and all cuz I don't temp God you know what I mean but I just believeing I get I take that half right by God's grace just say it and go forward we'll be next this may sound kind of silly to people but you know I have a lot of things on my Facebook about natural news and health health things and stuff like that um anyway one of the things things that I was reading was at Monsanto one of the big companies they're the ones that made the agent orange for Vietnam well they are now going to start spraying our food that is growing with this agent orange and you know one of the things that the Lord showed me not just within the past few weeks you know the scripture where it says we can pick up serpents or drink deadly things and you know it wouldn't harm us I said well you know what come to me it didn't necessarily mean that we were going to pick up a a drink of Arsenic and drink it like I mean that could be too but the food stuff that's out there right now that we consume all of the stuff that they have in that all it's doing is deteriorating every's body everybody's body but you know when we pray over our food that prayer of faith keeps that stuff right from doing us such harm and it's like you always tell us when it comes to medication put a prayer cloth in there sanctify it before you take it that God would take the side effects away so that's Faith that's faith in his word that he'll do what we asked him to do so that's just something that had come to me and I thought well Lord that is so simple but that that's exactly what it is it's faith in believing what he said he would do amen exactly Brother Sam we don't know if we've got faith until we exercise it right and I think a lot of times I'm learning I'm talking about me now what I'm going to say but I have learned in the last few weeks listening to you and listening to what's come up on my iPod at home home and just watching life that we're missing out on a lot of things that are extremely simple simply because we just don't stop and take God at his word and stand there we let Satan throw us a curve and lose it as for instance we went with down and was with Brother Dean and sister Peggy today the doctor had told Brother Dean his small blood vessels were collapsing today they weren't but it worked around where you had a different doctor and this doctor was very thorough I could go in detail but take too much time but just to make a make a point and an i Peggy and Dean all believe that God arranged everything that happened down there today the doctor getting changed and everything else was so that what God had done for Brother Dean was made manifest he the doctor had the doctor that treated him today testified that God had been there amen where it works believe in him and just go on who's next when you said that uh Adam had uh I always thought that Adam had eternal life in his soul now how could that not be God in his soul it was well how could he I forget how you said he had it it was like he words what you're saying Jesus hadn't died yet that type of thing but but remember Adam was by impartation he never went through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come into the kingdom because the kingdom was not present but he started the first person with the example of what he would end that mankind upon so he had to start Adam with eternal life in the soul that's true see and he imparted it all right now I don't put them in the same category but I give an example uh because see Adam was the first and he brought in but one day the foolish virgins will be given eternal life right right but that eternal life will not be the kingdom of God in the bases of what we call the new birth it's an impartation it's given unto them you know on the basis that God promised it and that makers we make the foolish virgins the fal Jew the different ones that are there it will give them eternal life to their soul but they have nothing to do with you're 144,000 after we leave out of here and the kingdom is gone they will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which will give their soul eternal life but it will not not make them part of the body of Christ so Adam's not part of the Bride no so you didn't have a bride Christ that was a bride of of Jehovah so it has to what I'm seeing immediately is that to be part of the Bride it has to be a decision on our part exactly where Adam didn't have that exactly that's why I use the word impartation okay he just spoke right into existence into Adam right just like he'll speak to the 144,000 he'll speak to the through the two witnesses I mean the uh the fill Jew the ones who don't have it like he'll speak to the foolish virgins one day and they'll receive eternal life but it does not make them the body of Christ there's a lot of difference in it because we have to do with receiving that we have to go through steps to receive that eternal life and that's something that we do you know we we're a part of it right but yet uh it's it's a how can you explain eternal life uh once they receive eternal life sure that'll be eternal life but they will never be bride even though they will be given eternal life because see we have something to do with being bride you know you know a man can ask you to be his wife but you must accept and walk into that or you're not his wife so that's be the difference okay and that's when I use that to liken Adam to the bases that God gave him Eternal and I believe he gave Eve eternal life right I believe in their soul they had eternal life all right but that was the way God started Mankind and speaking of what it would be when it was finished up cuz see Jesus didn't have to have impartation to receive eternal life he was eternal life you so he chose us by his for knowledge but we chose him yeah we chose him when when you say yes to a boy that asks for your hand in marriage you're choosing him right over other men exactly okay see we get it all in our mind to think now wait a minute he chose us we didn't choose him give you a quote for that you know he chose us we didn't choose him right but if you don't accept it it's not yours so in the basis you chose it in the basis of accepting it right you accepted what he gave to you right if you didn't you don't have it okay that's the difference anybody else lot people know my dad David yeah today would have been his 87th birthday he had a lot of faith one time uh we went to uh Alto up here at Arendale I had a brother that was in incarcerated there and they've been talking about it was going to rain all day long and and the it got so dark and everything and uh we were standing outside the gate and it was going to be a while before we could get in and Dad grabbed my hand and he said let's pray that this storm's going to pass over well we started praying there was people all around us and everything they were just looking and it come just a few drops of rain and then it cleared up and it was over with right and he had faith my healing too when I when I didn't have it that's what we're not doing s g you we're not trying to be any different Faith than what everybody always always had it's a same faith that was in the first church age second third fourth fifth all the same Faith go ahead well I'm 76 so I could talk all night but when our children were at home we had this sign that hung over the first one's bed and uh they made it in U in church you know the kids when in one of the groups and it said let go and let God and as each child married and left it hung over the next child bed and I just I'm getting it framed again now I still have it and you know you have to let go of your own thoughts your own desires what you see and just let go and let God do his beautiful thing right to me that's Faith just let go believe him ask him tell him you know I always tell him Lord you know I'm selfish and this is the way I want it to be but I want it to be the way you want it to be and you know he's never failed me yet I'm 76 I've known him since I was 12 he's never failed me with my Katie I turned her over to him the day I came home from the hospital and I I mean I was sitting on that sofa and I said Lord you know you know what tomorrow what down the road holds for that child it could be something terrible and you know I know that you know what's best I wanted to stay I'm selfish I wanted to have a good healthy full life but whatever you have decided whatever you saw that I give her back to you she's yours that burden left me that day I didn't cry another tear and I had cried all day the day before and you know it's just I could go on and on and on we all could I mean God is so faithful to us when we don't really deserve it exactly because it's Faith it's simply believe in him believe in it go ahead I just want to make one more statement my dad died about 3 years ago and I kept on wondering all my life growing up why he called God his he'd always say me and my God's right together because before he died I don't know what come on me but I sat down in the building with him and asked him I said Daddy are you right with God I want you to know I thank God for you've been a good daddy I love you you've been good to me my whole life but I need to ask you if you've got yourself right with God he said I'm right with my God and I never understand never understood what he meant by my God until I come here yeah now I know he's mine too exactly he's my God who'll be next sister um I want to say two things uh first of all his dad bill was just a fixture in my life all my life and I remember you remember brother brandham saying how that people would drive to the meetings and broken down old cars well his daddy was one I all my life I remember hearing them tell tales about how Bill would have to stop every few miles and put oil in the car you know and and they would hear brother Brandon was there and they would just pick up and go and come back that day and stuff so that when I think about Bill I think about that but the other thing is you said Sunday you mentioned how H you ask us a question have you ever had it happen to where you knew you no one could take it away from you when when something happened well this is a really kind of a simple thing I mean it's not a monuments healing or anything but several years ago um anybody knows JC um he when my mom passed away he wanted to to move and she had lived there all her life there in whiteall and he wanted to get away from whiteall so they uh well actually it was before Mama died actually when they moved um and he moved her out to a trailer park and she grieved leaving mama and stuff and I moved back in with Mama um but she wasn't happy and she talked to me about it and I said well let's just pray about it well he ended up moving her next door to the property and so he had sold the the property that she loved he that Daddy gave her he had sold it but it was like owner finance so the guy was paying him every month so they moved next door to the property that she loved and I just I remember just when I said that to her it just felt it just felt different you know it just felt different than just saying it you know right well didn't think nothing else about it prayed about it and didn't think nothing else about it they moved back in next door and every little bit it would just you know maybe maybe months but it would come to my mind you know cuz she would grieve over it and talk to me about it this guy ended up I mean he was a good way into paying for it and he ended up filing bankruptcy and and the property went right back to them and then and and right now she's back in that property and and it's but what my point is she's happy about it you know living there but it it it me it seems like like she'll relive it all and and and and in my mind when she talks about it I'm thinking about what the Lord did MH you know that that's that faith that thing happened with me but I it didn't it didn't seem to impact her in that same way and so that's just one of those little simple times that I always when you talk about faith I always remember that little situation right who's next I think about when um my mother came to the church she was on oxygen you know and she'd been around how order and all of us and I saw her faith building and and as everyone knows she was delivered from being on oxygen for last couple years of her life then I think about my father who came to the church heard the word and and some of the thoughts he had and then I think of about he how he called me one day and said he called tell you goodbye and that's where you going he said I'm going the hospital not coming out and I said well where's your faith and he said he was real carnal you know so but I had called brother Wade and and talk to you all about the day I had to disconnect the machines on him and I think you know he saw the word manifested in my mother in her healing and then he was always negative about what we believed and yet then I think about Marybeth being around here all all that time and around all the word and then when she had her leg cut off just you know a while back I had I asked myself where's her faith I mean she had to see the works and it wasn't Works she had to see the word manifested but in that was some Works where mother was healed and I just don't understand how you can walk around and be so close to the truth and yet blind yourself of it and deny it and then you sit and look and see what where they're at some people just have to be petted I guess some people like like that but I I I don't understand why if you see something happen in a healing you've got to be the in the natural I would think you at least pursue to try to understand how that happened you know so I just thank God that that Janet you know I always went to church and when Janet and I first met for two years I'd go to church church on Sunday she wouldn't go and I went and I'd go and she she said I'll come to church when you come hear the word that's where we came here it be 20 years uh November yeah I just thank you for helping me who'll be next brother Aaron just want to give a little testimony um everybody knows about my job situation and how everything went and you know just having faith to believe that God would make a way and you know just it's almost amazing but just the way God works it I was able to get this job the way I did and uh everybody asked me every morning how I'm doing and I tell them I'm doing great super wonderful and I just had my first review this this this month been there been there a year and you know I thank God for him being with me um because there's times when things happen I know it's not me I know it's him uh the scripture says that uh Proverbs says a man's gift Will Make Way for him make room for him and I know it's I know it's him not me that because you come to situations you have problems and things and he gives you the answer oh yeah and you know people say well I had a had a good review and uh my boss's boss made the comment said Aaron's the most capable person we have in in my in my part of Maintenance and you know I know that's not me that's him but you know I just put my trust in him right and he's brought me through all this and it's it's not been me it's it's been him the whole time amen and amen and a lot of people may not know but but we had a situation at work today we had a a disgruntled employee came and he made some threats against some people when he came and there was some people in the plant that had had seen this man come through and he come right through where where we were at come through my department and come right in the plant and then you know they couldn't find him or anything like that you know every and they had Place shut down people were looking for him and everything but you know you never know in a situation like that that somebody comes in with a gun and we've seen situations in the news how things have happened and you never know what's going to happen but I'm so glad he's there and you know never was never was afraid never feared a moment that I was there and we had a Mee and they told us about it and I walked out of that was talking to one of the guys I work with and I told him I said the Bible says no weapon formed against you shall prosper exactly and you know nothing happened today we was able to they let us go home early today but you know nothing happened everybody went home safe and y'all just continue to pray for him as of this evening they still didn't know where he was at but they didn't see see him in the building today but y'all just pray for him but I'm just so thankful that he's there with us all the time amen and amen even when we're unconscious and don't know it brother uh I just want to say something based on what Aaron was just talking about I was over in Winder and seeing my son and I come down the road and come up to this convenience store on a hot day it was it was a 100 degree day and I look up and I pull in this convenience store and guess who I see on top of the roof up there with all that heat all that hot air blowing and then him working on a hot air conditioner was my brother Aaron he didn't have no business up on top of that roof way up there and I mean I know he's not a a ballet dancer or anything you know and he don't have no business up there and there he was up on the roof trying to make a living doing the best he had right in front of him and I thought to myself I said Lord why is our brother up here like this on this roof he just I mean I'm not saying he wasn't qualified to do it yeah he's he's good at it he's good at his job but not as you know I thought to myself I said Lord we got to get him somewhere else get him off that roof and out of the heat because it was it was up there it was bad and I thought to myself that's just a simple things like you said one one can chase a thousand two Chase 10,000 I said he needs to get another job Lord right and uh here he is he's testifying about it and I thank God for the little things that happened in our day every day every day exactly I thought about writing down everything every day that God does for me and I spend my whole day writing right because he shows it to me right I thank him for it I thank him for this word I thank him for this church and I thank the ministry that's here I know it's God sent and I feel like I know he sent me here for a reason and that reason's being manifested and fulfilled all right and I and I love it I appreciate it who'll be next looking all over uh I guess most of y'all knows Chris the the the boy that I raised and um recently well I guess in the last year or so that uh the man that was supposed to be his father passed away and he decided that we as as parents to him mistreated him because we didn't have the didn't give him the opportunity that he needed to know his daddy but I told him from the time that we first took him we went to court and the court T had the man to be in court with him and he asked him said are you his father he said no I'm not so the judge just missed him from the court and told him to go on by his business because if you're not his father you don't have no need to be here and uh for for a while for a long while you know kind of bother me a good bit you know like I've took you off the street and raised you and now you don't even want to speak to me don't even want to know who am claim that you doesn't even know me and he put stuff all on you know Facebook with people that the girls one that was his sister that this this is my family and uh but I I I think I had enough faith that I began to just push him you know push the thoughts out of my mind and and and carry on with God because I know that he will continue to carry me through whatever things is happening and uh I mean you know he's he's he's gotten away from serving God in a way and and um he recently I was at a thing with Ru sisters for for Father's Day and his wife and he he does have a daughter and daughter came but they refused to even speak to me acknowledge that I was there and uh but I said well I've did the best I could with him to help him understand who God was but he said well I was glad when I turned 18 so I don't have to go to church anymore and uh so he he he's he's really gotten away from it but you know I I just I just read I read the Bible I keep it keep going you know what Paul said this this one verse I want to read here in Peter part of wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them to and be established in this present truth and so I have the faith are the present truth of God's word that's what I continue to hold fast to and I continue to pray for him too because he's in a terrible place so just thank God for for his faith that's the main thing is you can come out of it with the right attitude that's come out of the right attitude to do the best you can and then get ridiculed and all but still right attitude you know God can take that and work a lot of Miracles right anybody else I just want to give the Lord all the praise and glory for my job I've never been without a job from the day I started work more than a weekend I've been through five plant shutdowns I've uh commissioned a couple plants but I was taken standing one day working for this guy in Gainesville who I helped start his company and I was bored and I said Lord if it your will I change jobs Give Me A Sign I worked with him 3 years and I hadn't talked to a head hunter in 3 years 30 minutes later I got a phone call and got a job offering and the one I'm at right now and this company is wasn't making that I'm with now was not making any money hadn't made a profit in three years they have uh we got started receiving bonuses one year after or eight or 10 months after I got there the company things turned around the Lord just put me there at the right time and we got a another bonus yesterday 52% and it said it was a 60 out of 63 months we have made it 62 times yeah a bonus and that's just the Lord blessing right the company has bought another company two more companies with seven plants it's just growing leavs and Bounds and I my L my I have testimonies of my boss where he was buying a house and he called me said you need to pray we can't close this house cuz we can't find this lady we prayed and that lady walked in the house and she said something's happened because I'm never at home and that phone rang yeah but there's just more and more testimony that God's in all of it right and when you see people that these people were so uh I mean they didn't have a good word to share their attitude was terrible nobody talked about the Lord everything was bad words but now there's an atmosphere where you're sharing a little bit so there's some people that's come out that wouldn't speak of the Lord more and more are so I I just think he put me there for that purpose to share yeah but I'm telling you he's uh they don't know how he's bless amen anybody else where we go I just want to give one more testimony I was thinking you know about what you said to speak what you need when you have need of it you know cuz you don't play games with this right but years ago when my children were small there was a Sher had to be out of town and he was out of town for about six weeks I think and I was at the house and we kept getting a rash of obscene phone calls and you know I wouldn't talk to the guy but every few days he'd call back again and uh I I was praying about it I said you know Lord what can I do so finally uh when one day when he called I just told him I said I rebuke you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you leave us alone don't call anymore and then I hung up the phone well I had to I think it was the next day I had to go somewhere Kevin
