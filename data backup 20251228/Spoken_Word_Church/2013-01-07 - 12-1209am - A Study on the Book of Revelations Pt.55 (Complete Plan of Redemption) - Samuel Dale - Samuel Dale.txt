Revelations 1 and Hebrews 9. father we thank you for your love and your grace to us we thank you for the day and the time that we have upon the Earth and we pray that you would just bless us and Lord we pray that you would give us understanding of you because that's our desires and our heart forgive our sins because we know that we fail you we're just a born failure but yet we know that's not what you're depending on you're depending on how much we can believe what you've done for us we pray that you'd bless and God each one remember the ones that are missing Lord today remember brother Claude Darren just bring him on out of the problems and everything and just let your love be made manifest in his heart have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in Jesus name amen and amen okay Revelations one that we've been reading for quite a while in Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy what about a great blessing for you and I are at and keep those things which are written therein or the time is at hand now we're going to today take a doubt and make it on the complete Plan of Redemption so let's go over and read what Paul says in the ninth chapter of Hebrews not 1 through 15. then verily the first Covenant and also ordinances of divine service and the world is sanctuary for dire was a tabernacle there was a tabernacle made the first we're in was cam the Candlestick and the table and the shoe bread which is called the sanctuary and after this after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called a holist of all which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold we're in was the golden pot that had Manna and everyone's Rod that buddied and the tables of the Covenant and over it the cherubims of the glory of Glory shattering The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first Tabernacle accepting or accomplishing excuse me the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people and the Holy Ghost does this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest well as the first Tabernacle was yet standing in the word Jesus Christ hadn't come and died so you couldn't go through the complete point right which was a figure for the time than present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect that's pertaining to the conscience see there's no soul back there right to enter into the believer to bring him into the correct way now which stood only in meats and drinks and divers Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation now that word Reformation is uh setting things right you know getting it correctly not not the great Reformation of Luther Wesley all right now but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for Earth the blood of bulls and and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the Flesh in other words if that done back dire how much more shall the blood of Christ through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is the metered mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressors aggressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance we may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I'm going to try to preach as much as I can without reading I've got a few quotes I need to feel necessary to read but how this quote you know when you keep going and uh I want to just take a thought on a complete Plan of Redemption and taking it from word that we've been studying in the Book of Revelations and we've come up through and brought it out onto our life's thoughts we're dealing with the 144 thousand of the chosen of Israel and the Redemptive plan for them and then coming into seeing what would be in this day so I just thought I would just preach a message on it and then we'll have questions and answers Wednesday night so write down your questions and we'll try our best to cover it you know because I love questions and answers you know because they bring out what's on our thoughts all right now a complete plan or the complete Plan of Redemption now I'm going to be dealing with bringing it not to just try to show this that you know a point I'm talking about the Plan of Redemption For All Mankind yeah all right which will finality in the in to the world would even come forth and and be in that redeemed part good to see Sterling back there with us get him back with us and get him out of those places in the hospital thank God for being with him and taking care of it man but now do you understand what I'm doing I'm going to try to bring a message of the complete Plan of Redemption and if I'm slow I'm gonna have to try to follow my notes as much as I can because if I don't I'll jump over and get off the topic that I want to deal with so now remember if I were you I would even jot down as we go along because when I'm speaking of our thankless he'll be speaking of the Old Testament Saints the bride uh the foolish virgins the 144 000 two witnesses dealing and the fifth sealed Jew all right so now that's five groups of people to be dealing with so now don't cross me up and just think your mind cuts off and you you're going along and you're listening and I changed from Full Experience to the bride and then you just keep on going well you're going to totally misunderstand what I'm talking about and accuse me of saying something that I'm not saying so listen and I'll try my best to say this is this this is this this is this two or three times to make sure you understand because I know how the human brain works uh it'll do we we had the uh a good life last night because sister Trudy had brought a a rock to the house it's got a light but in it and it's supposed to keep you from snoring well it get it home for us because we couldn't sleep with a light on so it worked all right so I got it down under the pulpit anybody get that doctor's sleeping this morning all right we may hire your high a few times try to get through by two o'clock but we want to do that but listen I think it's necessary that we understand the Plan of Redemption that's right and I will not be dealing with just what happens to the soul what happens to the body what happened I'm going to be dealing with the people you know and the groups of people that are involved in Redemption all right and that away see then we'll try to cover it and like I said This is 40 something years I've studied in one message to try to pick up and see what the prophet has said about it and the Bible and to be able to follow it all right now to speak about Redemption we start off by saying that it means someone or something called the deal with the world but someone is lost all right now I do not believe of the doctrines of the people of the message that you come into the world with eternal life because if you do that way then you're going to bypass Calvary you don't need Jesus Etc I Believe by God's foreknowledge by his predestination the I believe that he can say you always was eternal but if you'll keep reading you'll see he says if you have the new birth if I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right it's not just basing that you're eternal right even dealing with the bride on it see I believe we all come lost that's right because of the fall in the garden all mankind everybody yes is lost and needs a savior all right right now we know that Adam and Eve caused that problem because they were not lost right but they became lost and that was our representation that put us into a place of needing a savior all right now and to do that then if we realize we're lost and want to be redeemed the prophet of God made the statement one day he said you know if I wanted to be saved he said it's up to God to make a way amen amen when he said he did through the blood of Jesus Christ all right now so then we start off by dealing with this that first we realize we're lost now to you out there that always was eternals and all you just go on go ahead just forget it I'm preaching to my people not to you if you're listening that's your business but this is what I'm trying to bring to the church at Lula all right now see then it means also if there's someone lost it would mean that there'd have to be someone who could pay the price that's right now the one who paid the price came first right the loss came second Jesus Christ is our savior Our Redeemer are all in all and we believe that he's almighty God the prophet of God said on the breach's message paragraph 138 . he said there had to be a person according to the Book of Ruth that would be according to the g-o-e-l gold whatever how you would pronounce it but he said that person would not only have to be someone they would first have to be someone kin folks amen second they would have to be someone capable of paying the price and thirdly someone who was willing to pay the price all right so then we know that it was left up to almighty God to make a way for you and I to be saved amen and we know for a certainty then that he wants to save us because he even said the scripture you know he he wouldn't everybody be healed and everybody be sunny and we know it's not done away but that's not what we're dealing with all right but see he's not only wanting to do it he came down and paid the price all right now he done it because he wanted to not because he had to he wanted to save mankind he wanted to impart his own life into you and I so he would make a way for that so he would truly be the one who would meet the requirements he would be the goal as we would call it in the in the words are all right then thinking about the fact that we were lost and no hopes of redemption then we realized that immediately God started in Genesis when man fell he started to make a way for that Redemptive plan right so you find Genesis 3 15 that what I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman that was the promise of the coming of the Messiah Prophet said it on e13 of the Messiah 61. promise of the Messiah that would come that could pay the price for Redemption for you and I all right now that that guy would be then a Redemptive plan and we'll get back to it in a minute but it would have to mean too that that person would have to come down in dwelling human flesh to pay that price all right so it means you would have to have a savior a redeemer to come forth all right now the Plan of Redemption is revealed in the word of God paragraph 321 of The Sixth Seal it's revealed in the seals the seals brings a complete Plan of Redemption for Body Spirit soul and world is revealed through the opening of the seal now just making points and then we'll get down into our thought all right now the word Redemption it means two parts it means out of and into that's paragraph 57 with the paradox at all and into right now so that means that you must come out of whatever condition or existence or whatever we call it being lost we must not only come out of that repent right no try to walk right do right live right yes but not only that we've got to have a way to be able to get into no and see he made the way by coming himself to pay our price to redeem us so now we can come out of and we can go into but now remember that as we go along and you'll see what I'm trying to say what the prophet is trying to say of redemption of coming out and going in all right now everything that you and I get must come by faith right but just you'll live by faith you're saved by grace through faith the great Hebrews 11 that we read and study of the great warriors of what we call Faith all right now it's very important to believe in how to Faith Hebrews 11 6 says that without faith it's impossible to serve God because he that cometh to God Must Believe what he was no he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him right now when we go along that's Rina I want you to go with me as these stages as we go along but remember everything is based upon a faith and that Faith must be a belief in God amen because you can't approach him without that that's right man you got to believe that he is see that's where the world teaches God was right the religious society today teaches God was but we have to believe that God is now so everything of redemption will be based upon a belief in a reality of a real God not just thoughts now that's right maybe not about a god but a reality of a living God who's living today you know he's Hebrews 13 8. then eat out to be the same today as he was yesterday or he missed it somewhere right around and said that's where Eve found up in the garden he said she didn't believe him to be Hebrews 13 9. he said well that wasn't even back guard no she didn't believe that God would keep his word she thought she got by with what she was doing and because God didn't kill her right then you kind of like you and I sometimes we think well boy I got by with that one right but you better study a while he might not get by all right all right but now everything that we get is based upon faith faith as a belief and what's the way I'm saying it faith that is a belief in God being real well now that is not to go over into the point of this saying his faith and different things you say what I'm saying everybody's salvation is based upon what they believe about God no matter who we are or what's going on see that's what's required so what name we must come out of our thinking right and go into his word or his thoughts or to accept what he says we were talking about it last night in the Bible study see when When God says I'm righteous I'm supposed to say what he says and you're a liar if you don't say by the new birth that you're just as righteous as God is that's right you're a liar so which way do you want to be one all right I had hit brother keep saying what God says that's right amen he says I'm perfect well I just don't know where we'll see that and you don't have the revelation of God that's right that's it that's my point your faith is not anchored faith is not anchored in letters of a word or a thoughtful idea that we have or what's been taught to us we used to believe that you couldn't tell this difference in the seasons except the abundance of the trees and the shedding of the leaves that ain't even in the Bible we used to believe that ever tell us that on its own bottom that ain't in the Bible we used to believe it's better to plant your seed in the belly of the than to put it on the ground that ain't in the Bible well I've heard it all my life and grandma told me that well grandma lied all right that was her idea well you're against my grandma regardless what you get into you start talking to people about something and they say you mean my mama's lost they ain't talking to Mama talking to me and you mama had her experience my man but my point is that we've had a lot of ideas that we thought the Bible said a lot of things he didn't say so we're back in the same day right now but listen see we've got to come out of our thinking to even start a journey of redemption that's right put into come out of our thinking and get into what he said in his word but it's got to be based on faith all right now watch that point now in the Old Testament the people they believed in God I'm not talking about all of the people because all the people that believe in God I'm not even talking about all the Israelites I mean you know whatever what you want to call them I'm talking about that there was people who could believe and they believe that God was real they had a faith in God they believed he was real you know what they experienced him being real about many miracles and signs and wonders amen that's right and that faith that they had in God even though it was not a new birth experience in the soul because we just read that you couldn't have had that until the death of the testator all right but yet it was a belief in God they live good lives and they've done the best they could do on a lot of scales but it was not a New Birth that would not come until Jesus Christ would come into being none but yet they had a belief a belief in that God is real God was real to Abraham to Moses to to those you know right he was real he wasn't just a thought he was real all right now do we have that kind of regard ourselves come on amen amen uh are we do we have the the god of Abraham of the god of William Brett oh my God will Brown his mind well be careful you might call him you're gone right thank God for the message he brought amen amen but the messenger wasn't God himself in the human vessel all right now those people believed now I'm laying this down as a background the word I'm going to get to it in a minute you'll understand those people believe that a real God and you know when they died they had a place to go to out of him to keep that in your mind they had a place to go to that place in the Old Testament was called Paradise or another word for it was called the bosom of Abraham right Jesus told the thief on the cross during the scripture that this day you'll be with me in Paradise that's right see when those Old Testament Saints died no not all of them see I'm trying to emphasize that right not every Israelite went to the place called Paradise a lot of them went to a place on down lower than that called Hadi shogohana hail a place to abide because that was the only two places in the Old Testament he was either in Hell or you was in Paradise there's no uh gray area because it wasn't made possible back then all right now in doing that see then they were in Paradise when Lazarus looked up during Luke 16. he saw the you know when the Rich Young Ruler or the guy looked up he seen Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham that's right now that wasn't Abraham's Billy that's right right right the bosom was meaning the paradise from the Old Testament you remember when Jesus descended he went to paradise and brought him out he'll get to that in a minute but just because it would say the bosom of Abraham he's not talking about his Bentley we're certainly not that carnal but it was a place provided by the faith of Abraham all right those people depended upon that was brought by Abraham that was why Jesus had to descend if you'll notice your scriptures Jesus had to descend to hell to preach to the spirits or Souls that were in prison that were disobedient in the long suffering the days of Noah right now they had a place that they died Noah died he had a place to go to call it Paradise because it was emptied up and taken up but I want you to get this point now it's out of and into your faith brings you out of an existence or a condition or a thoughts or carnality or sin or whatever you want to make it but if that's real and genuine it means you have a place to go to right the old Indian called it the happy hunting ground and that's not too far off in the word Paradise if you look it up but think about it now a place to go to to wait for the full Plan of Redemption to be made manifest all right now when Jesus Christ came and said he said to the Thief he said you'll be with me in Paradise all right he goes to Paradise and you know what happens he empty his paradise right when Jesus Christ went down to hell he went down preaching the spirits in prison different but when he come back by he the open Paradise lift up the Everlasting gate for the kingdom of Glory to go into this king of glory Lord Mighty and hosts and all right he brought forth Those Old Testament Saints because they were in The Plan of Redemption they're believing had brought them out of the world Abram was a heathen worshiper of the childish or something he comes from he was a heathen that his daddy-in-law or daddy one was making Idol that's what he doesn't make a living huh but see one day God spoke to him he come out of that condition or existence his belief was anchored in God all right well now you see what I'm talking about all the Old Testament won't be saved all the New Testament won't be saved right right so remember that all Jews won't be saved whatever it's only those who can have their belief in God in the correct way and God honored that belief now follow that point God honor that belief he made a place that they could go to and to prove that they were redeemable he went and opened up Paradise so let's just start reading a few of these now Mark these were the brothers could start because I want to make sure you get these points because you'd argue with this or that or the other so go ahead with number seven brother and let's just read what happened when Jesus Christ died now this is all a foundation that's right maybe two o'clock but this is a foundation for what I want to say go get the foundation right you'll understand message Jehovah Jireh e27 brother Brown says it like this but when Jesus died sin wasn't covered it was only covered in the Old Testament right but when Jesus Christ died it wasn't just covered it was divorced and done away with and when he left it then he emptied paradise and led captivity captive and they come out of the graves and they went in with the Lord Jesus according to Matthew 27. and when he finished his work they went on in being taken up in a form called a rapture because they were lifted up all right now Paradise being taken up or emptied you say well did it leave a hole see that's what we want to get into what we've got to have all this happen no it wouldn't hold left it was taken up because the king of paradise was there the god of paradise they wanted all those prophets and things had spoken on was standing there so he wouldn't have just went into paradise and say hi I'm here they came out with him proving they were redeemable at a place to go to them other than just their I hope you catch this point for later see other than just their point of dying when they died they had a place to go to their belief in God made a place that they could go and abide but that Not only was the end of the story because they were taken out yeah Paradise was emptied out brother rattle said on the Rapture message number eight the Old Testament science has gone into his presence Paradise done away Old Testament of sin and all that they went out with him in a rapture all right but if it done away what happened to Paradise when Jesus raised all right let's read a scripture back up to 7A now really second Corinthians 12 and 4 says talking of Paul that he was caught up in the paradise that's your scripture so Paradise wasn't annihilated because Paul went there Steve that's what the Bible said that's what we're going to believe well it looks like it's done away yep right around and said it's emptied out he says it's gone or done away but it's not done away it just moved the position amen from being the existence of one place you're still without oven too now and moved up into what we call Heaven Paul later says he was taken up to the third heaven but he says here he was taken up to Paradise to Paradise went up not just the people you realize what took place at Calvary not only did he pay the price of All That Old Testament Saints and all of their sacrifices and offerings that spoke of him but he proved that they were redeemable because he took them up with him true now when Jesus Christ has paid the price held it and empty up it goes right on waiting on the rest of people get there the paradise was taken up into what is a said we call Heaven all right could you see if you're redeemable you've got to have a way to get out of some condition but you also got to have a place to go to amen right so you've heard the story that Jesus paid for the Old Testament in the New Testament that's what I'm trying to describe to prove that he paid the price Paradise wasn't annihilated the people that were there were not annihilated they were taken up with Jesus you know they're now in what we call Heaven a paradise still waiting because there's a part of redemption is not complete yet so they're still having to wait so you and I we come into the world as lost we realize we need to stay here and even if you were in a Badness when you believed it or Methodist or Presbyterian if you come on to the message like you have then it proved that you had more than they had come on not be little nobody you know be little and everybody or say that just being straight honest because you proved where you're at you proved you were redeemable by coming out and going on see your belief in God was anchored in even as I said even though you didn't know the message Maybe right so you couldn't tell me when I was in the Baptist Church there were three gods now I didn't know how to explain it but you couldn't convince me there was three of them that just didn't make no common sense then in a short open night all right see because I had a belief in God you know why because I've seen him you know what I'd heard him speaking to me that's unreal then right you said well brother damn I never hurt God or never saw him like you you that was just for me that's right that's right right but you had your experience amen you're doing you're living your life and doing see I didn't have to come into the message a lot to learn that it was wrong to commit adultery I didn't have to come in the message and learn it was wrong to smoke drink too blind sealed that's already settled a long time ago even though I was just in a Justified State because I didn't receive the new birthplace after I come in this message see most everybody thinks they got it back Yonder and it brought it well what brought me because I'm telling you right in front of you I didn't get the new birth in the old in the Baptist Church I can believe I was justified and Sanctified in my belief in God when that Prophet started talking about a new birth and God the way he was and come living in you I knew right real quick he had something I didn't have right not all these signs and wonders I was just talking about what he was telling about God he had a reality with God that's right not because he saw visions and everything when he was a baby but because he experienced that God he knew that God he was talking about something that's real we talked about one of these days maybe I hope maybe maybe we say I hope we are go when we get up to heaven we're gonna find out we are now come on that's what we've done that's right right but you see Church something happened about some people because they believed that a real God existed all right then when we heard this message we come out of organized religion that's right and into the message right Amen to prove there was nothing there that was leading us all right we come out of the world of being lost and started our journey into wars being born again we received a new birth which was the Old Testament people couldn't receive because Jesus Christ hadn't died so we received a new birth yes all right that put us a place that we had come out of and Jesus according to John 14 says I go to prepare place for you so he went and provided that place where'd he go up come right back living in here where is he providing the place that we really need right in here all right forgive me I am healed but I still have to cough no no so we not only had that or have that you realize that when we received the new birth as I said we come out of the world and come into Christ right all right then we come out of organized religion we come into the message I think now what we need to do is come out of the message and get in the message best way for me to say is but you know that's my point but because it's not whether that I'm in the message or whether the message isn't me now amen but see not only that when you receive that new birth you know you had a place to go to if you died right Paul described it in second Corinthians 5 1 says this Earthly how can I Tabernacle be dissolved or word dissolved we have a place amen so we're have somewhere to go to we don't have to worry and we know that when this all finishes up we're going to raise right right in the glorified body this body made new not another one all right so we have a place to go to so it's out of and into right all right now so we'll take that hard and just go down and skip a page or two and start to thinking now let's start a whole Plan of Redemption and see where we can put it together in the right way and this is going to be repeated three times because I just reached done one now we're going through again then we're going through again all right that's the only way I know to express it Those Old Testament people had a belief in God not just talking about God they had a belief or a faith in God and you know it's provided a place for them to go to their belief that they had provided them a bosom of Abraham or a paradise or whatever they were calling it it was made dark now note I said not every Israelite only the ones who had a belief in a real God that's right I hope that sinks down maybe it'll get better about a lot of this we're in the message yes yeah and get down to find out what the message is about and you know that to prove that as we covered one time see one day they came God came to them in the bushing of Abraham or Paradise and took them up where did they go to here's the argument that we'll get into them later in a thought and I'll hold most of that thought until then but where did they go to and what happened In Those Old Testament Saints came up what happened yeah so you can take one point of saying that they raised in glorified bodies I show that to you and if they're raised up you know with the Lord Jesus and they're in their regular they're in a body you know because they're in a theophany body but that's the off the body people believe went into a resurrection and became a mortal body ain't gonna argue with you don't have time but when you get down to searching the scriptures then I could show on the other side that Jesus is the only one who has approached the immortality that's right right carnal reasoning then which we're not supposed to do right the Bible says come let us reason together when brother Branham went beyond the curtain of time he didn't see Abraham in them he didn't see Paul and Peter and all of them they want to saw his people so evidently worked brother running what too must have many many different sections or whatever you want to call it to that place or position all right we'll cover that more in a second let's see brother random on the message present stage of my Ministry go ahead and put up number nine brother he describes the dimensions we live in the third dimension life like matter all right fourth dimension is like television uh Etc movings Fifth Dimension is the center dead the sixth Dimension is where the Christians go the seventh Dimension is where God is now if you're reading it off of the thing the he's telling you that the message present stage of my Ministry all right and remember now that how high did Brother Brown go in those dimensions he only went to the sixth dimension according to the next quote go ahead and pull it up which is paragraph 390 of the fifth seal brother random when he went beyond the curtain of time he wanted to see Jesus he said you can't see him he said he's still higher are you reading it so you'll see him you can't see him now he's still higher all right now I did the Old Testament Saints precede any further than where we would be by passing on and going by the grave because run around as we gave you the quote before President stage of my Ministry he said Christians are in the sixth dimension all right she'll run around must have been in the sixth Dimension wanting to see Jesus and he said you can't see him because he's higher because he's in the Sabbath all right now what's the next scripture what's the scripture they could pull up go ahead First Timothy 6 16. who only speaking of Jesus Christ happy immortality immortality is mortal being that is made eternal is that a good definition a mortal person is made Eternal because if not you just say Eternal so when you're dealing with immortality you're dealing with Jesus Christ raised and the glorified Eternal mortal as we would call it that's to get to the point where you see flesh but it was immortality because it was eternal all right now you see if there are that who only had the mortality dwell in the Life which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see to whom the aren't bowed for Everlasting all right now we'll bring back that part after a while but just remember Those Old Testament Saints then when they went to Paradise Paradise went up and it became what we would call the sixth dimension because you can't put it in the field right right that's where people want to get their mathematics and run this out and the other that was hard to explain because it looked like it'd be better to put the Christians in The Fifth Dimension because the number five but it won't work because you got to put them right under the Altar and the five is where the center dead is at so you surely don't want them dark all right Follow Me Now the Bride of Jesus Christ remember that we covered Old Testament Saints they're in Paradise they're in the sixth dimension you said but now I differ we there that's all right you're different with me you know after a while you're going to see that if what you're saying is right it's gonna prove me right and it's what I'm saying is right's gonna prove me right so I ain't worried about it but the Bride of Jesus Christ as we've said before go ahead of belief in God not about a God or a thought but a real true belief in God when she dies she goes to sold under the altar not the one where they're crying how long how long no souls under the altar run around and used it they went into they go into the sixth Dimension which is the theophany which is the Heavenly Body which is the soul because your soul is your theophany all right I'm not going to stop and try to explain all this I've had 40 Years of doing it you weren't setting off it later we'll talk about it so that bride she has a place to go to the sixth dimension if you die you don't go right right you go into the sixth dimension the theophany the soul or the individual the word body theophany one two groups next group is the foolish virgin having a faith in God not all who claim I keep repeating that for each stage but those who have a true belief not all people are going to be foolish virgins right those with a real true belief but not a possession is that the difference is that according to Matthew 25 about the five wives and the five foolish at the five lives have four the other's lights are burning a little bit because when you read it today but it said our lives are gone out so they had enough justification and sanctification divide for a while but didn't have no wall in their lab which you didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they have a place to go to if they die what dimension you gonna put them in I'm going to believe there are any section they're part of the sixth Dimension right where else you're gonna put them all right different section different parts whatever you want to call it trying to be sensible all right now the 144 000 in the two witnesses and put them both in the same point we'll divide it in a second but look what it says they have a belief in God they have a belief in Jesus Christ you know that your foolish virgin has a belief in Jesus Christ but those don't have the new birth to go with you know that all is in our mental capacity is a belief or faith or right but yet it still was enough of them to hold them and make them good people right police guards are good people they have a belief in God they have a place to go to but the others that are good people don't have a place to go to it you know they go to hell because they don't you got the two left now you you don't have a gray area all right now so with 144 000 and two witnesses they actually received the baptism of the Holy Ghost eternal life in their soul here upon Earth but they rejected to ride a sunshield so they will not be in the bride and they'll only be servants that's right that's right always been the other way we'll get to it I mean it's all we're going to serve at Nation like Old Testament Israel their belief in God brings a reality to them because it's possible because Jesus Christ is now able to give them eternal life while here let eternal life they have to die right yeah 144 000 and the two and it said oh God according to the Bible and when they do they would have to go through the dimension of the sixth dimension which would be their soul their theophany their word body their being of what they have provided upon Earth all right number five is the fifth sealed Jew they don't have the testimony of Jesus Christ but they have the testimony they held right which is a belief in God knowing nothing about Jesus Christ but their belief in God provides them a place because run around said the field sealed Jewish killed from Calvary I'm down to here where we are they have a place to go to which is called sold under the altar and they can still cry how long because when they get there they don't have the white robe read your scripture it says white robes were given them they don't get the White Road when they die it would have to be given untrue it's going to be very valuable in a minute complete Plan of Redemption Ephesians 1 13 and 14 talks about that we're sealed and it gives us the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchase product the complete Plan of Redemption okay one two now start number three first we deal with the Old Testament Saints they have a place that they went to they had a belief in God they had a place that they went to and it was called Paradise all right you say well you're just repeating I'd hold on a little bit now to listen on this one all right because this is I'm trying to be fast anyway they have a the Old Testament Saints had a place to go to provided by their faith in the Living God God provided them you know it's a better way of saying it keep people from thinking at you words God provided them a place by their faith they're believing that place was taken up one day and you can say well they raised up in glorified bodies well I'm just honest I don't believe they did yet I can give you quotes where run around and said they did but I can give you quotes where he says that their bodies are still waiting like you know that one day Abraham Adam was going to reach over and get eve and he's going to reach over again you know so there's no argument I'm not trying to argue because if you think that that they raised in glorified bodies you're going to give me a whole lot better opportunity to say what I want to say but I'm telling you what I believe well we don't care what you believe okay cut it off I'm just trying to make a complete Plan of Redemption to see if it fits yes all right me That Old Testament Saints when they raised they are now waiting on you and I all right remember now we're not talking about all the Old Testament Saints but those that are the prophet would call predestinated or chosen I believe that all predestinated ones their faith in God will provide them a place to go to that's what he's doing he's providing the place all right listen right there will be a group of people or was a group of people that raised back there I do not believe that the Old Testament Saints will have to be raised in the last days and go to the watch on judgment I do not believe that why because they already have their Resurrection within them it was made possible by Jesus Christ in his resurrection if they're raised why would you want to take them to judgment even though I don't believe they have been raised physically Corporal bodies mortal bodies I do believe that they've been brought to a position that they don't have to be judged right What a Wonderful Plan of Redemption amen there will be a group of people in the Old Testament that are not came with Jesus do they give you a quote right around and said all not all the Old Testament Saints raised those people that do not have their belief that are good people and we're Jews of doing they will have to be raised in the second resurrection and come to the watch on judgment now we're talking about not the people of the Old Testament who had their belief in God and it was correct and approved by raising they don't have to go to the bathroom they're already judged but a lot of those Old Testament science Old Testament people we call them they're gonna have to be judges one day and that'll be if you walk thrown so that's how careful I'm having to make it so if you differ with me it's all right you just pray for me Paradise was taken up we've covered that Matthew 27 52 talks about how that the Grays were open and many bodies were the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection all right they went up there's three raptures in the Old Testament three and a new right the Old Testament you've got Enoch Elijah the Old Testament Saints New Testament you've got Jesus the bride of Christ and the two witnesses all right now in doing that then see they went up it's fulfilling Psalms 24 lift up your heads or lift up your Everlasting Gates they went up in a rapture they went up in a rapture they do not believe they'll have to be judged at the white Throne because they've raised up proving it all right were they raised in literal bodies did they go into their Dimension with Jesus when we just read the scriptures that nobody can do that he only had immortality but like I said I wrote this down if you want to argue the point you just wait just a minute then you're going to find out a little more that you might think that is a good point but I'm just telling you what I believe always ready for correction see the Old Testament Saints by being taken up they would have by impartation given unto them in their soul eternal life did you understand the wording by impartation they would receive eternal life all right and as they would then they would not have to be judged they don't have to stand it to watch their own judgment now here's one you may not have thought of I believe go to Old Testament saints that raise with Jesus will be in the millennial reign I have to change a lot of thoughts that I've had for 40 years still ain't worried too much about it they'll be in the millennial rain because the Millennium rain is going to be to Israel so there's got to be an Israel's effort to be too do they have eternal life and just step into the millennium but why not raise them up in the resurrection not the second Resurrection going to the judgment you say but they gave me a gave me an erection now we've got you you're you're saying wrong man because there's going to be a resurrection in a minute doesn't deal with white room it doesn't deal with any second Resurrection The Plan of Redemption all right in case you before you cut yourself off and do it remember there is a gospel to the Heathen and the Millennium has got to be raised that's according to your profit do they keep even turning the computer off see the millennial rain is actually promised to David that David would sit on the throne in the millennium you say not just his son Solomon said on a natural Throne Jesus Christ is the son of David we know that for sure but that's where he's coming forth in the Millennium is what son of David remember Son of God down the son of man then the crucified Son of God raised then the son of man back in the end times of the bride of Christ and then going to the son of David and the Millennium a promise to David all right now so we see that they don't have to go to the whites on judgment I don't believe you can put the Old Testament Saints at the white throne and I believe they'll be in the millennial Reign because it will be Israel as a nation in the morning right okay now I'll take number two the Bride of Jesus Christ she has a belief in God she has a place to go to her Redemption is in process she's here on Earth she received the new birth while living here the Old Testament Saints did not receive eternal life until they were raised but we get eternal life if we die we go to the sixth Dimension the theophany the soul eternal life one day in the resurrection that soul will come back right around said he'll release the soul that'll come to the spirit Spirit to the body and raise you back up and you'll stand up there's a group of people in there of the bride of Christ that does not have to die she'll be changed in a moment of twinkling of an eye so the bride doesn't in no way have to go to the watch on judgment will be changed here and make the Lord Jesus in the earth we go up to a marriage supper for three and a half years while he's speaking to Israel run around and said where was she after the supper he said she was in her father's house all right waiting for a time we come back into Millennial rain we don't have to go to the tribulation we don't have to go to the white Throne we come back into Millennial Ryan to rule and Reign for a thousand years all right foolish virgins remember I'm just moving up moving up we found that they have a belief but yet their belief is not as much as the bride because God can't birth them he birthed your belief that's why it's so important that you hear I hear they without preacher now you'll be preaching I said be sins you got to hear the truth of the new birth yeah but around said true prophets preach true verse false prophets brain false birth that's right foolish virgins she does not have eternal life while on Earth she goes to a six-dimensional form of holding she don't have eternal life she has to go to the white room and be judged for her beliefs and what she's done upon Earth and what's taking place they did not get eternal life so thereby they have to go to the watch on judgment they receive eternal life but to watch on judgment they missed the millennial reign laughs right they missed that but they'll come up at the future home with the Old Testament Saints it has to come to the white throne and be given eternal life I've divided that while ago now not the ones that rose with Jesus the ones that didn't raise with him will have to come up the watch only be judged that will be in the future home then the Nations that bring their honor and Glory into the city be the foolish virgins be the Old Testament Saints right the parts of Israel that don't need to be apart all right but they will have to go to the white Throne judgment to be judged and receive eternal life and adjustment that we don't want to be a foolish virgin independent upon that because we're going to miss the millennial rain we're going to miss A Thousand Years okay next group 144 000 are the and the two witnesses they receive eternal life in their soul here they're not bright because that's done been done away with nothing's been gone the bride's already been taken up that's like the the story of Joseph when he goes down into Egypt and he gets a wife from a gentile house his brothers come down they're going to be in the millennium but they're not going to be the bride hey man all right 144 000 and the two witnesses the two witnesses will raise in a rapture that's the only one you've got you don't have any listing for the 144 000 to be raised in a rapture right so why don't you let them be raised to go into the millennium I just got through proving that on tape over and over to you whether you listened or not right cover that in a second Israel has always been paragraph 196 sealed God's servant Nation that 144 thousand the prophet said page 41 Church age book you want to pull that up number 11. that 144 000 will be in the millennial rain what your profit says 144 000 will be in the millennial reign we just got through covering Daniel 70 weeks of different things and you can see they don't have to go to the white throne the white Throne is after the millennium those who go into the Millennium will buy past the white throne right but in the Millennium there's going to be two different groups there's going to be a Jew and there's going to be a heathen he deals with 144 000 as the tribes of Israel but in Ezekiel 48 you find right around putting the tribes back together and making 13 we just covered that right Dan and Ephraim is taken out according to revelation 7. but really Ephraim is not even counted in Revelation 7 I showed you that Dan is taking out Manassas has put into revelation 7. Ephraim an Ephraim is later removed because of his him and Dan going after the golden cage all right but in the Millennium Ephraim and Dan are put back in back to original 13 tribes that should have been will they leave out in the middle and Joseph not having a tribe on quoting right around come on Joseph's not having a tribe it's the end of Millennium then you're going to have a hundred and forty four thousand Jews into that quote plus twenty four thousand because you got 13 tribes in the millennium the way God wanted it in the beginning you only have 12 sons of Jacob Dan and Ephraim is removed from the records of of they're not not deleted as tribes they went right on down through there with God in his Providence and Revelations removed from but they'll be put back in because they're going to be purged right the brother random I gave you the quote where he said those tribes will be put right in that tribulation for purging with the foolish virgin that's right right so the 144 000 will be purged and the 24 000 will be purged in the tribulation no record that they go up in a Rapture but they're in the millennium so they must be raised from the dead but to go to the Millennium right all right Joy there's things going to happen that you and I haven't considered right right amen so now we've picked up a few more going into the millennium now the next group of people that we deal with is the fifth seal Jew those who the Bible said that they were given hot rolls and the day we'll have to wait until their Brethren are killed above the Bible Phil all right so that group of people can raise and go into millennium well because they receive white rose they don't have to go to the watch on judgment if you're following me and can't keep up with number wise then keep up with one thing only the foolish virgins will be going to the white throne and the people of Israel that does not raise when Jesus raised to where you'll have the people that are to have Nations coming up later they're giving white robes white robes is eternal life they don't have to go this this fifth sealed Jew they don't have to go to the white Throne to get white rose they have it and they go right into the Millennium right because the Millennium is to Israel we're just now on the honeymoon folks we're just our own honeymoon thousand year honeymoon but we can rule and reign you say well I don't know about all this Resurrection well put number 12 brother this is when people hadn't looked at too much look number 12. look at that question and answer 62 527 paragraph 177. then it's return of Christ and the bride the bride the church in the bride the bride of Christ shall walk out upon their ashes in the Millennium when the earth is purified by fire and there they shall reign watch the Heathen bats never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time and the sons of God will be manifested if you're going to have read on down if you're going to rule you've got to have something to rule over we're going to rule and Reign for a thousand years but around and said the what now he didn't say everybody see he stipulates and the Heathen that's never heard the gospel God is a just God he knows whether or not you've ever heard about him right so he doesn't judge you and send you to hell the Millennium is going to be a pretty crowded place it's gonna be a wonderful time foolish virgins they miss that all those Old Testament Jews and things they miss it that does not come up with Jesus I keep stating that where you make sure he can't get it wrong but what about a heathen Brother Gary that God will judge him according to his laws and I'll give you quotes for that he'll be judged according to how he lived but if he never heard about Jesus Christ he's not going to be thrown in hell he's going to have a millennial reign that we can preach to it what happens to them I don't know you're down to a point I said I don't know maybe one of these days I'll tell you what happened to them I don't know I've told you many times I don't know but the heater is going to be raised those who never heard of Jesus Christ a complete Plan of Redemption for all five different groups of peoples Old Testament Saints the Bride of Jesus Christ foolish virgins 24 000 which would put the two witness in with them in the field sealed you because of their belief they have a place they're allowed to go into heaven because of their belief but in the Gentile dispensation just remember for you and I to reject the gospel in this dispensation we go to hell ain't no hope being raised as foolish virgins coming out somewhere else ain't no hopes of being raised in the Millennium but either even though we are pretty well either you know what my definition of the heater is your definition of a heater and is a mean bad honorary old guy that don't believe in God right someone who's never heard is out of the other be your definition you know what my definition of an Ethernet this group of preachers that's in this message that's perverting the things right around them that's the worst Hedonism could ever be for you and I to reject this message that we've heard that's right amen and go on believe in our trinitarian thoughts and ideas and not falling after the word of God that's the heathen I remember listening to it or getting a tape one time they said invasion of the U.S and I thought man I'm going to find out about Russia coming down China's coming down this is coming here that one's coming here it's gonna be like like it was for Hitler more they're going to get over here and I put that tape on and all this you know what I talked about Catholicism captivating the mind of America that's brought us all down we're all going to happen we're all good people we're all Christians you know invasion of the U.S that's what shook us down there that's right and I hope you understand what I was saying at the end because to me either is a person that's closest to the truth but yet uses that truth to pervert it that's right to try to pervert the minds of people that's right and say brother random was wrong here and Jesus was wrong guard and Jesus done wrong he brought around done wrong what about the Plan of Redemption complete Redemption because one day because that you could go by the grave and be raised you could go down mortal corruptable and be raised up incorruptable amen and for the fact that Jesus Christ watched this world in the days of Noah and then in his day he dropped his blood upon this Earth to cleanse and claim it and he claimed our bodies because our bodies was laying right there then that's right so these bodies had already claimed to prove it is to give you the new birth you're not going to get a new body there ain't no such thing in the Bible Jesus raised with nail prints in his hands now you won't talk about getting a new body and Jesus is going to be there when they are prince in his hands showing he paid the price right right amen you see what I'm saying the people of this message are how they perverted the message the message is perfect now they're arguing that the messenger is not infallible I agree with you but the message is infallible now you agree with me on that one I agree that Brett around had mistakes was a human being a moral person yeah right but now you agree that the message is right then you'll shut up your dirty stinking stuff but you see because you and I were raised if I die I'll raise because I got the resurrection inside of me then this world is going to have to have a Redemptive plan this world is going to have to be redeemed right we just step ahead of it I believe that's 49 future home we step ahead of the World Cup and we go into glorified bodies right here but what about a Plan of Redemption that we cannot leave anybody out put them in the right place thank God for the truth you might have any we're going to go eat together have a good time fellowshipping and I hope you'll just sit down if you don't listen if you can't you're enough I know it's hard because the the seat has problems sitting on the Pew and the mine has problems cause a CPAP problem and when you do you don't listen too good go back and listen again over and over I've tried to place each group even to now believing that the 144 000 the the people will be raised to go into the Millennium the heat are going to be raised to go into the millennium Israel can be raised to go into the millennium he ain't for goddess people he ain't forgot his people they're going to be there that's right I may have to go through a lot of things in the purgings and different things with they're going to be there not all of them why because not all of them has that belief in God let's stand together not all of them can claim a belief in an eternal God what about a group of people a heathen that will be given an opportunity and raised up in the millennium these days we'll understand why it says it in the Millennials that are Center or die curse but a child who died 100 or something like that in the scripture I don't understand that I'm just beginning to understand the Plan of Redemption that way everybody's got a place you know what I like but my brother said one time he said I know I'm going to be there going to run around and saw me there this other brother said well I'd be careful brother because he is in both places right is that what he say did you say he went to hell did you say he went to the six Dimension Children of the honor in both places might have seen all of us there somewhere what about your salvation number one you got to have a belief in that God is real not just imagination or thought but a real God and then he can bring us out of and into because that's the whole story of redemption what we got 266 inspirable we're going same just a little bit because a lot of the sisters have done went downstairs to get everything ready so let's just worship and have a good time okay thank God I like ain't running back foreign to clear up you crazy foreign ly thank you we love you and we just come to an end of a service and a time that we try to explain a little bit about Redemption many said some things we hadn't said before and plain and blunt to say them but we just say what we believe one little bit we can see for the time we just keep progressing and gradually gaining a little bit of because if you give it all to us you'll probably said it one time we wouldn't be able to stand it so we just thank you we love you we ask you to go with us now as we go eat a natural meal the father we ask you to sanctify the food that each one of our bodies that we may all mean what you want us to be and be healthy and be letting you sanctify the food and the partakers amen you just need to know foreign everything is perfect
