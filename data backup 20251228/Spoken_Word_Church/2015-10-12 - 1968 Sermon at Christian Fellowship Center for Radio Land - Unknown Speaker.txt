felt the spirit of the lord in them thank you brother canada it's a great privilege to be here today to speak to you people out in radio land we don't know all the people that are listening to us but we do hope and pray that this program will prove a blessing unto you that you'll be instructed from the Word of God and that you will hear things that that you don't ordinarily hear from the different places that you go we certainly hope that this broadcast will be a source of strength unto you and we know that all of our help comes down from our Father above we know that all of our strength and power comes from him now as we read the scriptures today we'd like for you to to just begin to thank a little home well with say pro and con and I'm going to read to you from the sixth chapter of Romans beginning with the twenty second verse but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruits unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ now before I get started in this message I like for you to think about the payoffs the wages the wages is what you receive the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ now we know that there is only one source of eternal life and that comes through Jesus Christ and this might sound contradictory to a lot of people but what most of you have heard priests out in radioland is that the wages of sin is eternal life inhale and at the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ but may I say again that there is why only one source of eternal life and that has to come from God himself Jesus Christ in the Greek is the same self existent life that the Lord God is in the Hebrew the self same life and that life comes through Jesus Christ that life is eternal those that go into hell forever and ever is a space of time for the unbelievers that their soul may be destroyed inhale remember the scripture said fear not him that is able to destroy the soul or the able to destroy the body but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body inhale the word forever comes from the word a on which means a space of time the word eternal comes from the word Zoe which is eternal life now the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ I remember how that John spoke of this eternal life he said I eyes has seen and our hands of handle this eternal life and we showed unto you which was manifested unto you and which was with the father that word alive and that word of life today is the same as it was yesterday Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever because he is the word he is our righteousness the wages all sin is there but you must understand that in order to have the light you must also know what it is to be in darkness in order to be set free you must also know what it is to be in bondage so in order for us to understand what it was to be in bondage God sent forth the law through Moses and that law said thou shalt not kill and I should not steal and thou shalt not commit adultery but man's very nature was to do those things that was contrary to God because the carnal man is at enmity against God it's not subject to the laws of God neither indeed can be now if you happen to be a center out there in radioland you say well i'm so glad that i am not all the law let me tell you that you are under the law until you accept the Lord Jesus Christ and come out of the prison at your end because the law is ours Master to latest unto christ and the law brings our knowledge of sin and you would not know except it had been for the Lord said thou shalt not you would not know that you or is sin and remember today except you except the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior you're condemned by the law and the wages of your condemnation which proves that you are Center is death destruction done inhale far that sounds very plain probably a lot of people said I don't believe you or to top that plane the senses already pasted you already in prison condemned to death until you accept the only source of eternal life and that is the Lord Jesus Christ friendly little in what is your payoff what is your wage is going to be now we know that time is growing short we know that the shadows of darkness are occurring a denominational world because they're just like the Pharisees it would not accept the baptism of John jesus said it the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected a counsel of God against themselves not being baptized Oh John are you in that predicament today are you one of those that were not for the complete word of God and let me tell you just like Jesus told the devil in his day let me sandy ulit man shall not live by bread alone but by every where they proceedeth out of the mouth Oh God what is your wages going to be why are you gonna come at the end all the way you say well I belong to the biggest organization let me tell you that the way of destruction is the Broadway blood is a way that leadeth unto destruction maybe that go in there but matter and straight is the way that leads to life eternal and few there be that find it if you're in the majority today then you should know of a certainty by the scripture that you are wrong to begin with because it always going to be of two that will find the way that the lawyers provide for his chosen predestinated seed but let me say unto you out there there in bondage to the nomination you're just like old fire was in the day that moses went down to the river the churn of Israel out of the Gyptian bondage God had to show forth his glory by heart in a horror file that he wouldn't let the children of Israel go and you would tell for signs surely a servant and final would get not let him go because the Lord would harden his heart let me say today that you are serving your purpose you are proven to the world just exactly the position that you're in but those predestinated seed that are out in radioland better hell and advantages of Pharaoh God is going to leave them out by his word god is going to settle free from the bondages all sin and from the bondages our unbelief those are bound that are the Sheep of his pasture are going to walk three one of these days because your walls of Babylon are going to fall you are Leonys in church you are that church this lukewarm that's going to be spewed out of his mouth to go through the tribulation let me say the cry has already been made some of you are gone trying to get all youth you trend your lamps you again preaching the coming of Christ you said behold the bridegroom cometh and you begin the trail your lamps and some of y'all seen your mistakes Episcopalians privateer badness a lot of different people have gone and tried to buy all but let me just say to you I hope that you're not one of those it's going to be too late because when you go as a whole I am certain that the church will be gone when you get back the door will be shut those people in Moses is day that art was only built so big but the door gradually closed if they had a bit of predestinated see they could have probably run and got in just before the door quick behind them and I say to you today after in radioland if you are one of those that the Lord has a place prepared for you general walls of babblin the denominational walls that are built around Julis sponsored and mothered by the heart church of revelation 17 I believe the proverb says over there I don't remember exactly where to find it but he says as the mother is so is the daughter that's one way that you may know whether that you are a daughter or the mother harlot Church or not is what you will go along with this word and take the Santa Lord all right you were far what your Church teaches but fan around news for you that was a man present one day with the name of Barabbas he was behind bars and a sentence of death with a pony and they come in late now because they had chose to let him go free that the Lord Jesus Christ will be led to Calvary to take this place I can imagine is all Barabbas come out of that place somebody probably said lover going up that hill younger look he go up that hill burning a cross on his back that's the reason you're free but friend today it's not like it was in paralysis date he paid the price for every man and woman boy and girl you that place of the school called Gaga a He shed his precious blown up on Calvary's cross that you could be set free that through Jesus Christ you could reap the wages of eternal life but you have to walk out take up your cross and follow him hell song there's our crops on the hill it's an mo more suffering and shame but it's a reality unto us today that belief because the word is the power of God unto salvation do they literally to the Jew first and also unto the Greek I'm so glad today that even though i had a seal of some death upon me I step out from that prison into the marvelous light of darkness into the gospel light after John the Baptist was put in prison Jesus Christ come along to Lublin Hannah well it was Galilee of the Gentiles I believe the scripture says and those that said and dark is so great light and all set in the region and the shadow of death lot is from my friend today you are in the darkness unless you have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior your wages is dead inhale but if you'll accept or Jesus Christ take him as your own and all walk in the word mash you're not alone by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God walk in every bit of the light that you can see you can reap eternal life but it must be through Jesus Christ no organization has any strings on this life no Creed can cover the words of eternal life the all Creed's are just like those Pharisees and lawyers they fall short and will not accept the full gospel they rejected a counsel of God against them sealed because it would not be baptized of John today if you will not follow the Full Gospel you reject a castle of God against yourself because you are not fun you will be spilled into the tribulation and when you stand before that great white throne judgment if you have ever heard the word of truth oh my if it come through me he will say to / from me around you you you worker of iniquity be callin equity is a deviation from the truth not far in a full word of God then how you want to go in the rapture then a stand before the judgment to be condemned because you I refuse the true gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ how praise him for his mercy today
