========================================

good afternoon i just want to give a brief testimony of how god's worked in my life and brother benny i want you know i'm praying for you amen i found out a long time ago through sickness at different things that we go through that don't go up and tell somebody you know how they feel when you haven't experienced what they've experienced you know until you can you've been there and done that trust me you're more death makes you more desperate to perform when when you've experienced it amen but i'm just praying for everyone uh i just wanted to give you a brief update what's happened i found out just recently that the lord decided i needed about seven weeks down time this is what was revealed to me while i was lost my job but it all goes back to the faith you know hebrews 1 and faith is the substance of things hoped for and evidence of things not seen you know an ice storm come through here the other a couple weeks ago had i been working i could not have been at home helping howl and popping them get the things done that had to be done power poles were broken down we were digging post holes and setting telephone poles cutting them around dragging telephone poles but had i been on the job i could have been doing those things to help and i've decided that i learned what happened you know the lord gave me this job anyway that i had down in buford it was in the glass business but i've always been in the heavy metal stamping business and i feel like a bull in the china shops what i've always thought but the bottom line is i i stood there and took a man's word for six years that you'll never leave me you won't quit me with he would tell me this every week don't leave me don't ever quit and uh so i took him at his word he said it so much i finally got frustrated one day and i said do you want me to quit because i began to not believe it so i put my faith in a man and that's where i went wrong so january 30th i felt like a cowboy been in the fight i knocked out the door down on the ground and dusted so i got up and dusted myself off and i said you know what i'm a christian i'm going to go on but one thing happened to me that i think was also part of this i have uh struggled with temperance as many know unfortunately but the lord showed me what that was it was about my father my earthly father how hard he was and how when he died he didn't tell me he was sick i would see him a lot and he left me for about a month or you know about six months and but he never told me he was sick or anything and he had brain cancer and i was i found out the lord showed me you were mad because he didn't tell you the truth and that's what my temperance is all about that's what the lord showed me so i'm through that i'm going to do better but had it not been for this down time i would have not been able to you know i felt like i was letting my family down but something came to me and james you lust and you have not you kill and you desire to have and cannot obtain you fight in war yet you have not because you asked not so i began to pray as i looked for a job every week going on the internet different things and i began to pray and it came to me said lord pray this way if it be your will and that's what i began to pray i said lord be your will you'll find me a job but during this time we have paid off while i was not working we were paid off two credit cards the lord just did work that out some way so we paid off two credit cards and we've done a lot of things and been through a lot of things together but i always i said someday lord's going to give me a way to be with my wife that's my friend he gave me that time for seven weeks but he showed me a way that i could just still be with her and not work that sounds crazy but i got enough faith to believe that had this not i've got a job effective last tuesday had i not got that job that i was already had my mind made up i had a way to make it that i was going to be at home because i was put there for a purpose to help and serve whatever needed around the house but i just want to say this the fact is that until i started asking him i wasn't ready i had a lot of things going on but i finally stopped i said lord if it be your will it's time for me to go to work i had just finished a remodel for pop and then on a mobile home i just finished everything i had to finish complete right there and that next day i got a job and that's god that's all i did so and i never thought that i could get a job better than the last job i had i made more money i ever made my life but it ain't about money not that's really my problem is what it can do and get you into but the problem is uh the fact is that i didn't i wasn't doubting that god couldn't give me something better i would i was just wouldn't believe it well the job i got today on last tuesday i started a job with price industries and the position he put me in is like number two in the plant with under the plant manager which takes a four to six year degree in engineering over uh tool and die and maintenance and that's what i've done all my life but i don't have anything but a high school degree so that's god that did that in my experience but most of all it's the prayers of the saints believing you know sister peggy would say oh here we got to go again we got to pray for brother boy but but this is a journey i'm convinced that it's nothing but a journey that's going to build character this new plant manager within 15 minutes he and i sat down and he was interviewing me and he said i see character and he started talking about the lord how many times where can you go to a job in a plan or somewhere and the lord comes up it doesn't happen unless something makes it happen and that's who does it he makes it happen but i just want to thank everybody for praying and my god is real amen amen and i've claimed that and faith is a substance and this message you think about this the first message that we are known of is faith is a substance right from that very beginning in this message all the way through this journey that i've had is where that's where my very foundation starts and i'm i believe like when my dad passed i had to disconnect the machine i believe if he had the faith to come up off that table he would have done that that's just the faith i have and i've told brother dale and i've been in surgeries i said i believe he'll raise me up brother benny you believe and i'm gonna believe with you and if just don't pray unless you're really sincere and you mean it that's all and i thank you so much and the lord's blessed me and i just uh i just hope and pray that nobody really knows what another person is going through but that doesn't mean that you don't need to stop praying for them you know just pray thank you i love you amen god bless you this is sister doris up at uh mckaysville she always asked me to to do this song and uh i think it goes along with what uh brother matthew was saying this morning about a song we've done in a while and it's number 376 in the in the spiral book in the key of g and uh this is for sister audrey today god's attributes were manifested through his pride in this last stage life the original love the original scene the original one is today this is what the scriptures say and our names are seen within the kingdom of sin yes inspired by is and we

secret tears i cried then one day someone told me of your mercy and the love you showed on a hill called calvary then you die and purchased my redemption when you broke its power and set my spirit free is many and your ear is open every time i pray no one else has ever cared for me like you know other as friends to me i'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow knowing you are everything

on and it takes care of the lord take care of that so we don't worry we just leave it in his hands and have everything to settle for that all right let's sing open the eyes of my heart as brother pray comes brother matthew bray comes to bring the word of the lord unto us this afternoon right open the eyes of my heart i want to see open the eyes of my heart i want to see you shining in the light of your glory amen pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy high and lifted shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love we sing holy holy holy holy holy i want to see

much for letting us come and share with you amen the love of god and the love of this word jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep my word amen and we love god so we love his word amen amen god bless you today let's go to saint john chapter seven i'm going to read one passage and have a word of prayer praise god we're just uh really happy to get to share once again we're just gonna have a little bible study have a little sunday school study praise god you'd like to study the bible amen down in mobile uh we have what's called bible thread it's just a like a chain we just take scripture and just dovetail one scripture next year and it kind of when you get the inspiration holy ghost man that thing just opens up a beautiful picture because all scripture dovetails it's all connected amen praise the lord so uh i think we'll do a little bit of that today good lord willing let's let's look at this here in chapter 7 verse 10. uh just one passage of scripture how many of you know there's secret things hidden in the word of course you would know that right being message folk the way you are all kinds of things was hidden in this word amen and the in the sweet lord jesus still has things that it lets people make discoveries about and find out the spoken word message still pertinent for the hour amen praise the lord all right and we just want to stay right there and let the holy ghost just bring that nice sweet rain so we can be fruitful and manifest the word in the hour amen the bible says in saint john chapter 7 verse 10 what's 7 plus 10 17 okay okay just just checking with you 17 is an important number these days you know what i mean in verse 10 it says but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret right and the coming of the lord is in a secret coming amen now this feast that jesus attended not openly but as it were in secret this feast is the seventh feast and you find out in the book of john here it's actually the feast of tabernacles jesus attended the south feast in the sermon future home brother brahm said the seventh church age is a type of the seventh feast so the secret coming of the lord in these last days is in the seventh right right so here's a reflection of it right here amen let's pray precious father we love you so much lord god thank you god for opening up our hearts and open up our eyes and let us see the coming of the lord the way that it truly is lord we know now father that the coming has always been a secret way but you father have illuminated your bride jesus and you've brought into your presence lord that quickening power is living and moving in her and god we know that this hour is coming where the gentile dispensation will come to a close and you'll call your saints from the grave and those which are alive and remain to be changed father god and caught up and lord we'll all meet together and we'll be gathered unto you just like the bible says and father we live for that moment lord we just humbly bow our lives to you o god and we pray that whatever has to be done whatever has to be accomplished to make us ready father help us to meet that our god and be truly found in that place of fulfillment god please touch the hearts and lies of my dear brothers and sisters and myself god help us to fulfill all the righteousness of your word for this hour let us meet the directors and the objectives that you laid down for your bride for this our lord and just stir our hearts and help us father god to come into full obedience full compliance and under full subjection to your headship we love you lord jesus and we love your appearing and we ask that you help us be ready lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you can be seated now uh we'll just kind of be a little casual here and relax a little bit because i want you to just kind of study along with me now you remember how maybe you do maybe you don't but in this future home brother branham was talking about the seventh day the millennium is also a type of the seventh feast because in the millennium we'll be building houses building temporary dwelling places because the millennium is a space of time so even the millennium itself is glorious as it is is still temporary amen amen because the millennium is reflected in the scripture in different places and the seventh feast is one of those reflections the feast of tabernacles so the millennium is like the feast of tabernacles well whenever you follow the things the prophet teaches during the feast of tabernacles moses the lord commanded israel through the prophet moses that every seventh year in the feast of tabernacles bring the book out of the ark of the covenant open up before the people and read it publicly so the feast of tabernacles is synonymous with the opening of the word amen so this last church age like unto the feast of tabernacles is an age where the word is opened up right amen is that right so you're with me then all right this is the whole bible in the book of nehemiah you find out whenever they build a pulpit of wood and take the uh and the pulpit of wood was built specifically to set the word on and have a public reading of the word and it was around the seventh feast in the fall of the year they was observing the word in a way that they had never observed it before since before the captivity all right so that's a reflection of this hour amen and uh we have all these great things that pertain to that that realization and pertaining to this hour that we live in amen so the secret things of god are sealed up in the word right but they've become unsealed in these last days and uh we know that we have the fullness of the word introduced to us right amen sorry brother bob but i'm pulling a whammy on you i got some quotes here that i didn't give to you but i want to read a couple of these just to get you in the frame of mind here and uh there's a man here that can turn on the light in 1963 december 29 on paragraph 156 brother braham says but the grain goes right on and now we're in another age why won't they receive it why won't they see that the grain is matured here is the promised word for this day brother brown patch's bible why don't they see it because they're living in a lutheran glare right a wesleyan glare a baptist glare a pentecostal glare they're living in a glare of another light that's the reason they can't receive the light of the total word right the light of the what say that with me light of the total word being vindicated as god promised huh that's just one we can stack them this high if you want all the quotes the reason they can't receive the light of the total word being vindicated as god promised the seven seals were the what it's real simple when john the baptist introduced jesus messiah did he introduce half a word one-third i got the kind of idea brother samuel that john the baptist didn't like denominations and you know what a denomination is it's a fraction of a whole one-third one-fourth huh children of god ain't never satisfied with that right we want to feed on the whole word of god amen when john the baptist introduced jesus messiah he introduced the fullness of the word and we're taught that he's the same yesterday today and forever now our elijah ministry comes in these last days and what do you think he did he did the same thing he's introduced the fullness the completion amen now another one is it's really really good and it's in the seat should not be here with the shuck it's 65 january february 18th 1965 paragraph 101 praise god give brother bob a little time there praise the lord i get by with him he has to love me anyway huh praise the lord notice and in the pentecostal age through the lutheran age through the wesleyan age there's been the same thing through this pentecostal age now notice but at the opening of the seven seals revelations 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again the full word is to be born in manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of god in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth amen amen see that in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth that's what's happened the fullness when brother brandon was on the platform and he'd spend an hour two hours showing the people the scriptural vindication for the hour that they're living in and then jesus christ himself almighty god will come down out of heaven come onto the platform right next to the prophet and then discern the thoughts of the people's hearts to vindicate and prove what brother brown just spent two hours preaching about amen that's right that's that's the idea all right brother bob here's the last one it's in things that are to be and this is a good one too paragraph 42 it's 65 1205. 65-1205 december 5th 1965. and paragraph 42 now in saint john chapter 7 verse 10 i don't want you to lose that scripture we started with he says i do not think that heaven is a place that my mother used to tell me about i believe that the church has grown from that thank god to think it used to be a hundred years ago or two i think the old timers used to think that everyone that died went up to heaven and had a harp and set up there on the clouds and played a harp and they know that there was a place called heaven but if that be so all the musicians would have it on us definitely me i couldn't play nothing to save my life you just took a gun to my head said learn that piano or else i'd say else yeah see but it isn't that kind of a place it isn't playing harps at all i believe i don't believe the bible teaches that but that was a conception that they had before the fullness of the word come into existence and brother banner says or the opening of the seven seals it's the same thing the fullness of the word come into existence is that right so we've been just simply trying to lay out to you this weekend that it's that fullness that gets the bride ready and prepared for the rapture it's looking into that perfection that brings the bride into a rapturing grace a translating grace amen so you don't want to look at the message as something incomplete you don't want to look at the ministry of brother branham as something that's not fulfilled or complete it's a perfect work amen okay my precious brother back to identify christ of all ages quote number eight but uh let's just have a little bible study here real fast let's share a little something about the number 17. okay well brother branham was an ohio river boy was the year 1933 he's baptized in the 17th person and the pillar of fire comes down out of heaven it says as john the baptist right was sent to full run in the first game of christ so you got a message that will foreign he was baptized in the 17th person why not the eighth why not the first but the lord appeared on the 17th person amen so when brother branham starts preaching the seals it's on march 17th amen and when the cloud appears in life magazine it's the issue of may 17th and just goes on and on and on revelations chapter 10 verse 7 the coming of the lord the mystery in revelation chapter 10 is christ descending out of heaven and verse seven but we uh uh but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel right and here in saint john chapter seven verse 10 i'm showing you it's a secret coming again associated with the number 17. let's go to luke chapter 8. luke chapter 8 and we'll just look at a little something here luke chapter 8 and verse 17. i like this now this is good brother wade for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither anything hid that shall not be known or come abroad that is if you're not asleep right right and lady will see you right right all right that is if you got your i sav applied if you got the token applied huh right there's nothing hidden verse 17. i think that's interesting right amen let's go to luke chapter 14. luke chapter 14. brother branham used this parable right here to show the three pulls of his ministry but let's look at luke chapter 14 verse 16 and 17. and then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at what time you eat supper in the morning afternoon in the evening time that servant came in even time who do you think that servant is right there in verse 17. amen the first time elijah has ever spoken of in the whole bible is first kings chapter 17. punching elijah and about in the computer elijah will come up it's first kings chapter 17. right now all right there's brother branham in verse 17. right okay so do you think the message might be vindicated look at how people turn away from the message and they they find mistakes i find perfection right right that's absolutely perfect ain't nobody can do that but god amen there's there it is right there in verse 17 amen so of course you know luke 17 30. thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed amen now we know that elijah was translated without death is that right and elijah is connected to the rapture and this elijah minister in these last days is connected to the rapture amen so in second kings chapter 2 verse 17 is where those men went out to go try to find elijah and the bible says he was found not just like enoch he's found not right in verse 17. all right now uh your rapture scripture we looked at earlier today is first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 17. when we which are alive and remain right amen so this is just a bible thread we're going through let's go to acts chapter 17 to see if that might hold any significance for us acts chapter 17. let's read verse two and paul as his manner was hey that's interesting because it says in luke chapter four that jesus had a mannerism yeah he went into the synagogue and read and paul must have had the same spirit jesus had because that was his manner as his manner was went into them and three sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures opening and alleging that christ must need this effort so paul was showing them the vindicated word paul was reasoning with them out of the scripture and here we have it in chapter 17. now let's go to luke chapter 4 and read where jesus is given the scripture as his manner was in luke chapter 4. oh verse 17. and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had did what open the book the opening of the word amen now there's nothing secret it's all opened up right and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book and brother paul was doing the same thing opening and alleging is that right so now remember brother brown starts preaching seals on march 17th god hiding in simplicity amen so we can just go on and on and on but let's just give you one more here let's look at uh john chapter 20. john chapter 20 just give you an idea how it could possibly be associated with the rapture you think it is yeah i think it is too i think it most definitely is saint john chapter 20 verse 17 jesus says unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father to my god and your god amen amen now i'm not a date setter so don't nobody get 2017 in your head because 2015 be good enough for me praise god you see what i'm saying all right so don't go there let's let's go there sooner rather than later all right so that kind of just gets it started for us just a little bit okay now when sister uh hope was passing away she told brother branham that she was saving some money and hid it in a coffee can up on the shelf and she was saving money for to buy him a rifle and the rifle was 17 brother branham was shot in the back of the legs he's in the hospital the doctor said your heart's only beaten 17 times a minute when he's in india there's 17 different religions represented in front of him right so brother brown pastored the tabernacle 17 years while i worked at the psi company for 17 years so the number 17 is associated with the vindication of a prophet with with prophecy and perfection okay and uh we're going to look at something that you may or may not have realized i just realized it just a few months back the lord we was in brother sam's backyard having a little bible study we had our laptops open and his brother bob would bring up the sermons in the content list of 1960 i want to look at the church ages with you this jumps right off the screen at me open up your bibles of revelations chapter 6. right here i want us to look at the church ages watch how this is formatted it's exactly the way it is with the seals if you look at this it says revelation of jesus christ and the patmos vision well that's god hiding in simplicity and the breach first seal second seal third fourth fifth sixth and then questions and answers on the seals and then the seventh seal formatted exactly the same way so what you have is ten sermons dealing with seven church ages a ten and seven again so right so if you go to 1963 so they can see it brother bob here you have it right here revelation of jesus christ patmos vision ephesians sumerian right then pergamos thytira sardisian age philadelphian age right the 10 virgins and 144 000 then the seventh church age formatted exactly right that that's pretty awesome i got to looking at that i thought now lord brother branham never mentioned this but there it is so i take it over here and i read revelations chapter 6. guess how many verses are in the chapter 17 verses in revelation chapter six guess what chapter comes in between the sixth seal and the seventh seal chapter seven right well guess what chapter comes in between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet chapter ten chapter 7 and chapter 10. perfect vindication all right let's look at let's read in revelations chapter 6. i don't know about you but i'm totally sold out to this message because i see it's absolutely right you see that brother amen it's formatted exactly the way brother branham did the sermons whether he was conscious of it or not the holy ghost put that together like that that's the way it's formatted in the bible now when you look at revelations chapter 6 you have 17 verses chapter 7 is that sermon between the sixth church age and the seventh church age because you have the 144 000 and the virgins in the same chapter so that's what interrupts the seal between the sixth and seventh seal you see now why does god do this obviously because he hides things it's hidden in the word this way right but then it's brought out whenever god wants to illuminate us to something that he's doing so if you go over here to the trumpets and look at chapter eight chapter eight picks up your seventh seal in verse one so chapter seven comes in between the sixth and seventh seal just like brother brandon put a sermon between the six and the seventh i love it so you go to the trumpets and they start in revelations chapter 8. it goes all the way to six trumpets and it's cut off or interrupted by chapter 10 which is our seventh seal brother branham said the seventh trumpet is to israel what the seventh seal is to the bride amen so revelations chapter 10 is the coming of the lord to get the bride revelations chapter 7 pastor i'm just saying put in a form of a question because i don't want to make it sound like i know what i'm talking about or anything but chapter 7 i wonder could it be the seventh trumpet because it's the coming of the seal the holy ghost coming to 144 000 to seal the 144 thousand brother branham plainly tells us that revelations chapter 10 is the seventh seal there's several quotes on it so you have revelations chapter 10 when you read to the end of the last verse or the sixth trumpet starts in verse 13 of chapter nine and then the seventh trumpet is over here in chapter 11. so chapter 10 comes in between the sixth and seventh trumpet so you see how it's formatted in the scripture that's how the sermons are formatted now let's go where brother branham took us back to matthew 24 where the seals are right all right turn to matthew 24 with me and we'll see how brother brown showed us that jesus was covering the seals right there laying them out you come all the way to the sixth seal because he breaks the chapter down for us and shows us from the first seal to the sixth seal so the way it's even wrote here in matthew 24 is exactly the way it is in revelations go to the sixth seal then it goes right straight to the jews in chapter seven so right here in matthew chapter 24 jesus says immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light there's your sixth seal and the star shall fall from heaven the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in clouds of heaven with power and great glory right and he shall send his angels brother abraham says to moses and elijah with the great sound of the seventh trumpet right amen and they shall gather together his elected 144 thousand from the four winds from the end of heaven to the other right now learn a parable of the fig tree that's right so there's your revelations chapter 7 and verse 32 perfect order all right now it took a profit to open all this up but i mean it's just amazing how perfect god stays with his word all right now when you read this brother branham follows the example of jesus the lord jesus does not reveal the seventh seal the same way that he does the six seals right the seven seal brother branstad will be a total secret right all right but if you follow the rest of the chapter the rapture is in the rest of the chapter you understand what i'm saying because he it's like he throws off to try to hide something now learn a parable of a fig tree so he starts talking about israel right but then if you go to uh verse 37 and come on down like a verse 40. then shall two in the field one shall be taken to one left well there's the rapture it's right there hidden in scripture once you know what the seventh seal is right but then revelations chapter 25 goes to the virgins so the way it's formatted here is absolutely perfect the way he did it in the sermons amen so it's ten sermons dealing with seven seals ten sermons dealing with seven church ages that ten and seven so happens to be chapter seven that comes in between the sixth and seventh seal and chapter 10 that comes in between the sixth and seventh trumpet amen you think that number 17 is special a 10-7 must be something to it right by the way amen let's go to our quote and identify christ of all ages and we'll just get into something here you appreciate that i know i sure did the reason why i shared that with you today is you just simply underscore the fact that a message is absolutely vindicated don't never let no intellectual spirit come upon you and try to get you to second guesses message it is perfect just you gotta let the inspiration of the lord strike your life amen so that's why it's important to stay with it and study meditate pray look at it let me tell you exactly how i discovered that when i realized that a lot of people might have already i never did i just be honest with you i didn't know that until just a few months ago about the sermons of the church ages are formatted exactly like the sermons or the seals and then you take it to revelations chapter 7 revelation chapter 10 it's the same way so let me tell you i'm at my brother-in-law's house and we're sitting around having bible study we open up our computer and i got the contents page of the table opened up just like we opened up right there and i'm looking over because i have been looking at the seals god hiding in simplicity in the breach right two sermons in one day and then monday morning the first angel comes to brother brandon gives them the mystery of the first seal that's the 18th then on the 19th tuesday morning the second angel comes give him the mystery of the second seal for seven consecutive days seven angels come with seven messages and give brother branham seven mysteries all right so i'm looking and i have the 1960 sermons popped open and dropped down and i see the church ages and i said oh my god it jumped right off the screen and said look at that there's ten sermons dealing with seven church ages never seen that before and i don't recall brother brown to even mention it he just did it like that and when you look at the way they're preached the first two sermons is in one day then he takes one day to do the ephesian church age next day to do the second church age all the way to the last day he has two sermons again in the last day exactly the same way pretty amazing to me praise god amen so uh are you following a vindicated message are you satisfied of that amen we gotta just stay with it amen praise god amen so we know that god interprets his word by bringing it to pass god shows us his word we receive it and we never doubt it because the word lives the word comes to pass so brother bran makes a statement here very awesome he says jesus in his a in his age what was he just like the prophets of their age each one of them was god's word being interpreted for that age amen so the end time brides the same thing because the bride is in the word right so moses was god's word interpreted right if moses was god's word interpreted brother branham was god's word interpreted amen so god said i'll send down there and i'll deliver them i'm sending you down with my word i'll go i'll do great signs and wonders and he did it mary she was god's word interpreted a virgin shall conceive amen what if i behold i send them to you elijah you are god's word interpreted we work you are alive and remain we're alive and we remain amen amen amen a virgin shall conceive that was god's word interpreted now here comes jesus on the scene the god of the prophets and here they were so organized and incriminated you know in such a condition until they couldn't even they didn't even recognize him they didn't come or he didn't come the way they thought he ought to come they thought god would pull a little lever here and let the corridors of heaven down and he will walk out and say kev is this high priest of god i've arrived he had a little baby born in a manger now let's be careful here because the way jesus came was exactly the way the scripture said he would come right but that's not the way they had it figured in their mind as it was since that's the way it is now people follow the letter instead of getting a revelation so they get things fixed up they get doctrines ideas amen the important thing is is to follow the continuity and the unfolding of god's word he had a baby born in a manger down a little cave stable in bethlehem way down there with a straw and a manure of the barn a little baby wrapped in swelling cloth and laid into a manger had no schooling watch how they corrected the word as he was the word see he is the word he ever remains the same yesterday saying forever amen amen now let's go to quote number nine brother bob praise the lord so remember our lesson the other night about the gathering place you remember these sermons like uh like this one christ identif the identified christ of all ages god's only provided place of worship god's chosen place of worship these are the sermons where god brother brahm takes his text in deuteronomy 16 where the lord tells israel that you will shall not offer your sacrifice in any gate but in the gate that i choose to place my name which is a type of jesus christ because that's where god placed his name so the only place god will ever accept worship is in christ but there's a little understanding that comes along with this because jesus christ is the same message today today forever so what he was then he is now so what was he then he was the word made manifest the interpretation of the word for that day so the word made manifest for this day is jesus christ and that's where god has placed his name all right you got that understanding okay let's go on just a few more quotes he says now and christ identified quote number nine all right now when moses come he could not have took noah's message neither could moses have took noah took moses messes neither could joshua have took any of their message see each one isaiah could not have took another's each message for that age now this is a principle you ain't taught nowhere else but this message god's word has to be applied in the age he predestinated to be applied to we're not following a historical christ we're following a living christ anointing of this hour the manifestation of the word for this day that's the difference that's the difference between cain and abel uh-huh right and with the age that we're living in when that word is interpreted god's speaking that word out and making the word for that age live given the interpretation of it that is god in christ manifesting glory right okay let me go slow because i want to just conceptualize it's the hour to conceive all right isn't it interesting how the word conceived applies to the mind in the physical womb because your mind's a spiritual wound conception this is an hour that the bride is to conceive conceptualize god's word and with the age that we're living in when that word is interpreted god's speaking that word out and making that word for that age live giving the interpretation of it that is god in christ manifesting now this is an extremely important truth and principle because that is where god puts his name the name of god is associated with the manifestation of the word all right that's a quote we're going to read it okay so now this is it we're actually i'm just kind of setting you up and building you up to something right now and god's provided place of worship quote number 10 god had a certain place that he met abraham oh let's go slow god had a certain place that he met abraham and abraham worshipped all down through the testament and his promised word will be interpreted in you by him amen did you get that the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in you will be a written epistle of god read of all man not what you claim but what god does through you will speak out louder than anything you could claim that's right now i want to emphasize something here where it says god had a certain place that he met abraham right now we all know now under the new testament revelation god's meeting place is in christ and we was trying to share with you earlier today to to understand that you're in christ is awesome well and good but what part of christ because christ has been being revealed right but his fullness has been revealed in these last days so you're revealed in christ your your revelation your part in the word has certain specific meaning to the hour that you live in okay these things shall follow them that believe that speaks through you right he spoke of this age what would be now the believers of this age has to believe this right what he promised today exactly that's why i preach a lot about rapturing faith because that's the hour we're living in it you know the water age done past the blood aged unpassed the holy ghost aged unpassed the adoption that's why the statute of perfect man's taught so much in this church and everything it's the time of that perfection okay just the same as they had to come into the ark and that's so also about god right in the middle of satan's eden he's bringing a bride to perfection that's almighty god now praise god hallelujah that's good see just the same as they had to come into the ark to be saved to go out of egypt to be saved they had to come into christ to be saved now oh into the word message that he's the same yesterday today and forever now brother branham hold on a second don't don't you mean everybody is included no he just excluded a bunch of people right there think about what he's saying right a lot of people want to follow christianity as a historical context you can't right christianity's something that's living glory see to be saved now into the word message of today right right now how do you get into it by baptism baptism of what water by the holy ghost one spirit we're all baptized into one body so the holy ghost in every age is going to baptize the believer into a certain part of christ certain measures certain part right okay quote number 11. all right now does god have a meeting place did god meet with brother branham did god meet with moses moses would come into the ark and the pillar fire would come down out of heaven and meet with his prophet in the holy place and the holy place was always where the ark was and the ark was always a type and a symbol of jesus christ remember the ark was made out of wood overlaid with gold that's the wood is flesh and the gold is deity so the wood and the gold together is a is a symbol of humanity and god united jesus christ was man jesus christ was god there's the ark amen so the presence of god was always associated with that ark but the prophet was always called into that presence and given the word amen so you have a meeting place that god was always foreshadowing down to the old testament but it was always a type of god meeting man in christ the meeting place that god has with his prophets or anybody else is in christ all right we just want to relax and think these thoughts okay but we must find where he did put his name right for in it is his only provided gate amen straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be that find it amen glory watch where did he put his name in his son now who is the son he's the word made manifest in the age that it's manifested in oh you say now wait a minute brother branham that was the son not the father the son always takes the name of the father in every case i come to this search in the name of brandon because my father's name was branham right right jesus said i came in my father's name and received me not you want the scripture on that saint john 5 43 all right i came in my father's name and you received me not then the father put his own name which is jesus in the son and he's the way he's the door he's the house he's where god chose to put his name god never put his name in me he never put his name in the church he put it he never put it in the methodist baptist catholic he put it in christ the anointed emmanuel now that's the revelation of all revelations that's right now but that is a principle you want to be very careful to understand and follow because god don't never deviate from that right okay now paragraph 2 14. and the name we're going to go slow on this too it's real simple but you got to let your let the holy spirit just sink it into your heart and the name is in the word right because he is the word now jesus christ is the word in the beginning saint john chapter 1 and the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and that's where god put his name right this is what brother brahm's saying and the name is in the word because he is the word amen what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god amen no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who i am and upon this rock i'll build my place of worship right and the gates of hell can't shake it down amen oh living church of god stand firm foundation on jesus christ alone you can sing the song but if you're not on christ the word you're on teetering faltering sand but upon this rock christ my word amen all right let's get number 12. but he said i'll choose the place to put my name and the name was jesus and jesus is the word saint john 1 is that right that's the place of worship in christ the word i come in my father's name a lot of people think they can get the spirit without the word it's a lie all right you got to put the word first and then the spirit follows amen it's the spirit that quickens the word if you want the holy ghost find out what the word is today you'll find where the spirit of god is amen now that's the place of worship in christ the word i come in my father's name the prophet said his name shall be called emmanuel that's matthew 1 23. if you want to write down jesus jehovah the savior and the fifth verse shows that he is the door by now many other invisible proofs this gate the name and place can be proved to be there's only one place that god meets man think about it church there's only one place that god meets man to worship and that's when he's in christ all right now where do you think god met brother branham to give him the seven mysteries are you with me where was brother branham caught up to meet those seven angels and what did those seven angels form the seven angels are just the seven spirits of god in a seven-fold manifestation not seven different spirits but god's spirit manifests in a sevenfold way right so the seven angels made the head of christ right so brother brown was caught up in the consolation of seven angels which is actually the fullness of the spirit it takes the fullness of the spirit to reveal the fullness of the word so the fullness of the spirit came to the prophet to reveal and fully disclose all the mysteries so god met brother branham in christ to give him the seven mysteries is that right where does god put his name at in christ all right praise god just so you know anytime you hear me go on like this you're getting set up for something all right that's the that's when he's in christ now the question is how do we get in him now this is this may pinch just a little bit but you know like taking medicine if you don't it'd make you sick if you don't it don't do no good right amen god's only provided place of worship quote number 13. amen just put this in here now the lutherans wanted to get it one way by joining the lutheran church the methodist wanted to get it mean by shouting the pentecost is one to get in by speaking in tongues that still ain't it see no that's gifts so forth but first corinthians 12 says by one spirit spirit of god which is the life giver to the word to vindicate the seed for that season see here's the methodist age seed laying there taking the holy spirit to make that seed come to life and purify the church by signification luther didn't preach that because he didn't know it the pentecost was wanting to speak in tongues for the restoration of gifts each one declares that's it that's it but by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is a family the family of god and that's the house of god that's the house of god is in the name of jesus christ and the house of god is the name of jesus christ amen the name of the lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe now how are you going to come in by a title how's your check going to be received by saying paid to the order of reverend dr minister see you might be reverend dr minister but the name of the lord is jesus christ i have chose to put my name at the door of the house of my worship for my family will be gathered in there under the blood now i know why god had me preach on shiloh because it was a gathering place okay and it's all in continuity see like it was in egypt anything outside died and in there there's no leavened bread there's no denominational mixture in it anywhere my house my children born to my jeans amen you already hear brother i see this on tape my genes amen glory to god my genes are in them my i put my word in them i'll write them upon the tables of my of their heart see that's my family the family of the body of jesus christ amen brothers and sisters we we who get in the body if you're not in the body of christ get in the body of christ the holy ghost will baptize you in there amen because the body has already been put in the grave it's already raised from the tomb it's already descended on eye that's your position as a believer is in christ if you're in the body amen and if you're in that body the holy spirit is actively revealing to you your part of the word for this day amen that's my fam my family see the door you'll come in that's my family the family the body of jesus christ the family and this door you'll come in not methodist baptist or pentecostal but in the door where i put my name it ain't methodist god's name ain't methodist god's name ain't pentecostal god's name ain't baptist god's name ain't catholic stay out of them doors then uh oh yeah right stay out of them doors in so praise god now you understand where the name of the lord is right you understand that's god's meeting place where did god meet brother branham in christ right you say well we met him in the woods once and met him out in the desert once and met him in his house once and that's all true but the real meeting place brother bram just got done showing us is in christ that's right do you think brother branham would have been given those seven mysteries if he wasn't in christ absolutely not i mean that's kind of a silly question but i'm just trying to get your thinking wrapped around this okay so let's go to our last quote this is back in 1956. now i got that ipod playing in my living room and i'm on my way out the front door here a few months back and i hear brother brandon make this statement and it hit me like a ton of bricks i had to go back and meditate in this and this 1956 quote goes together with all this right here let's read what it says remember how the angel came to brother branham and showed him his life in the scripture he says and watch he's always scriptural he said did not our lord say when thou prayest be not like the hypocrites that like to make a show said enter into the secret closet and when you have done so close the door then pray to your father that seeth in secret and he that seeth and seeker shall reward thee openly and he said the angel he said you remember that name that time you were hunting that time that you dreamed about and i said yes and he said i'll meet you in there and this time it won't be a public show right now where's the meeting place it's in the name right there why'd the angel bring to brother browner's remembrance that dream about hunting that name is that simple or what right that's pretty simple it's so simple it's painfully simple huh let's go slow and meditate the angel's talking to brother branham the angel of the lord says to him you remember that name that time that you were hunting that time that you dreamed about he said yes and i said yes he said i'll meet you in there where's there if english if language means anything it means the name that's god's provided place of worship that's the meeting place amen so that's how simple that vision is praise be to god almighty i appreciate the word of the lord today don't you amen god's truth is so awesome and so marvelous to our hearts amen god help us to just live by it amen be humble and just live in the presence of the lord jesus i pray god's quickening power come so strong in each and every one of us and make us ready right amen for the hour that we live in glory to be prepared to walk in the way that he would have us to walk in amen amen i might be cutting it short i don't know but that's just what i felt led to share with you praise god i really enjoyed that things the lord opens up to us you know and amen uh the seven church ages are preached this is exactly where the seven seals were right that's how it's formatted right in the scripture amen that's awesome that message is perfect amen i don't mind saying it you want me to say it again that message is perfect praise god amen praise god amen well i sure love you all so much

brother that touched my heart amen god helps us overcome ourselves amen god helps us rise above things that's why you always want to just stay studying focus on that word amen the prophet isaiah said

hearts god bless you so much god bless you love you all day amen amen come ahead brothers enjoy the message give our brother a good hand we believe it or are we together in christ in christ come ahead musicians and christ is the word so anytime you're gathered into words you're gathered in christ you know christ is not something that has a beginning glory you remember how we took it back the prophet took it all the way back for the foundation world talked about that logos theophany et cetera son of god he said that's the christ see then down to the old testament you can't find jesus he didn't say look in the bible and find jesus in every verse he said you look in the bible you'll find christ christ because he's the word right amen what are we gonna we're gonna find number five in
