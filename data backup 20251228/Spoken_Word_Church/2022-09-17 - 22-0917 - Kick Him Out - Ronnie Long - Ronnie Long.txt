to and so it's nice when you can and everybody stays together amen but if you have your bibles uh this afternoon we'll turn to the book of numbers the 13th chapter familiar passage of scripture for us and and uh trust that the lord is is with us this afternoon amen how many how many in here just just curious uh maybe just the young people here towards the front how many of you were born in a message church in a message home how about the old people in the back how many was born into a message home and it's pretty near 100 pretty close pretty close i'm not putting you in a sub category if you weren't just curious in the 25th verse and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of puran and kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whether thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in that land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of enact there if you don't you of course your bible studies know that those are those are giants the amount the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said be not able we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the giants the sons of a knack which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight may god bless his word let's just bow our heads this afternoon father we thank you for this opportunity to come and gather around your word father and lord just to open the pages and to look they're on lord there's oh father there's our promises in there there's our victories in there there's our our restoration our faith is in there lord all that we are is in this word and lord we thank you for allowing us to see lord pass the words of ink on the pages but lord to see a life that you provided in there for us lord and father uh a manna that would come in the hour in which we have need of it father and lord we thank you for sending us a prophet in this hour that could make it not just a dead letter but a living word in our hour father and lord we're so thankful lord that we have been given this opportunity lord to come and just to feast on your carcass this morning lord and god we just ask you bless it to our hearts and our our ears would be open to receive it father and lord may we just lay aside whatever's going on around us lord the the events that might come lord but lord we don't want to miss the event of your coming father we don't want to miss the event of of your visitation lord and father wherever you're talked about that's where you are lord and so we just we just want you to feel welcome father we want to invite you into every heart lord every mind father may every spirit be subject under your word now we pray father in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may be seated just a couple minutes this afternoon i like to just take a pretty simple topic ask me for a title and i say well the only title i have is kick him out there's somebody else in your house it's time to kick them out amen i believe that us as we raise our hands that we were brought into this message if we weren't born into it maybe we've been into it for some years and we've heard enough preaching to last a lifetime we've heard enough of the word to last a lifetime but it's time to put it into action it's time to take what we believe and put it into action there's there's somebody else living in your land and where i got this context from or read this quote i know i couldn't get it to email to you but it's in um the power of the devil you said well can i plug your your tablet in here i said well you don't want to read my chicken scratch on here so it wouldn't make any sense to you all anyway but brother bannon would say the devil's nothing but a bluff anyhow snorting and blowing all thunder and no lightning but i tell you brother the lightning power of the resurrected jesus christ puts a reality there that shocks the soul from a dead slumber of these earthly bound things into the immortal realms to believe god and take him at his word and call those things which are not as though they were amen redeemed by the blood of the lamb called out set aside a church bought and washed and ironed out without spot or wrinkle now he's talking about us the church somebody say he's talking about me say me he's talking about me without spot or wrinkle that's what he's coming for god help us to get our faith in the right place tonight to move out on the battlegrounds there and say satan you're a liar jesus christ died to make me free and it's mine somebody say it's mine somebody say it's mine now think about your possession the victory that you have desire i don't believe you came in here this afternoon just to sit in a pew or to get free pizza but i believe you have something on your mind that you're looking for god to come and deliver to you i say it's time to visualize that and say it's mine it's mine you can see yourself walking in victory he says get out of here you went to your home tonight you legitimate people and there's a bunch of drunks in there kicking around and carrying around smoking drinking cursing and living immorally you'd say hey get out of here this is my house brother tim if somebody was in your house when you got home tonight and there was somebody else carrying on in there you wouldn't just let him be in there right you wouldn't just let him sit in there brother bob you wouldn't just let somebody just come into your house and have some stranger have their muddy boots up on your couch i believe you'd walk in there and say hey this is my house you're you're sitting in my chair get out but but most of the time we'll let the devil come right into our home and come right into our life and we'll just let him we'll let him take up a residency there and he'll have our best chair and he'll have the most comfortable seat in the house and we don't have the courage within us to say hey this is my house get out but i think by the power of the word that we're living under it's been affirmed to us that we have the authority to say this is my house get out so remember this is your victory i can't pronounce your victory for you but you've got to know what you have requested of the lord maybe you've desired the holy ghost you've desired healing in your life you just desired a greater victory or to walk in a greater light than you've ever known or or maybe to get healing in your body whatever it is you've got to recognize that it's already yours but there's a devil between you and there there's a hindrance between you and there i believe it's time to walk out in total victory now imagine if you went into your house and say this is my house you'd say oh i'm a human being this was built for human beings and i've got a right here you'd say this is my house i have an abstract deed that proves this is my property then if you show him the deed he will not move then there is a law down here that will make him move right so if you took that word to the authorities and you took that that that title deed you said this is my house i have the deed to it and there's a squatter in my house now the law would show up and they would make that man get out of your house right now you know that as a citizen you have those rights as an american everybody in here american citizen you have those rights that if you went to the law and you say there's somebody in my house then by law they would have to be removed but i believe as christians we have a greater law i believe as endtime believers we have a greater law that is exercised for us that if we could recognize that and say we have a law that protects us from you being in my house but we've got to exercise that law and if that devil that come to you tonight tried to send you to a premature grave try to you up read god's abstract deed and by his stripes we were healed and if you don't want to believe that there's a holy ghost here the law of god that'll kick him out that'll prove it just ring up jesus jesus central say j-e-s-u-s find out if there's something that don't take place the angels of god will take their positions and that devil will get out you can stand there on your toes and say yes sir it's the truth amen not up here or down here you've read your title clear you know what it is oh my feel like taking wings sometime and fly away don't you when you think of that lift up lift up above the shadows give me fellowship divine yes sir stand up in there where all the things are possible somebody say all things now are some of the things possible all things somebody say all things all things are possible stand up there where enoch did my when he took a little stroll one afternoon with god and walked on home with him just didn't want to come back hallelujah not one morning or or one evening the rapture the resurrection he had a testimony that he pleased god because he believed god now that sounds too simple right that enoch's testimony wasn't that he knew all the mysteries or he knew all the revelations or that he knew where to find that quote or that exact text but the testimony that enoch had that he walked with god was that he believed god now i find that we we see ourselves living in a condition that that is under our privileges because we simply don't take god at his word now i think every individual in this building is guilty of that we're all we're all guilty of letting our humanity come in the way but i believe we're getting to an age into a time and we're living in a different dispensation where we are rising above just this humanity or what these three dimensions can hold but but we're seeing a supernatural god in action at this time on earth now i'm not going to settle for what i had last year i'm not going to settle for what i had 10 years ago or 15 years ago we've got to be walking in a current light with god is that all right somebody say right now right now god is on the move not tomorrow not yesterday but right now god is on the move and we've got to be walking in step with him right so we can come by we can ask ourselves and i could pass the mic we'd go one by one and say now why do you believe what we believe and somebody say well i don't know somebody say well i believe it because my my parents believed her i believe it because my grandpa believed it or or my mama made me come here or i don't really want to be here whatever the answer is we've got to recognize the living truth is in our midst now not just not just in 1965 or back in another age gone by but we're walking in the light now somebody say now now not yesterday not in another age not back in paul's age or john's age or even when jesus was walking in sandals but right now we are walking in a living light we're not looking for something to come but it's already come we're not looking for for the prophet to come back and to tell us something he didn't already tell us but we're walking in a living light already now right not waiting for something but it's already come he says that's what we need that's what we want is that what you want now you'd have to be a pretty pretty in pretty bad shape to not raise your hand to say i want the lord to come in and take total control of my situation i don't know what your situation is it might be it might be depression it might be uh health it might be diabetes it might be a foggy mind it might be unbelief you might be unsure about what i'm saying it might be confusion you might think that you're just walking in victory that's that's wonderful walk on in victory it might be a complex that somebody put on you whatever your situation is god is able to remove that but we must recognize who we are in this hour now the fault of israel there those 10 spies that went they they testified of their faults in the scripture and they said we saw ourselves as grasshoppers now them giants didn't say you're grasshoppers them giants didn't call them grasshoppers they didn't even get close enough to him but the scripture says that they saw themselves as grasshoppers and so they were in the sight of the giants because that's how they saw themselves i'm not going to raise my hand in this hour and say i'm just a grasshopper i'm just lowly and meek and i've got no power i've got no authority i've got no right but i believe we've been positionally placed into the body of christ not just to know it in letter but to actually perform it indeed to actually put a faith in action in this time to say it's my land it's time to take it back you always sing this song i i went to the enemy's camp and i took back what he stole from me he's stolen joy he's stolen freedom he's put you in bondage he's put you he's put you in chains he's he's told you you can't worship he's told you you've got as far as you can in this belief well let me just say that devil's a liar you have not gotten as far as you can in what we believe there is no limit to how far you can get now now being born into this now did somebody tell you or or did you have to find it yourself that you capped yourself off to what your faith could reach well that's just a little bit out there that's just a little bit higher and you know it seemed like maybe 20 years ago if if you were really to preach the son of man nobody would know where you were coming from maybe 30 years ago nobody would understand they say this man's blasphemy he's preaching that deity is in the body of christ but now we preach that on a regular basis and we believe it with all our heart but who told them 30 years ago that that was not the truth you understand where you're walking you're not living where 30 years ago was you're living in today's light it's a different light of this age now you can't expect to be harvested in march's light right the light of a march spring will not harvest that plant but we're living in the harvest time this all right am i going too fast just relax a little bit bro all right maybe you all raised your hand that you were you were you were born in the message so i assume you know where i'm coming from right right we cannot rely when they came into pentecost they could not rely on luther's message they cannot rely on wesley's message they had to see their own message for their own light now we coming into another light we cannot rely on what they believed on a hundred years ago in 1909 we cannot we can't believe that that will not get us all the way through we've got to have that and more we've got to have what luther preached and more right so now we know we're walking in a prevailing revelation that we're walking in step with the word right remember when brother branham saw you in the vision and he saw with that quote there i just read that there would be a spotless spotless bride without spot or wrinkles should be walking in the word walking in step with the word so we're continuing on in this we're not putting a cap and say you know you just got to be content to sit in that pew and be handed what you're given when did that become a normal thing for the church of the living god to just just take what you're given and that's what you're given now the woman with the blood issue she was handed a death sentence there they couldn't figure it out they couldn't find it they couldn't they couldn't heal it they couldn't cure it but she didn't just take what she was given she recognized who was walking on the earth at that time i believe there's the same christ walking on the earth at this time i am not satisfied just taking what i'm given in this life but i believe we're called to take him at his word and to remove any hindrance in our life to remove any giant in our land now we look over there and we see the victory right you see what i'm preaching to you see that you can walk in total victory and you can praise them like you desire to and you can walk in total faith but there's a giant standing in between you and that you see we've got to have the eyes of faith to know that that's already my land over there and if that's my land there's a law protecting me that says i can have it back now when those spies gather there they used to live in that land their forefathers lived in that land you see they were told how beautiful the land was and how great the land was but it had been it had been something 400 something years since they'd been there right so those individuals had never actually been in that land they were born into slavery but they'd heard they had heard of a land now many of these young people sitting here you maybe you've heard of a supernatural testimony taking place for this brother over here you've heard of god moving on the scene over there or maybe back in you know when you're your pastor preached the convention you heard this the spirit of god move or you heard it last sunday for somebody else but you've got to see it with your own eyes you've got to believe that it's for you and it's it's it's for your time it's not for the neighbor or it's not for tomorrow it's not for just brother wade or it's not just for brother bob but it's for you in your time this is the bride's time right we're not living in the wrong age you weren't supposed to have cowboy boots and spurs you're living in the age that god thought of you to be in you're not you're not born out of season you're not born out of time you're walking in the perfect vision of god this is where he saw you so if god saw you already here then he gave you what it's going to take to overcome this age right we are living in the darkest age i don't know if there's a the the the mural with the ages on it but we're living in the darkest age right there there's there's just barely a sliver of light there that represents us thank god that there's a sliver of light there because there is a bride on the earth today that is walking in victory we're not defeated we're not walking with our head down we're not walking pretending that we know what we're talking about but we are walking in total victory because we recognize that messiah is on the earth living in the body i believe it's us i i can't speak for you but i say hey it's me it's me now not not sometime in the in the future when when something comes to pass but brother braham said all things have been fulfilled already we are now walking in victory if we can only recognize now we can't control the circumstance that come to us but we can't control how we react to that circumstance is that circumstance going to tell you how high you can rise or are you going to just look past that giant and be able to see total victory now the devil would love for you to sit there in your seat and be so depressed in yourself and to be and be coming at your own mind with every angle you can think of of why it's not you but wouldn't it be easier just to believe it's you wouldn't it be easier just to get rid of all the doubt and just say i believe that i'm fulfilling this scripture in this age he's talking about me he's not talking about another group but he is talking about me right now in my situation in my flesh in my circumstance he's talking about me now when royalty is born they didn't have to tell uh prince charles that he was going to be the next king he already knew that he was born under the right bloodline that when the queen passed away he would be the next king right he already knew that it was already within him nobody had to tell him that but when you're born into another kingdom when you're born into this kingdom of which i'm talking about it comes with entitlement it comes with rights it comes with a new bloodline and you're entitled to every promise that is promised that psalms 103 is already yours when you're baptized into this body when you receive him in fullness when you when you walk in the holy ghost every right is yours now how many exercise every every one of those rights how many how many sick people exercised by his stripes were healed now it's one thing to testify with your lips but it's another thing to walk in it and see it happen friends i i i can't i can't explain this in a better way than to say that i've seen more of god this year than i have in my entire walk put together i've seen god move on the scene more this year than i have in my entire testimony since i've been serving the lord what is it we're reaching another level but we've got to recognize that we're moving up we cannot stay behind in yesterday's hour we cannot stay behind in yesterday's day we've got to recognize that we're walking in a higher level we're seeing things that we didn't see 10 years ago what has the word changed have we been preaching different quotes by the way no but the bride is recognizing who she is we know the quote when she recognizes who she is she will be an invincible army right but there's a catch to that you've got to recognize who you are somebody say it's me it's me he's talking about me this this this word of encouragement that comes through the prophet's lips is not talking about another group or another race or some people are far off he's talking about me now you can look at the message a couple different ways you could say well you know it's just a bunch of negativity and it speaks about judgment it speaks about hell he's not talking to me when he's talking about that but when he's talking about walking in perfect victory when he's talking about taking off of this old garment of sorrow and putting on a garment of praise he's talking to me somebody say me he's not talking that it's going to come but he's saying it's already here my message is to declare that he is here right i don't believe that we should have to water down i hope you're okay with this i don't believe we should have to water down our youth services because i believe you all hear the truth of the hour i believe you're just as far along you're you're further along sometimes than a lot of people that have been in the message their entire lives because you're you're called and elected to receive it in this hour now when you recognize that you're coming to this kingdom and you've taken on the holy ghost which is not just uh i raised my right hand and i solemnly swear that i'll be a member of this church and i'll follow this message for the rest of my life no when you actually take on the life of christ within you there are rights that come with that with that citizenship is that it right have you moved over here from another country you used to be under that country's laws right you used to be under that countries and maybe they didn't protect you as good maybe they didn't have uh social security and maybe they didn't have the benefits that we have here in the united states but when you became a citizen of the united states every right that every other citizen has is now yours right what's the same with coming into the kingdom of god brother wade does not have rights that you don't have if you come into the kingdom of god you're entitled to the same word of prophecy that he's entitled to or that i'm entitled to or that brother louise is entitled we're all walking in the same kingdom right there's no big eyes or or big knees and little yous we're all walking under the same authority when you recognize where you're living now the hour in this age everybody's fighting for their rights everybody's fighting for for uh black lives matter or or lgbtq rst rights or whatever it is everybody's fighting for their rights and yet the people of god sit there and they take what the devil gives them and they think that's how they have to live not anymore i say from today on you've got to recognize in your heart i'm kicking him out maybe there's a devil been living in your life and been bringing you down and bringing you sorrow and telling you that you're not ever going to make it and telling you that the rapture's going to pass you by i say it's time to kick him out take the word and use it for what it was meant for for authority to kick him out of your life kick him out of your house kick him out of your kingdom let the word do the cutting let the word cut off of that that devil that's been hanging on to your life and telling you that you're not going to make it you don't have the authority you don't have the faith that's the devil of condemnation and i say it's time to kick him out you've been given given the same promises that every man before you has been given that's come into this kingdom the same authority that peter was given when he would walk by someone and his shadow would do the healing that same authority lives within the bride in this hour the same authority that would take paul and silas out of a prison cell that would shake the walls loose and they would walk in freedom that same authority is in the bride in this hour we're walking in it now now we've got to change the way we're looking at it we've been given this well this is just the way i am that's just how i was meant to be i just i just have a woe is me kind of attitude i just have a debbie downer but that's not walking in victory you're saying i'm just a grasshopper in the sight of that giant i don't know how you look at yourself but you've got to see yourself how god sees you he sees his child when i when i look at my son or my daughter i don't see a lesser human being or somebody smaller i see i'll give my life for that person you've got to recognize that god sees you as his beloved he's not looking at you in some lesser manner thinking that he's not going to move on the scene for you like he did somebody else you're not a grasshopper in god's sight but what about your own faith what does it testify about yourself well we're just a grasshopper to this this is a dark hour we're living in this is a dark age and you know i thought we were just going to come in here and and he was just going to preach a simple sermon but this is what the lord gave me on my heart you know i thought he was going to make me feel good but i'm telling you who you are in this hour and by telling you who you are you're identifying what rights are yours the devil that comes to you and torments you at night you have a right to kick that devil out of your mind you have a right to kick that devil out of your home it's your right the law of god protects you from those things but you've got to recognize it's not a yesterday thing it's not just that if i do this and i carry my cross across the middle of the desert on my knees i'll be entitled to this but right now while i'm speaking these words you can come into this kingdom and you can be entitled to every right that a christian has it's yours already it's a living fire right it's not it's not a dead cold fire in another age gone by it's alive today right we sing the song he's alive and well living in me does it say he expired yesterday or that the faith of god only works for a certain amount of time and you know those things just don't happen anymore days of miracles has passed right it's the same old spirit that the prophet preached against you know those things don't happen anymore they don't happen around here wouldn't you like to be the change in that wouldn't you like to see the manifestation of the promises of god coming to pass in your church in your life in your circumstance and what your giant is in front of you wouldn't you like to see that same old david anointing strike you that same old joshua anointing strike you and say there's more for us than there is against us there's more on my side than there is against me we are given kingdom authority in this hour but we've got to recognize we are the bride in this hour we're not looking for something to come we're already there sisters if you knew the power that you hold within your faith if you could recognize that god gave you all that he was is laying in the church now he never intended for that power to lay dormant he intended it to defeat the devil any circumstance any time any place under any condition this word will defeat the devil but so many times we end up in the corner and we think somehow we're defeated or we're not able or we're just stuck with this circumstance i say kick him out i say take the word which you already have the knowledge of and kick him out oh he says oh my that takes the wishbone out and puts a backbone in there when you come to find out that jesus really we gotta we we he raised from the dead and is here tonight proving himself alive your faith in action your faith put in action so what drives the devil out your faith somebody say my faith my to think that you have the faith to drive out the devil now if you walk up to the devil and you come at him with a with a little bit of uh fear in you he's been defeating humans for ages for thousands of years you come to the devil with a little bit of doubt in your voice and you say it's my faith i think that devil's not going to move and maybe you've come up against this giant of which i'm talking about tonight you've tried it before and you said by maybe you worked up under emotion sometime and you said by faith be removed but there was an element of doubt in there that it just wasn't for you that devil will recognize that doubt he recognizes where that comes from but if you can ever get past that point that point of doubt to recognize that this word is for me this is my weapon this is my sword this is how i defeat him it's not it's not a mythical thing out there that maybe will come to a people one day but it's mine it's right now then you can say it's my face somebody say my faith my faith what's good is it going to do to read of a historical god if he isn't the same god today what's good is it going to do to read about old george washington if he's dead and gone it's just a history fact but jesus raised from the dead and he's the same today what good does it do to paint a fire to a freezing man show him a picture of a nice big warm fire and the man's a freezing that's something that was that's what people are trying to keep you alive by today no wonder we got a failure in america of religion no wonder the magazine says the spiritual ongoe is a burst is because they failed to represent the right thing to them they're trying to teach them of a historical god but what we need today is a god resurrected from the dead and on hand right now somebody say right now to do whatever he promised he would do to confirm his word and we need delegates out there in the audience who's willing to rest their soul on any word that god said and put it into action how many wants to fulfill that quote right there we need delegates out here in the audience that will take god at his word and will put it into action somebody say me somebody say i'll do it we got to have the same anointing that isaiah said here am i lord i may not be able in my flesh i may not think i'm i'm worthy in my flesh but here am i send me that's what we need today that's what we need is men and women who stand up to the forefront there and call the devil a liar say jesus christ stripped you and robbed you of every right you had and i'm in christ jesus and the world belongs to me amen right what good does it do to have a bird to have wings as long as you've got him in a cage he can't fly he don't need no wings if you've got him in a cage that's the way a lot of these people are they're in a cage taught of the days the miracles has passed oh there's a god oh yes we believe that jesus was a son i've accepted him as personal savior but i tell you all those things is back there in the old days their past how many is i had to encounter that devil of unbelief all those things are passed they're in another day gone by the days of miracles has passed what good's your wings going to do you what good's your faith to do you if you can't turn it loose what good is your faith going to do if you can't put it in action certainly if i believe jesus lives today i'll put it into action what good is it to say that we have a vindicated word of promise in this hour that it's infallible we can argue it till we're blue in the face and say there's no contradiction there's no mistake and yet we've not even put it into action yet hey we've got so concerned about proving this to ourselves we've missed that we can use it against the devil and we just take him at his word just say i believe this wholeheartedly it works let me say this message works it works when you need him it works when you think that there's no way out it works when when you're in desperation and you're crying out for help this message works we've already proven that to be so but let it work for you what good is it for god to give you wings if you're going to be in a cage your whole life what good is it for god to give you the ability to worship if you're never going to use it what good is it for god to give you breath in your lungs if you're never going to use it to glorify him brother that was playing the piano wonderful playing what good would it be for god to give you the gift to play the piano if you're not going to use it to glorify him what good would it be for god to give you discernment of the word to look over this and to know the quotes and to know that if you're not going to use it to glorify him it was not put here so we could argue back and forth about it it was put here so we could put it into action in our lives now maybe we'll talk to the back for a second how many mamas and daddies are ready to get the devil out of your house i've had enough of the devil in my house and dictating to me how my kids can go and what direction they're gonna take i say it's time to kick him out i say it's time to take the word that you've already been given and use it for the purpose it was given for and kicked the devil out what good is it to be given the gift of the holy ghost if you're just going to sit there if you're just going gonna wait on him to do something for you if you're gonna wait on some emotion to come by or the light to flicker or the chain to move what good is that god is waiting for somebody to put their faith into action this is our time this is our hour let me say are you the bride are you the bride over here you believe you're the bride is this your age is this where you live is this your your dimension here is this your time it's your time to let your word shine don't put it out to somebody else to do or just the pastor or just the ministry but the son of man ministry is in his bride it's in women it's in brothers it's in the it's in the in the pa girl it's in the the sound man back there it's in the drum player the ministry of this hour is in the bride why would it just be there if we were had to deal with whatever we were given maybe you were given uh just uh just a small portion but that's not what you're that's not your cap who told you you couldn't fly well gravity told me that well who who told you you couldn't walk in perfect victory in this word some devil told you that some devil came along and he told you that this was just the way it is that you're just going to continue to live under your means and just go from meeting to meeting and from paycheck to paycheck and you're never going to get ahead that's some devil that came into the church and told our young people that that they would have to live under this kind of expectation but i say it's time to kick that kind of expectation out of the church this word did not come in our hours so we can live under our our means or under our expectations but it came that we could have fullness that we could have life that we could get under the fountain and drink freely but my sometimes it seems that we've got a battle to get under that fountain we've got a battle to actually get underneath it that's right my we have to battle our own thoughts we got to battle traditions we got to battle uh false teaching we got to battle everything that the devil can throw at us not to mention the temptations of the world that you all face you all are facing more temptation and greater temptation than i faced in my day maybe i'm not that old but just in 10 years a lot changes a lot of temptation changes the devil has greater access into your home than he did when i was a kid but you were put here to overcome him in this age you're not putting the stage wrong you don't put you weren't put in here that god just sends you through and hope you make it on the other side but god already saw you walking in total victory right by a prophet's vision he already saw a bride without spot he didn't say it would just be old people he saw a bride walking in this age without spot without sin above reproach not letting the devil work through their life he saw a bride made up of you and me walking in step with the word that's why we were given this word of this age so that we could overcome them in every situation under any circumstance now tell me what what what is greater than god is your doubt greater than god is your is your depression greater than god how about that anxiety you fight is it greater than god no but your faith must be put into action to recognize that god is not coming god is already here living in me to tell he's alive and well he already defeated that same enemy 2000 years ago why don't you let him defeat him again today why don't you let that word of god strike a seed in here and let him defeat that enemy again today amen but we can't survive by a fire of yesterday if i drew you a picture of a nice flame and i put it out here would you get any warmth from it it wouldn't give you one bit of warmth but you have need a fire you know that you're cold you know that your hands are cold you want to get somewhere there's a fire if i paint you a picture of it it doesn't do anything for you let me say just to know that the pillar of fire came and it was over brother man's head it doesn't do anything for you if you don't recognize that it's right here in our midst in this hour it wasn't just back in 1963 when he was caught up it's right here in this hour angel lord didn't leave he's right here in this building but why would he come in here if he's just going to sit there and let you go through the same old dry routine and be stuck in the same old rut that you've been stuck in service in and service out waiting for god to do i sure wish god would come in here and do something miraculous all right brother well what hinders you why not you yeah why not let it shine on you why not let the revival come down and hit you could you imagine this brother man of somebody standing at the platform saying the baptism the holy ghost divine healing that's for another day it's like trying to introduce a man to freezing death freezing to death and paint him some fire for him and say that's a fine fire that's what was you can't warm by a painted fire you can't warm by uh by uh by a religion that died 60 years ago if you're basing on the man william branham it's a painted fire you've got to recognize where the word is today that was fire at one time but what about fire now holy ghost had power at pentecost through the first stage second age and on down what about this age he's the same holy ghost today the same power the same signs the same wonders the same miracles let me say same if he can get the same kind of faith amongst the people god doesn't change if he can get the same kind of faith do you know that if you were in that upper room on that day you would not act any different than you are right now it's not in a greater portion back then there wasn't just a greater outpouring of his presence back then you know if you were in brother braden's meetings you would not act any different than you are right now you know brother branham came up in here and brother wade was doing the introduction he said i have a special treat for you today reverend william branham is going to come out to the pulpit do you know you would not act any different than you are right now maybe you don't but i'm going to tell you that's the truth he said jesus couldn't heal you anymore if he was standing here in his corporal body than he could right now because the power which he left is what what was in him to heal the sick to begin with that same power is here in the church of the living god that same fire is here that was in the upper room that same anointing that was on william branham is here there's only one perfect gift sent to every age that gift is coming on but that same power is here in the church prophesied speaking in tongues uh uh healing the sick we've witnessed it just this year i've witnessed every gift work in the church accurately god is not dead he's not he's not backed up he's not dwindled in faith or dwindled in power he's waiting for somebody to use the same faith the same faith they would come under that anointing and under that anointing for the rep say you feel that there's a connection between us you feel that there's something taking place between us you've stepped into the presence of the angel you feel that i've stepped into that same presence i know exactly what that angel feels like i know exactly what they were feeling when they came under that i don't you say well brother you weren't there i just just last year there was a meeting up at nathan bryant's church and there was a sister there that went to branham tabernacle and in that meeting she said afterwards she came and she talked to brother wayne she says this is the same anointing the same feeling was in this building that it was under brother branham's meetings see it wasn't any different or any lesser it felt exactly the same a holy hush came across and and the power of god was moving and and the sick were being healed it's the same anointing why because it wasn't william branham's anointing it was an angel's anointing and that same angel is here but why would he be here if he's not gonna change you why would he be here if he's gonna send you out with the same old the same old burden you had on you when you walked in this building he's here to change your life he's here to heal the sick he's here to save the lost he's here to restore that which was broken he's here to mend it that heart that's been hurt and it's been questioned and you're and you're wondering and you're struggling he's here to set it straight if we can just have the same faith but we can't get warm by a fire that somebody told you about i can tell you that we built a huge bonfire i could tell you testimonies right now of what the lord's doing but you've got to have your own testimony but it might build your faith that you could say well there's it's possible it's possible in this hour that somebody's building a bonfire there's a bonfire out there somewhere brother wade's not crazy he knows that there's a fire there's a fire happening in his soul and that's what he's trying to express across the pulpit hey get in the fire while it's hot this is a real fire you can get warm you can get lit come and get in the fire i like that brother brown said if you don't have something to say just tell them how your candle got lit but i think a lot of times men get behind the pulpit and they never lift their candle so i got anything to share but i'm here to tell you how my candle got lit is by coming under the authority of this word in this hour by recognizing that it's not just a letter on paper but it's a life alive in beings alive in flesh alive in lips and feet and hands it's not just a saying lord take these hands not just a nice song but it's a literal life of jesus christ living in men today living in women today testifying of his works and his goodness you do not have to walk out of here with whatever you walked in with you might have walked in this room carrying a burden of doubt a question of unbelief of wondering what's going to happen to to that so-and-so or wondering what's going to happen to you when you i say it's time to kick that devil out i say we've given up too much already i say we've given away the boundary too much already we've let the devil take and take and take and take i say it's time to take back what the enemy stole from you come on mamas and daddies you know what i'm talking about it's time to take back what the enemy stole from you he's encroached on your children he's encroached in your life he's encroached on on these young people sitting here no doubt many of your parents are sitting back there pulling for you it's time to take back what the enemy stole from you it's yours it's yours to have it's not something afar out that's above your reach it's right here the angel moving in our midst not just so we could argue about it or we could feel a little emotional whoo but he's here to change lives he's here to set that crooked straight now we might have disappointments where we've prayed to the lord for things that didn't come to pass and we've waited and we've waited but he's here to change lives he's here to give you the desire of your heart you don't have to rely on your daddy's testimonies i remember growing up i remember growing up as a kid and my my mom and dad came in the message back in california and and they they would share these testimonies of things that would happen back in the church back then back in the 80s it seemed like we had a a real revival going through the message and there was supernatural done and there was mighty works of god going on but then i was born in the late 80s and by the time i was hearing about it it was in the 90s and i'm thinking where are all the miracles well that's nice it's nice that you have those stories yeah i get so encouraged my dad say oh you should have been there in this meeting and the power of god fell and this happened and this happened and and then you just look at it and say well that must have been for another age that must have been for another time gone by and then you associate it with well you know maybe maybe the power of god following in a meeting like that was just in brother branham's hour just to brother branham's time or maybe maybe those maybe those gifts were just extinguished out of the church or maybe divine healing doesn't exist anymore maybe those things just don't happen but eventually you get to a place where you recognize he's not changed his power's not decreased he's not changed the way he operates he's not changed his mind about his people he's not changed his mind about how he heals or how he delivers or how he shows up on the scene he's not changed his mind but the faith of men has got so mixed up and arguing about it now many of you were born into something that you didn't you didn't you didn't expect that to happen you were born into it right and you come into the middle of the scene if this is am i okay you come into the middle of the scene and there's quote wars going on and there's battling going on and and you've fallen into this and all of a sudden you're just you didn't ask for this but there's a war between this pastor and that pastor that you didn't even you weren't even there for but you heard about it and you think well i'm on this side and you heard this quote well i see it that way and you're born into a situation that you didn't have any control over but there will be somebody that overcomes that situation there will be somebody that actually looks at this word for themselves with their own eyes and say i take it for what it is i didn't ask for this uh opinion i didn't ask for this doubt or this question or this we don't we don't read that quote that way well let me ask how many quotes can you cut out before you've cut the whole thing out i say it's time for the the church of the living god and i think it's going to come through these young people here that's going to recognize i'll take the whole message nothing but the message i won't cut it i won't trim it i won't water it down i want it all i want it all i want him out of my house i want him out of my life i want it all but you see because we're born into the middle of this we have a superstition built up about about how we can act about what we can do about what liberty we can have right we don't want to get too crazy you won't be wildfire yeah don't be wildfire you wanna be you wanna be crazy like brother wade and billy ronnie there you see we've put a cap unknowingly on how we can operate under the influence of an angel we think we have to live under these expectations under this on this type of anointing and that's as far as we'll ever get but but but the word did not tell you that this message did not tell you that you can only live this high this message did not come to tell you that you can only have just this much water or this much of the love the life of christ but this message came to say he's here in fullness he's the same yesterday today and forever and all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into his church all somebody say all is in the church in this hour we're not waiting for it to be poured out it's already in the church we've got to recognize we're moving in step with the word time for those old shackles to fall off time for that old giant i don't see myself as a grasshopper i see myself as a king and priest already in the kingdom of god i'm a son of god you're a daughter of god you're entitled to every redemptive right but if you don't recognize who's here it's like you're in another kingdom wandering around i wish my dad was here remember when you were a kid when you're real little and you say well my dad could beat up your dad with my daddy you see he has a better job than your daddy my daddy's truck's bigger than your daddy but you see the whole time daddy's not around you're just saying things and all the while you're thinking i hope daddy shows up i hope my big brother shows up i'm sure talking a lot of trash i want big brother to be here to back me up see that's what it's like when you're walking around in this kingdom and you're unaware of who you are you're saying these things are possible you're saying that the days of miracles is not passed and that god's still alive today and that this message is alive and true but if you have any element of doubt in there you're thinking i sure hope the pastor gets here pretty soon i sure hope so-and-so minister shows up here pretty soon or i'm sure hope brother branham would come back and write this or where's where's where's somebody to back me up here but you've got to recognize that you are already a citizen in that kingdom and your word is just as sure as any word that's come before you through the prophets your word is just like his word you've been adopted once you come into this holy ghost i believe we recognize that we've been taught it we've been we've been we've been quoted it but one day we're gonna live it one day we're gonna break through that barrier to say this isn't my daddy's testimonies this isn't just something afar off or that we used to hear about her i wish i lived in this day but you'll be able to walk and say i'm living in the best day that there ever has been i'm walking in a greater light than there ever has been i'm walking in complete perfected word that's where we're coming to recognize friends you were you young people you were born into the best age in my opinion that there ever was brother ram said if he could pick one he would pick this one because this is the age where god has rested his reputation on let me say to you young people brother what's your name philip god has rested his reputation on you overcoming in this age is that all right god's name is on the line for this age to come out and take a rapture god's name is on the line for you girls to overcome complexes and fears and and anxieties god's god's name is on the line for you to overcome and be a a rightful son of god his name's on it he said it who's going to fulfill it some church down the road some other some other big big big camp down the road no he's going to work through a flock just like this that takes him at his word and says i'm not going to settle for just having this much i want it all i say if there's more of him to have i want it all now we can pass the mic and say do you believe that there's more of god for you to have in your life everyone would say yes i want more of god i want it all i want the devil so far removed from my life that the indwelling of god is radiating out of my being that i could walk in perfect faith and i could walk in perfect victory that the things i only imagined would be possible will be a reality to me i want it all i don't want to settle for just what the devil handed me i want a total victory somebody say me somebody say it's mine i want a total victory well let me say that he's here and he's here to give you a total victory you don't have to walk out of here with the same old regret that i wish i would have done something when you walk out of these doors but you can settle it even now settle it don't live by a painted fire don't live by something that you've heard is possible or you heard happen let's manifest it in your life let's see the manifestation of this message come out in the life of a young person in this hour say i want to be that person i want to be that young person this hour that lives this word so so real that it becomes manifested in me that's our desire as believers we're not here just to battle back and forth and quote shake hands see what you wore today see how well you sing and how good your pitch was we're here to manifest this word that we live for when did it become a tradition to give what the devil gave you just to settle for it just to walk in that think about old joshua when he recognized i'm not a bricklayer i'm not a brick maker there's something greater in me than just making these bricks you see i've become tradition to those israelites that they just make bricks right when they come to cadiz barnea and the ten spies went over and they brought back a report it had become tradition for them to walk around in the desert and eat manna and live under their privileges it had become a tradition for them god forbid that it becomes a tradition in the church of the living god just to take what you're given in this life just to take what the devil handed to you and say that's all i can get this is all i meant to be what if joshua and caleb would have had the same vision that those other ten spies had they'd still be in cadence barney they'd still be wandering around but there was something greater inside them they recognized this is our day this is our hour i will not settle for wandering around in the wilderness i have a land over there it's my land they didn't even see giants they saw their land this is the land that that abraham lived in this is the land that isaac lived in this is our land and there's a squatter sitting in your land and you might think i'm just crazy why are you why are you yelling and why are you screaming because i've recognized i've tasted of the grapes i've seen that there's a better land for you than where you're living you've got to recognize it's your land ah well i you i just i i i you see yourself as a grasshopper you've got to recognize you're an anointed called appointed elected inspired son and daughter of god to take back what the devil has already stolen from you it's your property when did god come in here and through the message or through the bible tell you that joy was not yours anybody anybody got a quote for me that joy's not yours anybody got a quote that you just have to be sad all the rest of your days anybody got a quote where you got to live in the gloom all the rest of your life let me have a quote and yet we live in that and yet we settle for that and we have a quote where you'd have to live with this disease the rest of your life anybody have a quote where you'd have to live in unbelief for the rest of your days brother you have a quote you no why because it doesn't exist because god promised you greater things than walking in this laodicean condition god promised you that you'd walk out in a perfect body god promised you that you'd walk out without sin without wrinkle without spot god promised you something greater than what this devil handed you in this age we've got to recognize it's me it's right now now's my time this is my hour my anointing the presence of god is here to change me from what i walked in that door with it's your time don't just live on somebody else's testimony have your own testimony here a couple months ago i was in australia remember i said maybe maybe sharing a testimonial let you know that there's a fire out there being built i was in australia a couple months ago and there was a young man there i was about my age maybe a little bit younger and we we talked he's from america ends up in australia and uh through circumstances he's running from the lord he ends up in australia ends up in him back in a message church in australia you see you can't run from the lord you can try but if you're elected you cannot outrun him he'll find you worried about your prodigal brother or sister he'll find him they can't outrun the reach of the lord and so this man finds himself there in in australia and he's helping out in the church a good brother just a wonderful wonderful man to be around and just feel just a kindred spirit there after i got done preaching one night i was walking i was walking out and he had the they had a camp a youth camp set up and so the audio was kind of in an odd place over on the on the side of the building and so i was walking out towards the back door and he and i see him coming i think oh he's going to ask me if i need a water or he's going to and as he gets closer to me i can see that he's he's affected by the presence that's in the room and he comes up to me and says i've got to have what you have i need that i've got to have it and here he's born and raised in a message church i've got to have that you think well if i go out in the world maybe i'll have a better testimony that's what happened to him and he came back in he still said i've got to have what you have friends the lord is still giving new births i watched one happen right there on the floor we didn't we didn't crawl through it or we didn't squeeze our way through it i simply said silver and gold have i none but that which i have i give unto you in the name of jesus and a wave of anointing came down and he is forever changed he just preached his first sermon last week you see what god's doing in this hour you're not just meant to hold on to whatever you're dealt the cards you're dealt with is not what you ended up with you can change your circumstance you can change your atmosphere around you by simply saying i've got to have something more than i currently have i've got to have something greater than just knowing god sent a prophet or knowing the quotes or knowing that our pastor is a good man i've got to know him i've got to know the author i've got to recognize him i've got to have him living in me that's where we've got to get to if we're ever going to overcome the devil in this age i believe we will i believe we are i believe it's by the bride that we're recognizing this is not yesterday's light but we're walking in a different maturity that's why i'm not preaching to you like your kids because you're walking in another level of maturity the 11th hour worker understands it at the same level is that all right the same pay we're not getting money here the 11th hour worker understands it at the same level as those that have been delving their life into it for for years and years and years but you give me you give me a nine-year-old that's been raised in a good message church and he'll out-preach any theologian out there in any denomination i heal out preacher joel osteen or a td jakes or whoever you give him a paul washer come on give me another name he'll out preach any one of those preachers because the authority that we've been given in this hour is a greater light than they could ever imagine to attain and yet we're the ones living under privileges friends i didn't just come out here to yell at you but i am sick and tired of watching the devil trample all over god's people to take victories away from god's people to to hand him a card that says you're depressed to hand him a card that says you're anxious to hand him a card that says you won't sleep tonight i refuse to accept that from the devil i say it's ours and it's time to kick him out kick him out of your life kick him out of your mind kick him out of your of your world your circumstance you have control over that now you might go home and you're maybe i don't know all of you maybe you live with unbelieving parents i don't know but you have the ability within you to have the faith to say i am the one he was talking about it's me it's for me this is my victory i'm not looking for something else to come but i'm walking in the victory now is that all right friends what are we waiting for well when we have a big camp next year we have our certain certain meeting you might not get that you might not get tomorrow's service you might not get next week you might not make it out of this building where the tim you didn't know you might not make it in mexico new mexico you just don't know you might not make it to the next surface you've got to settle things now you got to take him at his word now you got to recognize he's here now don't let that anointing go by without recognizing whose presence you're in jacob knew there was another israel there was an israel in him there's another me inside there i'm not just what you see out here just this common flesh and just look like any other person on the street but there's another you there's another you another you inside there and when jacob recognized the anointing was there i'll not let you go till you bless me i'll let the pot roast burn i'll let the beans boil i'll not let you go until you bless me when your hour of visitation comes don't ignore it recognize who's in your midst recognize who what this word came to do in our hour recognize it wasn't just a man wore a suit just like you and i but it was a living christ my ministry is to declare that he's here and if he's here all things somebody say all things are possible he just wants you to put your faith in action to activate the promise is that all right the music players would come i don't know how long we've been up here is this accurate all things amen we should be the most encouraged the most sure the most confident the most on top of the world people that there is because we've been given a promise not by a man not by a a a pastor or an individual or a pope or a holy man we've been given a promise by christ himself in this hour that you will possess the gate of every enemy that you have in your life to me that sets me my soul on fire i don't have to live by a painted fire i can recognize i can possess the gate of every enemy if i just apply my faith to this word it's not mind over matter to say i think i can i think that won't get you there psychology will never win the battle for you but recognizing that he's already defeated the foe that you're fighting that that that that feeling that comes over you that you wonder if you're gonna make it you wonder that if you if you're ever if you're ever gonna make the rapture if it's just gonna pass by it's gonna hit your neighbor it's gonna hit your it's gonna hit your girlfriend or your boyfriend or maybe it's just gonna hit the pastor and you're just gonna be left here he already defeated that same foe it's your promise to defeat by the word that enemy of unbelief to say it's already mine let me say the rapture is mine [Music] you deserve the glory and the honor lord we lift our hands in worship as we bless your holy name you deserve the glory and the honor [Music] lord i lift my hands in

[Music] [Music] more than conquerors [Music] thank you father we've been made [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the prophet of god we thank god he sent us a prophet amen how many times i say it on sunday about 10 or 15 times a sermon i am glad god sent us a prophet they could give us clarity and there's only one prophet that could tell us uh brother ronnie he says you're god's victory you're the victory right he was victorious over the death hell engraving the cross but you and i are going to have to be what participants of that we're going to have to take that and like brother ronnie said we're going to have to live it he he doesn't know that our whole theme for this whole year has been what let it out good or bad whatever you got in let it out if it's good you need to let it out and show the world if it's bad you need to get it out right so here he comes and talk about kicking it out so we appreciate that man so he's just a little more stronger than i was a little bit you know kick it out but we need to kick your devil out amen and we ought to kick our heels up for jesus christ amen we're victorious this world has no victory none show me one tell me one thing this world can brag on well yeah they brag on being winning ball games and winning this temporary yeah eternal life is not temporary eternal life is eternal right and that's what we're talking about that's what brother ronnie was talking about today and uh really good let's give our brother a big hand hey man you believe what he said i'm like dad always says i believe he believes what he said anyway amen whether you do or not i believe he believes what he said we need to enter in um i was thinking about that i was laughing while you were preaching i preached a sermon 20 years ago on 10 lion preachers that's what it was there was 10 there was 10 there was 12 went across 10 come back and they lied they were liars and they were preachers because they made the people like he said they made the people stay there for 40 years 10 people that said we are grasshoppers then there had to be a joshua generation like you saying the joshua generation had to raise up a young group of people amen to carry us on and but now remember i want to i want to make something clear joshua was young but caleb was an old guy us old people can do it too hey man caleb was 80 something years old okay all right and he said he was stronger now than he was 40 years ago how many of y'all can say that don't raise your hand you lie but you know what i believe caleb probably had aches and pains and and needed some liniment and geritol and everything else but you know what in his spirit he was just as young as he was because you know what he had a promise you and i have a promise we have a promise that this group as brother ronnie said this group is going to defeat the devil like i said many times before i'm just dumb enough to believe i'm going to do it i'm just dumb enough to put myself in a place to where god can speak to me and i can help god i don't god don't need any help but you know what he chose us he chose us to help him he chose us like i said we're his victory him dying on the cross and going to calvary and getting being resurrected has nothing to do if you're not doing it in you if it's not doing it inside of you we've got to what make manifest what he's already done amen you love the lord man thank you everybody for coming we're going to go downstairs and eat now the young kids eat first because this is a youth day so take them downstairs and two slices of pizza first everybody with me two slices of pizza first then you can get whatever you want afterwards but just make sure that we don't overdo it and not have any left because that's old people hungry too well okay they they look to me like so what but we love you with a lovely lord we got pizza sure enough this plant should be planted down there and we have drinks and pizza and some bread sticks and all kind of dessert so uh you you we appreciate you the visitors let them go first we always do that so you won't be a visitor next time so you don't get to you'll get to eat the back of the line but good to have each and every one of you here uh we're represented by uh about several churches and and got the group from lincolnton here with us so surprised that's good i love to see them come man they can they can sing like you wouldn't believe so good to see them and then we've got the la group and then we've got some brother gene williams so if i miss somebody i'm i'm sorry i think i got everybody but then we got the old home group here so let's bow our heads and be dismissed thank you for coming like i said before there'll be activities for the young kids and remember when you get finished eating your pizza the group there's a group going to sing so you need to come up here and practice after that see sister christine if you have a question about it sister christine yorego which is right back there now okay so all mine's clear everybody good tell brother arnie how much you enjoyed it hey man tell him how much you really enjoyed him he moved out of the way and let god speak to us because that's what we needed we needed that today i needed that today so i know y'all needed it today we all needed it and we're all one in the body of christ so let's buy our heads lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for bringing our brother lord to hear lord where we can hear from you father you said through the foolishness of preaching that you're going to speak to us lord so i pray now lord that what has been said though will now enter into each one of our heart and we'll become lord more mature christians more mature adults more mature kids and will grow up in you father that's the most important thing we can have all the knowledge in the world and be like albert einstein but if we don't know you lord in the power of your resurrection then we're nothing we're of men most miserable lord i pray lord as brother ronnie was saying we don't need to be miserable we don't need to be depressed we don't need to be sick we need the lord take what you've already said take those promises lord and make them real father we pray now that you sanctify the food that will nourish our bodies keep brother ronnie strong lord and bless him for his coming up service tomorrow be with the ones that are here lord the ones that are streaming in lord the ones that will be here tomorrow we pray that you just be with them keep them safe be the ones that are going to be on highways we appreciate lord that you give us lord this word for this hour and as i say before thank you god for sending us a prophet that brings us clarity so that we can speak the word of god lord with boldness as peter and james and john said look on us so lord we looked on you today and we saw you manifested in a young man and father we pray that you just be with us now take care of us bless us in our in our activities downstairs and just keep us all safe father we love you and we thank you for all things in jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed god bless you [Music] all fear is gone
