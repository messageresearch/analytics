========================================

recording before we start this is something that kind of excites me Gabi talked to me this past Monday and said Ron I want to know how I know I'm born again and more or less the same thing sister Sheppard said in the dream you know is it in blessed blessed be his name that sermon brother Dale said first of us to over and over again and sister Shepherds wondering she's born again or how she know she has a new verse and Gabby had asked me Monday because of something brother Dale said Sunday morning in the service that caught her attention kind of put a question in her mind and so that's what he's trying to do if you remember he's always saying like every service I wish I could preach so much to where you fill out your loss so that you would start seeking God because a lot of people have come to a position where to be a justification and sanctification and stopped short of get the Holy Ghost and to me if you ever stopped at any time in your journey then you know you have really made any progress you haven't really started in my mind if you just come to any place and stop you're not waiting to be even if you believe you have the Holy Ghost you still keep going on still keep seeking more God so it thrilled my heart that Gabby would ask me that I know she'll hear this on the tape later so she said I can I asked her if I could talk about this for an illustration all right so she said how do I know I'm worn again I said well this is how I know I'm worn again and I based it on an experience I had 2015 and actually since that time I haven't sat down and stopped and so you know I'm born again I'm waiting on you to catch up wife it's not like that a few years ago if something happened to me where a simple verse of scripture was quickened to me one that I've read many times and if this came to life and I have never seen it in that line before and since that time has been a continual unfolding of the Word of God to me that's a new birth that hasn't stopped and I haven't stopped in my fervent desire to keep going on with God so but I had actually already been a Christian for 18 years by that time so it was you know I gave more for when I was 12 and since tom has been a continual growth well anyway I said just don't stop seeking you know just never stop seeking more of God and he'll fill you with all the ghosts and his time you just keep going but anyway a lot of brothers I got to thinking a lot of husbands if their wife said I don't know if I'm born again a lot of brothers might say well no don't don't say that you know you shouldn't say that because you spoke in tongue you shouted around the house you danced in the spirit you and I might say to her you set up three hours or two hours every single night and listen to sermons you know she comes into her sleep time to do that because that's all the time she can do it that's sometimes she can make time for the Lord is after she puts the kids down for bed at ten o'clock I go to work and she's cutting into her sleep time to step and listen to sermons of these ministers seeking God and I might say well Gabby you can look to that Lester in your birth but it's not that's not a new birth that's seeking for their first but you know you can't base it on some kind of experience like that it's got to be a person or that's what the new birthday has birth of the word it's exactly what it is and that's all it is it's not speaking in tongues shouting and you know who was it John or Charles Wesley I think it was John Wesley but anyone that came over here and said I came to America to hurt the hey were made and well I guess it was his brother that was appalled at this madness and lived so holding so how can you say that look at all that you've done you know everything done for the Lord but I'm thrilled to death that she's still sneaking back to the hallways period you're thrilled to know it and I'm sure she's glad to let it be more and not ashamed of there's nothing ashamed about that for me to be a Christian for eighteen years before I count my new birth to have actually started is it's not I'm not embarrassed to say it I'm just still sticking for more God though okay so we'll go ahead and pray that was just a little testimony I want to share with you all they're going to father with the cradle of the chill blessed us in the service today and in the Sunday school the services afternoon orders I'm not my master will just be an Irish to here father is your work comes forth just get over to yourself and everything that's done father and help us to just to dwell on new keep our hearts focused on the Lord and touch all the sick and all those who are out stable of Thomas and all the many others for just manifest your children and offer our bodies and just give us what we have enough today father today I had a few little slides touch up some stuff in this report but what we're gonna do is review a little bit from the last lesson about moment strength and then we're gonna pick up where he left off alright and I'm ever to think to put this name last time so I thought about this though is the song 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod enough to comfort me now prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies now notice my head with all of my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever so like last time we were talking about sheep all we like sheep have gone astray the table has gone astray this time are too title isaiah 53:6 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all psalm 119 176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep seek thy servant for I do not forget my Commandments so the objective today is to better understand the Sheep life nature that we have as humans and to recognize the rabbit tendency to go astray and most important to recognize that we need a foul administration to follow all right there is no such thing as being too dumb to understand the mysteries of God I use this slide last time I want to just reiterate okay very important there's no such thing being too dumb to understand the mysteries of God he reveals them to babes the uneducated the unsophisticated the simple and the humble it's not too hard or too complex to understand we simply need to read listen and pray and trust God to bring the understanding through the most Revelator men that I know of that I listen to is the right kind of regular basis it's our pastor who has like a ninth grade education is that right maybe a genius yeah they started into the den got a limited education and then brother branham about a seventh grader thanked education and these godly men have come to a place of Revelation and where I want to be and so you know that underlines emphasizes that we don't have to have education or be sophisticated really you're in a better position right the opposite of that just get real little real humble before the Lord sheep instinctively followed the late sheep and their flock similar to our instinct the event major sometimes that later can be just the first sheep that moves to another location however sheep often following the oldest mother the you and the floor find you humans do the same as I am talk about that last time got higher simplicity because man not made up in the beginning was better not to try to shift for himself for mammals had to rely completely upon God that's three my liking in the lamb's wool sheep the Sheep cannot lead it set himself he has to have a leader and the Holy Spirit's supposed to lead us so a man has made that way it was not a flaw it was not unintentional God made us that way so we seek Him as sheep we haven't has a tendency to go straight from common sense he sound doctrine last time I gave you all these examples naturally most of them just natural things above and how they go astray and all those things are bias is parenting driving and so forth I'm just going to talk about the Christian life this time we're not careful we can go straight even on our Christian experience 2nd Peter 3:17 ye therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness all right I kind of goofed up on this little game I told there last time we're going to start doing a name that creature that's my little game for the purpose of giving you to realize how much God is speaking to us through these men because you know as quoted to you last time the scripture a prophet is not without honor saving his own country among his own kin maybe you can to the preachers here or at least we all know them on a personal basis so it's kind of hard to look past that veil of the flesh and see that God behind that speaking to us but it's there okay and if you just look at this statement or any of these statements that I've come out to you and focus on that you might see that this is a very profound thing that's really happening and I gave this one away last time I said I'm a pastor said this now which one five minutes brother Dale what about the hospice into the work and letting them the word clean you out other day Hebrews 6:12 that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises I have witnessed our fivefold ministers and heard the promises of the promise of the new birth to us to follow them follow them as they follow Christ God keeps us warm little kind of speed through some of these I'm eating that pastor for a while I'm skipping I'm yellow but you go into a place where a pastor of the solid gospel teacher and all hell when they promote that church Jesus Christ the minister headbang forever so many times we fail to get the real power out of the gospel because we try to make it so complicated and the self simple it is we miss it by that way and now having some simplicity to expect to be something great something that we miss the simple thing we stumble over simplicity that's how we miss God is by stumbling over simplicity God is so simple until the scholars of these days and all days miss him a million miles because in their intellect they know there's nothing like him so great but in his revelation who makes it so simple they go fall over the top of it or miss it so did you find yourself lacking in revelation those God not there with you as much as you would lie this is not his fault he has not slack concerning his promise Simon Peter 3:9 one of the ways we have gone astray in our Christian life is by not spending enough time with God I think the best thing to come to church and every service and listening to the word being preached we are okay you might say well I don't think that the Word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart sometimes we're thinking things that we don't even realize we're thinking it so brother Dale or some master exposes that takes that veil off of our face and we begin to see where we're at we see the walk horse rider rotting away in opposition when the rebel so there's things that really does preach when I literally thought no I didn't think I was believed in that banality I really was and so the revelation comes I'm glad to what actually believes so you might not think that that this is you but just double check because frankly if you don't go home and study and pray and read and listen to these sermons over and over again that are being preached here maybe you fall in that category just me just think about that so don't pitch for get back to the next person so that's not me as for the young ones or somebody though that is a very necessary part of the Christian life until them out whatever I said in that last life every kind of going going to church listening the work and so forth though lesson that's third part of the Christian life we should also be spending much time in sacred with the Lord we should be reading the sermons that our ministers tell us to read you know brother delt gives us homework assignments I call them almost a resource he said go read or listen to this for that write it down because you won't remember and then go go do it thinking on the things that are being preached by all of our Minister brother Brown them and by all the ministers here and those who come true to preach and so forth ask some questions in spending much time in prayer asking the Lord to reveal to us the word that is being brought if you want to understand the seals be still book understand them seventy weeks of a book you want to understand the same church ages ready to church a book pretty simple huh reading does not give you a revelation all right when it doesn't so it's down on the Word of God it does soul the word got into your mind so that God can quicken it to ground this is our part of repairing our ground can't expect off overhead and forward him other thing I'll say about that is how can you convince God that you're really sincere and really desire a revelation if you won't go and study and pray you know it's like lord I really decided to reveal your work to me and that's in this third part of praying but then do you go and show them your sincere you do that by studying and bright and spend time with hmm I just love that picture in the scriptures although they up there we're fair 225 for we were you were as sheep going astray but are now returned under the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls let me go back to this one from you so talking about preparing our ground and so forth I'll give you an illustration I don't remember if I've ever heard this somewhere else if I just thought of it but let's suppose that say a young girl walks in here right now say 25 years old and we know she's fertile she's able to conceive but we know she's never known a man she doesn't have a husband or even a boyfriend she's never been with a man in that way then and all of a sudden she says you know what I'm pregnant I'm expecting a child first I might say well you missed you missed that boat that came you know with Mary she's on one that had the Immaculate Conception right so you'd say well how are you pregnant you don't know a man and she she might come up with some kind of little story or something but really we know she can't be pregnant outside of being with the man and spiritually speaking we cannot be born again we cannot be bearing any fruit or anything to the Lord cannot be born again unless we been spending time with Almighty God a secret okay that's that Tommy you make yourself available to him and he opens his work to you and you just lay yourself out there and say lord I speak to me and then is pray and read and study and open your minds to the Lord just tell me then another game of name that preacher everybody really they got a time allotted to their life you don't know how much time that God has given you but you have a set amount of time you're here on earth which is why the Bible says redeem the time you want to maximize that the time that you're given here on earth to make as efficient as possible this process the new verse we should be giving everything that we have everything we are to God so that he can come so that he can make this work manifest in us because just like in this little one God is transforming us to take us from darkness into life who might have said that one of our five ministers gasps waking up Oh baa baa black sheep baa black sheep I'll form a firmly believe really in all seriousness I really believe what these learner brand tongues will pass the full redemption body that is here Christ is in these men speaking to us I'm not exhorting the men I'm just telling you that listen closely what I say what they're saying this was they were seven he started that was the beginning that series in here on birth pangs okay that was a really good there's a little nugget hidden in there [Music] all right this is just food for thought if you're not interested enough in the word now to sit down and study and pray meditate listen and read the sermon how do you think you'll be suddenly interested in the message of cheer we receive in eternity y'all ever given thought to that you say well my body's gonna be changed I'm going to be fully redeem oh all of a sudden I'll have all this desire for the Lord then I don't know about that I think the Bible says to set your affections on things above and that tells me it's within our realm of possibility he didn't say how to keep it to your stature because you know we can he said anything the Lord asks us to do should be perfect rhyme perfect if he asked us to do those things then it's possible right so that's a reflection on things of both so that's something we can do that's something in our part that we can intentionally set our affections on things above all right can we do that but everything just make her all right second Thessalonians 2:10 I think we're the way to refer to this a while back I think I wrote it down work for with all disable asan unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved we have to have the love of the truth we have to you ever heard some I administer stand up and say well I just love this quote or I just love that scripture you know they're falling in love with the Lord and I have certain scriptures or certain quotes that I literally love and I love to think on those things but you know that's unless we're falling in love with the Lord and that's part of it from the seventh rib cages the pattern Serge's the triptych book it is the morning star that is visible and a lot of the Sun commences to shine when our Sun Jesus comes there will be no further native messengers he will bring us his message of chair himself and as he rules his kingdom and we live in his presence the light of the word will become brighter and brighter our perfect day what else the widow's are above Jesus himself is he not everything even perfect everything he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches Amen even so Lord God by thy spirit let us hear that truth but I especially wanted to emphasize the message of tear that's why I was talking about can you put a price tag on eternal life if you sacrifice worldly pleasures consecrate your life to Christ read listen and pray constantly do you suppose to look back from eternity with remorse about your consecrated life here on earth or regret I've ever Morris regret whatever would you look back from a fully redeemed body spirit and soul say in the future home and so I wish I spent more time on Facebook while I could or spend more time here is Almanac might really they'll says or or whatever you name the thing that to keep it's hindering you or spend more time cleaning the toilet the bathroom plate in the kitchen whatever it is that keeps you from the Lord that keeps you from spending time with God would you look back from fully-rigged for redemption and say man I wish I hadn't spent all that time studying and I kind of have this idea that maybe I'll probably look back and say I wish I'd spent more time saying you can't put a price tag on eternal life that's answering my question you can't put a price tag on eternal life it's worth everything we could do is it worth its full body experience or redemption worth listening to a sermon twice five times ten times a hundred times if you have time or if you can make the time you know it run else's listening to such a such a sermon and you say well I heard that when years ago listen again it's right you know why not right and all of our summers that our priests hear these ministers here listen to again look 962 it Jesus said it to him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God when we start our Christian journey we should give Christ are all no turning back like Lot's wife to worldly ideas and traditions care for the letters let's leave everything take up our cross and follow him here's another gang it looks like yeah I've named that preacher again there are so many of these little nuggets hidden in the message it's wonderful all of our schemes and our ideas and our classical buildups and all of our politics and all of our science and everything it's been proved that it's nonsense and then we pray for God to help us to intervene come in and do something for us and then when he does I just wonder if we'll be able to understand it if we will be able to receive it or would we even consider it in my seat humility written all the way across their humble simplicity right Christ hidden in simplicity because if we can miss it entirely so I think especially in this hour it but Hooves us to pay attention to what's happening and realize what's taking place anybody want to guess who said that blotchy yeah same [Music] same exact that last lesson itself as follow those knuckles do one more attribute that humans and sheep both share is strength in numbers for this reason humans including message believers tend to do what everyone else is doing and think they'll be okay and say God will have to accept us because there's so many a number how can you reject so many people I'll get to this one if I don't forget in a minute but it's like Catholicism you know there's a lot of Catholics and if we believe in strength in numbers we should just join the Catholics is it a lot more than or us there are people in the message that I've talked to that I crossed paths with about doctrine and so forth and especially about the River Jordan the seed doctrine and so forth and they would say something to me like what about brothers throwing so screwed they've got a hundred people if you if you're disagreeing with us and you got a bit you guys say they're wrong - and what about brother someone's so screwed in this other brother she made all the big name preachers are the message and said what about all that and I said well I'm just talking about me I just don't see what you're saying you know I defended but anyway you know and then they always think what about these great big batch numbers and that's exactly what she'd do she'd go running and this is the time to introduce that we all remember the last time I talked about sheep I've talked about this illustration where there was fifteen hundred sheep I think it was jumped off a cliff and five hundred of them died the first 500 or so died and then they made a nice pillow for the other thousand for following up so they got entrance but they're the last thousand of them lived and but when she started off a cliff who knows why I think it was a butterfly trace now butterfly and everybody else go laughter no flaw apparently no thought process no vertical thinking is this really wise it's just I'm a sheep I'm instinctively gonna follow everybody else and go back my way and you know and what if some of these false stalkers some of these feel-good dolphins are started by somebody just because it feels good and it sounds good and it's too good sounds too good to not be true and they don't really research it and they don't really check it out the messages in the Bible and then all of a sudden they start gaining like a snowball effects or a gain of momentum because more and more people start to say that does feel good that sound good and more more people start running with and before you know a vast multitude of people are following this little silly idea and right off into death and all they started because we're that sheep nature that sheep instinct that we just follow the leader you know I can't strength in numbers this one brother Dale also said listen to well back I think you must be born again that the people might know that not rest upon some little experience they had but to rest song only on their day-by-day life how they live in the times when they're in church and how they live when the great strain comes on the outside there they flee to the cross for help my trouble arises or do they walk in their own spirit and their own thoughts did they rob back when the round upon is that's the question but and when we see that it's totally impossible for any of us to save their that the God has made an appropriate way and all sufficient sacrifice and it's the only way that we can come not by any church or in created domination a sensation but by the way of Christ so you know I was talking about the testimony while ago about Gabby giving her you know she was concerned as to whether or not she's really born again you know she could have looked to all the things there's been a lot of changes I've watched her over the years she and I live to go she could watch me closely hanbyul can and I can watch her very closely and save her progressing and I think she can be you've come a long way you do have the Holy Ghost but I'm not going to spend it away and so you've got it you just sit down now you can just go ahead and sit down and get on Facebook no I'd say keep on going that's not we're not black sheep in it is there any questions about that one comment though sir you might be too young I remember Jim Jones with a good example that's right yeah yeah yeah man let me think on me I forgot very cozy I'll bring that Goulet [Music] so far no good the second humility so the objective on this lesson I'm trying to get through the first few slides of this one it's mostly quotes at the front of this one and then we'll try it on the next lesson to finish the last half of this so the objective is to understand what it means to humble ourselves before the Lord very simple humble the definition having or showing a modest or low estimate of one's own importance second Chronicles 7:14 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land I know other ways to talk about it you know there's an importance about the land you know of Israel or Jerusalem and so forth but you know in our day we could look at that and say well what about our body change you know God is concerned about this lamb about our earth he wants to redeem us by spirit and soul the humble is a Psalm 69 32 the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek God a lot of these things won't tie them to my last lesson - just a just a little bit variation of Isaiah 57 for thus saith the high lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contract which means like penitent horny and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contract ones matthew 18 for whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven Matthew 23:12 and whosoever shall exalt himself should be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted James 4:6 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble James 4:10 humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up 1st Peter 5:5 likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and then Clubman be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble there's really nothing the Lord can do with you when you're proud when you're lifted up in Revelation or not revelation I mean when you're lifted up in your own self and your own ideas and so forth today in the next verse humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time well thank you do Commodus think there's another answer for Gaby because she's waiting on their birth and so but she says she's staying humble before the Lord so that he may exalt her and do time in his season is coming and then we got the Strong's definition for humbled or humility which everyone to abase let me just start you might love to bring low to level reduced to a plane to bring to a humble condition reduce reduce to meaner circumstances to assemble lower rank or place to to a base to be ranked below others who are honored or rewarded to humble or based muscle myself by humble living to lower the press of one's soul bringing down once pride to have a monster peanut oneself to behave in an unassuming manner devoid of all haughtiness three bass cast down home tests down humble of low degree estate lowly and then not rising far from the ground as a condition lowly of low degree brought low with grief depressed lowly in spirit humble and a bass sense supporting one's self object Lee I know there's a lot of definitions but that's just spitballing the next one there are many misconceptions about what it means to be humble humble is often often thought to mean sample or shallow this is calm this common thought may late to slothfulness toward God as was once stated by brother Dan I'm going on memory here okay I think this actually came from sister Peggy you might remember if you said this or not this is a paraphrase but when when she preached there is a difference between simplicity and stupidity anyway there's never explained simplicity and stupidity you know people walk around and hold their head down sign just don't understand all that's just over my head what's not over your head if you just get into my study on the contrary to humble ourselves before God can mean many things but perhaps the best summation of these is to submit our whole life to Jesus Christ as my definition this includes prayer meditation servitude fastings studying listening and many other acts of love and obedience many people may feel that to be humble means that we should not study because we are trying to figure things out on our own like Eve did instead of waiting on God this is a nice conception about humility reading studying and listening to sermons it's not a way of trying to figure things out our own stay in the Word of God is actually necessary for us to in order for God to reveal his word to us it's a part of our reasonable service let's read that they're true I'm a seeker therefore brethren by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind how can you do that much to take on the mind of Christ and how can you do that unless you're in the word so that you may prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will or work of God for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith so thank home bleh of your own self a village meeting some great names if these guys got change the clothes fit Spencer around that's the guy the thing don't we do the right thing ha be right back break it up Vivek you think you're the great person great is his humility forget that I tell you why you do it not dumb I don't think ahead that's real humility Jesus told us how to do it you overcome be overcome to stand the test but Jesus did mr. Alden the enemy is the best everything he was testing him he stood the base of sickness done okay we're pretty close to the time to go upstairs so let's just go ahead there any questions comments [Music]
