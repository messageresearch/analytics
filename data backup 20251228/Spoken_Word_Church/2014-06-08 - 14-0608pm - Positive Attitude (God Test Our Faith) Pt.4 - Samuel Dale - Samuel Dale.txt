========================================

shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we've seen holy holy holy glory holy holy holy amen you want to see him just look right into the word and you'll find him once you amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord we pray to the lord we just be with each one that's not here we know there's a lot missing and everything and brother joe did tell me too that now you can do your live streaming screaming human whatever that word is that they put on there you can do it on your cell phone now all you gotta do is take your cell phone out there's a service right on the cell phone so it's all made into your hands because there's no excuse then for missing the services you ride down the highway put it in turn it on and be able to follow it but you know we appreciate all that amen and uh just remember the announcements now brother bob will be preaching wednesday i pray that the lord would would be with each one you'd like turn in your scripture return to john 6 and we'll try to continue our thought from this morning and go to john 6 beginning in verse 53 heavenly father we thank you lord for thy loving grace and our kindness and thank you for being you that way we can depend on you because you change not so we don't have to worry about it we can just walk in you lord we love you and we thank you for everything we ask you to just bless us and speak to our hearts and our lives that we may lord be led of you to say what would be needful to your people and that we may walk in the light of thy grace forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and just have your way bless those that are not here bless the ones that lord are away everything and be traveling back this week lord and just have your way with each and every one of us and lord open the eyes of our hearts that we may see you in jesus name amen all right john 6 53. now you know the story of this this is coming down and the point i'll get to in a little while while you'll see what i'm reading it reading this that jesus coming down talking about i'm the bread that come down from heaven you know in the different things and then just to save reading we'll drop to verse 53 because you know they had said how can we eat this man's flesh how can we do this or whatever then said jesus unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you who eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last days now remember my point is he will not explain what he's talking about all right all right you get to sit and he doesn't explain what he's talking about see there's a reason for it all right for my flesh it's meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he doesn't eat uf my flesh and drink of my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as a living father hath sent me and i live by the by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum many there are four of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them this this offends you in other words you've got problems over what i've just said let me say something else right what and if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophetess nothing the words i speak to unto you they are spirit in their life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and should betray him and he said therefore and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can give can come unto me except it was were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him don't worry about it he didn't explain it then said jesus unto the dwell will you also go away brother randomly says it's like this said do you wish to go also that's what he said that they were what was actually being said then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that the art that christ the son of the living god now think about what's being said and we believe and are sure that our that christ the son of the living god you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now my whole point of reading that scripture is one thing god loves to test your faith we'll get to that in a little bit he loves to test your faith he loves to test to see whether or not you have the faith and you know it wasn't long after that they doing you know the 70 we know left and then he turns to the 12 and said why don't you go two you know if you want to he didn't explain it he was testing them to see what they would do all right and they said well we believe but then later on in putting more scriptures together and coming up jesus said do you now believe in other words has it come to a place that you could finally believe then he comes to a place that he says when the son of man cometh said will he find faith in the earth you know all right that's coming all the way down to where you and i are at all right coming of the son of man god loves to test our faith but is it testing our faith to see for him to see what we'll do or for us to find out what we'll do did he test job to find out what job would do or to let job through that testing receive strength and doings because only through his testings and and the things that happened did job come to a place that he said i know my redeemer liveth it was not in the beginning it was not in the starting it was when he finally come down to you know appoint something personal to him all right and see god even will give us something right but then he'll test us to see what we think about it he'll show you something in the word he has me but yet not explain it you know not explain it to me but he'd give me a time and give me a point that i could sit down and thinks things out and you know he loves to do that because he knows what we'll do you could say you mean god would would deliberately put something in front of you to try you that's what he says in the scripture there you know the can't come one problem word on i sent it among you what to test you to try you to see if you're staying but you said well well god don't look like that would be right for god remember you're not dealing with an ignorant peanut brain people you know a person you're dealing with god god was here he knew that if he said anything about being the bread they wouldn't understand it he knew if he said what he did about the uh the blood they wouldn't understand it but then you all showed that if he spent 20 years explaining it they still wouldn't understand it it's not god uh doing something to try to trick or whatever he knows whether or not you and i will ever come to the place of having rapturing faith uh you know faith for healing oh he knows he didn't you hear the 70 would walk away he knew the 12 would stay and he knew one of them would be the one that would betray you god loves to test your faith you know you never heard brother brown say that god would speak to him about something he said i'll spend the rest of the day searching through the bible to see whether that was right or not he loves to do that well because that is our child training if he put us in a tube pushed us through the other side he said there's no overcoming to that so he tests you he's going to test the little bride in the end time look down to end of the message to her to worthy he says it he'll prove to satan that this bride won't fall like eve now he loves to test you and i and let us come out of it with faith builder all right now what have we been talking about so if he loves to test us then wouldn't our whole life you know a christian journey uh true justification in the same case and baptism in the holy ghost and coming on up wouldn't he be wouldn't he love to test us all the way through and wouldn't it be something that even when you first come to god that you first repent what happens he turned everybody against you like right in hopes said he said when he got saved said he thought everybody called the life he'd been you know he said i thought everybody would would want to know that i got saved he said i went around the neighborhood telling them he said you know they weren't too happy about it well think about it now then even through our mental faith you know you remember blasphemous names the biggest portion of our faith is mental based upon what the word of god what but it's a mental faith he starts off revealing himself and what happened when you started when you first heard the truth oh that's where people do it when they do it but i'm sorry i just remember too much but you know people say well when i first saw that when i see it i've seen it i've seen it but then you remember well why'd it take me six months to be able to beat it into you you know but see he'll try you you go out to the world and start talking about being a christian they're going to try to get you to go to the honky tonk they're going to try to get you to go smoke a cigarette they're going to try to get you to go drink it they're going to try to get you to do everything and they really become your enemy right he allows that to happen to see whether or not that you will stand for him even with just a mental concept so not only did he allow the world and everything to go against the disciples he seemingly looked like he was going against him himself saying you're going to eat my flesh drink my blood if you don't you won't have no part with me that's something ain't it but see done it to test them and remember now the disciples was in the form of mental faith when he was talking to them all right because they were not born again all right on the message perfect faith i just pulled this out so go ahead brother john put it up 1a when i said i wish you'd listen to that message but look what he's saying now now we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith they didn't have it because they'd had christ walking with them all right but then afterwards christ was in them so you see it's hard then to have perfect faith without the holy spirit it has to bring it the disciples you say your disciple didn't have perfect no they remember the child and they couldn't cast it out he allowed them to come up against a lot of things and then rebuking them for their lack of faith well could it be that you and i could be at that point because remember now this is before they receive the holy ghost but then go into their lives after they receive the holy ghost and look john was the only one that died a natural death all of the rest of the apostles you know the disciples all were killed for what they believed looked like when the holy ghost come he would have just put them apart and when they let nothing touch them look at paul beat four or five times one striped shy of death in the deep and he said in trouble with my own brother gonna let him be tried amen he lets you and i be tried to see let us find out if what we have is genuine now i've always said the reason he puts you here is like in the army if they wanted a tough bunch of groups they didn't pick out the little you know feminist acting charge ups and put them over and they got the roughest toughest meanest hatefulest guy they could get and put him over them told to go beat the daylights out of me make something out of him well that's the way god does here i guess but he sent you here for us to holler and scream enough at but yet it's to test us to see whether or not we'll walk with the truth and then that way it's not somebody walk up to you and say what do you think well brother so-and-so believes this you know he's got seniority in the message you know he walked with the prophet he talked with him the prophet ordained him in the ministry they said the other you well i can sort of go believe him if you don't get nothing else out of the message today get one thing god loves to test you he loves to try you not to find out what you'll do he knows what you'll do he wants you to know what you'll do he wants you to know your limits and your abilities they say they have i've read not too long ago about in the military now they have a group of military elite that can just run for 24 hours a day it's just on the article it was just totally unbelievable the human the things those human beings could do because they were so trained built you know tested put forth but it's like i told you to the way it looks around the country i'd sure hate for us to have to go fight a war that was required now because we'll you know wouldn't be something require these soldiers go out there now when they can't even exist you know tell them to go climb a tree and they couldn't even get up it but listen church my whole point god loves to try us because in the trial we will find out whether or not that our mental faith has become a spiritual revelation because if it stands the test then we'll know right our faith not his if it stands a test when the everybody can be against you and that's what a lot of people don't believe that that there's going to be any form of of persecution for the bride because they say well no you know no god loves us so much he's not going to let things happen well he did before are you something special when he had 68 million killed you know allowed that to happen to see whether or not they would stay with the word and then we think we're going to get by on a flowery bed of ease you better go reading but now think about it it's hard for you and i to comprehend i guess the way or i don't know how to say that i wrote down the best i could it's hard for us to understand the working of god the way he does because we get it figured out and we're dodio granddaddies you know and grandkids they just can't do nothing wrong you know i mean they just they just grandkids get on the bed and jump up and down well i have one of our kids that have done that they wouldn't have been sitting down for a while because they would have been sore but you know i mean that's just the way we are we get old and but do we think that's the way god is remember god don't have no grandchildren amen he has sons and daughters that have been tried and tested and how can you prove what you are if you ain't never had a test that's what i heard the first come into the message well i'll be glad when i can just speak that word i'll just speak that word and just create well i believe a time will come and i believe it's already here about to speak another word right but you got to have some child training to be able to learn how to use it we say we don't put a child driving a car at five years old no you don't even do it at 15. even the law says you gotta ride with them for a year right child training but we don't want child training especially when it's rough right when it's horrible sometimes the situations of life but just remember you got a 20-foot hurdle you got to get over it a reason to get over the 20-foot hurdle you got a 30-foot hurdle coming sometime right horrible things we better be ready all right now with that thought in mind let's think about something we talked about we must we must first have mental faith before it can become a spiritual revelation all right but if we stop on the mental faith before it is revealed what's happened to us we're like i said this morning about disciples that some of them said hey let's take it by faith we'll go well what's the difference in that than any other church any other system any other groups now we have to admit one thing for sure the biggest portion of the religious world system does not have the new birth would you agree with that i didn't mean and it's got no numbers trying to make no people and no but the biggest portion of the religious society does not have the new birth right well then that means the biggest portion of religious society has a mental concept well what's the difference in our mental concept and other people's mental concept we believe in one god what a baptism and there's a lot of churches that preach about one god and preach about water baptism and right what's the difference between us and others do we want to make ourselves some part but what's the difference between us you know as i always say about you know i respect doctors i respect people's authority they went to school but you know what they put their pants on just like i do they're no different they're just human beings that have dedicated their life and i appreciate them for that but they don't make them no different just because you and i say we are message believers does that make us a special class of people or a group does god look at us at any different or does he look at us as to what we stand for in the word how we believe the word and what the word says like i said this morning why is it then as you see people that that they backslide the first thing they do they start cutting their hair wearing pants and men doing this and why the things that the bible says don't do why and then after a while they come back and say i just backflip what you're saying oh you lost you've lost or you wouldn't have done that and god lets those obstacles get in our way you know look at what's happening now around them the message people i mean you think 40 years ago they would have said very much about brother branham being wrong no see now there's a test here to see whether or not you and i will stay with the word even though they have some good uh evidences of a lot of things but are you going to stand on the personal experience or a collective form see do we have a revelation just because we can read now you wouldn't go that way at all would you the ability to read is a revelation that's not a revelation the ability to read anybody can read you know what i mean with the education abilities et cetera they can read all right with november at brother dale we've got the message you don't understand is it because we have the message within our possession does that mean we're born again because i can let you take my bible and just about explain every doctrine in the message by hand written on the side where the prophet explained that does that mean that i'm born again if it is the computer's got ahead of us remember now all churches now listen to my point basically all churches read from the same basis of the word of god some of them have their own written things you know job witness with their own translation etc but it's still word-based all right when the prophet came did he change the letter of the word to say that wasn't correct no he told us it was correct what did you say well look at our the prophet said it was correct and we believe the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a whoa glory big shout there'll be a trumpet sound there'll be this that and the other be angels well that wasn't what he said to start with if we're talking about last night what would it be what did paul see when he said the lord himself shall descend wait and then we're talking about it paul looked down and seen a seventh church age messenger coming with the word of god and said it was the shout that's what he was saying we had that all twisted in every form see the prophet never changed the letter of the word amen he told us the letter of the word was correct but he never told us that because we could now have the correct form of saying the word is right but that meant it was revealed he said we need revelation more than anything he said yeah but you know we have the revealed word where's it at amen what do you mean brother today we have the message we look at all of the twists and the doctrines and the ideas and opinions of the people of this message is the message that confused does it teach two lords two souls sympathetic virtues parousias river jordans did it does it teach those things you know that even the denominations you don't find them as mixed up in the word letter as the people of this message they may differ without the shout or the little time but they'll hang with the same principle or the people of this message you've got to pull it this way that way right do we have spiritual revelation or is it mental faith remember spiritual revelation will hold us mental faith is like brother whitney you say you get them in with a hot dog you can get them out with a hamburger right you can take them from two souls the seventh other verse of the perusal you know two lords and and all you can just move people from one doctrine to another but is the message that confused did he teach that what they say he did you know now think about it how do we know that we have substance faith i know it's kind of sleepy a little bit today so ayahuaya jump up and down scream and holler do something you'll scare the rest of them they'll wake up i understand that but how do you know you have substance faith the two soul people say that the two lords people are wrong the seventh under virtue people says the rest of them's wrong come on you remember what i'm saying you know brother battle says the baptist says the methodist is wrong they all got to be you know well we just moved on up into the little closer you know we just talk about two lords seven thunders instead of saying methodists and baptists and things and we ought to be away from that well by by what standard are thought now you don't get nothing today get this point by what standard thought or whatever you want to call it what is your answer to the question of how do you know whether you have mental faith or spiritual revelation when people with mental faith can walk on coals of fire people with mental faith can levitate tables people with mental faith can bust ice do things that look supernatural by what standard talk or what is it that you put it on we talked about what the prophet said about peter what was the difference in peter when he had the substance and when he didn't have the substance what was the difference in him he first had the substance right he walked on the water he lost his substance kept his confession you remember that over and over been bringing it down what was he doing so he lost his substance faith but he was back to his mental faith because he was at his mental faith when all of them looked and said are you a spook is that this or what is it you know he was in the crowd thinking it was scared and thinking it was much a spook or something out there but then all at once he received something there was a substance that he could walk on but then he lost that substance yet he had his confession all right so the difference in substance faith and mental faith is peter could walk on substance faith are you with me whereas he couldn't walk on mental faith okay is that sensible now that the whole thing we're talking about if you and i let circumstances make us doubt are you listening we let subs if we let circumstances make us doubt then it could be we don't have substance faith and you know what i talk about and how it i am and we're all human you have somebody comes up the doctor says you got cancer what's the first thing my stripes i'm healed you can't tell me i ain't healed i'm healed and they do pretty good for a while until things starts getting worse all right and things starts getting worse you see them gradually losing that great first unction or whatever you want to call it and they begin to well i need to go to the doctor i guess brother brown said it's okay to go to the doctor now didn't he say that you read it this morning it was okay to go doctor and maybe they can take me and find some cure with my case see you've lost your substance but you have your mental faith it's his vice rights i'm healed the circumstances has made us doubt then you can see how it would be easy to go from one doctrine in the message to another doctrine because of the ability to out-argue and i've warned you a long time ago about 40-something years ago i said it then and i still believe it when a move comes among this bride and things starts taking place there's going to be a move in them denominational churches and when it comes into the real bride to move the seventh under virtue people proves his son of man two souls signs and wonders are gonna start happening now what are you gonna do now you've experienced it you know when the they're not named the names dude not because you don't need but you know when the young ones jump up in this message young preachers and they'll get a following oh this is it this is it and after a while it just dwindles down here comes another one well this is it yeah you know that's true you've been around long enough to see all right but what if somebody come along with great signs and wonders what are you going to do what are you going to do if somebody come in here i said i challenge your faith we're going to have a dead person rolling here and god is going to raise them from the dead but i'm going to tell you brother branham's message is wrong and to prove i'm right the dead is going to raise what are you going to do if the dead raises but you better remember one thing too keep it in your mind the devil can't raise the dead so god is going to test the people well it's not that what it says in the scripture or the prophet gave you a sign and it come to pass read your bible see buddy take you to another god says because i done that to try you what are you going to do this is not a play thing it's either life or death now so then you can have a substance faith and then lose it but now i always have to go through to explain myself because people get lost in you you can't have a born-again experience of the baptism of the holy ghost like come on the day of pentecost and lose it yeah so we're not talking about that right that's out of the question that ain't even mentioned they shouldn't even be in your mind because you can't do it you can't be saved today and lost tomorrow now you can be justified as wade was explaining wednesday you can be up part of justification sanctification great follower and miss it and lose it why because you don't have the substance you think you do it looks like you do you act like you do but you don't have it we need somebody to jog us we've been a while now without a new doctrine we need somebody to come along and jog us you think i'm a hateful old dude but i have thought about coming out here and trying to preach something just preach it totally wrong and see how many of you would aim in it and then tell you it's wrong he said well you're not do that i won't have enough trouble trying to keep all the rest of it straight without deliberately doing something remember a brother did years ago though he memorized the tape this happened way back he memorized the tape and he got up and he quoted that tape verbatim and he asked the people whether they believed it or not and it was a verbatim type for brother branham i feel like the old story what you take the constitution out and try to get people to sign it they won't sign it right you know he said well this is the constitution i ain't gonna sign it first of all we don't know what he says what are you following me now we're not talking about having a new birth and losing it because that does not work we're talking about in our journey of justification and sanctification is where the problem is at because in that journey the unclean spirit goes out we get new desires all kind of things are happening we love to go to church we do all of those things and we're still not born again i didn't love to go to church no more the day after i received the holy ghost than i did the day before did you no it didn't work in that way i believe you can repent be baptized follow on i also believe other things i wish i didn't believe uh people will say you need to preach on the new birth you need to preach on justification you need to preach on faith and i start preaching hope and i start laying out it sounds about like his brother he said i can sit for five hours and wailed and wailed and wailed but it wires me out to set an hour in church well that means which one you love the most all right but you know what i mean you know what i love people and don't want to hinder but if you think i ain't right go back to what i said god loves to test you you say with your own mouth i'm going to be in church every service you've just opened up a can of beans that the devil is going to get on your back and you're going to have a good excuse to miss the next service right yeah but when are we going to make that statement and mean it right we want to throw off on the women we want to say that you know you know brother they'll just go on preaching they're gonna do what they're gonna do anyway see there's a difference between mental faith and holy ghost faith the disciples had mental faith and could not heal that child was it something was that disease some disease that was so horrible that they couldn't do remember these fellows had been instrumental in that dead being raised the sick being healed or was it just one time that god said i'm going to let you see you ain't got what you think right and they couldn't cast that demon out of that epileptic child see there's a difference between a mental faith but the prophet said on black feminist names program 143 going through he said when your mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation see when jesus said the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church he was not talking about a mental faith because the gates of hell has already captured mental faith he was speaking of a holy ghost-filled group of people that satan would not be able to stop him a lot of difference in mental faith and a spiritual revelation substance faith does not come first mental faith comes first and then our mental faith when it's quickened becomes a spiritual revelation all right so we need a revelation more than anything what i think is wrong with most people today who follow the message we we ain't out there i'm preaching on the internet they're listening it's up to them i'm preaching lulu we start out like peter with a faith to walk before god at least we start with a positive attitude all right back to our sermon you know a positive attitude comes by accepting the word right you see we start out and we're doing great but one is god's worst enemy sight and time progress 78 demonology excited time god's worst enemy we prayed for it don't happen but yet he's testing us here's what brother brown said he said if you have repented talk about healing you've repented you've confessed everything you've straightened up everything you've done all you know and said you're not healed you know what he said he said god's trying you he said right then is when you need to hold on he's testing you you don't want no group of people when you get down to jordan and the crossing over to be a little cystified he wanted somebody strong to work like in world war ii it was written specimen that sometimes one man would determine whether or not they defeated the enemy you remember the story honor of our swinglord you know how you pronounce it you know this day i die for switzerland and that was used to conquer the big army that was coming see one person so it's not an end not a group of things it's an individual we want to try to get the person next to us straightened out right or we want to do like a condo at that time which is in there but people say brother branham was really saying is your wife worthy the gospel you know when he preached is your life worthy of the gospel see we get the winning straight now we're ready to go yeah we're when it don't come when we first ask for it we first confess it i mean if it don't come inside it's fine do you know when that happens right and you know when little babies are little babies they cry you just run to them right but you know after a while you find out it ain't gonna kill that kid to cry makes his lungs better makes him movable makes him learn to behave but i'm still oh dodie granddaddy i can't stand for him to cry well a terrence can't he'll grab one of them wade king all of us say that away baby cries we get it i know that but listen sight and time and the prophet said that that was where eve failed at that she couldn't wait for god to fulfill his word she had been told that they were going to multiply and replenish right but she couldn't wait now those are quotes that you can read spoken words original seed paragraph 124 125. but why is it that we can't wait on god well yeah we can go down to the doctor's office and wait all day to get to see the doctor to tell us ain't nothing i can do for you or you need to take an aspirin i think i'd help you i want to send them a bill don't you i mean i'd like to send them a bill how much is your services worth well i get 20 i get a hundred dollars we calculate around here i can make about 200 an hour okay i'm not that bad i'll just send you a bill for fifty dollars you know that's true isn't it i mean but you know they're not concerned they just keep piling in patience they don't care if if them walks out the other house gonna pay but we sit there all day long or as i said well for five hours we can't wait on god five minutes right shot and time but you know god loves go to number four which is e39 of jehovah gyra and this is where the thought comes from we had the number four brother and look about it look at what he said number four yep joel jehovah now what if abraham would have took the second thought how am i going to be a father of nations when you're i am this old and you're asking me to kill and destroy the only evidence that i have that you'll keep your word and make me a father of nations and god loves to test his people every child that comes to god must be tested child trained no exceptions ever won and maybe tonight that you're sick just to have a little child training just a little testing don't be discouraged yeah but but i want to be well that's right you're just hindering see god's on the throne he knows all things if we were truly born to the spirit of god everything working together for our good he's going to make everything right he promised he would he swore he would and he's got to keep his keep that word but he's kept it now for oh thousands of years to ever believe her would you be any exception no sir we're no exception now watch him we don't say are you sick for the glory of the lord brother moat had a good point somebody say i i've got a leg off for the glory of the lord he said we'll take the other and i'll make it double glory no you don't want to do that now no the glory that lord the lord gets out of doing is the healing right we're not sick for the glory of the lord it's the healing that brings him glory all right and think about it god loves to test you so he lets you get sick now none of us want to hurt right we're human but see that's where you we want to quote what we want see what if you're sick to be a little child training we failed the test what is they're always saying about when you fail the test you've got to go through it again right all right so then as he's testing us to see what we'll do well brother dale how do i know the difference between testing me and i'm guilty i don't have to explain that right i should not even have to open my mouth to say anything about that you know whether you're guilty or not quit playing games right we want to put it on everything else except ourselves i've tried to explain to you the best that i can just because you got a bad cold doesn't mean the devil's after you it means you're going to live for a while in this world you're going to have a cold sure that's the devil we know that but that's not just do it remember now you see why it's so hard to preach the truth it's easy to preach a lie because you can prop up but you realize that god permits the devil to get on us and you want the quotes from the prophet that he can't get on you unless god permits it come on do we believe all the message yes well you know what that we should be we should say well you know what god taught enough of me to let me be put to a test i should honor him for that instead of being upset with him god what's going wrong what did i do you know what you've done you're trying to prop the thing up i know when i'm guilty of doing things don't you i mean you got to have somebody hold up a sign the women don't cut your hair back to where it was last night and this morning what are you going to go do that prove your loss to start with but you got to sign up i've got to carry sign out here every sunday don't cut your hair don't wear your pants don't paint your face you know whether you're guilty or not of doing these things you don't have to have nobody to tell you you know what you're trying to do is hide it from everybody else right but see god wants to test us he said don't be certain of god that he loves to test your faith you mean god loves to test our faith our revelation or yeah to let us see whether it's real or not if it's real it'll stand the test if it ain't real we're going to lose it right he loves to test it every child we read the scripture every child must be tested and child trained well i thought i was so good that god didn't want i thought i was so s sweet and nice that god he don't have to whip me i just do what he wants me to do you just lied i try to do what i can but there's still a lot of things that i don't try to do and don't do it right so then i'm not in the category i'm in the category that we all have problems as human beings but what about being tried what about god allowing the cankerworm fine worm locust caterpillar to come on that church down to the ages we're just dealing with the human life right you know things going against his people speaking again what about down the dark ages and the time where they were killed and god allowed that to happen to try them 68 million killed by their own records and every one of them was a test in a trial if they were all true born-again believers now i've tried to illustrate it to keep it from being so hard about it what kind of a situation do you think about happening when the catholic priest is standing there with a cross and jesus on it and he walks up before you and he says deny that faith and i look at him and i say the cross says you believe jesus i believe jesus don't you pray to jesus i pray to jesus you understand but when it comes down to the point he says do you believe the pope has the authority to change the word you say no you're contrary to their thoughts you're talking about the same god what faith is he trying to get you to deny the truth of one true and living god and believing it the way they say for you to believe it what's the difference in it you see how it was that some gave in because they knew they were going to face death and what's so horrible he plays in jesus i believe in jesus he believes he was god i believe he was god brother brown said to people in the end time would give in thinking it was better to serve god publicly than to not serve him at all unquote from the church book he said but to believe satan's lie is to serve satan i'm glad to fellowship with anybody no matter what church it is systems or message people i don't think it's a horrible sin to fellowship no but now to me to give up my ideas to fellowship won't work i told him when we started i did with in the fellowship meeting i said when the day comes that a baptist preacher can't come to a fellowship meeting and tell you what he believes i said that day i'll get out of the fellowship meeting he said yeah but he's wrong nobody's got a right but i told him also i said today comes when you try to make me believe your doctrine i will move out because i will not follow your doctrine god has helped us over all of these years to keep them from trying to bring in even preachers to preach their pity little doctrines in their own church it's been real good because i guess they knew i meant what i said you try to make me believe your doctrine i'm going to rebel if your doctrine's not right i'm going to say no and i'm going to move away why because i have to stand for what i believe but i can sit down beside of a two soul seventh under virtue perusing i shake his hand hug his neck call him brother but i can hug the pope's neck call him brother the baptist preacher billy graham anybody i can call him brother that doesn't mean i agree with what they say that means i'm trying to be what i'm supposed to be a christian you follow me but you see he loves to test our faith he loves to do it he knows what we're going to do but we don't know what we're going to do you got to be put to a test to find out it'd be like donnie said i read the book i can build a transmission i can just build that transmission i know every part by name what it looks like all the dimensions of it the guy hands him a transmission he said i'm afraid to touch it well he don't trust what he's got he don't trust what he's got the test is whether or not he can take it apart put it back together right that's the test everybody lies at me and even the neighbor runner said anybody that you can take a trailer and make a house out of it you can do anything he wants to when you get tested sometimes trying to work on things when tony can tell you he's trying to lay his tile on the floor and you're just a quarter of an inch out and at a while it don't look right well it's a test see then after a while you got to learn before you start you find out if it's level if it's a quarter of an inch out you build that quarter of an inch up before you start i got a room at the house that from one side of it it's flat zero and i cut boards to five inches on the other side that's how out of level the porch was it used to be the deck because it allowed water to run off but you couldn't walk through my office you know and sat down in the chair with it so i leveled it up and then put a floor down you can't tell it i can tell you say which way did it lean you wouldn't know but what's my point god loves to try you and i to see whether or not we've got a substance faith or a mental faith if somebody can talk you out of it it's mental it's not substance we're going to get into substance faith when we get a change but remember substance faith don't come first right mental faith comes and then substance faith goes on blasphemy this name he said coming down true he said from your mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation now you got something you stand on you mean after all you've heard about one god that somebody could prove a trinity to you oh come on well they just made it so beautiful huh but it'd be like donnie's sitting there and you already took he's read the book he knows the dimension knows everything he took it apart put it back together and it works and he built ten of them and they work then somebody comes along said i want to improve that i want to show you how to change that well there's things that can be done right but then he turns around and gives you something that won't work you know immediately there's something wrong and you don't want to do it that way that's just the way i am in the gospel this thing has stood for 2 000 years in the faith of the fathers why do we want to go to something else or somebody else's concept especially to these that the concepts they have have no vindication they don't get up and say i'm going to tell you the truth god's going to vindicate it no they will one day and that's where it's going to be worse it is now mental faith can become a spiritual revelation if we believe it right that's my life's talk if we believe it and accept it and walk in it the first basis is where's it at it's in the word sometimes i have to say i believe things because the bible says it all right okay sometimes i say i believe things because the prophet said no that's mentally believing it but i like what oh it brother brother maloney i'm pretty sure it was he had a tp on his bible he that was christian ftp one day i said brother what does that tp mean he said tried and proven well you know we stood here at lula georgia not bragging but just talking playing when all the rest of the world just about it has gone after some form of doctrines and we wound up walking along nowhere to go preach nowhere to go fellowship truly but you know what if i walk by myself i will keep walking that's my point and i want people with me that are not afraid not afraid to be tested i told them brother callie one day i said i'm going to get you into the biggest argument that i've ever got in with anybody and i'm going to back off and get around the corner he said what that's called i want to know what you believe i want him to be put to the test to see whether he believes it or not there must needs to be heresies among you what they that are approved are they that are right will be made manifest hard thing to say but thank god for false doctrine because it makes you think i will remember the day when the two souls was starting in the message they were in the late 60s and how they were dealing with it in the seventh under virtue message and the error and hitting so many home runs and bringing them all home and all of the great tops and shadows i will remember those days that those things were taking place but you know what every one of them made me dig when they were talking about whether you had two souls or not and satan give your soul and god give you a soul and i mean i could quote feist enough that satan can't give you a soul he's not a creator but that wouldn't what anchored it in me it was an argument of quotes on that basis but one day i was thinking about what had been said and a knowledge came to me that the new birth brings christ into you as the person of christ and that that's not a physical stepping into me of of god but that's your soul right and body to body he's a man a brother to me spirit to spirit he's an anointing the help and the god and the comforter the soul the soul then my soul is my theophany after i'm born again and carries me on you know what the thrill to me was when they were talking about how many souls you had no it's a carnal way of saying it i'm sorry but god spoke to me and telling me that he was a soul not that he had one if he had one that was an upgrade of a doctrine but that he was the very heart and soul of almighty i god thank you lord i'm glad them brothers preached that brother come to the church where was that at that time years ago and preached a doctrine and i couldn't figure it out i told you a little bit about it last night and i couldn't bypass that book i just kept going over it and i'd re-read and i'd go back to that book go back to that page i said okay i saw this i got in the car coming home i said brother mo i didn't tell him what i was thinking i said explain this page what is he saying and when he finished it i said no i know god is real he's not just an imagination of your mind as we were talking about last night at the brother remember had to powerpoint years ago and had this great thing and then it moved over here and up here he just had a pulsating of light like things or something that that was just god the great energy well that's what science believes science believes it and can prove that the energy cannot be created nor destroyed that's scientific fact it cannot be created not destroyed it can be moved into ability to use but it can't be created or destroyed within they are seeing god but yet putting it in the wrong terminology god's not a pulsating light or as they got it on the uh the correct me kids what is it the uh ninja turtles or ones of their own they got this guy that's supposed to be the brain you remember there's a great big guy down in the stomach here is a big old brain now i get my cartoons wrong okay there's someone we're saying it's okay that's not god god's not a brain god don't have a soul he is a soul because a soul is a person amen he don't have a person he is the person right the only person amen and he's real see doctrines makes you dig well was jesus not god until the river jordan quote quote see makes you dig and you come find out what happened to him on river jordan when the prophet said on the river jordan is when he become the fullness of the godhead bodily well what was it before then like wade said he gave us a quote on where he would already fullness of the godhead body he was god laying in a cradle god with no teeth why is the prophet saying get on the river jordan see that's where the anointing came for jesus's ministry to put him into the ministry to send him forth that didn't make him the messiah that made him the anointed messiah god with us yes when that anointing comes back in this bride she will be the fullness of the godhead bodily she will be the anointed messiah but like we talked about last night it's hard to explain god because we want to think about something that becomes exhausted to move over to another point it'll finally become exhausted and you know no the more brother moak said we think it's like cutting up an apple you give out to pieces you run out of apple no the more god gives out the more god there is the greater it makes him the more he gives out the more he can expand himself the greater he is what a wonderful understanding of god in his ways what a wonderful substance come on brothers what a wonderful substance that you and i can have yeah but the theologian said so and so okay we'll pay for the theologian huh if he tells me the truth i believe it right but what about it do you have a substance or a mental faith we're going to be tried to see which one it is we're going to be tried by it what do we got right now 260 in a red book anybody have a name remember the bomb will be preaching the lord willing wednesday pray for him the lord would bless and remember now to the brothers that we'll meet just a few minutes downstairs in the white sunday

you and we thank you lord for your love in jesus name do you know god is real do you have a substance or is it what somebody else has convinced you just remember if it's what somebody's convinced you somebody else can convince you different um think about him what he's done for you and i over all these years how he's protected us and brought us to an understanding and even our children it's an amazing thing of what they know about god in his ways is he loves to test us but the test is no good unless somebody can pass it right somebody is somebody's going to stand the test and pass that test somebody's going to walk off this earth without having to die why can't we say we are the one why can't we say this is that is lord jesus we love you we thank you we just ask you to help us to
