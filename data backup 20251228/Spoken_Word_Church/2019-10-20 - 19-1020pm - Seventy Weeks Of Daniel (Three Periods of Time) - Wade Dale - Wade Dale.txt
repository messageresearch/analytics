Christ in the end time that ought to make you happy I was reading some quotes back there a few minutes ago where brother Dale said about the where we don't need manifested sons in the Millennium my brother Branham came upon that in the 50s where they were talking about having no millennium and where we are where we needed divine healing in the millennium and all these things in the millennium and even that brother earned Baxter didn't believe in the millennium I don't know if he turned around and started believing but brother Bramson even brother earned Baxter doesn't believe in the millennium he said well I believe in millennium he said but why do we need healing in the millennium he said we'll be in glorified bodies so we need it now we need to speaking of the word now that's what's gonna get us to the Millennium hey man we're not gonna get to the millennium unless we start unless the words being spoken through the mouth of the endtime bride so you got your Bibles let's turn to Daniel 9 and just review for a moment the six fold purpose and then we will just for a moment not going to get into any days because we need kind of a couple of consecutive Sundays and we're

greatest miracle is to love you Lord we thank you for that probably give us this day our daily bread be with each one Lord in Jesus name Amen today we're going to speak just for a moment on three periods of time but we're going to get to that in just a minute Daniel 9:24 seventy weeks are determined upon thy city upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do what six things we've been talking about to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity bringing everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now that's all of Daniels seventy weeks that's it that's it that's it in a nutshell that's what we've been talking about for you know five services that is the seventy weeks of Daniel seventy weeks are determined upon the people in the city to do these six things to get us into the Millennium alright but now we God thought so much of us and Daniel he sent Gabriel to tell us how it was gonna happen so know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore in two weeks the street shall be built again in the wall even in troublous times and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and to the end unto the end of the war desolations are determined verse 27 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word we're going to go back over I erased all this off so I hope you remember what I wrote down but we're going to we're going to kind of break it down just a little bit more and if it's if you have any questions feel free to ask but don't ask about something we fixing to talk about asking buy something we already talked about because we're fixing to get into the days and the times with everybody have the chart with them today the big chart the one that brother branham everybody got it close by where you can see it I keep one in my Bible all the time that's this one this chart here the one that gave everybody this is the one that brother Branham drew on the 70th week of Daniel that's the chart he drew like I said before we showed this to brother George Smith and he said that is definitely Rebecca did this she took it off of the chalkboard and put it on this piece of paper for brother Branham so this is that's not hearsay that's not what somebody else drew this is exactly what brother Branham drew on the day he preached the 70th week of Daniel which was the last of the three-part series the first one was Gabriel's instructions then the six fold purpose and then the 70th week so if you would let's read the I like to read that in second chronicles because what it does it gives you an idea that God has already spoke to somebody about what's going to happen so let's go to 2nd chronicles 36 so therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young men are made an old man or him that stoop for age he gave them all into his hand now remember this is back in the history just for a minute remember Israel turned God down started worshipping idols started throwing their kids in the fire them the mole out they just did all kind of they did they did nothing God said to do and everything he said not to do so God had to divorce him and put him away couldn't forget him though but he divorced them and put him away they lost a position in God and all the best of the house of God great and small in the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the King and all of his princes and all these he brought to Babylon and they burnt the house of God and break down the wall of Jerusalem because remember the walls got to be built back according to Daniel 9:25 and all these and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof and then they had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the king of Persia because we're going to talk next time we speak we're going to go back to where Cyrus is going to give us because remember Israel couldn't do anything because they were under the reign of the kings they were under Nebuchadnezzar then they were under his son Belshazzar and then they were under these different ones but when it comes to the king of Persia or the Chaldees you see Cyrus and Cyrus is the one that's going to actually give them a proclamation to be able to build everything back so we'll see that later not right now but this is kind of what he's talking about and then he carried away the sortie to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her Sabbath's where as long as she laid desolate she kept Sabbath to fulfil in other words 70 years God was going to make sure that 70 years through Jeremiah and during that time it was the captivity that Daniel got caught up in and remember when Daniel is writing this the Book of Daniel was written Daniel was not in Jerusalem all right the the goings on and the happenings was what happened inside that captivity but Daniel said okay Lord I've got I know I've been here sixty-eight years I got two more years left what are you what's going to happen same way with us what's going to happen Lord so God sent us a prophet he sends Gabriel to Daniel to show him what's going to happen all the way to the Millennium not just what's going to happen when they get out of captivity because when they got our captivity things happen that God said was going to happen but God showed him all the way till now right now at this time we're we're talking about now all the way into the great millennial reign because that's what the Jews are looking for see the Jews are not promised in new city Jews are not promised in new city that's the price we're promised a new city because we're the bride but they are promised a time they're promised of time that they're going to rest for a thousand years they're going to have a thousand years where Jesus Christ is going to rule and reign on the throne as the son of David to fulfill Scripture judging and ruling the twelve tribes of Israel which twelve times 12 is 144 that's going to be a hundred and twelve thousand from each tribe that's 144,000 it's going to be in that millennium that's why I'm telling you this you got to have the people and the city the people and the city you can't just put the people in you got to get the city bill you got to get the you got to get the they built it up here we'll see that in just a second we run through it real quick and then what they're done is is there gonna be a millenium that they're gonna build a Millennial temple and they're gonna live in the Millennial tent well they're gonna live in a thousand years they're gonna build houses but it's going to be a central thing called a temple that the Ezekiel 40 through 44 is the Millennial temple that God said Israel was going to build and that the prophet of God many many times we've read it several times before that they are going to build that city and the anointing to the city we'll see in just a minute as we'll read it again is going to be when Christ comes out back in Revelations 19 21 and he's not coming back alone he's coming back with a bride and the bride the bride will be the anointing to the temple all right so that's something that you and I got to look forward to is that we're gonna sit there with him it's not going to be him just sitting there by self he's gonna have a bride sitting there beside of him to rule and reign for a thousand years and like I said before you and I have you and I virtually have zero scripture to fulfill during that time our script is fulfilled in in and when we go in the rapture I mean what you say well what do we got well we got all we got some new CD coming that Scripture and you know what we don't fulfill that God's all right brother branham according to the future home he's already got it built for us it's just gonna come down out of heaven by your desire so you've already built it you're sitting here in it today you have your own house right there that's the house God wanted you to live in amen because John saw the city coming down as it looked like a what a bride adorned for a husband all right so that's what we've got to look forward to so we've Ezekiel 42 44 and and you know I was thinking this morning when brother Dale was time about the law the law is never done away with if you do the way with the law then you got to take the Old Testament and throw it out so Ezekiel goes throw it out with it so there's no Millennial temple announced if you throw it all that out that all comes down listen Moses is going to be there now all the different ones they we're not gonna do away with it but we are going to be able maybe to explain to them what they tried to explain without the baptism of the holy ghost in their soul they would have an anointing come on him and Isaiah would preach 66 books of the Bible but now I don't think he understood it all he was just prophesying he was he was writing down what he saw now listen you and I are living what they saw we're not we're not prophesying anymore as we were talking this morning in the Sunday School class we're not we're not prophesying anymore where we're living the actual prophesy amen because if we if we prophesied that something else is coming then you and I pass away and let that come up you got that if we're prophesying all there's a group that groups here we are that group we are the prophesy brother Brown said we are a prophetic group of people we have prophetic insight that means that God can speak to us in a way that he's never spoke to anybody else and you and I can understand more than anybody has ever been able to understand on the face of this earth everybody got that right now today we can understand more even more than the Apostle Paul oh you get quiet Paul didn't know a thing about a seal Paul died before the seals were even talked about but he but when we refer to the seals we refer back to what Paul said see so he was prophesying about something he didn't even see now he said I could look through a glass darkly what reason I'm saying this Daniel Daniel was sitting there wanting to know what was going on in two years Gabriel give him the whole thing to the to the Millennium but now he didn't draw him a chart because he tells Daniel in Daniel 12 he says Daniel Daniel ass I like Daniel because he asked a lot of questions he said when do these things be in the and the angel told him said Daniel it's not for you you need to go on as you are that sound familiar brother Branham on this illness questions and answers on the sales he said it's not for you it's gone from you in other words it's sealed up to the time of the end fifty years later has to be opened up to a group of people Daniel it's going to be sealed up until the time of the end where you're going to just go stand with your people and then I'm gonna come on the day of Pentecost and I'm going to enter into a group of people then we're gonna live through 2,000 years of church ages I'm gonna send a prophet in the very last one and his his name's Elijah he's gonna have the spirit of Elijah Daniel didn't know much about Elijah but he's going to the spirit of Elijah and he's going tell all this you saw Daniel all the way through he's going to tell you about the the kingdoms and all these different things that's coming to pass and then he's going to take and he's gonna put it up on a board and he's going to show the whole all the way to the consummation this prophet in the end time he's going to draw this chart and he's going to show exactly what's gonna happen but Daniel you just hang on in the Millennium somebody be able to explain him so don't worry about Daniel in other words listen it wasn't for him he'd gone from him he knew the visions and that's what I'm telling you now Lee the people that live in there as I read that quote during the seals you know there's you got a box and our boxes our boxes stood to take the forward the full word was with no discrepancy the full word with you say can you preach a perfect word well Jesus did didn't he and he was the word the Word was made flesh now the words been made fleshing in different Jesus same Jesus Paul said behind the mind of Christ and to have the mind of Christ as the things think the thoughts of Christ and as you think the thoughts of Christ that brings what Christ in you the hope of glory and Christ if you'll let him if you'll lean toward him and not your own understanding you'll let him talk through you and you know what it'll be the same perfect word he spoke 2,000 years ago it'll have to be if it's the same Jesus now if it's a different one and man connects their ideas to it then it's a little bit different that's what's been happening with this 70 weeks of Daniel man has stuck their ideas in it all the way down through the ages and then brother Branham comes up and we're not going to read it today but I'm compiling the quotes in the 70 weeks of Daniel how positive he was thus that the Lord this has got to be done we've got to do this you've got to take this chart and write it down and copy it down and and study it you know he wasn't worried just a trunk a diner 70 weeks we'll just go through that because it's in the Bible no there was a purpose because without understanding the the great secret of Daniel 7 to ition our gonna understand the seals so and that's according to what he said not what I said all right so if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you can't understand the seals and you can't take a body change just wet is so maybe by the Lord's help we'll try to get this to where you can understand I know we've got new ones that's come in later you know but brother Dale has been preaching this since 1974 so it's it's just about I don't think you can ever wear the Word of God out but you can go over it so many times you think man I hope they get it this time and of course that's a schoolteacher and I'll tell you you know you you keep on and keep on you keep on and then you got to keep on then you got just keep holding these got to keep on we don't want to leave nobody behind we want everybody I want everybody why in the world would you as a Christian would want to say well that person ain't gonna make it now grab a bottle ahead and pull them up take them with you get them to get them to believe the same words you believe that to me that's having faith in the Word of God alright let's read the first the first quote we we shouldn't be too much too much today Lewis gave us a little extra time I don't count that time now before between two and three that he gave to 2:00 and 2:30 if he'd given me 10 minutes and we ain't counting that it's supposed to be 2:30 okay so anyway nobody agreed with that saying man yeah ah you heard what I said I thought I'd get a much amen all right the six fold purpose now what brother bran tell us seventy weeks are determined upon by people for what purpose for what whose people was it determined upon Daniel's people the Jew so this is to the Jews alone it what was it determined for upon not only Daniel but upon Daniel's holy city and as I said 15 times before this covers the people and the dwelling the people in the city the people in city if you don't get if you leave one out then you won't be able to understand the damage 70 weeks you got to take the people and the city because to us look to us the only city that's important is the future home alright well that's worth head down that's way down the road but to the Jews they want that temple hey listen they are today this day today trying to get that temple built the natural Orthodox Jews they don't believe Jesus came yet the Messiah they said you don't say Jesus but the Messiah came yet and they're trying to get these pieces together so that they can get the Messiah here they know he's supposed to come but remember they mixed him when he came but when he comes back through two prophets to the hundred forty four thousand they're gonna see that same Jesus and know that they had they're the ones that put him on the cross so this is to Daniel's people and the city everybody got that say man what is Daniel city Jerusalem so it's got to happen around Jerusalem it's what's gonna go on now alright number two real quick now now I want you to know friends striking on these things I'll certainly leave out weeks of teaching the kind of hitting this to the weather cools off later we get to the seven seals by all trumpets all these things I can refer back and say do you remember on the seventy weeks of Daniel do you remember the church ages when it went up and what taking place look and the seventy and what seventy weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church that space when it covers now not all seventy weeks of Daniel part of it talking about the redemption of the six fold purpose because remember that's the title of the for the quote comes from he's in the six fold purpose alright seventy weeks are determined now there was a six fold purpose to his visit telling him what was going to come to pass now there was a six fold purpose of its coming because remember he he he Christ at the end of the six fold purpose who shows up Christ in the bride all right now tonight I think leave off Scripture and let's going down to the red and seventy weeks are determined upon my people now remember that is all that the journey of Israel will have on this earth they are determined seventy weeks is just determined all right now seventy weeks is how long we'll go write it right here 490 years does everybody know how we got that seventy times seven if it's 70 weeks and one week equals seven years seventy times seven is 490 years to redeem Israel everybody got that same man that would be seventy times seven one week equals seven years now we've already established that right all right because that's going to be important here in just a minute we're gonna get our our three time periods and then we'll then we'll stop now look they are determined just determined seven two weeks is just determined that's all that's lauded to the Jews upon thy people and upon thy holy city therefore this seventy weeks now don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem until there'll be a new city built so whatever the six-four purpose is will be the redemption of the Jews until the new city is built everybody got that pretty plain all right revelations 11:1 says there was given to me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not to see there's your building there's your temple but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months now how long is forty two months three and a half years are twelve hundred and sixty days and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred threescore days clothed in Clau now we're going to have to bring something else in here want you to remember that we are not talking from this point forward we are not talking about our calendar our calendar is 365 and 1/4 day called a Julian calendar because of Emperor Julian decided well what happened was real quick the reason we have quarter days the reason we do it the way you do it when they started way back when and brother Dale explained this a long time ago and I'll just kind of cover over you can look it up google it it's got to be right yeah I know but what happened was is they kept by the moon so it just kept going back into whatever century it was BC or ad or somewhere in there close what happened was this spring wasn't in April anymore it had begin losing or gaining so many days until spring was like in July or December so they set it back like so many years or so many months they did away with it and started it back said ok 365 and a quarter days because the earth is wobbling all you kids know that the earth is tilted to one side so many degrees and it's wobbles so it doesn't hit exactly on the what it's supposed to be a 360 days ok so that's the old Julian calendar but what we're going to talk about from now on will be will be brother branham called it a prophetic calendar of 360 days to a year they got that same in 30 days to a month now he's gonna I want to read that he's gonna hit it in just a minute but I'm gonna get you get ahead of a little bit because remember moon cycles your sisters know about cycles 28 to 30 day cycles you everybody got that so even brother Branson nature tells us that there's 30 days not 31 30-knot 28 or 29 like man saying but if you use the 360-day calendar that's why the bible says here they will prophesy 1003 score a thousand two hundred and threescore days which is twelve hundred and sixty days well now 1260 days is not three and a half years of our calendar but the Bible says that'll be four time times and the dividing of times that's three and a half so but three you take three and a half years 42 months according to the 30-day calendar and 1260 days it hits that exactly and even when we bring the dates in that's why everybody had it off they were using regular calendar days 365 and a quarter days well everything we're going to talk about now in Daniel 70 wheats comes from the prophetic calendar of 360 days to a year alright and I believe this is what I believe this is just my belief I think brother Branham made one comment and I've been looking at it for it because what happened was is when did it tilt it tilted at the flood and brother Brown said something a comment could have happened there in the flood you know you it wasn't 40 days of rain that's for sure 40 days rain didn't Phyllis world up the Bible says the Fountains of the deep opened up and you can see now where even brother Branham explains you know that's why the polar ice caps are in or in each pole because the gravity pulls them toward each pole all right there's no telling what's up there under these glaciers when they start melting they there's got to be civilizations and people and everything else because after the flood I believe that for it drew it out well what God's going to do is is this next atomic Armageddon I believe is gonna set it back up because no millennium it's not gonna be a thousand years of 365 and a quarter days we're going right back to this right here because it still is a day I mean you got time in the millennium now this is going to go away at the future home amen but it's not going to millennium we're gonna live 1,000 year millennium according to 360 days not 365 and a quarter okay but as we do that you got to bring the earth back up right to have that so that's just my thought is the man I believe is one that knocked it out of cater and man ones gonna put it back up you know so alright everybody got that then we've got four hundred ninety years seventy times seven one week equal seven years and then three hundred and sixty days are two a year there year the year that we'll talk about that on the Daniel seventy weeks everybody got that same an all right three hundred sixty days so don't get confused and try to figure it out with three hundred sixty five and a quarter and brother Brown explains that we'll bring it in but I'm just gonna try to hit the hit the highlights because we're not gonna be here next Sunday if we give you time to either forget everything I just said or give you time to study a little bit what I just say we is one either way all right so let's look here at the we know what happened in this in the six full purpose we've been through it five different services that there were six things that God was going to do to bring back Israel and bring back the cities everybody got that same am alright so we're going then where we're going we know for sure that when these two witnesses when they prophesy they are going to preach salvation to those 144,000 so those 144,000 are going to be redeemed they're going to be justified sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost amen they're going to be 144,000 Holy Ghost filled individuals and they are going to do whatever they do for that three and a half year time under justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost through those two prophets now there's not anything else to come there's not another message to prophets for 1260 days everybody got that amen everybody's got that 1260 days that's that's the time determined to get the people ready everybody got that time and the people ready not the city the people alright so the three things that happen if you pull them up one is to finish the transgression two is to make an end of sins three is to make reconciliation for a nickel now that is for the people because you don't save houses people get saved houses don't get saved people get saved the the temple didn't transgress and temple didn't have sins and the temple didn't have iniquity so that's got to be the people that were in there all right those people are the ones that transgressed now God had to hook he hooks the temple in because he's told them he even told him he said hey if you're in trouble look toward the temple and pray and I'll meet your need what did Jonah do I was reading it yesterday a couple days ago Jonah in the belly of the whale by spiritual revelation because he was in a dark place he turned and he remembered what they said to do he turned toward the city and prayed and then what happened the thing puked him out on the on the on the beach and he went in and preach salvation to Nineveh and the whole city got safe alright but he turned toward that so that's God said okay now bride bride you have no continuing City you have no certain place brother Brown said we don't have a certain day we don't have a certain temple we got to go to you are the temple but they have a certain temple because you can't take away all that God said about the temple in the Old Testament why do you think they're trying to build that temple for because they want to what restore they know that the restoration of Jerusalem in part has to happen with that temple that temples got to be in place all right there may okay with that so finish the transgression make an end of sin make reconciliation for iniquity for the people all right now let's read number three real quick because what's going to happen is is remember as we were talking last week a couple weeks ago Wednesday night about the Battle of Armageddon that Battle of Armageddon takes place in the midst of that last week and we'll put it back up on the chart in a minute go right here victory day we've had many great battle spiritual battle with many great be days the churches had I mean the church the body of Christ I'm not talking about the organization I'm talking about the body of Christ the body of believers down through the ages has had many victory day or be days we talked about we've had several you wars the wars and rumors of wars and be days and be days and be days it finally winds up into the great battle of Armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to the Battle of Armageddon that'll settle the whole thing just before the great millennium our mageddon is to clean off the earth now remember we're at word we just got three of the six fold finish finish the transgression make an end of sin mate reconciliation for iniquity we still got three more to go and you can't bring them in before the Battle of Armageddon how can you do that you can't how you gonna bring you in everlasting righteousness and then blow the whole world up all right if I okay with that we're gonna go Bible Bible just before the great millennium Armageddon is to clean off the earth shiri purifies herself with this atomic blowing so it's going to be in a calming battle and the volcanic ash and thing sinks this soap blood of men and upon the earth and sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth the volcanic Braves out again and renews and cleans the earth for the great millennium he cleans his church during that time for a people to live here alright there's coming the time that'll be great so at the Battle of Armageddon it's a not a spiritual battle this is physical men blowing each other up godless men there's nobody here with the new birth there's nobody here in the bride there's nobody here 144,000 there's nobody here that is of God nobody and that's why that this is not just a small piece of a tribulation that was that's what's gonna happen when we leave Jacob's trouble or a small part of the battle before the Battle of Armageddon but the Battle of Armageddon is going to be a godless battle it's going to be a battle that well there's never been a battle since and there's never gonna be about laughter words all right because the next by the next great battle I read it to you last week the next great battle is a battle of Gog and Magog which is way over here on the other end of the millennium and that's God's fire that's God blowing up sold battle Armageddon doesn't kill a soul it just killed people human people the soul goes down into the fifth dimension and it has to lay there because the Bible says woe to them that don't receive in other words don't receive the the word of God because they have to go and live a thousand years or you know they're in that dimension for a thousand years and have to come up in the resurrection over here alright so the Battle of Armageddon is one battle the Battle of Gog and Magog is another battle two totally separate battles all right number four questions and answers the church age ending and has blacked out the bride is called we have already entered in Tribulation Period now that's a question somebody asked no no no I wish that I could just have more time on that the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease Laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes to glory the Tribulation Period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years or 1260 days while Israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation excuse me then tribulation sets in upon Israel why because after the 1260 days the two prophets are killed in 144,000 are being killed right all right and then comes the Battle of Armageddon which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennial reign millennium reign after that comes the white throne after that comes a new heaven yes we're over here and the new city coming down from God out of heaven eternity in time blends together but you got to remember we've still got three more because that six fold purpose has got to be inside them 490 years amen seventy times seven seventy weeks of Daniel finishes all these things and then according to Bible that's 490 years it's gonna take 490 years for that to happen now we're gonna get into dates like I said the next time we talk about it but today I just want to make sure we know 490 years is seventy times seven one week equals seven years and 360 days to a year is our prophetic calendar that we're going to use now let's go we got to look and see number four five and six before is to bring in everlasting righteousness now how it like I said in the order they're in how are you going to you can't do that outside of the seventy weeks of Daniel it's got to be inside of the 490 years amen got to be inside of 490 years but now remember the Battle of Armageddon happens in the midst of the week then there's three other things that's got to happen to bring in everlasting righteousness why after all this has been wiped off after all the Armageddon every everything's been wiped off God brings in everlasting righteousness seals up the vision and prophecy puts it in a hundred forty-four thousand because they've got a vision and a prophecy to fulfil because they got to come back and build a temple and then to anoint the most holy now let's see what brother Branham says about this I didn't read this the other day but what's this number five this is in the 70th week of Daniel the prophet of God tells us that now the six fold purpose and we find out that on this sixth purpose to anoint the most holy we find out that most holy always represented the church the tabernacle and the last thing was to be done was to anoint the most holy that's the Millennial tabernacle that he'll live in during the millennial that will live in that will live in who's will we always him and us yeah we will left it who's the we will it's us were the we will that we will live in brother Branham just shortened it like we do like most of our southerners we take a lot of eyes and ease and ours and all that we add a few letters and we have warm urn and supper and dinner and all that other stuff so brother Brown said we'll live in that Millennial temple now so can that happen before the Battle of Armageddon can't so there's three full purpose over here for the people and then the Battle of Armageddon is going to destroy everything and then a new temple is gonna be built inside that 490 years all right not four hundred and eighty four hundred and eighty nine four hundred eighty six and a half as most people believe but four hundred ninety years from the time this begins until that millennial temple is to be built it's gonna take 490 years now we're gonna get into the dates later on but now let's go through these three periods if you have your chart you can read it but I'm gonna fix them to draw another one right here so let's read this again three periods of time so this time 490 years this time all right so dang let's go to Daniel 9:27 how'd that get shifted over a little bit all right seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy all right so that's all that's all gonna happen all right here's what we're gonna focus on right now know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build jerusalem until Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks now that's gonna be our starting point it's got to start somewhere there is something given there's an there's an edict given that we're gonna look at the different dates and we're gonna see when it started we know when it ends I'm gonna put this already over here we know when this ends until there's 490 years between right here and right here right seventy times seven 490 years something's gotta happen in between that time to bring Israel and to bring these prophecies to pass and to bring a new city because here's the millennium alright and here's here's revelations 1921 now brother Evans already said - I read it to you in the sixth full purpose revelations 19 this when the bride comes back into millennium into that temple that we just talked about everybody got that same an all right so know therefore and understand that from the going forth of commandment to restore build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks right everybody got that that's seven weeks now what's 7 times 7 49 years first period and threescore and two weeks that's another period which would be threescore will be 62 that right 62 weeks if I got that say man that'd be 62 a rest read it again know therefore and understand that from the going forth of commandment to restore and build jerusalem unto messiah the prince shall be seven weeks we got that and threescore in two weeks alright the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous time and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off so right here's Calvary if you look on your sheet of paper brother branham and put a cross right there go that's where he was cut off now you got to remember that this time period is not added this is Gentiles this is the church ages has nothing to do like I said before if Israel had not of rejected Christ you would have had three periods that it would have fitted right here okay but moot point didn't happen that way so this is the church ages this is the bride everybody got that say man Jesus Christ came right here this is Calvary it says read it one more time know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto them aside the prince whose Messiah the Prince Jesus Christ shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks everybody got that alright the street shall be built again the wall even in troublous times everybody got that and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself who was he cut off for us will as in that last quote he was cut out four wheel we're the bride he was cut off for us now sure he was cut off for Jerusalem too but he was cut off so that we this is the wild olive tree to olive branch that was grafted in right here everybody got that all right so that's one period two periods this is not a period this we're not included remember we're not included in this and then you've got number three we're reading right here just a second right here everybody good make sure I got this right no I forgot one so this is 434 years I forgot it sorry so now 434 and 49 is what 483 years in my mouth right if Deana was here she'd say yes now we got to get 490 there's 483 to Calvary don't you explain to me how there's only three and a half years left after the rapture 483 years plus three and a half its 486 and a half that's not 490 so the Bible's right there's one week left after the rapture sixty-two and seven is 69 and one mate seventy that's just as plain as plain can be everybody got that all right and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary now who was that that was Titus there was an overlap a little bitty piece come in here to AD 70 why did he do that he had to tear that temple down member it was here when Jesus was here temple was still there they were doing you know he ran him out of the temple but in AD 70 Titus had to destroy it it's never been rebuilt right man's gonna try to build it right here but the real ones gonna be built right here because it's Daniel and thy people the people and the city yeah I got that the people are gonna be redeemed by the two prophets and the city's gonna be rebuilt for us to enter into the millenniums everybody got that all right now watch and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city when Titus came in 80 70 if you'll google it look at that there was a what was it um Bob was here he tell you there's a mural in Rome and you can see Titus walking out Jerusalem you can see the temple burning and one soldiers got the menorah one soldiers got this the other soldiers got so all the equipment for the temple is in Rome they've got it now that's why that covenant is going to be made right here when we get out of here the Pope is gonna say hey got your stuff if you want to finish this let's talk about a covenant see it's so plain to us we can see all right now look says after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people the Prince come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end there with the flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant that's number three you've got one seven week period of sixty two week period and then he shall confirm the covenant who is he he is the Antichrist the only way he can have a covenant and him come into power is for us to be gone so the Gentile church age we go into rapture right there he makes a covenant with many for what one week so now you got 62 and seven and 69 and one meet one wakes one week make seventy seventy times seven is 490 years 483 years are already accomplished you can't count any time in here remember times no longer for us but you got to come back for three and a half years of Jesus's ministry and then you got another part here this will be for the people this will be for the city to be rebuilt everybody okay with that go this is the Battle of Armageddon right here proved on your chart and proved by proved by after the 1260 days we read it in the scripture and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease told you what he's gonna do he's gonna walk in and say I'm God and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation now what is the consummation the consummation is that last part of that of the four to fulfil - 490 years because here's the consummation the consummation brother Branham said was the Millennium alright that's the consummation now even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon a desolate there's a desolation gonna happen right here that's the Battle of Armageddon then you've got to bring in everlasting righteousness self the vision prophecy in order to hope most holy you got one two three four five six that's why I said if you'll get to six fold purpose which only happens right here but you got to set it up by all these this temples got to be destroyed the people have got to turn Jesus down so they can be saved listen they're God's people back this way until they reject him they're his people when they built the temple it was built by it was built by the Jews that believed that Messiah was coming but then they didn't believe he was here they think he's coming over here you know why because God blinded them for that two thousand years to bring them back in so now let's read in number six now now let's outline Daniels 70 of weeks now I might repeat here again ministers of the gospel if you disagree with this all right they are divided into three periods as we find out in Daniel 9 three periods first a seven week period then a threescore and two which is 62 and then a one week period they're divided into three different periods there's no half weeks in there okay now I've got it divided here on the board it's the charts were looking at if you got the chart with you the first period second period now watch this look how positive he is now watch this is by no means of my way in Brenham but he this is what he's doing he said right here watch the first period he's pointing the first period the second period and to my understanding by the gospel by the Holy Spirit that the end time at the end time God returns again to the Jews so he's pointing right here if I got that say man now we know by all the Gospels that Paul taught and the others that God will return again to the Jews well then if he's going to return again to the Jews how can we apply it back in Daniels time we've got to apply it in this last stage and it's after the Gentile Church has been gone because he deals with Israel as a nation we as individuals he's that he's at this part right here he's at this part in this quote he's at this part right here all right let's read number 7 this is just to let you know that you know we talked about Google I just have to do a search we got a we got a message Google it's called the table amen and it's always right so watch you just gotta get your wording right we know now that each week meant seven years have you got it let's say it together one week equals seven years now we know we got it one week equals seven years here we are right here the first week brother Graham steps to the blackboard 49 years to rebuild the temple he's standing right here right now this top line here represents the Jewish nation as it goes you talk about this line right here right the Jewish nation as it goes across this is just timing when it drops down here it drops out of the Jewish nation into the Gentile time right here there's no line on your chart it's just this part of the seven churches everybody got that then goes up again and catches Israel this line right here because it should be a straight line if they hadn't have done what they'd done it had just been a straight line across all right actually there's no way it could have happen because they would have accept him here accepted him here and they went in a rapture they would've been none of this falling because they wouldn't fell if they would but see since they turned him down they fell and had to be restored and city fell and had to be restored is that okay all right let's go to number eight this is kind of a long quote but just 20 after that we're good now we got three different calendars here we are going by reading the calendar we go back to the old astronomy calendar when we find out that in the Julian calendar there's 365 and a quarter days in the year they timed that by the passing of Sardis and the different stars and so forth they timed it now we find in the Roman calendar that we live under now 365 days in the year by the calendar but in the Christian or prophetic calendar we find there's only 360 days in a year now you might wonder how this confusion came about now this is I can only say as myself speaking I believe that back before the antediluvian destruction back in the days of Jobin 4 so forth that they kept the time by the stars now he marks it the flood antediluvian flood that's the answer delivering flood right before the flood they kept it by the Stars and will understand or back before that time that the world stood upright and then in the sin of man the overflow of the world what's he talking about talk about the flood before the flood and the sin of man the over for the world and it tilted and the floods came therefore we have the great ice glaciers and so forth see I wasn't just I had a quote to back it up we have the great ice glaciers and so forth and all the top and bottom of the earth is full of ice it wasn't before because it stood straight up now it tilts away from the Sun but we're hidden we're hitting now where we're tilting away cuz this wintertime Sun didn't move we moved you know we tilted we wobbled that shook it wait a minute top of the earth is ice and bottom the earth life we know that and the earth does not sit straight up it's tilted that shook it out from where the moon and the stars were they were looking at and misplaced then or you could not keep time by it anymore because it's sitting lopsided that's what I said they let it go they let the calendar go for several years and it happened to be that April was had begin to be the middle of wintertime or something they got way off because see they go by spring April is the first day of the Jewish calendar first month of the Jewish calendar so everything is hens don't April all right or the spring time because they're sitting lopsided sitting tilted back therefore it would not hit them stars at the same time because it's out of cater to them stars you understand I believe that's what it is all right keep going it's laying back they slam back in that condition and that only shows that this is just a period of time can't you see God don't have things out of cater he's just letting it run like that for a little time and I truly believe that that thing was done and at this last day is when God is going to reveal the secrets to the church in other words tell us to use 360 days it doesn't matter how much is open the calendars 365 and a quarter use 360 days he hasn't done it before and the reason he hasn't done it is to keep the church watching in other words he hasn't revealed this till now keep the church watching and praying all the time not knowing when it's coming but you remember in Daniel 12 he said the wise shall understand in the last in this last day it's been given to him the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day we're living in just the same as Gabriel come to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last day to reveal these great deep secret things do you understand now now what would knock out that as astronomic astronomy year are the julian year calendar the masonic year i've never heard of that one but because the worlds tilted we all know that from studying school and it's out of cater therefore they then stars wouldn't pass the line of the earth at the same time therefore the Roman calendar is wrong too because you cannot put together the days there's just many things that I could say right here that we find out by even nature's most elemental sisters and all the different things itself teaches us that there's only 30 days exactly now he'd meant he said year but you know he didn't mean year they ain't never been 30 days in a year it was 30 days in a month now let's take revelations where we're going to have to go over here in the days of the two prophets the Bible said they prophesied one thousand two hundred and threescore days now we take the astronomy calendar it sure wouldn't miss it a long way from being 3 and 1/2 years and we take the Roman calendar that we have today it would miss it a long way but you take the prophetic calendar and there's exactly one thousand two hundred and threescore days in 30 days to the month everybody got that that's why we're going to every everything that we're going to look at from this point back it's 360 days to the year all right so you got three periods you've got one period that's what seven weeks 62 weeks make 69 and then one week period right here is everybody got that same m3 brother Brown said three distinct periods now there's no half weeks in any of this everybody got that show it to me right now somebody show it to me there's not one it's a one week a sixty two week and in one week added up that makes seventy are 490 years 483 years have already passed according to the Bible according to the prophets message and there's one week left after we leave to finish now listen to me to finish Daniel 70 weeks not to finish 1260 days of the Prophet sign that's different that's inside it but it's different because the Bible says there's one week left after the treaty has been made everybody good with that just telling you what the Bible says all right so now let's go to number nine let's read this and then we'll be done the 70th week of Daniel this would be when he's preaching the 70th week of Daniel now we are told from the going forth of the commandment now here's where trouble now we're told from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild the city to Messiah and Messiah was Christ of course shall be seven weeks right there and threescore and two weeks sixty-two weeks making 69 weeks all right 69 right there which makes 483 years all right seven times 69 there's no half weeks anybody know there's a half week in here anywhere zero all four weeks now you're getting it down seven times sixty-nine makes four hundred and eighty three years now we got to have four hundred and ninety to finish the transgression make an end of sin reconciliation for iniquity bringing everlasting righteousness cell division and prophecy and anoint the most holy everybody got that right now you getting it down if you want me to run over it again I'll be glad to and guess what I'll be glad to - we've been over and over it would it's okay we got we got to get we got to get everybody have a good fresh revelation now we are told from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild the city - Messiah shall be seven seven that's the first right here he's pointing right here scroll it up so everybody can see it please seven that's the first right here seven weeks and threescore and two weeks mate 62 and seven and 69 he said it again sixty-nine weeks seven times sixty-nine would make 483 years therefore until the Messiah now we're coming up to this part here until the Messiah there's got to be 483 years right here because where did Jesus come on the scene right here all right he came in and you know we can go through the many times we went through it before a long time ago where Jesus was born in 4 BC he was not born and there's no ad zro it went from it went from BC 1 - 81 not 80 zero if I got that say man so if he's born in 4 BC which will we may go through that but to me it's really immaterial it's not though if you look at what brother Bram talks about Jesus being crucified in 80 30 because he was 33 years old when he died he wasn't thirty all right so he had to be born sometime before 81 and we'll prove that we've already proved that we've got we've got sermons on it before that he was born around 4 BC because that's when Herod came into into into power made - he shows up somewhere in there and says well they said well when did the Messiah show up and they said well two years he said we'll kill every baby remember he said kill every baby from two years back right all right I'm told you knew he was born somewhere in that time you know so he said okay from this time I want everybody all the kids that are two years old all the Hebrew babies I want him dead he's trying to kill Jesus but he was born in 4 BC and then you look at ad 30 it's where he marks if you look on your own your sheet and we will actually make it into that to make sure we prove that because it wasn't and brother Bram does make one statement he says ad 33 but it doesn't match ad 30 is what matches if you'll read your Daniel seventy weeks the 70th week you will find out where brother Brown says he rode into Jerusalem on a white donkey on April the 2nd ad 30 now that was when those 483 years were coming to an end okay because the Messiah was fixing to be cut off if he rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday what is Palm Sunday thank you for those of you that don't know which you should have already known that's the week before the crucifixion right right before Passover so if he rode into Jerusalem on a white donkey on Palm Sunday 80 30 he died four days five days later or whatever it was that next coming to the next Friday he was dead he was cut off they said let his blood be on us and our children all that that we talked about happened right in that little spot and then he was crucified in April of 8030 so we'll explain that a little bit later so god bless you just watch this chart look at your charts you got read your Bible and tell me where there's a half week now remember what I said remember tell me where there's a half week in Daniel 70 we've I didn't say anything about 1260 days of this prophecy right here that's inside of the 70 weeks of Daniel that is not the last week it's inside the last week because the Bible says and brother Branham just said there's three distinct periods one more time musicians get ready to come there's a seven weeks sixty-two weeks make 69 or 483 years then there's one week left to finish the time if I understand that to finish the time of the 70 weeks of Daniel most people in the message and I'm telling you they'll fight you tooth-and-nail one preacher says that's a shin kicker they fight and tell you that this right here according to what brother Brown said of course brother Graham can't say what the Bible didn't say and I just read you the Bible said that he shall make a confirm a covenant minute for one week I don't understand that but they're putting that three and a half weeks right there right here and then there's only a half week left after the rapture I want somebody to bring meal bring me a Bible and show show me how that can happen it'll shut the mouth of the critics cuz you know what that I should have done that when they were arguing back and forth I said have you ever read Daniel 9:24 show me where there's a half week in there because the Bible faced final resting places in what the Word of God the Word of God is true musicians come musician one more time I know we don't have a whole bunch of them here today but the ones that are coming come up but study that pray about it cuz you we can't be wrong and get out of here we got to be right we got to be right that's what I said a long time ago and even brother Dale you people say that brother Brown changed it in the when the seals open I want you to show me where he changed it man you're just not getting what he said you got to listen you got to listen with revelation not would just verbatim quotes just like I said Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood seventy people turned and left but the others got a revelation and then how we done is last weekend we read to Revelation that Paul had where we took communion I mean we had a revelation we didn't walk away the 70 walked away as if a vampire we knew exactly you can keep doing that do it again with her brother Tim hymns Church a couple weeks ago that the organ player heed it went when brother Tim or I was speaking but somebody was singing a song and they were giving a testimony and the little guy over there with the guy give a testimony go Sarah follow script all right let's stand to our feet god bless you but this thing Daniel seventy weeks according to the Bible there's three periods and you can't make them any other way let's don't cut them up let's just see what God said you said well I got this quote well you know what if the quote doesn't match the Bible one more time your revelation of the quote is wrong I didn't say the quote was wrong brother branham was so sure that he had to get those seventy weeks of Daniel out of the way so he could bring the seals in why if he take out a question out of people's mind into daniel stamm many weeks then the seven seals would place right in where they're supposed to be placed let's sing a song god bless you one sixty one day of redemption nations of raki Israel's awakening the sign that the prophets are today's number powers encumber return
