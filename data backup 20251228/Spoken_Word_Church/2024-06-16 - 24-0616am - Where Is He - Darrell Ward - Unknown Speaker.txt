with us to the Book of Mark want to read from Mark chapter 4 let start starting at verse 35 and I'd also like to say Happy Father's Day to all the daddies and certainly appreciate fathers amen if your father's still with you make sure you take time to visit him or call him or buy him a Big Mac from McDonald's or or something you know but my father left many year ago and sure still miss him amen absolutely amen mark 4:35 and the Bible says this and the same day when the Eden was come he said unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there was also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and said unto him Master carest thou not that we perish but he does care and he arose and rebuke the wind and set into the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Sea obey him Amen Let Us bow our heads I want to speak to you this morning on where is he where is he Heavenly Father Thy word is true we commit this congregation and ourselves into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you Saints you may be seated this morning I'd like to call your attention back to verse 40 it says and he said unto them why are you so fearful and how is it that you have no faith and as I was thinking about this scripture on fear and faith it reminded me of something that the prophet said brother bam said I thought tonight that I would talk on faith for a little while just to build you up on Christian faith he said I find that one of the greatest hindrances that the church has got today is that they're scared to death and what are you scared about that's what I'm wondering if you'll just only realize who you are amen you don't know who you are you don't know who that is sitting next to you you say oh yeah that's my neighbor I know him all right but you see he's a Son of God see that's right adopted by Jesus Christ into the family that's a daughter of God sitting next to you and who are you if you're a Christian a Believer you're a son or daughter of God then what are you scared about there's no need of being scared so see that's as long as the devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then as long as he can keep you scared keep you afraid because you don't know who you are am so then we realize that amnesia of not knowing who you are produces fear amen you know I was telling you of my father I lost my daddy several year ago he died from Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's a terrible disease because you lose them twice you lose them long before they pass and as the disease progressed on my daddy and he he he got to where he couldn't remember and uh we had to put him into an Alzheimer's home where they took care of people like that and they was having a little party for him and I I went over to be with my daddy and I rode him out into this room and they were passing out gifts and they called my daddy's name they said James Ward but my daddy never moved cuz he didn't know who he was and I said Daddy you better raise up here buddy they they've got a gift for you it's yours it belongs to you but he never moved right you said now why would you say that because I want you to understand that no matter how great the anointing would be from this pull pit no matter how great the gift would be that stands before you if you don't realize that it's for you it'll do you no good amen he didn't come just to give us the word but it came for a personal relationship with you amen so Amnesia then you'll find a lot of times Alzheimer's patients will get violent it's because they're scared they don't know that person coming in the room they don't know whether they're going to help them or hurt them and so Amnesia produces fear it feeds fear but realizing who you are produces faith brother Bram said Jesus had perfect Faith because he knew who he was in the word amen you know I heard one time a story of a beggar that was laying in a gutter and an artist walked up to him and he said sir may I paint a portrait of you said I'll give you a few dollars and the the old beggar said why sure and so the artist paints this portrait and when he gets done he hands the old fell some money and the beggar land in the street he said well if you painted a portrait of me may I see the portrait that you painted and the man said why sure and the artist turned the canvas around and on the canvas was this well-dressed man and ever hair in place clean shaven and he said the old beggar said who is that and the artist said That's you he said that's me he said well you see that's the way I see you amen and the old beggar said well if that's the man you see then that's the man I'll be amen and he got up and he straightened himself up and walked down the road and I say that this morning that many times we see oursel through our eyes we see our weaknesses and our faults and our failures come on somebody but if you can realize this morning that he doesn't see you that way he sees you through the blood of the Lamb of God and that sacrifice is perfect amen hallelujah we need to see oursel the way God sees us this morning perfect love cast out all fear and love and faith is the same thing see love perfect love cast out all fear which gives us Faith then let us come this morning with this revelation we are not a cult they try to make us a cult but we are not a cult we are not a denomination we are not an organization we are a body his body represented on the earth this morning that's who I am Hallelujah and I can be what my daddy says I am amen oh my then let's come with that Revelation and let our faith cast out all fear because we're living in a day of great phobias everything is a fear oh yeah huh never even heard of phobus when I was a boy I'm not even sure I can spell it there's fear people scared of lettuce look it up fear fear but there's no need in a time a fearful time for us to fear our Daddy has it all in control amen now our scriptures opens this morning we find that Jesus is telling his disciples to get into the boat and let us pass over to the other side now where are they going to the other side why he said so he said so let us pass over to the other side now the reason that they're making this journey is across the water is a maniac he's known as the maniac of gadera and this man is living among the tombs and he's cutting himself and ripping off is clothed he's a maniac they tried to tame him they tried to reform him but he would break the chains and go right back into the tombs again but even though he was in this condition he was crying out for help yes he wanted Deliverance so Jesus got into the ship and he crossed that stormy sea that night not for the mayor not for the mayor's daughter but for a Maniac living among the tombs the call of one needy Soul brought him on the sea we don't need a church full this morning we need one needy Soul can call him on the scene this morning oh Hallelujah Jesus crossed the sea all the way over to gadera to give Mercy to one man amen to one man brother you know when my daughter came home from the hospital she was the only Survivor of a train accident and when they she came home their homecoming from the hospital they invited brother Billy Paul down to give his testimony and he come down that weekend and when the service was over we were standing outside and my daughter Jess is just a little old thing had she actually turned three just during that time and so I I asked brother Billy I said brother Billy would you pray for my daughter and so he just took Jessica up in his arms and he prayed for her and he handed her back to me and brother Billy Paul brandham told me this he said brother Daryl he said daddy always told me that in every meeting there's always one great miracle takes place they said this weekend that Miracle is your daughter amen but ever since he's told me that I've thought if there's one Miracle takes place in this building this morning God let it be me if what that ought to be your attitude amen when we come through that door God if nobody else wants help I won't help if nobody else wants a Revival I want a Revival Lord if you're only coming for one Let It Be Me amen he's the same Jesus this morning he'll come from glory to one needy Soul setting in a humble church tonight the same one he'll every time come to where he's wanted but he'll never come to where he's doubted right well I don't know if he can help me or not don't worry he won't he will never be there well he ain't done nothing for me he won't never do nothing for you with that kind of attitude he'll come every time where he's wanted but he'll never come to where he's doubted then let let's let out ever doubt and ever fear and believe him that's all he ever ask us to do was to believe him amen amen then let's let's realize this morning that there is nothing that's able to stop him from coming when we call him notice the wind couldn't stop him the waves couldn't stop him the storm couldn't stop him the sea couldn't stop him the Devils couldn't stop it there was nothing n o t h i n g nothing that could stop him from coming to you when you call on him you see it wasn't the man's voice he was on the other side of the sea he never heard the man's voice then what was it that touched Jesus it was not his voice it was his face Hallelujah and if his faith can touch Jesus your faith can touch him this morning Hallelujah like the boy in the shopping mall he told brother Ben he said I'm lost as lost can be that's right he said I'm like a coin in a sandpile lost and brother R said but you don't have to stay that way yeah amen you know people don't go to hell because they're Sinners right did you know that amen you go to hell because you won't escap the way we could help being born Sinners huh we had nothing to do with that now so we don't go to hell for being Sinners we go to hell because a way was provided away from hell and you refused to accept it amen well that's for somebody I don't know but that's all right amen he said you don't have to stay that way there's someone standing present now who can find you the minute you are ready to be found and the boy said I'm ready are you ready this morning are you ready for a Revival are you ready for a move of God are you ready for God to touch your life don't doubt him just believe him well the doctor says it's great but the Bible says Our God's greater Hallelujah so if you're doubting him just remember he'll never be at your door but if you love him and want him he'll come anytime you call for him he's ready to come there's one standing present this morning who can find you the moment you want to be found who can heal you the moment you want to be healed so we find the meeting is coming to a close and he tells his disciples to get into the boat let us go over to the other side now he's filling the pool of The Maniacs need so he gets into the ship and Jesus is with them and they began to cross now Jesus being the word he knew all things you believe that he knew the maniac was on the other side he knew he would deal with that tomorrow he knew the storm was coming he knew the Devils would try to drown them he knew the pig Farmers would reject him and ask him to leave he knew all already he already knew all of that but yet he spoke let us pass to the other side now that was his word and the Bible said his word will not return to him void but it will accomplish that which it was sent to do he knew the waves were coming he knew the storm was brewing he knew the winds would pick up but he also knew that his word would carry them through Hallelujah so he finds him a place to sleep and he lays down knowing the storm is coming he wasn't worried he wasn't nervous well why would a man do that if he knew a category 8 Hurricane was coming how could he lay down and go to sleep think about it we get a weather alert about a wind shear and stay up all night burning candles well Glory but you see he had a promise from his father amen over in Proverbs that when thou layest down Thou shalt not be afraid and when thou layest down thy sleep shall be sweet amen so he had a promise it didn't say your sleep will be sleep will be sweet if it's a clear night no clouds he said it' be sleep whether there's a storm or not a storm so he didn't Rel oh God he wasn't looking at the wind he wasn't looking at the storm he was looking at the promise of the word when you lay down and night in a troubl some time and many people taking all kinds of pills just to sleep I tell you the best pill you can take is the gospel well Glory I'm getting in your medicine cabinet you're going to pull back on me amen but we have a promise from the father when we lay down our sleep can be sweet go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep little bride don't you worry I am with you I will never leave your side amen right just go to sleep I mean not now but tonight Hallelujah he knew the storm was coming but he wasn't nervous he wasn't worried because he knew the storm did oh God help the sink in this morning he knew the storm did not control him but he would control the storm and you know it seems like we find every time that we try to do something for the Lord when we try to help someone or try to draw closer to God it's or walk in Obedience of It's Always them times that snags comes and hindrances comes and storms begin to have you ever noticed that amen Satan tries to put up barriers to try to keep you from getting closer to God you know in a racetrack when they back those horses in and they close that gate in front of them do you know what that Gate's called it's called the barrier gate but what does that barrier testify of it tells you that on the other side is a victory line amen so so every time Satan tries to gate you in just remember that's the evidence there's a victory waiting for you amen but it seems like in these times as I was telling the young people yesterday we was talking about prayer that you can go all day without getting a text and you go into your prayer closet to pray and is Satan tried to bring hindrances amen like Moses when God told him bring my people out they shall serve me on this mountain then as far as God was concerned they were already on the mountain am and that same God that said you'll worship me on this mountain he said there'll be a Rapture and as far as God is concerned we've already raptured Hallelujah Moses look at the hindrances he faced bringing God's people out of bondage the first thing he hit was a sea not a creek a sea henders but God split the water then he got three days in the desert with no water amen and then they found water and the water was bitter it would have been better to find no water at all than to find water that was bitter but sometimes I'm convinced that God makes the water so bitter that the only place you can look to is to him Hallelujah but whatever was in his way Moses had the right to speak and go forth God never says to go back we are not to retreat well brother dar it's getting pretty rough around here we are not to retreat look at the armor that God gave us every piece of armor but there's not one piece on our back CU we are never to retreat now I was in the Army I know some of you Brothers Here know that was in the Army and I was in the army they gave me equipment I was in a combat unit up here at Fort bra North Carolina I was at the 18th Airborne Corps up there field artillery unit and they gave me all this equipment to defend my country they gave me a helmet that we called a steel pot they gave me an M16 rifle with a banana clip that held 18 rounds they gave me an m203 which was a grenade launcher that fit underneath the M16 and you would put the grenade shell in there and you stick it on your arm and poop now the reason they gave me that grenade launcher was because the sergeant watched me shoot my rifle one day and he looked at me and he said you'll be the grenade launcher you don't have to be close you don't have to be accurate just close right so I carried it the whole time M16 rifle m203 they gave me combat boots I was on A5 Houser that fired around the projectile round that weighed 105 lb and on a Max charge eight green bag it could go 18 miles if my memory served me right and they gave me all this to defend my country but one thing the United States Army never gave me was the promise of a victory come on now now I joined the army for two reasons one to get the GI bill to go to school for the go so they pay for my school in a second was to see the world we was raised poor I wanted to see the world there's no way for us to to do that so I thought I'd get in the army and see the world so I got in the Army and they sent me to North Carolina spent all four years of my military in North Carolina but when I got out of God's uh the US Army and got into God's Army I've been in 32 countries I just found out I was in the wrong Army but when I got into God's Army he I found out he gave me equipment he gave me the helmet of salvation he shot my feet with the preparation of the gopel he gave me the sword of the word and he gave me the shield of Faith but God gave me something that the United States Army never gave me he Hallelujah he gave me a promise of a victory no matter how bad it gets he said look in the back of the book we win hallelujah amen hallelujah do you love him this morning the prophet said if you're sick and you can't get well and you've done all the doctor told you to do and you still can't get well you're in the line of duty just go forward amen just keep moving Jesus said let us go to the other side he had a job to do he was tired he was weary and he lays down to rest knowing he's in the will of the father moving across the sea to the maniac of gadera now here's the disciples they're moving across the lake or the sea and they're with him in this boat they were in the message of the hour if I could say it that way they had Jesus with them they were having a Revival testifying of all that they seen him do now here you're going across this water in the message of the hour in a great Revival should be smooth sailing no worries no bumps no waves we're his disciples we're moving with him we left everything to follow him it should be smooth sailing but you see there's one problem with that Jesus never promised that right right he didn't say matter of fact he said we're not on a picnic we're in a battle right he never said we wouldn't have trials he never said we wouldn't suffer they just sung about it right before I came out he never said we wouldn't be laughed at he never said we wouldn't be made fun of he never promised move Salem he never said there wouldn't be storms he didn't he never said we wouldn't lose loved ones he never said we wouldn't cry come on somebody he never said that but he did say I will never leave you nor will I forsake you then no matter what we face in life we do not face it alone hallelujah amen he said let us go to the other side so they're sailing across this sea and as they're sailing across this sea the storm begins to blow in now Peter being a seasoned fisherman no doubt had fished on this water many times been in all kinds of Storms and know out he thought boys see that right there I've got this this Peter was relying on his ability as a fisherman as a navigator all this confidence was in his ability but you see what Peter failed to realize was this wasn't a storm this was a storm but yet his attitude was I've got this I can handle this myself no you can't he built the body in such a way that we would need one another don't you sit in this church and what I don't need nobody in this church I'm sorry the devil's lying to you we need each other the prophet said it's Christ in me helping you and Christ in you helping me brother amen we need one another sometimes us message people what we need to do is just humble our s down and say Lord I need help brother some people been in this message 50 years never been to the altar one time I don't care who we are Pastor preacher teacher evangelist song leader mom and dad there's times in our life that we need him more than we ever needed him before amen the prophet said Jesus was crossing the Sea and the devil knew think about this the devil knew he was on the road to a great victory for God and he tried to drowned him that night and caused a storm to come up and 10,000 Devils of the sea saw that drowned him that night and he was tired and he was laying in the stern of the boat and even the waves didn't wake him up 10,000 Devils tried to drown him because he knew the devil knew that the next day he was going to have a great Victory and you wonder sometimes why Trouble Comes if you could only realize amen this great storm began to rise up and as the sails were torn and the ores were broke and the waves be to toss on the prophet said 20ft waves and they were tossed like a bottle stopper out on the choppy Waters in this great storm it way up this way and way back up this way the water coming into the boat where was Jesus it looks like if he really cared he'd be up there with them if he really cared he would have told them the storm was coming he knew it was coming he knew when it would hit he knew where it would hit he knew how bad it would be he knew all things knowing the end from the beginning he knew it was going to happen he knew it was going to happen he was Goden why wouldn't he up there with his hand on Peter's shoulder yeah yeah where was he yeah where is he amen this storm is great why is it happening come on brother the prophet said it only happened to test their faith didn't he say so later so a real child in the testing time do not walk by sight their physical eyes are closed to the things that are around them they only walk by the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ looking into his word and believe it he'll keep every word exactly the way he said it amen you see you can't walk by your eyesight and walk by faith at the same time you've got to walk by one or the other but true Christians do not walk by what they see with their eyes but they walk by what they see with the eyes of their heart and the eyes of our heart sees the Unseen oh hallelujah hallu amen testing times and trials sometimes God let afflictions hits his people to test him for their faith he was testing a saint not rebuking a sinner that's such a good point because a lot of times when Trouble Comes The Devil will try to tell us the reason you're going through this is because you failed God but sometimes it's not because you failed God at all matter of fact the prophet said in Victory Day the more loyal the more testing oh Lord Jesus amen amen get ready there's a storm coming amen not rebuking a sinner but testing a saint he was testing a saint not rebuking a God does that to test the prophet said and that's why you're sick tonight maybe that's why this La of the Revival is to see what you're going to do about it are you going to pick it up you going to make it all what are you going to do yeah let me tell you something when everybody's praising God and stand on your feet it's easy to raise your hand it's easy to holler amen it's easy to holler Hallelujah but when when you're the only one in the church and you got that side above your door this day I give my all for Jesus Christ God help us that will be our attitude that when I leave this service I can say I gave everything I had if nobody will amen him I'll amen him if nobody will say hallelujah I'll say hallelujah if nobody will sing loud I'll sing loud hallelujah hallelujah I'm not basing my Revival on an emotion I'm basing my Revival Hallelujah on the revelation of who I am amen amen they asked a man this man was blind he was deaf and blind and they asked this man why do you even come to church through brille why do you even come to church you can't see or you can't hear why do you come why do you why do you come to church he said because I want the devil to know what side I'm on amen amen amen you see how some people dress it's not hard to tell what side they're on come on somebody I want the devil to know what side I'm on Amen oh can I have just little bit list my my grandpa he was a mixed blood got a little bit bit Indian in our family he was a mixed blood my my grandma always said that Papa couldn't hold his liquor cuz he's half Indian I've heard that since I was a little boy anyhow he was a boxer out of Knoxville Tennessee he fought under the title of Doughboy Johnson Doughboy was what they called The World War I soldiers so he fought under the title of Doughboy Johnson and my mama was telling me when she was about 16 17 something like that my papa was fighting a fight down in Knoxville he was a Golden Glove boxer light light lightweight boxer Golden Glove and so they had a fight down in Knoxville my mama said they bought her a new dress to go to this fight and she said that night of the fight said the man that my papa was fighting was much bigger than him had a a bigger reach than him bigger fists than he had and my mom said I was afraid he's going to hurt my daddy and said I told my daddy I said Daddy please don't fight that man tonight let's just go home so that guy's going to kill you I said Mama what did he say she said he didn't listen said he went there I got in the ring said the fight started said about the second round said that man hit Papa with an uppercut knocked him plumped through the ropes out into the crowd said people got out of their chairs and he was laying back there mama said I went running down there said his nose was turned up towards his jaw said blood was pouring out said I took the corner of my new dress whatever that is but she said I took the corner of my new dress and wiped the blood off my daddy's face I said Daddy let's just go home that man's going to kill you it's just bigger than you let's just go home I said what did he do she said he didn't listen she said he took his gloves and went straightened his nose got up climbed back in that ring and my mama said three rounds later he knocked the man out and won the fight and I thought oh God give me that kind of Grace brother that if the devil knocks me pum back into the second row God give me and he knocks every tooth in my head out God give me Grace to get up and climb back into the ring and D him to death come on somebody whose side are you on we are on the Lord's Side hall hallelujah oh my this day this day I will give my all for Jesus Christ the trouble set in the storm was so great the wind the rain the lightning they were so busy fighting for their lives they forgot that the very one that said let us go over to the other side the very Creator was in the boat with them they should have known he knew all things they should have known he knew it was going to happen they should have remembered he had it all in control does he have it all in control does he have it all in control then what are you afraid about why was he letting it happen when he got into the ship he knew it was going to happen he was testing their faith do you believe what I tell you H and finally when the waves had them beat down and the wind was so great just so strong and the cells were torn the ores were broke everything was crashing in what are we going to do what are we going to do and all their fear and all their anguish the greatest storm of their life 10,000 Devils trying to drown them right somebody said wait a minute wait a minute amen he's in the ship with us where's Jesus where is he he's in the boat with us the answer to the storm was in the boat await the master master help us we're going to perish he rebukes the storm the Sea and the wind obeys him kind I don't know how big it was we'll say catgory 8 whatever that is a great storm and when he said peace be still hallu it's like glass amen you just comb your hair just amen he can change it in a moment's time amenl amen every the doctor's report was bad every doctor I worked with him I was friends with him every doctor was telling me my daughter would not live the day of the funeral when I buried two of my family and I went back to the Intensive Care Unit my my my my daughter Jessica was in the kicu kids Intensive Care Unit sitting there in the wedding room everything was against our family every thing was against my daughter every MRI CT scan every Vital sign everything was against her but he came to me Hallelujah and he spoke to me and he said your daughter shall live in a moment's time he changed the storm amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord he rebukes the storm the wind and the Sea obeys him peast be still and there was a great come and he turns to them and says why are you so fearful where is your faith did not I say we're going to the other side right amen was I not with you the whole time reminds me of the Cherokee have a it's called the right of passage it's a myth among the Cherokee when a boy gets a certain age his father takes him to a secret place only the father knows about just listen to me just a couple more minutes I'll close and he sets him on a rock or a stump and he ties his feet but he ties them real loose he ties his hands but he ties them loose so if the boy wants to get out of it he can and he takes a blindfold and puts it over his eyes so he can't see now the boy must sit there all night if he cries out for help he fails the test if he gets up and moves around he fails the test he must sit there all night long but if he's true to the test at the rising of the sun when the first Ray strikes his face he's a man he can come out of the ties take off the blindfold he a man it's called the right of passage from a boy to a man so the father takes him out to the secret place sets him on the stump ties him and the boy sits there all night ain't too bad to S 8:00 about 10 you know when the dampness sets in the cies begin to yel when my girls are little I used to take them camping in the backyard you spend a little time with them I was gone so much I told my wife I said leave the back door unlocked we'll be in the first time the cootes yel sure enough first time they let out one of them whales here we go Oreos and all you know that's right but he hears the sounds of the animals the rustle of the leaves is it a bear is it a is it a wolf is it a shy Warrior looking for a scal easy target he don't know so he sits there all night long but at the rising of the sun when the ray strikes his face The Boy comes out of the ties he takes off the blindfold and he looks around he's a man but it's only then that he realizes sitting behind him is his daddy he had been there the whole time that's right don't we sing a song like that he was there all the time amen amen the Bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever amen then if he calmed their storm by being in the ship with them yes then he can calm our storms by being in the ship with us the answer to their storm was in the ship with them and the answer to your storm is in the ship with you this morning he's the same Jesus he's just changed ships yeah amen right amen amen remember we was all wearing those mask y'all didn't wear them down here

behind the groom right amen now he's veiled behind the bride what is fellowship two fellows in the one ship right Hallelujah he's right here with us now yes sir as we travel on the sea of life let us remember the Bible said many are the Affliction of the righteous but the Lord deliver him out of them oh huh Paul said persecutions and afflictions which came into me at Antioch and aacom and lth what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me sometimes we get in physical trouble we can't remedy sickness cancer and so forth and the doctors can't they don't know what to do but remember who's in the ship as the father has sent me even so send I you the father that sent him went with him and was in him and the Jesus that sends you goes with you and is in you the prophet said you're still in the ship Lord The Old Ship of Z that's carrying us across the troubled sea and when the devil sweeps a storm down upon us what difference does it make as long as he is in the ship where is he where is he amen I told the young people yesterday Time Magazine a few years ago said where is God I said if he listened to me I could tell him he's right here with us now then let us come
