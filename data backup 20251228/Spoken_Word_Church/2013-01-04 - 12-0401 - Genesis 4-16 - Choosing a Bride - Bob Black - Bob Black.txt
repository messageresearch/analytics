========================================

oh so today is april 1st yeah nobody yeah i had to keep an eye on timbo to make sure so let's go ahead and get started does anybody this wednesday is april 4th and uh it's the anniversary or something that happened in bible history does anybody remember what april 4th is the anniversary of oh yeah well one thing that's special to me is because it's my birthday and this this isn't really part of the lesson it's just something since we're around april 4. that's just completely not remember the date matthew 24. 4 24 24 and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see not all these things rarely i say to you they shall not be able to hear one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down let's stop there for a second and read what brother brown said about this and jesus went out this is in the sixth seal and jesus went out and departed from the temple and disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple and he said unto them see not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be one be left here one stone on another that shall not be thrown down and third verse says he said upon mount olives the disciples came to him privately saying tell us when these things shall be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world now let's stop there these three verses it took place actually on tuesday afternoon april the 4th 830 and the first two verses took place on the afternoon of april 4th at 80 30 and the third verse took place on tuesday evening of the same day and the third verse as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of i feel you know the end of the world so this wednesday just think about that that i you know nobody could tell us these things but a profit that's why anybody that would come along behind and say they could correct brother brown there's no way for you to know all these secret things about a prophet they could tell us the exact time that jesus sat on the mount of olives and and spoke those words to his cycle on april 4th in the afternoon in the year 80 30. that was 1982 years ago so now let's turn and keep going through genesis let's go back to genesis chapter four and this time we uh we've been making our way in great detail through genesis chapter four we're going to look at verse 16. now you know the same god i could tell whether brown what uh happened 1982 years ago as the same god that told moses over 2500 years after it happened what happened in the garden of eden and all these things that we're reading about in genesis moses wrote moses lived you know two two thousand years later when he wrote this down and that's it's just to make all the all of these things are written down by the problems the problems of god there's nothing in the bible that um that we we have assurance that man didn't make up any of the words we're reading because everything fits together so perfectly and so let's read verse 16 and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of not on the east of eden and so i have a long list of quotes to read through and the theme of this is that when cain went out from the presence of the lord he went out to find uh as we'll read through what brother has to say about it he found he went to find a church that would meet his that would satisfy his desires and he found a wife that would satisfy his desires and um the way that you find a church and the way that you find the wife are the are identical because most people look at the outside when they're finding church i i've talked to many people about why they chose their church and some people say that they they felt like the church that they go to is the right place because the people outside shook their hand or um there was a right amount of emotion and things uh and that's similar to the way people choose their spouse is because they they like the way they look or the way they uh you know they were familiar with the story brother and told about the little girl that liked her boyfriend's feet those are all not very good reasons to choose a church or choose so brother branham compared seth and cain seth stayed in the presence of god and got a wife and cain left the presence of god and got a wife and they both found a church and a wife based on their desires what they were what was inside of them the desire that was in them so um let's read abraham and his seed after him 1961. now sometime this week we're going to take the mark of the beast and the seal of god and watch how that started right and eden and come right out where cain went out from the presence of god to get his wife outside stayed in the presence of god and got his wife how the church's different way went out with their organizations to going out with their organizations or system and gotten themselves a church a bribe and when the real true church stayed with god perfectly in the mark of the beast and the seal of god 1961 he said say i got a note today said could you prove that the assemblies of god started in genesis not listen to this this is good because he's comparing he's using assemblies of god to compare the uh the true church the true bride and what their desires and assemblies of god whether they stayed with the word or not could you prove that the assemblies of god started in genesis i don't know about the organization but the spirit that's in the assemblies of god starting in genesis that's exactly right and all the other born-again churches started in genesis and all this supposed to be churches just nominal churches they started in genesis and they both was represented in the first two sons both cain and abel cain received the mark of the beast and was sent away we realized that the serpent which was the one who had deceived his mother was a beast and not a reptile he was the most soul of all the beasts of the field in genesis 14 or genesis 4 15 rather that god sent mark cain and as soon as cain was marked he went out of the presence of the lord as you get it last night now did you read it as soon as the mark came he went out of the presence of the lord and took him away from the land of non and uh that same message let's see keep going down and then questions and answers brother said he came to his wife and lived with her in the land of not outside because god had separated him from this fellowship with his own brother because of the death of abel and that's who he had his own sister and married her is the only way that i could myself and see how that he married and and we know that you know everybody uh the bible doesn't list all the women that were born so um this is a this is a huge question among uh i go to this this website where uh it's kind of bible scholars talk amongst themselves and you the thing is that we take for granted as misses believers that the brother brandon has taught us like this that kay mary and sister are it's amazing to me how the the worldly the outside that those christians can't really there's still a mystery even these little simple things that we take for granted about where cain got his wife from and so we know that cain married one of his sisters choosing a church and we might go home for several let's see okay this is looking at the unseen we might go on for several hours speaking of the modern day of how men and women today just completely look and they go down the street and they're going to choose a church that they might must go to and bring up their children in and they'll search around through the city not trying to find the most spiritual church but the biggest church that they can find the one that's got the greatest crowds and the best dressed and the celebrity of the city goes to this such church where it's called the better class as far as men know and then in that church they'll try to find a minister that's what they call not narrow-minded that have just about let them live any way they wish to and belong to that church but the spiritual man on the inside if you'll give him the right of way he might lead you to a little mission somewhere where there is not many people but there is the spirit of the living god for the outside man feast on psychology and intellectual but the inside man feeds on the word of god and think about this broader than just looking at a church because this is how you choose your spouse to your husband and your wife and if you look at the end of marriage and divorce when brother brown was talking about the end of the marriage and divorce he says now that you've accepted the grace of marriage and divorce make sure that you teach your children never do this this is i i i tell my kids that there's two two great lessons you you must learn the first is that you've got to receive the holy ghost and the second is pray pray before you uh pray about your wife and and your your spouse is the uh the second most important decision you'll ever make because the way whether you accept jesus or not the the first decision to receive the holy ghost determines your destination if you make the wrong decision your soul you stand a chance of being lost eternally the second most important decision can ruin your entire life and you know we've seen just looking around i believe god sets examples into your path of things to follow and things to be aware of like he set pharaoh and moses before the children of israel they could look at pharaoh and see an example of what not to do and look at moses and see an example of how to live their life and we we've all had examples set before us of if if you don't pray before you seek a wife or seek a church it can it can destroy your life and i'm gonna read a quote in a second about what happens if you don't choose the right church if you don't choose the right church it can it can destroy your uh your fellowship with god and let's keep reading questions and answers were on hebrew in 1957 but eden was like a country or what our state and then none was another state or county next to it now the only person that kane could have had or married would have to be his own sister he had to because there's only one male and female that they could have come from and he had to marry his own sister now that was legal in those days and isaac married his own first blood cousin rebecca ordained of god and just remember that as we go along isaac married his own first blood cousin rebecca ordained god and that's how you choose that's the type of how you choose your wife today you must be your wife has to be related to god through the blood it's the blood of god living in the life of god living in her or living in your husband or whoever you choose that's how we're related to one another it's got to be through the blood of christ covered under him the the isaac and rebecca were related by blood and that's how we've got to be related the same holy ghost that's in me has to be in my wife or whoever you choose that's how you know if you've got the right wife or not you know brother branham said if you don't have the right one here on the other side you'll have the right one the right one is filled with the holy ghost it's not um because they've got pretty feet because they've got uh a nice hairdo or um or or does everything that you think they should do but if they're pleasing is that if they're pleasing to god or feel the same life that was in christ the mark of the beast and the seal of god 1961 notice he went out from the presence of god on whose mark went to the land of nod and got him a wife the very type of the church goes out from god gets the wife of the world think about it parallels it's the wife of the world gets a church of the world it doesn't believe what uh the revealed word teaches the mark of the beast and the seal of god however we find that cain then went away from god and took himself a wife out of another group in the land of god that's exactly what the man does that will not come up and worship god as spirit and truth he goes off and gets him a church that will satisfy him the true easter seal and what did the organization do it left the true pentecostal belief when it organized and got a wife out of the organization that's exactly right now what now what he's done look how look how the pentecostal wife's been to do and what she's saying and what she's doing look look at her action and standing right back around and trying to cut down the very thing that she stood for at first she's trying to cut it down smother it out because it's against her creeds like it was there but she's forced again to make a decision she's got to make it she's got to make it god help me and my brother who will stand with me help the god help us to stand there gallantly no matter if it's martyr's blood stand there i must fight if i must reign and increase my courage or now let's go to questions and answers on genesis 1953 and he's talking about abraham and isaac and rebecca and it was legal and lawful in those days even for abraham and even on down to isaac isaac married his own blood cousin when abraham married his own sister blood sister his fathers his different mothers but the same father and the german comes out of the male 6 sarah which brought forth the wonderful isaac is that right there was a nobody on the earth then that that was all in tight showing that here it is brother isaac rebecca is the type of the church and isaac is the type of the bride christ is that right and they must be blood relation blood relation questions and answers 1964. remember eliezer representing now the message that went forth from abraham eliezer went forth to find a bride for isaac he found a beautiful rebecca in the cool the evening a little dark-skinned girl coming out with a water pot on and eleazar prayed said lord god give me a good journey now and success for my master abraham and he said go don't take him amongst the philistines don't take her get over here amongst his people showing that the bride of christ and christ is blood relation because rebecca and isaac were cousins the time of decision and this time came and abraham was determined that he did not want his son to marry an unbeliever that would be good decision for our christians today who are sons and daughters of abraham to make the same decision about their children now it didn't make any difference about how pretty those unbelieving girls were how nice the women they were but abraham did not want his son connected with that kind of stuff and so he had to make a time of decision on who he should marry the choosing of a bride 1965 now if the spiritual or the natural is the type of the spiritual then the choosing of a bride and the natural is a type of choosing a bride the bride and the spiritual now it's a serious thing when we go to choose a wife a man for the vows here is until death do we part that's how we should keep it and you take that vow before god that only death will separate you and i think we should a man in his right mind that's planning a future that he should choose that wife very careful be careful what you're doing and a woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband should be real careful what she's doing and especially in these days a man should think and pray before he chooses a wife the choosing of a bride i think today what's got so many divorce cases now that we lead the world of america and divorce cases we lead the rest of the world there's more divorces here than anywhere else this nation and supposed to be and thought of a christian nation would reproach our divorce court i think the reason of it is because that men have got away from god and women has got away from god and we find that if a man prayed and a woman prayed over the matter not just look at a pretty set of eyes or big strong shoulders or such as that or some other worldly affection but would look first to god and say god is this your plan that's what we want is god's plan we call it we we must it's so important to pray before you make these important decisions because i i can look back over all the examples that i've seen in my life of people that you that thought they were marrying a true believer that raised their hands in church and prayed and dressed right and did everything that seemed right but after five or ten years when the trials and troubles came something on the inside just wasn't holding and uh it's it's so important to pray hard before you make these decisions to make sure that you've got god's plan and you're not just looking at something pretty on the outside and this again this is two things not just talking about the bride but the church too what church you go to you know people will say they they uh they're looking for a church that'll give them revelation and then they'll they'll go after pretty on the outside instead of pretty on the inside a tourist that really will stand by what god believed but god was in god's word and the choosing of a bride in 1965 brother graham said a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life to remember the vows until death do we part and he could ruin his life by making the wrong choice but if he knows what he's making the wrong choice and is marrying a woman that isn't fit to be his wife and he does it anyhow but then it's his fault if the woman takes your husband and knows that he's not fit to be a husband to you then that's your own fault after you know what's right and wrong so you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly pray through it choosing the church and choosing your bride he said you know you must pray over the church that you are fellowshipping in remember churches carry a spirit now i don't want to be critical but i realize that i'm an old man and i got to leave here one of these days i got to answer at the day of judgment for what i say tonight or any other time and i therefore i got to be dead earnest and truly convicted but you go into a church and if you'll watch the behavior of that church you just watch the church for a while and you'll usually find that the church acts like the pastor sometimes i wonder if we just don't get one another spirit instead of the holy spirit you get to a place where pastor pastors will radical and carry on you'll find out the congregation is the same way i bring you to a church where i see the pastor stand drip their heads back and forth you watch the congregation they do the same thing you take a pasture just gulp down anything usually the church will do the same thing so if i was choosing a church i choose a genuine fundamental full gospel bible church i was choosing one to put my family on and the choice of the church you go to is so important and now brother brown's going to explain why because just like the choice of a wife can can destroy your life but the choice of a church can destroy your life also destroy your soul and destroy the way that you believe if you go to a church that doesn't believe god's word and all of it then it'll affect the way you believe the choosing of a bride he says phone call just came in come in a while ago this morning a member of my church was really a baptist woman out of louisville she died early this morning and my church at home a real group of consecrated me and assembled themselves together and looked down before the undertaker and bombed her stood over her prayed until life come back to her and she is living tonight the elders in my church while they've been taught to believe that all things are possible come to come to god sincerely so you must make the right choice now his point is he was talking about this member of his church that made the right choice to go to a church where the elders were taught that all things are possible when he died he was they prayed for him and his and life came back into him and it's more than that they brought her think about his soul not just that he was brought back from the dead but his soul uh when you go to a church that teaches right it's the salvation of your soul the choosing of a bride 1965 you have also a choice whether when you choose this church you can choose whether you in this church whether you will choose a church that will guide you to your eternal destination you can choose a church that has a certain creed that you might think that creed is just what you want or the other church has their creed and then there is the word of god you have choice of you have to make the choice there's an unwritten law among us of choosing so you can do just like king did you choose the word of god or you can choose your own creeds and the things that satisfy you things that satisfy you don't may not necessarily be pleasing to go up and uh we've got about five more minutes i i just have three more quotes to read and then won't be done but um brother branham talked about how when you think of you're part of the bride the bride is what god the bride manifests the nature of who god is who he is and that's how a man chooses a wife he's going to choose something that expresses what's inside of him what a wife displays on the outside is expression of what's inside a man i've seen many times in my life when uh well i'm not going to talk about that listen the choosing the bride in 1965 he said again the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition and his character if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife it shows what's down in it no matter what he says outside or watch what he married i go to a man's office and he says he's a christian penta's all around on the walls i don't believe you look at music going on i don't care what he says i don't believe his testimony because his spirit is feeding on them things of the world let's say if we would marry if he would marry a coarse girl or what if he would marry a sex queen or just a pretty modern modern raketa it reflects it shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be because he took her to raise his children by that's something important to consider when you're choosing a spouse somebody that uh there's more to it than just um somebody that uh you know what i i mean when a man chooses a wife it could be the salvation of his children because she's the pastor of his little home and she's going to raise up his children the way that he they should go and whatever she is that's the way she'll raise those children so it reflects what's in the man a man that takes a woman like that shows just what he's thinking of the future could you imagine a christian doing a thing like that no sir i could not a true christian will not look for such beauty queens and chorus girls and sex queens he'll look for christian character choosing of a bride in 1965 now you can't have all things there might be one girl that's real pretty and the other girl maybe she's in her stature looks better than this one and you might have to sacrifice one for the other but if she's not the stature of a lady of a woman she's i don't care whether she's pretty or not you better look at her character whether she's pretty or not or not pretty now for it is becoming if a christian would choose a wife if he ought to choose a genuine born-again woman regardless of what she looks like it's what she is what makes her and then again that reflects his own godly character and reflects what's in his mind and what's going to be in the future for his family will be raised by such a woman for the future plans for his home if he marries one of these little modern raquetta sex queens what could he expect what kind of a home could a man expect to have if he marries a girl they ain't got enough moral about her to stay home and take care of a house and wants to work out in somebody's office what kind of a housekeeper would she be you'll have babysitters and everything else be certain of god and then in his wedding instead of marrying among his own people he went over he's talking about jezebel and um i forgot what that dude was what was his name thank you and then in his wedding instead of marrying him on his own people he went over and married a sinner an idolated worship of idols he married jezebel and she was not a believer and no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances should always marry believers but they haven't done this evil thing and no doubt but jezebel was a beautiful woman and he fell for what she looked like instead of what she was that so many people make that same mistake to this day and she had brought idolatry in the nation among the people and the people the priests their ministers had fell victim to this great popular demand i i heard this brother i think he's from trinidad one time saying i like this that if you if a holy ghost feel brother mary's or or sister marry somebody that's not feel the holy ghost if you feel the holy ghost your father is god fulfill the holy ghost and not feel the holy ghost then satan is still your father so if you marry somebody that's not filled the holy ghost your father-in-law is the devil and it will ruin your life it will make life very difficult for you uh so uh it's we should find that quote uh the an american divorce teach your children to never marry an unbeliever don't wait till they get old enough to make a wrong decision before you start teaching them no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances this is always a married believer and it's not just this isn't just a rule that we should follow to that uh it's something god makes rules to help us along the line all of the laws and things in the bible are not just for fun they're actually to help us so am i in there
