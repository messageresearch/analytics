that we still have the Liberty to hear and and read and speak and talk about his word amen that's a wonderful privilege in this hour amen um let's just go to the word this evening we want to turn to Joshua chapter 1 Joshua chapter 1 it's one of my favorite scriptures and uh so let's let's let's go there I I want to talk about this this evening marching marching towards the promise full of Christ amen and I believe in this hour saints that it's more important especially in the day and time that we're living in more important to be feeding on the word of God more than ever right amen uh uh in in in the day and hour that we're living in so much so much uncertainty and so so many things happening but yet we have we can stand on something amen that's true amen amen something that that that that has um that will never change because God said my the world will change amen presidents will will change and and the things of of this world will change but God's word never changes amen and sometimes Saints if we could just really have that to be a revelation to us amen amen and to realize that what the word of God says and what is written there was made specifically and written just for you to help you in the hour that you are living in and when we don't want to listen to that word or obey that word amen then we it's basically kind of like we're we're we're be we're becoming our own Pope to ourselves because what the pope does is is is he is instead of God so whatever he says amen that that that goes above what what what God says you see because he is God here in on on on Earth so that's what Satan wants you to be God here on Earth but without the authority of the word of God in your life he wants you to be your own Pope that's right amen so that's that's something that we have to look at in this hour and just be careful of so let's just uh let's let's let's let's pray before we read the word Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord once again for the opportunity that we have to open back the pages of your word Lord we realize that we don't read father God the words of just any man Lord or some Pope Lord or but Lord God we reading the your word your Eternal Word father God the same word that said let there be light father God is the same exact word that we're reading here tonight Lord God it has creative power Lord God it has power Lord to heal it has power to to save and it has power Lord God to fill Lord Jesus oh Father God we thank you Lord for the opportunity that we have to open back these Pages Lord God and we pray Lord that you would have your way here this evening Lord forgive us for all of our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord God and may you continue Lord Jesus to lead and guide us Lord Lord God and directing us father God in this day and hour that we're living in Lord with so much uncertainty father God surrounding your people oh God Lord help us to keep our eyes focused on you Lord help us Lord God to not stay not be focused on any man or any other thing Lord God but only Jesus Christ the son of man Lord in this hour oh lord for we know that there's going to be false Christ to rise up man that will come father God with deceiving words but oh God Lord your word never deceives heavenly father but your word Lord God fills those gaps Lord Jesus and it gives us understanding Lord God lord and and father the same word Lord God is what will change our bodies one day father and Lord we thank you for it bless it bless Lord that are those that are not here with us this evening Lord bless brother Boyd Lord God Almighty may you just help them Father God this Friday I believe he's going to have the surgery I pray Lord for protection I pray for that you just be with him Lord God Almighty and Lord we're we're going to have a prayer here at the end of the service Lord God but we just ask that you would just give him strength and give him Comfort Lord the family as well Lord Jesus and we're committing him into your hands father God when we know when he's in your hands he is in the best hands that could ever be Lord thank you Father God for the good report we got back from Nanny Lord Jesus We Appreciate You Lord God working on that end Lord God and we just commit the service now into your hands I commit myself now un you in Jesus Christ Christ's name amen amen amen Joshua chapter 1 verse 1 it says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses amen and from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and all and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast H verse five and then you can be seated there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life amen praise God what a promise right amen not even the Gates of Hell will prevail amen praise the Lord as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee praise the Lord you may be seated this hour amen amen what a what a great thing Amen to know that we have a god of certainty in this hour amen amen praise the Lord and as as we see here you know God gave God gave Joshua the Commandment to go over the Jordan amen we know that the promise was given to the children of Israel amen even back even back when uh it was given to to Abraham that they will they would they would take a a land amen and that God was going to give them a land amen that that that belonged to them amen why why did it belong to them because God said so am right amen and so that promise was handed down down to Moses and handed down to the different ones amen and and the children of Israel were looking for that promise to be fulfilled amen and it had to be fulfilled In God's Time amen praise God sometimes we could push and pull and and and and and think if we do this or if we do that or this ain't happening because this is happening but really amen it takes God it's in God's time when things are fulfilled amen praise the Lord sometimes we think we do have a part in it for sure but then there's also it the time of God Amen cuz God has everything predestinated in his own time amen praise the Lord Jesus you came in amen into this word amen In God's Time amen you couldn't come in any sooner and you couldn't come any later you came in at the right time amen praise God and there was nothing else that nothing that you could do or nothing extra that you could have done no more extra belief in his word you came in exactly at the time amen prescribed by God praise the Lord Jesus didn't come he came exactly at the right time amen the the the prophecy was given to to uh to Isaiah amen that a virgin shall conceive and that word had to come down through all the different women at that time all the different teenagers at that time that thousands and millions probably of of girls that happened between the time that Isaiah gave the prophecy Amen to the time that Mary came on the scene but it had to be amen exactly to Mary praise the Lord in order for that prophecy to be fulfilled amen and so I believe saints that in the hour that we're living in amen we are here because God ordained it for it to be that way amen praise God we couldn't have gone in a Rapture previously and in another last year or or 10 years ago or 50 years ago amen you are here amen because you have a part to fulfill in this hour amen you've got a word to fulfill in this word praise God Almighty and God's not going to leave here until every jot every ttle everything that you were bent to to fulfill is fulfilled in this hour amen praise God nothing more nothing less God won't have it any other way praise God you are here to fulfill that exact part hallelujah amen and so This Promise was given to the children of Israel amen back in the uh uh uh to to Abraham and and it was passed down and here's the children of Israel and and now it's time for them to come to this point where they're getting ready to take this land land amen praise God I believe in this hour that we're living in we're getting ready to take our land amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen we see the signs amen Pharaoh is on the scene right amen and and and and he's putting in his laws he's doing all these things and he's doing it very slightly too he is amen don't you think that the Democrats and and and and and and that they were the they were Satan incarnate amen you better believe amen that Satan incarnate it comes very deceiving very close to the truth amen amen Trump Bibles and all kinds of things amen very close that's what's going to deceive amen the Bible says that in this day and the hour that we're living in amen Jesus said that there will be there will be calling out peace peace peace amen and that's what they're calling Trump the the the the the I mean up to the point where even the Jews are calling him the Messiah I've got quotes where there some of those rabbis calling him the Messiah people here in in the in Christianity in denominations calling him the son of man calling him that's bunch of blasphemy yeah bud and we're just hooray y Trump won and he and he's taking it all in you better be careful better be careful and you better know where you're standing amen amen I I I I say these things about Trump because people are caught up with this amen more than the word of God do you not know what the word of God says Amen brother the word of God says that it'll deceive the very elected if it was possible amen so that means that it's going to deceive some people amen but it won't deceive the very elected praise God so you better be careful amen don't get caught up with all this Trump stuff I'm telling you I'm telling you he is he is leading people towards somewhere where you don't want to you're mark my words and you don't you'll think I'm a crank right now but you mark my words give it about two more years Y and you'll see I saw the Trump thing a long time ago you better believe that he's got something he's got something for y'all if you don't if if you're not hankered in the word of God praise God all right let's get back to this all right I don't know how I got into that it's the the the thing is Saints is that we're living in in in in a dangerous hour amen the hour that we're living in is so dangerous so deceiving we are living in the age of the pale horse rider that's right brother where everything is gray you don't know exactly what's right what's wrong what's good what's bad amen so you must be standing firm on something praise God the children of Israel were standing on that promise that God had given Abraham amen that God was going to give us a land amen and they had to look amen at Joshua who was a type of the holy spirit in that hour amen Joshua meaning Jesus praise God that's what the name means amen and Jesus is the word amen praise the Lord Jesus amen amen and so the children of Israel had to look at that promise in order for that promise amen had to in order for that had to look towards Joshua amen who was the leader of that hour in order for that promise to be fulfilled Amen to get to the point to say whatever you say Joshua that we will do amen amen because we see that later later on in chapter 3 I believe it is that's what Joshua that's what the children of Israel told uh told Joshua whatever you say Joshua that we will do why because Joshua had the word of the hour amen and God has given us a word of the hour in this hour amen for us to go astray in other ways and in other directions amen God has given us a sure word in this hour praise God the message of the hour amen it goes along with the word praise the Lord exactly it has to amen amen amen if it's a if it's the message praise the Lord amen amen so here's the children of Israel and at that point and so God gives them this tells them to go over this Jordan amen thou and all this people it's a commandment unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon Hallelujah that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses amen so he tells them amen as I said unto Moses praise God and what a what a wonderful thing it is to know that every promise Amen in the book is yours amen everything that God said amen if every promise that he gave is for you if you take it amen and put it into action amen have faith and believe that promise put it into action you watch it coming to pass hallelujah amen repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we'll never stop talking about water baptism we'll never stop talking about repentance because it's in the word and people need it Hallelujah I need to repent amen every day praise God we have we have people that still that that still uh that that still need to be baptized amen and we will just continue to preach that amen because it's part of the word hallelujah amen don't think that you oh well I knew all that already 50 years ago amen but but that that that's just skim milk and that's that's just amen that's in the word amen that's what got you to the point where you are at amen so somebody somebody else needs that same word amen so that they have the opportunity to get to where you are now amen praise the Lord so we will continue preaching those things amen because they're part of the word so every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and the Lebanon even unto the Great River the the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not amen there shall not any be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life amen praise the Lord you know we're going to have we're going to have adversary we have an adversary in this hour We're going to have Satan Satan's brother BR said that Satan's got a Punch coming to you every he's studied you ever since you were a little a little kid right right when you come out of that mother's womb he's been studying you he knows amen what what what what what you what what ticks in your life amen he knows what what what where he can punch you Amen to cause you to fall to cause you to disbelieve this word amen and those are the areas in our life that we need to keep covered amen praise God don't feel and I guess this is an encouragement to your young people young people don't don't feel well I I I I'm struggling with this in my life I have I had this battle in my life let me tell you what we've all had battles in our life we've all had struggles in our life in one way or another Saints amen and so you're not the only one you're not the only one who who has these mind battles and who has these Temptations and these things that happen amen but let me tell you what there is a way out of that amen there is a way there's a way in of Escape for you amen and and and and and that just tells that just tells me that you're just human going through certain changes in your life and things like that amen that's just part of the process amen and so what Satan does is he tries to get in there and takes advantage of that in your life all this that's going on in your life Satan just comes in there and sticks a wrench in there and and and and adds more to the to the to the situation and and then you feel like it's a huge problem amen but in reality it's nothing but the devil amen amen and I know that it's something that's that's big and it's something that maybe us and our adults in in the hour that we live in we may not understand it completely amen because I know some things a lot has changed amen even since since I was a young young man but you see but you see there's no temptation that God doesn't understand that you're going through amen everything that you're going through amen he went through praise God Amen so and so I don't even know how I got there but there shall not any man be able to stand before you amen before thee all the days of thy life now he continues here he says be strong and of a good courage amen he tells Joshua For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous amen now he tells Joshua there in that scripture about three or four times to be strong and very courageous Amen in the hour that we're living in amen it's is it's not time for us to give up amen amen and to think about letting everything go and going back to the world and and and and amen you didn't have it in the first place if that's the thoughts that you're amen if that's the thoughts that you're having you didn't have anything then at the beginning amen if that's what if is that what if that's what ends up happening many people you know that that have looked to uh a church or or a Ministry or or a certain personality in this message and and they realize and and that person falls and and they leave this word and then they go they go with it and not some of them don't don't even just go with the man if that man goes and starts preaching something else some of them just turned back to the world why because they were looking more to a personality and looking more towards uh an organization it's it's nothing but an organization amen if that's what you've made it in your life more than than than than the word of God and that lets me know that that wasn't an experience a true genuine experience in that life amen you know you may have shouted you may have screamed you may have spoken tongues all those things you can do Amen in the spirit realm and it be and it be something genuine it it be something so close that that but yet you still not have the token in your life amen praise God now we got to know in this hour that we have the token amen the token which is the Holy Ghost amen that's going to lead us and guide us unto all truth amen amen praise the Lord amen the the the the you know we we we're going to have trials and tribulations even with the Holy Ghost in our life amen amen but that Holy Ghost will never keep us away from the truth amen that Holy Ghost will lead us to more truth will hallelujah amen amen praise God I'm so thankful for the truth in this hour amen where I where where I I you know going through the different churches and the different denominations and things that I went through amen we had truth we had I had salvation amen but thank God Amen for the leading of the holy spirit amen to be be able to find the truth for the hour amen praise God Amen so this book of the law now now in verse 7 he says only be thou strong and very courageous very courageous not just courageous very courageous

and preach and you know as a as a preacher pre preaching ripped ripped up jeans and and uh you know tucked you know tucked Out shirt and and it looks like it's a it's a club in the back behind you and and every and everybody's just dancing and jumping that's easy amen that's easy religion praise God Amen but it but it it's hard Amen in this hour to to stand amen for for something and and and and and to let the world know hey I'm standing for truth no matter what how the world goes no matter where they do amen I'm standing for truth in this hour amen that's tough amen amen Joshua had to stand amen with that promise that was given handed down to Moses amen no matter what the problem the the what it looked like no matter if it looked impossible for them to take the land he had to stand on that word amen amen and that's the that's what we have to stand for in this hour no matter it might look Impossible The Rapture might not might look like it's a hundred years away way amen but stand on that word and you watch that thing fulfilled in your life amen he didn't say when when it would happened he just say it would happen stand in the word stand with the word amen amen God didn't say when it was time for you to be healed he just said you're by your stripes you are healed amen praise God stand with the word amen and you watch it fulfill in your life amen God made all these different promises in your life amen he does not say when it will be fulfilled he just says it will be fulfilled amen but stand on that word be be believing on that word amen be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left amen praise God don't go Republican or Democrat amen stand in the middle amen stand in the word right in this hour praise God I just I would I just saw that I'm like well this where people are going in this hour yeah I know it's if if you're a donkey well I don't like you if you're an elephant I don't like you either amen but God called us to love one another that's right right and and it's the world that strives to separate you in these different classes and the different groups amen so that later on they can take over you that's it amen that's exactly what's happening and they keep people fighting with each other and groups fighting with one another and and all these things but amen stay with stay balanced stay with the word the word is what's going to keep you balanced in this hour politics won't politics will keep you fighting politics will keep you uh on your on the edge of your toes and veins coming out of your of your neck and it's so upset with people cuz they don't see things the way they are cuz Trump is my man and and you know that's what we that's that's not the spirit of God the spirit of God is Not That amen the spirit of God keeps you balanced amen keeps you amen keeps you sure keeps you I know where I'm standing I'm standing on God's word I'm standing on something that won't Shake I'm it might Shake but it won't crumble politics crumble we've seen it amen throughout all of our lifetimes amen president presid come and go amen people people come and go leaders come and go countries and Things Come and Go amen amen but the word of God is the only thing that has stood through all all of that we still have the word of God amen amen we we still have the word of God Amen so thankful for something sure amen amen so don't turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper like that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest now he was talking about the the promise of God in other words the promise of God to Moses in other words the word of God to Moses don't turn from it if you want to prosper don't turn from it amen no matter what it is in your life you want to prosper uh in your job stay with the word want to prosper in school stay with the word amen want to prosper in in in your family amen stay with the word amen whatever it is amen stay in the word of God and you watch and see if it God doesn't fulfill what he said amen this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth verse 8 amen this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night amen now now that's that's where I kind of get the little thought about amen uh marching towards the promise amen full of Christ because in the hour that we're living in Saints we must eat this word of God like we never eaten it before exactly amen you know Saints uh I thank God for times times like these you know amen I thank God for for uh uh trials and tribulations in your life because that lets you look more into the word of God because that lets you know that you have no control of your own of your own everything in your life you might think you do amen and you might think that things are going a certain direction and and and then things all of a sudden come to a halt and you realize you know what I need more of God am there's no other way I need I need more of his word and so he tells God tells uh Joshua here this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth in other words you keep feeding on this word amen amen keep eating this word am amen how many stopped eating uh since uh since Thanksgiving of last year I don't see anybody that looks anorexic or anything like that you know you guys all look very nice and healthy robust amen why you kept eating right you didn't stop eating oh you were still eating the same mashed potatoes and the same cornbread and and the same turkey and you you're going to eat the same turkey that you ate last year it's the same turkey with dressing same things that we ate last uh Sunday we ate more than likely last last year but but you kept eating amen why because eating keeps you alive right eating keeps you amen gives you energy Amen to move forward amen amen don't stop eating this word keep it in your mouth amen this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate amen therein day and night amen praise God and it's not not just about eating it amen but meditating upon it as well amen meditating when you're meditating you know there's a a big movements about meditation and and and and all that all that stuff and and all that stuff comes from all those religions back in the Hinduism and all those things so be careful with with with those things because those things open up doors to Devils if you're not careful and meditation and things like that but there is a true meditation in the word of God and let think on these things amen think on these things that God said in his word amen and then try to see hey where am I failing the word amen in this and let me see if I can uh I can change my life amen according to what I have read amen but you over there practicing uh different uh Indian religions and and all that kind of stuff and thinking you know meditation and all that kind of stuff you're opening yourself to Devils so be careful with that CU some people use that to meditate as if it's something good just be careful with that amen but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein all that is written therein amen not just a little bit of it not just 25% of it God's not not pleased with just 25% of his word being fulfilled in your life amen he wants all of it amen he wants you to give him a everything that that he knows that you can give him amen praise through his word to do according to to all that is written there for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have success good success my what's better than success good success amen ain't that right Mercy that's good success is better than success amen and so we want good success in this hour amen and you know they they ask Jesus you know and they said good Master you know how how and he said why call me good there was only only good but God and so you can only get good success with a good God in your life amen there's no good success outside of a good God in your life amen don't you try to put and substitute anything else in there amen you won't get good success you might get success but you won't get good success amen it's it's good amen to know amen that that that you can you can have a good business you can you can be making good money you can have it amen but you're doing everything amen according to God's word amen you can you can have these things in your life amen but you know that you're walking amen and you're not letting uh your business rule rule your life you come to church on Sundays you you you you stay on top amen of think you you are in obedience and you're on top of the word amen because the word has become you're number one thing in your life amen I I believe that will create good success amen majority of the people now only have success but that success will will will you know whatever whatever these people have amounted to their life amen it will all die off brother you know your riches and whatever you've accumulated in your life amen but if your ultimate and your number one priority is God those things will perish amen but you still have god with you you're still taking god with you Elon Musk ain't taking god with him even though he says he says I believe in Jesus Christ and all that kind of stuff uh I like what brother Wade said you know Trump says he's a Christian and if he's a Christian then you're the Pope I don't believe that no Trump says that he he he says out of his own mouth he says I I don't need to repent says what do I need to I Tred to live a good life so that I don't repent is what he said though I Paul said I Die daily and he was the church age messenger that we still talk about in this day amen who changed and saved many lives amen praise the Lord and he said brother brandom need to repent every day amen why because they know it's not about them amen they knew it was about the Lord Jesus Christ amen they knew they they they they answered to a higher a higher person than they themselves amen praise God and so and so we need to realize amen that that when we we feel like well I I don't need to listen to what brother so and so says all he all he's up there he's just monologuing and and uh amen you need to see if it's in the word of God or not because if it's in the word of God and it's hitting you amen exactly where it needs to be it needs to hit you and yet you don't want to change even though the word of God says you're becoming your own Pope brother amen that means you are over the word amen amen you know and as as us preachers amen we preach generally amen I don't know anything about anybody's life I don't I don't want to know I try to not know I just you know but if something hits amen praise God then it needed to hit yes amen and then if you don't change according to the word of God Amen then you are becoming your you're your own Pope amen yeah you're you're over the word of God and we don't want to be over the word of God Amen you know the Bible says that there I believe it's in Thessalonians it says that there was a there would be a man rising up amen and and and and he would sit in the in the throne amen and he would sit in the temple amen saying that he's God and that's what Satan wants to do in your temple he wants to sit in your temple amen and Proclaim that he is God that's right amen Proclaim you Proclaim that that that you're God right amen because that's what that's what he did that's what he did with Judas Judas amen came to the point that it was so close nobody knew that there was a Judas there right brother nobody knew that that there was there was uh they thought that he was probably the closest Christian better Christian even than than Peter and anyone you see he was a better follower than any of the disciples even better than John and John would lay on the bosom of Jesus but yet it was the one that was so close that deceived and was the one who ended up amen why because when Satan entered into him he said well I'm beyond the word and when you say that when you come to that point amen then you go do what you need to do you betray Jesus afterwards praise God you become your own Pope and so have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage verse n Be not Afraid Don't Be Afraid Saints neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest amen praise the Lord and so Saints we know that that this story amen when it IT begun with eating story in in in the Garden of Eden it begun with eating with eating eating eating amen amen and and it's got to end with eating as well amen amen praise God this thing amen if they would have just continued eating off that that tree of life eventually their bodies would have been changed amen that eternal life that they had in their soul would eventually manifest on their in their bodies they wouldn't have died amen they wouldn't have died but see now in this hour that we're living in we have to continue eating off that tree of life amen and if you continue eating remember this word of God needs to be in your mouth on Wednesday nights on just Sundays amen every day right and not just eating but meditating on it right amen and so that's you eating that word and when you feed on that word and you continue eating that word amen you'll eventually become like the word you'll eventually become like that tree of life amen that tree of life will change your body so you will fulfill what Adam couldn't fulfill amen you will fulfill this bride amen is going to fulfill why because she's had one that fulfilled it for her amen the Lord Jesus Christ amen the second Adam yes and and as I always say wherever the head goes the body follows amen but you must be continually attached to that to that word to that head to that tree of life amen not just going over there and plucking at it every now and then that's what we do a lot you know we just kind of pluck at it here and there you know kind of like we're grazing a little bit you know kind of we're going over there picking up some berries and and get out a little basket and you know but you need to be attached to that tree of life amen you need to be you need to be right there attached to that amen constantly feeding off that life amen and people are happy with just grazing a little Berry here and there they're happy to you know come to church every now and then and and then and and and open up the Bible you know two times a year that's that's good enough for them but that's not good enough for a true Christian a true Christian wants to be in that word constantly what what what does it say it says the book of the law shall not depart out of the mouth shall not depart out of th mouth that means it's got to be your life amen amen it's got to be part of your life if it's not to depart out of your mouth amen then it's got to be part of your life hallelujah amen so we don't want to just be grazing a little bit here and there amen we want it all Hallelujah so so so we know that that this eve fell amen she disbelieved this word for her day amen but thank God there's no way that this second Eve can fall there's no way that this second Eve can fall why because she's word of his word b b bone of his bone life of his life everything that he is she is amen everything that that he that that that he is amen she is and and there's no way that she can fall no why because she's not just grazing or looking at him from afar she's connected to him amen praise God Amen and so she can't fall because this word amen it's she's impregnated with this word this seed amen just like Mary Amen in the be uh she was impregnated with the word amen with with with with impregnated with the seed of God Amen it was God's seed and that that was in Mary amen it wasn't Joseph's seed it wasn't anybody's seed it was God seed amen and so that's why Jesus wasn't Gentile or Jewish amen he was God Amen because it was God that put that egg in there and it was God that put that seed in there amen and so when Mary when that was told to Mary all Mary could say it was I don't understand it but be it unto me according to what you said Lord amen right and that's what the people of the children of Israel were saying Lord you gave the promise we don't understand all that was that's going on but as you said we're going to go and take this land amen because your word says your word said it amen and so this that's what that's what Mary did amen when she received that message amen can you imagine amen receiving that type of that type of message from an angel and and you're just you know you girls doing your laundry or doing something doing your homework and and an angel just appears right there in front of you and you know and but Mary at this time she was she was married or she was to she was going to be married and and uh and given this type of news she knew that the promise was there in the word she knew in Isaiah she'd read the Scrolls her she knew about this but she never thought that she would be the one to fulfill that what would cause Amen to for God to gravitate towards her amen God must have seen something there there Amen in her life that amen that would that would say she's the one that I'm going to fulfill that word in my amen praise the Lord there's there was a representation in God's mind amen I believe that that God even knew that even before the foundation of the world that it was married that was to give birth to Jesus amen it's the same thing with you and I amen it's before the foundations of The World God knew that you were going to receive this word and he had that exact word ready for you amen what a wonderful thing it is to serve God in this hour amen that he knows all things and that nothing takes him by surprise amen hallelujah praise God so she cannot give birth to any other thing amen this second Eve can't give birth to any other thing but that word amen amen praise God praise the Lord Jesus now in Luke 1 128 it says and the angel came in unto her and said hail that thou art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women amen praise the Lord Jesus and and Luke 138 said Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word amen not according to my thoughts not according to what I think it is amen but according to Thy word Lord according to what you said let that word be fulfilled in me praise God Amen and and and that's you submitting to the word amen that's you amen surrendering totally Amen to that word amen and that's the only way that the word can change you in this hour amen praise God and you know what the bride of Christ says the same thing amen amen let that word of God Amen whatever it is Lord if it needs to to to to to change me in whatever way whatever needs to happen in my life Let It Be Lord because I need amen I need it amen if it needs to hit me in whatever way Lord Jesus let it be so praise God it would be so nice Amen to come to church and nobody say anything against us and the preacher never preaches again you know against our lives you know and things like that that would be wonderful but you know there's churches that exist that that are like that oh yeah you can watch them on YouTube too usually the pastors you know they they they don't they don't preach against you know the LGBT community they they're very inclusive they you see them with ripped jeans and little small little glass Pulpit up there in front of the you know and they're very just very inclusive you know anybody would like to go to that kind of church you know and Jesus but Jesus amen he rebuked when he needed to rebuke amen he was a party pooper if you if I could say say that you know I remember one in Matthew 24 you know that the disciples they came to Jesus and they were talking about Lord look at this this Temple and how beautiful the this Temple is and and how wonderful how magnificent look what look what man has done wow that's wonderful and Jesus said don't you know that all this is going to be destroyed yes sir right we're admiring everything that man has done and Jesus all of a sudden just just tears it tears it tears them down you know just well that's what Jesus likes to do amen but at the same time he was also the life of the the party as well so because why he was he was the one he harlot's liked for him to be around around them the DR drunkards why because he was there to try to save amen not Rebel in what they were doing amen but he would try to save amen he says because the phys you know you Pharisees don't need a doctor you say that you already are okay in his heart God knew that they weren't but here these are the people that need to that that that need a touch in their life amen and and so he was the one he was there he would be he'd both be the party pooper but also he'd be the life of the party as well amen praise God in other words he was balanced amen praise the Lord and so real quick Saints amen the the the the Mana amen real quick let's talk about this Mana that the children of Israel were eating you know that that that Mana that fell in the wilderness amen it it fell every day and every day that they had to go and pick up that Mana amen otherwise it would spoil and they would have to uh and God commanded them that every day they'd have to go out and and pick up that Mana why it was fresh new experience every day amen every day amen it has with with the word of God Amen it has to be a fresh experience praise the Lord amen and if if your experience has wiggle Tails amen then just go get back in the word amen you know sometimes we we wonder how can I get closer to God it's it's right there amen the Bible is sitting on your counter yeah come on brother it's sitting the app is on your phone it's it's on your tablet that's how you start a Revival in your in your life amen you don't have to wait until you come to church amen you don't have to wait until you the the you know the the the popular evangelist comes through amen pick up that word amen and get in that word and say God change me through this word a reveal this word to me don't just pick it up amen and just just just read it amen but say Lord speak to me through this word amen say give me something the exact that I need for my life in order to change me amen From the Inside Out amen I promise you that word will do it right amen because it's the life behind that word amen and so every day the children of Israel had to go and get a new experience right amen they had to go and get this new Mana amen and God had tasked Aaron and and Moses to go uh and put that original Mana that fell to go and put it behind the the the holies of holies and that Mana that was on behind that holies of holies never never spoiled amen why because it was attached to the tree of life it was attached to the life of God was always always there amen praise the Lord and so in order for you to eat that original Mana the children the priest amen they would have to go in there once a year and go in the back see the Mana taste the Mana and then know hey man I remember this experience but here's another there's a a new experience in in amen but the Mana that was outside of the Tabernacle it would spoil amen and so where is it that you need to be amen you need to be in Christ in order to always get that experience or that high in other words amen you want to know how to how to get high in God Amen get in Christ amen praise the Lord and he'll give you a true experience amen and an eternal experience amen I apologize for saying it that way but but you know what I'm talking about amen always be when you're in Christ amen that experience never goes away amen praise the Lord and so it was it was death amen if you in into that into the into that holies of holies at that time but it's death if you don't go in now amen and there is no excuse in this hour amen young people there is no excuse to not serve God in this hour amen there there every every curtain every wall every partition everything has been has been has been taken down amen now the angel brother Braham said that the angels are trying to run us to the Tree of Life they're trying to carry us to the Tree of Life but sometimes we just tell no I don't want to go I don't want to go yet amen then when on when when is a good time for you right come on Amen when is it amen you didn't come here by on your own you didn't create yourself amen when is a good time for you Amen to get serious with God that's right my the patience of God the mercy of the Lord thank you Lord It's so one it's so great amen thank so thankful that he had all the years that I was I was uh out in the world and doing the things of the world knowing that I shouldn't have been doing those things amen but the patience of God Amen but you don't have to go that way young people amen you don't have to you don't have to wait till something bad happens in your life some some accident or something happens in your life in order to to change amen your your relationship with God amen amen just do it while while he can still be found amen you know I'm never going to stop saying that because I I encourage you amen be born again amen amen be born again if you're not yes sir amen the the God is to seek God and and you find him while he still May yet be found amen so go in and enter into that holy of holies amen because it's wide open for you now amen there's no excuse in this hour praise the Lord Jesus yes that's right amen so what are we commanded in this hour to do amen we commanded to eat this book amen we have to constantly be eating amen it started with eating it ends with eating amen and and it's this book amen that's going to that's going to change you amen oh sure it's going to make you feel you know on on Sunday it it it's very sweet while brother Wade's preaching and bringing things out and it's it's very nice it's very good and we're all in harmony with one another amen but it's Monday when you have to show it becomes a little bitter you have to rub shoulders with people amen you might say well I don't like to be around people well you can't help that you there's going to always be people God made us here to be with people amen so what God wants you Amen to be a a witness to somebody amen God gave you gifts God gave you things in your life amen that that he wants you to show others so that they can be helped in their lives praise God right man God gave you something amen that that that you can do Amen in order because why this thing this thing is about saving Souls if we can amen and you can't save a soul at your house no right you know oh I get online but what are you doing online yeah right brother CU you you you can be preaching the word of God online and you can be you know testifying online but some of us we're just like this just scrolling on while everybody else is feeding us and we never an influence to the to to someone else you see so amen we are meant Amen to rub shoulders with one another amen Jesus rubs shoulders with the people right Jesus was not somewhere all by himself and am man he was rubbing short shoulders with the people amen it's with the people amen and that's how you influence people that's right amen what brother Wade stayed home every Sunday you you wouldn't get the benefit amen of of the word amen a live ministry right so we don't want that amen we want a live word in this hour God wants a live word amen a live a Living Word in your workplace in your school amen your football team God wants a live word wherever it is amen he wants somebody to live that word right there and then why for your benefit no amen for the benefit of someone else amen your teammate won't know Christ if you don't show him Christ your work your work your your your work partner amen won't see Christ amen if you don't show him Christen amen but you have the opportunity Amen to bring these Souls amen Lord and present souls to God as jewels in your crown amen how many Souls have you won right since you've become a Christian amen think about that yes sir amen or is it just about me me me me and and that's it amen I'm but how many souls are we winning for Christ and maybe we won't we may never know right maybe we've done everything we've can we we can to to live the life and to testify but we may never know but if you did that that word will never return back void God will let you know at some point in time hey if it wasn't for you this person wouldn't have come to the word later on right amen so God's got a lot of surprises in store for us amen but just be be in the word amen get in this word amen and and and it's just an encouragement for you amen uh I don't know if I'll when I'll get to ministry again but you pray for us as we'll be in South Carolina this Sunday next weekend we'll be in Florida ministering there so
