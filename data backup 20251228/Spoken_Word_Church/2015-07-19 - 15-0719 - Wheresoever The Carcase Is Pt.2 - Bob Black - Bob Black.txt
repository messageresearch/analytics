========================================

testing power we're live so this is the scripture woman are looking at again but before we before we get it started let's just go and pray Lord Jesus we just think you've gone for another day to gather around your word and the human what about you which is you're all closer to you or were pretty honor to lead with the services that they are great an upgrade or two people it away to studies more and open the eyes about Hartley asked anybody just Christ now so so let me bring it back up in the scripture us it's kind of look at it because they're asking this is this is kind of steers and uses these two examples Noah and lot it's going to be like that when when when they come into the son of man appears and the process and so forth and they're asking and then cuz it's a little parable there's going to be two in the bed to the field and whatnot and and one will be taken and the other left and to me I think this is this is really kind of striking because you know you you go to church with everybody you fellowship with one another and to think that so will be left and others will be taken you have you know to me when we get over there I think it's just going to be so wonderful to make me look across the street of that New Jerusalem and see see brother Joe and all of you here and be able to fellow sit up and sit down by the river life and talk it over talk about all thanks middle brother rhoram was pitching on this and it just begin to open up and things but it's really sad there's this little story the thing there'll be one taken and one left right that's not you know that I believe that's where Jesus comes on saying wipes the tears away from our articles that's that's a sad thing to think about the people that were were lovely to us that we're something real dear to us but yet they cannot see the essence of the message which by the way we're speaking on and really kind of struck me to the kind of kind of give me a little push with this little lesson that little thought on that so with the message is funny but I believe what this is what the soc is where the new trucks where the carcass is the Eagles will be getting together and that question that the Wayne Jesus responded to that question shows us how to be born again how to grow a stache your perfect man where we're going to be where we're going to be taken and you know he said that the kingdom of heaven doesn't come with a observation so when you think about where will the eagle's be gathered together it's not necessarily a place of observation but it's a he's telling a story trying to get it across to us something now I put together some little two little slides they're just going to illustrate my point and and and this is gruesome I know but your age because I have I even wore Bruce and slide ahead cuz we're talking about the carcass that this is a bloody gah spectra and we would never be able to go where the carcass is that Jesus had to come and died and his life for us to be like brother Brennan said ground up his facially buy hamburger meat now that's that's the first that that seed had to go in the ground so that so that he could have fellowship left so there's the question and the answer is seven a.m. where Lord where where are these people going that are are disappearing or changed where are they going is a place is it what is it wheresoever the body is still there when the Eagles now what about that black be you remember last last Sunday I was talking about how the believers Christians whole focus is to see that move that sermon but what does the tracks on the Mount we're attracted by God fulfilling his word when we see God's work begin to be fulfill that attracts us in it it calls us to focus in that's that's our whole our whole desire that's what Jesus desire he's not not my will but thine be doing you want to see God's Word be fulfilled and and let's look a paragraph 95 this message look and his faith can only be based upon one thing and that's the word I mean I feel like a shouting Baptist yes sir see when you get to that word that's the living thing that's the word we are mind and eyes can be single to that word and to focus that into you see exactly what God is doing what a wonderful thing that's what the Old Testament says let that I be single and let that you're the ideal heart is really you you can look over here look over there but focusing and let it be single but to God word right and and not be distracted because that is what's going to take us out of here and you think about is a word um I'm kind of getting over the wake talk a little bit here but is the word of like just intellectual understanding is it just a scriptural page and the more we know about is that learning the word but the water it is a person in it the word of somebody and that's what that's really the whole point of this little Sunday School lessons we're being weird that's where the eagles are gathered together to him we've become the word and we're drawn to the word and that's what we're going to now now in the beginning God had it in him these attributes not this is mega dope or illustration of attributes but attributes are like genius right there there are maybe look at these they have like a little own if you look at least one of these little things as an ant remain each one might describe something about whatever it is an attribute of and attributes are attributes are written that the genes and you are like it's almost like written and can give you updated overridden using for letters right I think is a cgt that science is used to transcribe the genes in your body for and that's up before the number of earthly glimmers for imagine or Luke and John for is a number that your attributes are inscribed in your DNA in it well God's attributes are actually written in him they were written full written in but they got to be expressed they got to be manifested in it so you can almost look techniques these attributes and think of them as as as as word that's writing but it's got to come in being and now this is this is maybe also a poor illustration but they would think of God in the beginning at all these things written down what kind of God he was what kind of person love and Redeemer and a savior and enjoy and all these different things but it's got to be expressed and what he's doing is is by his word he's bringing it on down to express it a first he groped and he wrote his attributes in the stars and program talks about how he put his attributes and he wrote him down in three different bottles he go to look you know that from the stars tell the whole story of o how God was go down and save us like like a Aquarius the Water Bearer with his paws I pour out my spirit conflation all the stars tell berger together it was written in the pyramid and maybe a little bit hard for us to understand but that whole story of going up a few it is written in that pyramid that enoch built and then it was written in the Bible but written on the pages is not enough got to be alive it's got to a and that's what we're talking about we're being drawn to the word by the word then it was written in a person but this person couldn't he took he got one word out I said I inserted a word that's my my illustration of a warning you insert one extra thing with an actual attribute and it just messes it up now here you got a line in a zebra it'll never be able to do and I don't think there's a real creature like that some I just made up that picture but you'll never once you have one thing to it it'll never be able to reproduce right it will never be able to go back to being a line or being a zebra and they'll be able to make another line because it's now it's all it's all off killed 40 all messed up and and that's why now God the book went back in the guards here now he's like well I'm just I'm going to come down to myself fun and that's why i did now what was written those attributes that were written now they're written in the man he's walking this is the fullness of Godhead bodily although that r abuse all those little things are now in this man that's walking on the shore Galilee and that means if that attribute that one day you heard that scripture in and clicking something inside unit came to like that actually that one was in that main I say because he was a fullness chaotic body all the little boxes think of those attributes one day you walk alone when they listen to the radio as the song those or listen to a creature and that actually that's why there might be a little picture that just something strikes personally me because that little word that you heard was oh so personal it just it just spring to life yep and that word was in here and if that word if that were missing you now within him then you're just as eternal as he that's right and look what he began to do those attributes that actually has to be spoken right so he began to preach he began to sow that seed and it and then live what he had to do in John 12 23 jesus H you can say the hour is coming that the son of man should be glorified very liberally I say to you except the corner we fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it died bringeth forth much fruit so he's so word by his teaching now that corner weeks got to go down on the ground so that what if the carcass here's that here's that gruesome picture I was talking about that this is what attracts the bride this is what attracts all the inkless because we're attracted by God shedding is like that he said the except to eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in the car with me and we're not eating is his actual literal flesh but his his word is flesh I word baba says the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us now now here's the big mystery it seems like growing up you know so many people couldn't quite pinpoint exactly how to get born again is it when you pray do you get a cessation your prey until you feel something still something nice and totally overlooked the word I see so many people doing that today think they are say well I'm not going to go to this church anymore why because i don't like a song winger because some my feelings but it's never about the word when you hear somebody leaving our churches almost never about the words never by the doctrine it's always because you get your feelings hurt or something so silly right that's why a believers focus is on the word the word is the main thing it's been the main focus of the whole thing I feel good on in now so this is the whole process the corner beat goes into the ground now I know he gave His life it goes in the ground it's going to be covered up it's got to go on a good girl good ground where it don't matter like like that dog speaking of you know brother rooms preach that sermon a message of a wounded or the snow white of a link of snow white deliver about how that does it he didn't care and want to see maybe just to illustrate wanted to see God worked on the pass and while I was shooting at it it didn't matter it had a goal in mind and I went and until you know maybe a wing halfway shot off for whatever well that's the way God was when he came down to give his life for us and that's where the believers got to be I don't matter how many girls are fired to how many people were saying stuff back to you i'm going to wrestle through until you get to the word i think no matter what stands in your way you want the word you will see God's work in the field so this is called we go to the ground and then one look at this process I was reading this a gardeners blog about how a seed germinates what's the process that it goes through I think I see begin us the German extermination is when you gotta see it and begin it breaks forth that's what that's what germination is calling it start to grow a seed begins the germination process when the seed coat is interrupt what's that mean that little that little far cope around outside they eat all this can't get out of it because it's hard it can't get you know it is preventing it so what's going to happen is it's got a ride you got to let go all your ideas and say God whatever let thy will be done what you were is first and then the water can permeate in there right and this blog on recent science don't even understand but something happens when that water gets in that seat enzymes began to react to something all sudden the spring forth and out goes a little a little seemingly insignificant but look at look at the new birth experience you hear the word and then the Spirit comes in clickers in all of a sudden you maybe somebody interest Kenya came to see what's happening but it says a little something happens and just a little spark and it starts growing and and now this is maybe I don't know what kind of plan get your tongue but but now we're not talking about a little Peter something we're talking about like Davis said i will be playing it like a tree planted by the rivers of water so on you you grow up in a great sycamore tree like that that you won't be shaken by your win the doctor I have a thing that comes along with all kinds of silliness you'll know exactly where you stand in exactly where they treat their that's exactly what up what who you are and what you are and whe when you begin to see who you are yeah then the bride will take a by chance a cv has a germination process when the c code is interrupted in the internal parts of the sea began to taking up water plant that seed in that frontal ground and and just let God where thy will be done and give yourself over God you know that like like I was mentioned last time psalm 42 David you gotta pray it's getting front of God to say nothing sometimes you got to do that you got it just lay down unless you're so we'll just pour out to God so if you come and fill it up and the internal parts of the cpk to take up water that's pee real quick and I see the water that you've heard and make it come to life and then all that word all that preaching that Jesus has done on the day of Pentecost that spirit failing quick and has seen the life and now they can go out and start preaching they can start that those attributes that were in God before the foundation of the world they can begin to speak those attributes and that is the greater works greater works shall you do because they now that Holy Spirit is in them to begin to speak out and give life to people to bring that same new birth because the light of the sea guys to come through the body is coming through the it's coming through these people and Christians and now they become written a Scrooge that what was written in the stars and the pyramid in the Bible now main benefits the least in these people these acts crees all these things that were written in God that were written in the hill this is all kind of a it's a little bit hard to explain me and that's why brother Graham said you'll never really be able to understand without a New York without that teacher to give you a spiritual and extended stays these attributes this word that was written in God and see see the way I'm doing it I'm going back it up now so he came he came down yeah man I like going back up with him back up look this is a Iranians Polycarp and Martin Luther it's written in the US it's only written in the last day no it was written on down who's seven churches they learned that they had it was flicking to them any change that's why I said I'll and the last a little social lesson it when i read this was on there there were they he had those preachers under him they better say exactly what he was preaching you better word on the Martin Luther they better stay exactly with the messenger for your bed just pretty exact because the you're trying to fulfill those attributes fulfill god's word the word for your name maybe if you add anything to it it screws up the plan but get it um it won't bring forth it won't manifest the word for the measurement day now per million church age milligram said let's get us in folks oh this is a google now let us take a scriptural warning here was it not of the days of Moses whom God had vindicated at Cora rose up and let's do that mighty prophet be disputed with Moses and claimed that he has much from God to lead the people on that other share the divine revelation as well as did Moses he denied the authority of Moses and other people back there after they had heard the true word and well acquainted with the fact that a true prophet was vindicated of God I say those people fell for and his gang sayings skip down they have the little at four years old our hands and balls of fire on the platform they are women preachers let women cut their hair wear slacks and shorts and bypass the Word of God for their own creeds and darling doggies now that's what kind of what I'm getting at is that somebody focus on these little all these little tangential things um the Golden Calf schemes all our hands and balls of high on the platform like like you know Elijah when he got in a cave and he was interested in that still small voice which is the word you know that outside it came there earthquake in the fire and all these different things but a lot of things that that people kind of get distracted by the main thing the main focus is the word of God it's still small voice it's something that maybe just seems so insignificant too many people I still small voice is the word of God yeah that they allow women preachers letting women cut their hair or wear shorts and slides and bypass the world their own fries and daughter was that shows what kind of seeds in them some something had something a little bit extra that they can't come to life yeah but not all of people turn on Moses and left the Word of God that's true in this day not everybody turned know the elect stayed within the same is happening today many are leaving the word but some are staying with it but remember the parable of the wheat no takers the tears on TV boo boo for burning these apostate churches are getting down cluster pushing the other ready for the prior to document a shot but the wheat is going to be gathered to the master now there's the answer to the question later on where will they be get any response that where the equals are where the carcasses the Eagles will begin together because the week is being added the master plan I go on where is going to the word that's what we want it back that's well that's what we're going right now this may be seemed like something so far I hear so many people people sprite songs and things about when i get over there then then kissing that and these and others but but God came down here so that his word could be manifesting us right here but and of course you know that is the sign of his coming that he's president he's he's manifesting himself now the word is fully open so that these things can come to pass in it now so Luke 1737 answered send me aware or and instead of them were so ever the body are still there will be Eagles together and and in that comparison scripture where makkac gels in Matthew 24 point 7 24 is the Lightning cometh out of the east and shyness even into the width should social officer the coming of the Son of man how's it going to be how God going to come by over the other order for wheresoever the caucus is there or the Eagles be gathered together all right let's kind of look at some quotes now this is the quote word yummy so am I asking about your scripture he explains it what is the carcass the Cardinals is what the Eagles feed on now I evil is considered in the Bible of profit the profit is the Eagle God called himself an eagle and we're eat less then the believers you see and what is the carcass that they feed on is the word wherever the word is the true nature of the bird will show itself see I ego which ones freshman team establish freshman he's not are not a buzzard he's an eagle you can't give me no denominational stuff to him he's got to have Eagles for you that's the freshest come to me not what Moses doesn't know what somebody else does not want saintly Phoenix knocks calendar right now the meat that's killed for this day and that's the part of Christ that died to make use word be confirmed that's where they get it CC now this is something that many of us here that have been a missed for a long time something is this seems so simple but this is I believe this is like the foundation of the message that everything is centered on the word the whole thing is a is so simple and it goes over are the thing because of the hand of the thing he loves is the wise and the prudent if I be careful and everything because it just just read your Bible every day a break my friend is your church could it be that soon I'll be a little bit right right exactly now there's there's a picture God feeding us know now this is kind of a strange thing to understand but this believe as he died so that we can feast on his body or word and so it's almost it's almost difficult to illustrate by a picture like this here working on the potty word of Christ and crisis fetus will become Christ and jealousy 63 said it is the spirit Lee quickness of flesh profiteth nothing yeah the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the time i was reading through all this almost question places where Bill Graham said run for your life and I believe that's what we should be doing which if you run it and now more than ever run into the word that's what really i scriptures talking about the english money will be gathered to the word and now more than ever if you if you don't or anything now's the time and i get in the Bible getting the scripture and and really prove it out place I like a brother we should approve out what you believe and get in there and study it out and see me if they spend it true you had a picture that yes something well thank you were just we get big money exactly come because God I come back for a little babies owned by four hold on manifest a try I've no that's the best Hakeem you said well gosh is wait for somebody to put to the tape player here to her helper somewhere this is here like she words but he's not coming back for to somebody r22 heard he's going back from primal mature bride so on if thats united with him right behind with him will just is just don't feel like prozac God's only provide a place of worship he said passed from death and creating the Living Word of the Living God jaws only provided plan for his agent sons in the word 82 quickened by the spirit like a spark they slid off of something to make it a lot and seated now in heavenly places in prison 10 already alive and subject to put every promise in the word then what does that do you being a part of God Jeannie if hard words other than a part of God were seated together manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no living among see what he's talking about what about no 11 and one you just a word only seeding in heavenly places in the door where he put his name that Christ Jesus that surprised entire focus is the word only and that's why I Jesus after he after the Spirit came over the ridge already winning their wondrous Annabelle began Tiffany and and he said he had the way you battle him was with the word and written is written and we even go back in words that what is written it is written that you know we're gonna take a by change that it's written up all these things about sickness in the illness but every time this is my king of Jesus yeah that He healed them if you're threatening you can believe it and receive the word let that spirit coming quick and it may collide you Nathaniel devil inhale can take it away then you gotta get on the rock but what's written it up because up it was written if it if it becomes in a manifestation it's an eternal attribute of God listening internal word of god that cannot all Devils inhale can change if they if they pull it all the all the demon stallions and all that hello everyone how do you want to go to stretch on it is the rising of the Sun 143 when we see no denomination I'm a PhD not a lld not a good neighbor but a son of God moldering the image of God with a dynamic power God to answer the requests of this day that he is the same yesterday today and for what's the request of his day to prove to the devil that we won't get one word off what I'm going to do like Ed and get one of those little by little red square you should work that in there somewhere nope it's going to be the fool the forward made manifest that needs to say it see that's what the brass interest in fulfill God's Word ok all of the things must fall away let God's work be fulfilled its like Jesus Jesus in the garden forgotten where people feel he had to die if that's what it takes to be fulfilled through the one don't feel it like like Roberto saying i'm loving someone that you know if he would simulate hail and then if that will make him happy then you know because his interest was in a fulfilling God more pleasing God doing on every to it no matter how many naysayers and what not all right let me finish me Explo thanks the same yesterday and forever the right note he and going to hold you much for his moment is an eagle in the game with he recognizes this real evil recognizes the call God's Word why he's a field by Eagle to Eagle measure the word before the foundation the word to the word were predestinated to the word written for the out you realize your position yes for me I hope that I hope after the sons to listen there's nobody left with a question your mind that scripture means wheresoever the cost is that you will begin again here's the answer right the word to the word onward predestinated to the word written for the out in fact that's where you're going to get the word and if you're not the Word made manifest like that brother political speech let's not like that about the coffee yeah that was good when the bottles are going to fall it's just too late there that's okay you're doing do you pray now do you 1990 with the word around thank you Bob we pray right now it's time to room for your life and I and I think that would be good exercise if anybody want to go go on home to the voice to our website and look through the table good we just put in run for your life and search through the whole of all places where he said that a good little weak it maybe inspire you a little bit to get to running front and oh we got five more minutes but you know the scripture says there's a Corral 4677 come to pass in that day that the lights are not be clear no darn but it shall be one day which they'll be gone a little or nothing all right now hitting that this day whether it's all foggy you can't tell whether somebody's a hard on everybody halfway warm yummy i were there but it shall come to pass that evening time you shall be like now I'm reuniting with the word if we're being grown world light beretta said uh you come to a great great what is the attraction of a mountain but let me just skip down a little bit in the last top of the tree it's turned out to at Angela which is half of our chaplain when I make free kick converted thing come home from conversion living off that same tree this year almost to see the Olay looks like an armed but it ain't but it shall be like when she grows beyond organization who this bride his bride Trina the statute of perfect man that when she gets out of past organization it blooms out of him he'll put four oranges like she was when she went into the ground in DNA shall be like what's this attraction what's this happening fulfilling God's Word there's two witnesses of the old testament of this would happen he's talking about logging old and this summer so good what is the attraction on the mouth the evening light has come God indicating himself what is it it is the fact that God in Christ are one the white how many seeing a white with foam is in talks with revelation 1 rodel do preaching on all this time see the supreme deity supreme authority no other voice Miller dog nothing in him dwells fullness of the Godhead bodily the Angels themselves was his wig Damien what's happened to phone mounts on sensei jobs and firming his word that's what all this noise is about notice this God fulfilling his promise murdered again revelations team 127 and the days of the sounding of seven st. paintings message the missed you dog should be finished time they hit killer mysteries of Revelation the last message for the last 2 change fulfills exactly at this age the day when the Son of man shall be revealed although now skip on down the people still in doubt and as usual the church is just as fun trying and that is the truth amen and you know why I oppose them because their eyesight is on something other than God were at their eyes not single if that I be seeing right now look at God's Word is looking at all the other times but all right then I'm already talked about granite background yes we're here that's what ever you know you can undergo a scroll all things to look at this so many legs is the brother ground wrong I don't like it that he did you've cleared luggage created I don't like it he didn't the news article of the days that didn't list all people that were killed this you can look at you know that they did the same thing to teach us and he says he said you know John came and he didn't you're drinking said this is such a specialist that's about human and the Son of man came and he eaten and drank we caught him a lot of everybody you know he said wisdom is justified were children in other words you you know you're gonna come up with something to criticize anywhere has come up with so many criticized but the main thing is to stay with God's Word and how do you even know what God weren't really talking about how do you stay with God with you must be boring and I think and it starts with as simple as we're being can be baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ such promises of the Utah although your children and so forth and me as an organized also call it starts with repeated let that OSHA just fall away even said where we go and hear the word that you know they they didn't hear much word I therefore the men and women on the outside the doors of that little upper room Peter just priests a little sermon little scheme and summon you killed him the one that you thought was coming to killing and then he told him this the TV open teach to him and they believe they heard that word that receive it and it was flicking tool and that little that little life begin to germinate kemon so we have no excuse we have excellent no excuse for being in doubt for me and still purple and wondering on one of the stars 20 a winner which which church near who's preaching the truth of who is doing that we should we should be I believe now we should be like trees planted by the water that should not be moving from that shall not be moved but not should not but shall I not be rude I got maybe two more minutes so let me just read a few and I was getting hot here yep that fan is really just speak a word as a man confirm the words God to say something is one thing God to do it is another thing God don't need eating interpreter he does his own interpretation go now I put this corner here because that's what he's doing now all these scriptures have been written I think the attributes re-written and you look around some might look around and say well nothing is happening but you know that remove that little boy that went out on the boat with runarounds deacon and he said how can I see God well that Deacon everybody else is with around I off Cena that diga said all i see is God wants guns on the inside how can you look around and say nothing's happened because it's happening to you and I might I might not be aware of what's happening if anybody else to see the life being they manifest remember but as won't see it in yourself and it can't see in yourself and go back to the word go back to your little prayer room until let everything just die out until that life becomes germinated in India going back what I say their message nothing whoever's up there out of the way not speaking Mary you'll ever see you only see that everything so now we've seen a miracle you know that is the truth that is and that's what still most people they look at that place on how far they look to that asking and people with problems whatever my skin problem wrong you know who those would that kind of that steer somebody away from from looking at seeing the word God but that that's exactly right that's the truth that's what stumble people in Jesus day they were saying you're not matter of a phony or whatever and not made a desired yep a man licking himself god I'm saying all these things and and and and they got they need to stumble over the fact that he would heal people own son over Sabbath yeah like my goodness you know how blind can we be much but watching make sure that we're not just one and they come a time when Abraham saw his last night just before so I was burning that was God manifesting himself in the following remain and I got some more folks but I'm best that's pretty much all i would say and I think that as an excellent place to stop back get also really himself ya know
