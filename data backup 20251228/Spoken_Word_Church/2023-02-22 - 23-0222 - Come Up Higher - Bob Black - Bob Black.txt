safe travels and keep in prayer to meetings this weekend the the regular service and just come expect it so tonight I just want to take a little scripture um and and read from Revelation chapter four and uh so let's just go to the altar before we look into the scripture Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather here tonight Lord and and look into your word and we just we ask Lord that you'll just move Among Us here tonight Lord Jesus and that you'll feel that Liberty Lord to to speak to our hearts Lord Jesus and that we'll hear that voice speaking to us Lord Lord not my voice Lord but when yours speaks Lord and things begin to change Lord I pray Lord that you'll just feel at Liberty and move Among Us here tonight Lord and just make it a special night we ask and pray in your name um so Revelation chapter 4 says in verse we'll just read verses one and two it says after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I sh I will show you thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word I think uh you know if you go back into Revelation chapter four is a pretty short little chapter there it's only got a few verses but if you read that it sets up a just a wonderful Sublime scene that uh that maybe maybe tonight if we could just take take ourselves and put ourselves in the position of John there because we know brother brother Brown said that John represents us and he's he's seeing that uh I would think that that John uh got a kind of a preview of everything that everything that we go through and the whole scene unfolding there for him and oh you know if you think if you look back and think about John's life how that there he was at the cross when Jesus told him that you know you need to take care of Mary a woman behold your son son behold your your mother and uh and and Mary went and began to live with John and John take took care of her and and the tradition says that John started up a little uh a little uh he began to write down the the Bible that we read here today even now began to compile all the different books together and and he started getting in trouble because the uh that the emperor said he got wind that he was saying that you need to worship somebody other than the emperor call somebody else uh God and so they got so mad at him that they tried to bowl him on oh but you see he he had a power on the inside that they couldn't bull it out of him and then uh they said well the only thing we can do is we're going to put him in put him on this island all by himself where he had there was other prisoners I'm sure out on this island and all the snakes and all the different kind of things on that island that it's a real miserable situation but in that miserable situation God began to speak to John and so tonight I want to take a little topic of come up higher and you know God God I I think in this day God always wants us to keep moving up higher and a lot of times he'll get you into a spot where you just saw down and you think everything's against you but yeah yeah like like John out on that on that on that island all by himself uh it seemed like he was nobody cared about him God maybe he thought in moments that God had forgotten about him that like is my life really supposed to be wound up and out here on this island I'm supposed to be preaching I've got all this Revelation I've been with Jesus and God put him out on that island so he can speak to him and isn't that how sometimes God wants to do us sometimes he wants to get you into a place where it seems you see it all all dejected and seems like everything ain't going right and God will get you into a place where he can begin to speak to you oh when when you hear the voice of God the voice of God begins to speak to you and woo you and begins to show you things that's greater than anything he anything that the world can give anything any kind of rough times any kind of tribulations it trumps everything you see and you see I think I think that I hear that brother that Jesus was telling trying to show to John that that he wants us to keep going up to think that John that John could look up and see to look up and see a door open up in heaven now if you would just kind of set the set the the stage here that he looked and he saw a door opened up in heaven think about what John was looking at that he was looking at us at a at a painting lay there before him a film strip like it was and he saw he saw the bride gone and he saw that the bride had made herself ready and she was gone oh you know sitting here tonight it seems like sometimes things are rough and things things are you're going life is hard but one day one day the bride is going to be gone one day you ain't gonna be here no more I want to think that in spite of all the heartaches and struggles the all the ups and downs of life one day you're gonna be gone oh and I I think it's just surely it's just right around the corners you can you can see all around the earth the spirit is being poured out on All Flesh as the Bible said but there's a people that have a revelation of their God there's a people that have heard the voice of God and one day we're going to be going to surely it's it's just got to be right around the corner one day we'll turn around and we'll see we'll see Grandma walking through the kitchen one day we'll turn around and we'll see somebody that we love coming through the door and we'll say we've arrived we've made it now it's the hour that I'm in looking for the uh the time that John saw back there when he was in that dark spot in his life on the Isle of Patmos we were rolling around with all the lizards and all the snakes and all the the heat the heat baking them in that sun but yet in that moment God was able to show him a preview of what we're coming to you see I believe I still believe in a Rapture I still believe I still believe that we're marching towards something that's what we're we're going we're every day every step we take faith is being built up higher and higher until one day we're going to see an open door we're gonna we're gonna see that Open Door by Revelation by eyes of faith and brother Brown will say you said the first three chapters of Revelation is about the church oh you think the first three chapters that John saw rolling before him in the vision of of all the church ages and all the sermons preached and all the messengers coming and all those things happening the first three chapters is about the church and the message and the angels of the church and then she disappears right there in the third chapter and she doesn't appear again until the 19th Chapter and the 19th Chapter she returns and between this time God is dealing with the Jews you know in Revelation 19 it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready but to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints ought to think that right now right sitting here in this building there's a bride that's getting herself ready that's clothing herself that's that's the reason you're here tonight on a Wednesday night in the middle of the week that's the reason you're you've come that's because something's drawing you you you want to be made ready you want to get ready you want to be clothed in the righteousness I see your bride's gotta the bride's got to prepare herself she's got to get the clothes off she's got to yield herself she's got a She's Gotta She's Gotta make sure that she's clothed right but be prepared like like you know brother I'm always told that story of the the uh the young man that uh the son of the or the grandson or whatever of the armor of meat packing how he he proposed to that little girl and he made her that promise that one day I'm coming I'm coming back for you and she knew she was hanging on his word she said I'm not worthy I couldn't make a wife to a man like you said because you are used to great things and I know nothing about them I'm poor he said but you are my choice oh so can we put ourselves in that situation tonight that there's there's nothing great about us there's nothing that we can boast of but God made he come down and he chose us he chose us before the foundation of the world and brother Adam said you know you wasn't worthy to be a Christian but you know there wasn't there wasn't nothing you could ever do but he just chose you see it's his goodness his Mercy that he chose you you didn't choose him you know he chose you that's all to think that God God chose you before the founder he knew before the foundation of the world that you would want it that your desire would be for him you never chose him because he wasn't the one that was lost but he chose you because you were the one that needed saving he chose you and brother said he said don't look at your clothes he's telling the story I don't look at your clothes I look at what you are oh thank God that God don't look at our backgrounds he didn't look at where we come from and all our failures and faults and everything but he looks at our faith in him he's looking at what he's made us he's looking at his thought about us before the foundation of the world and he said will you marry me and finally the agreement was made and he said one year from this day I will return you be ready oh you know you tonight you got a promise like that he said he's coming back he said he's coming for you he said one day one day there's going to be a day when the church is gone when the bride is gone and she said he said have that wedding garment on for I will return and marry you right here on these grounds and I'll take you to Chicago to Outer Drive there well you'll have a castle to live in and all this dishwashing will be over and things then but you see that's what John was looking at down through in in the first couple of chapters of book of The Book of Revelation he was looking at a church going through all the dishwashing and all the all the stuff all the heartaches and all the sermons preached and all the song sung and all those things but then one day he saw a church gone he looked up and he saw his eyes was turned from Patmos up to the heavens and he saw that a church had been raptured and I want to declare you tonight one day you're going to look around if you ain't ready and the church is going to be gone so if you ain't ready tonight's the night that you can get ready tonight tonight that you can surrender yourself to God because one day the day is going to come when you look around and you wonder where all the saints were that you used to fellowship with you'll wonder what happened when you see the uh the knee in the news about bombs being dropped and all the all the things that we know is coming because they've been prophesied in the Book of Malachi they've been prophesied in Revelation all these chapters that I'm talking about here that one day the plagues will Begin to Fall one day there's coming a time when the church is going to be going are you going to be going with it one of them he promised that he's coming back he promised it you know it takes a lot of prep work to get for a wedding that's what John was looking at and as he saw all the seven Church ages he was looking at all the prep work he was looking at all the proposing he was looking at all the prepared he was looking at the garments being laid out he was looking at all the invitations being sent out the invitation who will come come unto me all you that labor in her heavy laden people being invited to the wedding and some would not come and some would come I wondered tonight if the invitation is given to you would you come would you be willing to come and maybe maybe tonight you're listening on the internet watch it in tonight and I want to ask you tonight when you come if the invitation is given to you come unto me all you the labor to be Laden and I'll give you rest the invocation has been sent out all down through the seven Church ages but after all these things after all those things that John was looking at after all the songs have been so you think about one day there won't be any more special song one day all the specials that have been sung all the sermons that have been preached will be over after sermons have been preached and and seven churches messages have preached their sermon and all the messages have gone forth and after Hearts have been won and after lives have been lived after testimonies have been given one day one day the bride is going to be gone after all those you know I surely surely we can see that there's brother Brown would say over and over again there's nothing between right now right now where you're standing there's nothing that has to happen between us between right now and the coming of the Lord sometimes we we keep trying to put things in in front of it and say well this has got to happen this has got to happen there ain't nothing else has to happen what's going to happen what's the only thing that's going to happen is the bride has got to prepare herself the bride has got to be made ready that's the only requirement there's nothing else got to happen sometimes we gotta we want to place things in front of that and say well brother Brown's got to come back to preach some more sermons but he already gave us everything we have need of well something else has got to happen you know sometimes we get in our mind well well if I can be if I could just live in a concrete house like they do in Nicaragua then might be ready for the rapture let me let me preach on that for a little bit listen you don't need a concrete house to go in the Rapture when we were down there one thing that really struck me was uh and that that scripture that I read uh I I it didn't come to mind right now but but everybody all around the world was going through the same problems we're fighting the same devil no matter where we are and if you're living in a concrete house you ain't fighting a different devil you're still fighting the same devil and we were down there and we went over we on that little island of omittepi we went over and and we visited with a little brother who had stopped coming to church you just think well uh if I was living in a concrete house I would be more faithful no they still got the same problems people still not coming to church down there in the air condition you think well if I was living with a little dirt floor then I'd be able to overcome but they got people I was talking to some of the ministers down there and they said you can steal down there the little kids will go up onto a top of the hill with their phone and they'll be looking at stuff that they ain't supposed to look at just like they do in the United States oh but if I had a dirt floor then I could really overcome know what you need need to overcome is you need the word of God God has given us the greatest thing it could ever be given for you to overcome you don't need a dark floor the concrete has to overcome you need the word of God the blood of the Lamb to cover you to you to overcome and that's the only thing that you need to get out of here you don't need hard times and rough times to be a Christian you don't need so you don't need nothing else but the word isn't that what God what was unfolded to us in the fifth and The Sixth Seal that there was the word of God was sufficient to justify you and sanctify you to cover you up with his blood and to purify you that's all you need is the word of God and after seven Church ages and after seven Messengers John looking at God moving and building his bride down through seven Church ages by what by the word by the word and some people in the seven churches were rich and some people were poor some people had a lot and some people had a little but they all had the word because that's what you overcome with you ever come by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony that's what you overcome with oh if we could realize that God has given us the greatest weapon in our hands to defeat to overcome everything that the devil throws at us and John was looking at a process down through the seven churches is a process that God was taking the bride through a process he was taking him from Ephesus all the way up to the layout to see you until they would be formed into the village that he could come and manifest himself in the for in the purity of of his word and John was looking at that he was looking at a process he saw in Revelations 4 that process was completed he was looking at Redemption finished after these things after the church age and all this from here after now will be pertaining brother Brown said will take place on Earth after the Rapture of the church see you after the Rapture this is going back now to pick up Israel after the church age after the ages of the church and they the church never appears again until Revelation the 19th Chapter when she returns again with her bridegroom after all of that after all of that you know you think about what John looked at all of that was happening right now all of that songs being sung and sermons being preached and testimonies being given and lives being won and people coming to the Altar and young people going to youth camps and and some giving of their heart to the Lord and some not giving their heart to the Lord some heart being turned softened up and some hearts being turned to stone and all those things but after all that the bride was gone you know the Book of Revelation didn't open up with this scene in Revelation 4. it took a while to get there it took a while if we could just look think about your own life it takes a while it takes a while a while for God to form himself into In His Image and you to to mold you into the place where he can use you it takes a while it takes what does it take it takes seven candlesticks seven Church ages seven warnings all those warning warning constantly warning seven Promises to the Overcomers all those things being played out seven stars that God was sending Seven Stars with seven messages seven messages and all those things and now the church is gone and The Last Enemy has been defeated you know on on the day of Pentecost when Peter began to preach his message he gave that promise that one day one day every enemy is going to be defeated you know there's a promise to that you can lay hold to that if you've got an enemy besetting you in your life you just take God at his word and you'll see that enemy to be defeated uh Peter was quoting Psalm 110 when he said on the day of Pentecost Peter was quoting it when he said the Lord said unto my Lord sit out in my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool until every enemy is under his feet every enemy is under your feet and what's The Last Enemy is death oh you see that's what John saw in Revelation chapter four that every enemy had been defeated somebody had overcome death somebody had overcome every sickness somebody had overcome covert somebody had overcome cancer somebody had overcome tumors somebody had overcome every everything every foul idea that the devil could put in their minds somebody had overcome pornography somebody had overcome or you you just listened somebody overcome alcohol somebody overcome cigarettes and he was looking at that somebody overcame because there's a promise in the Bible and Hebrews chapter 10 it says but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of God from his more forth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool I think that God that there is no enemy too difficult there is no enemy too difficult tonight on this Wednesday night she's kind of sitting here trying to stay awake trying to listen after you've been working hard all day working hard all week There's No enemy too difficult every enemy has already been defeated oh you think that should give us Faith here tonight that Christ defeated every enemy on the cross if we can just lay hold of that in faith and believe that the mighty conqueror has already gone before us and he's already conquered in Exodus chapter 14 it says the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace the Lord shall fight for you and you ain't got to say nothing and you ain't got to do nothing the Lord is the one that fights our battles in Deuteronomy 28 the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face oh oh if we could keep these scriptures in front of us it would give us confidence the Lord shall cause thine enemies to be spent before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before these seven ways down through seven Church ages the Lord has routed the enemy and ever turned he's caused the enemy to flee at the word of the testimony of the of Believers that will take the message of their day and believe what God sent to them you see if you believe what God said to you one day you're going to be gone if you could just take what God Said and lay hold to it one day you're going to be gone but now after all those things John is looking at a scene where the bride has gone up and death has been defeated oh you I just want to meditate tonight on what John saw that he saw the bride going up not down oh if our conversation could be like that it doesn't it just kind of get you down when you get around somebody and they're they're just they just they're they're talking down and they're they're punching down all the time well I don't like the way you look and I don't like this and I don't like the way the church is run and I don't like all but you this I thank God that we've got a message that pulls us up we've got a positive gospel you know brother said a Christian is an optimist why because we're always going up you always got to be going up I I believe I believe it's possible all things are possible to them to believe but this is not defeated bride we don't have a message of defeat we have a message of cheer to build us up we have a message that keeps us going up keeps us moving on up that there's no going back there's no turning around there's no stopping there's no pausing we're constantly climbing we're going up you can you can't keep the bride down that's what the Holy Ghost is for that if if you've got the Holy Ghost this afternoon and you were to die on the way home you can't keep it down down because one of these days you're coming up from the graves one of these days you're coming up you can't keep the Holy Ghost down it's coming up sooner or later and one day this Holy Ghost is going to take the bride into the skies she's going to leave one day it's coming you can't keep her in the ground you can't keep her down because she's got a positive word she's got a positive confession that's why I believe tonight that the bride is going up we're coming up we're going up that's where the word is taking you the word is taking you up you know the word's not taking you down the word is taking you up into fellowship with him and I thank God that we don't have all drawn up Sourpuss message that tells us how bad we are or how miserable we are or how backwards we are or how many problems we got thank God we got a message we got something to preach tonight we don't all the other the other morning I I woke up and I was just laying in bed and I was thinking about all the sermons that have been preached about going around and around Mount Horeb and I began to I began to just meditate about all all the all the fighting and all the stewing and all the going around and around and just you the sermons just being preached over and over again about just being born again over and over and over again and just staying in one spot and I begin to think oh God God please don't don't let us be guilty of the things that the age is past or guilty of if others have been guilty of going around and around Mount Orab and just staying in one spot I I don't want to be guilty of that in my life and I want tonight to challenge you that you'll have a renewed fervor to not go around matter of don't let that be your testimony but let's keep putting one foot in front of the other and press on toward the mark of the high calling in Christ and you know a lot of times you've got to press on you'll get to a place in your life where you just you just feel like I don't know what to do next seems like it's so deep for me I don't know I don't I really understand these deep things but you've got to press on don't stagnate don't just don't just settle down and just keep going around and around that's why I believe we've got a message tonight to preach that we don't have to go around and around in circles we don't have to just keep preaching the same old repent and you must be born again that must be preached but it's we've got to go up we've got to go higher we've got to go on to the Capstone Revelation listen to the Capstone has got to be preached you see where are you getting this from Brother Bob I'm getting it from what Paul said because he's the one that said therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on into Perfection let us go on from this little baby form things let's go on into a Capstone understanding let's go on to where we can preach the seals well we don't have to look at our notes let's go on to where we can preach the statue of a perfect man we don't have to keep keep relying back on the on our notes over and over again but preach it not lay it again the foundation of repentance from dead works and the faith or God of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment all those things have to be preached but let's go on to perfection oh I surely God did not call me in this age to preach a watered-down gospel of conspiracy theories and fanciful stories and psychology of some good thoughts and ideas on how to be successful and popular or to be happy but God has called us in the hour to preach what brother Branham gave us to preach what brother Brandon preached he cut his message was The Headstone and if God sent the message of The Headstone then that's what we've got to preach somebody's got to preach it somebody's got to preach it sooner or later if the head is Christ and the head has come let's preach it I want to ask you tonight do you believe the seals are open yeah do you believe the head has come you know if you don't believe that then what are you confessing if you don't believe that then you're confessing something that you're confession is something way off in the future or you keep putting things in front of us something something way in front of us one of these days one of these days somebody is going to be able to live it I believe somebody's able to live it now one of these days somebody's going to be able to manifest these virtues no somebody's manifest I believe all around the Earth in Nicaragua and Ecuador and in the jungles everywhere all around in Africa somebody's able to live this and it ain't far off it ain't way off in the future there's a present we have a present God a present tense God that's able to live it right and down man ooh you cheat keeps hearing people preach well you ain't got it I ain't got it nobody ain't got it somebody's got it you ain't got it nobody ain't got it that's see that's a down message I I believe in a message that that's pulling us up somebody's gonna have uh you believe what I'm saying tonight somebody's gonna have this guy I believe this is a gospel where somebody is available to somebody if you own it you can have it I see you tonight if you don't believe if you don't see that the seals are open if you don't truly see the understanding of the seals then that's why it's got to be preached it's got to be priests somebody's got to preach the Book of Revelation somebody's got to preach to these mysterious things and you know I was thinking the other day about how brother Brown said the things that will get a minister a lead up get them astray is women money and popularity and popularity I think is tied in maybe maybe this is my opinion tonight we all just bear with me but I think it's tied in with preaching the Capstone because you preached the Capstone it ain't gonna be popular people want people want to hear a message that'll make you jump around and run up and down the aisles and and get people up at the altar but they don't want to hear they don't want to hear the Book of Revelation they don't want to hear Daniel 70 weeks they don't want to hear any deep things but you see it's deep things that will get you in the Rapture it's deep things what will prepare you and and the bride wants to be clothed the bride wants to be clothed with the righteousness of Christ so it's got to be preached God's got a bride that is going up God's got a bride that is going out of here and that's why John looked and he said in Revelation chapter 4 after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven a door was opened in heaven in Revelation chapter 3 verse 8 a promise was given to the Church of Philadelphia I Know Thy Works behold I've sit before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and that's not denying my name aren't you glad for a door that no man can shut for a door that is set before you and anybody is freely available if you believe that that door is sitting there open that you can step through it and no man can shut it oh we thought we sing that song that's joy that I have the world didn't give it to me there was no man that gave me this joy that I got this joy that I got the world can't take it away cause no man no man gave it to me no man can take it away this Revelation that I have the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away there's no man that can take away the Revelation I have there's no devil that can take away the Revelation you have there's no man there's no devil there's no body that can shut this door because it's open he said in John chapter 10 I am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheik did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and and find Pastor you uh maybe maybe tonight you're wondering what is this door that John's all well this door is Christ because Jesus said I am the door I am the door of the cross in John chapter 14. he said Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so if you want to if you want access to God you've got to come through Jesus because he is the door he is the way he is he is the only access to eternal life how you get through that door by faith faith is the thing that opens up the door in Matthew chapter 16 Jesus told Peter he said I'll give unto thee the kings of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven and boy did Peter loose it on the day of Pentecost when he took those keys on the day of Pentecost and he began to preach the Bible says that then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ I I want to ask you this afternoon how was how was Peter opening up the door how was he unlocking eternal life to all those that were gathered around he was sharing with him a personal revelation of Jesus Christ and the revelation of Jesus Christ will open up the door in every case oh if you've got a revelation of Jesus Christ it'll unlock every mystery it'll unlock every Ever every benefit every promise is laying there in the scripture if you if you can look into the scripture with a revelation of what it says it'll open it up to you brother Ryan said Faith holds the key and the key is scripture Faith takes the little hinges of the scripture and unlocks the glories and good of God out to his people Faith holds the key that unlocks Christ to the people unlocks it reveal it reveals it Faith what's Faith doing faith is unlocking faith is opening up to you a revelation of who Jesus Christ is n't that what the new birth is a revelation a personal revelation to you of who Jesus Christ is I know sometimes that that boggles our mind what what do you mean a revelation of Jesus Christ well see and when he when he begins to open up the scripture to you he'll start from the feet and I'll make his way all the way up to the head until you can see Christ perfectly represented in his word from cover to cover from the beginning to the end from the feet to the head and then he'll reveal to you your the beginning of your journey and the end of your journey what's the end of your journey now what we're talking about Revelation 4 1 that he looked he looked John looked and saw a bride was gone brother Brown said he said to this church age I've set you before an open door talking to them about the Methodist he said to that myth to the Methodist Church age they turned away from it when an organization but I've set before you an Open Door now after they had received sanctification he said I'll put the open door which is the Holy Spirit by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body which is Christ he sent that message before the Methodist church and they turned aside from it they come up to sanctification and refuse the Holy Ghost remember that that Open Door how do you get into Christ by one spirit Holy Spirit which is Christ's Spirit we've entered in not by handshaking not by sprinkling but by one Holy Ghost baptism we are all baptized into one body and made partakers of that body one Holy Ghost baptism into that door so this afternoon do you want Christ if you want Christ just take him at his word I I challenge you to take him in his word and see what happens you take God at his word and something will happen you have faith in God and watch the door open up to you he this door set in heaven that door when he looked up he saw the Lord Jesus he looked up he wasn't looking down he looked up oh if we can just look up keep our eyes on Jesus despite all the all the I know I keep preaching all the weird stuff that's happening there's a lot of weird stuff I was telling my wife I was watching a preacher a Baptist preacher and he was preaching about he got to preaching about how what a blessing it was to look thou on the first row of his church and see a a young couple and and and the ex a man with his ex-wife sitting next to his newly married husband and I thought what uh travesty this we're living in Sodom and Gomorrah and you begin to look around at all the weird things that are happening on the Earth all the weird stuff and you you can get you can get off track if you start doing that but keep you if you keep your eyes on Christ oh I I want to encourage you tonight don't don't set your eyes on the strange things that your neighbors doing or that other people are doing or you see Ministry is doing around the message around the world but just keep your eyes on Christ that's what John was looking up he looked up and he saw Jesus and he his eyes were turned from he was he was looking first at the scene of all those things that are happening on on Earth he was looking at seven Church ages and seven Messengers and preaching their sermons and and songs being sung and testimonies and lives and all those things that we've been going over he was watching he had been his eyes were on Patmos down on that island of looking down at all the all the the Heat and the the snakes and all that stuff going on but then he now he looks up and he sees something went on Earth here these seven churches dialed down through the church ages and then he looked up what was what was going on down through seven Church ages a bride was being called out a bride was being prepared the truth was marching on like that wheel in the middle of the wheel was going with her traveling she's traveling she's moving on and then after he got through seeing the church ages after that after the church ages has ceased he heard a voice that voice was the same voice that that same voice that was walking in the seven golden candlesticks that same voice that was walking in the heaven golden candlesticks in Revelation chapter one it said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks that voice where that voice came from that's the one that showed John the mystery of them seven golden candlesticks he's the one he's the one that was holding the Seven Stars he's the one that had the white wig he's the one that had the feet like brass and eyes like fire and all those symbols he's the one that gave the gospel he's the one that gave the message he's the one that's been speaking through those seven Church ages that John was looking at he's the one that spoke through the seven Church age Messengers it's his voice and I want to ask you this question have you heard his voice you know John John was able to recognize that voice he turned he wanted to see that voice because he knew that he had heard that voice before he had he had walked down the shores of Galilee with that voice for three and a half years he knew what that voice sounded like but I wondered tonight sitting here if we'd be able to recognize that voice when the strange Doctrine is preached from behind the pulpit can you say well I don't know I don't recognize that voice or when when you hear the truth being preached can you say something stirs my soul that's that I recognize that voice I know that voice oh you realize one of the greatest gifts there is is to be able to discern not the level of discernment like brother Brandon have but be able to tell the truth tell when something's true oh you realize when you're sitting in church and you can shout amen that's one of the greatest blessings there's a lot of people in the world that can't tell when something's true or not there's a lot of people that can't tell the truth but when you can tell that John could tell that voice he knew that voice John chapter 10 says verily verily I say unto you that he that entereth not the by the door under the Sheepfold book climb with up somewhere some other way the same as a thief and a robber the bridegroom stands at the door and all comes up with an invitation the bridegroom is standing at that door and if you've heard the voice to give you an invitation you've got a right to come to the door and say I have been invited oh you think about when Esther's and Zach just got married and you think about how they they kept begging for all the RSVPs please RSVP I'm inviting you I've given you an invitation now I want to know if you're coming now in the in the old days they get that invitation and they come and they the the the bridegroom will be standing at the door and to receive them and they'd come up and they'd say you if you didn't have an invitation you couldn't come eat it but if you've got an invitation in you go and you go and and John chapter six he said no man could come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day there is your invitation no man can come to me except the father oh you see a lot of times we come to church and we hear the preacher's voice and maybe it's a tired Wednesday night Sherman and everybody's like well that's just brother Bob up there but you know my see my voice my voice won't help you none oh but when you hear the father's voice when the father speaks to you and begins to identify with you that this sermon that you hear tonight that's for you that this promise tonight that's for you and you've got an invitation that you can receive it if you want it if you want it you can go through the door of Christ you can come to the door and you see then you can come boldly come boldly to the throne of grace come boldly and say well I've got an invitation why not because you've heard from Brother Wade or from Brother Bob or brother Aaron and brother Louise but I've heard from my father he gave me invitation he said I could come no man could come except the father was just sent me sent me drawing and I'll raise him up at the last today oh but when the father draws when the father not because the Deacon prepped you on the shoulder and said you need to go up to the altar it's time for you to pray not because your mama and daddy tapped you on the shoulder and said you need to go on up there but when God draws you it's written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father come and doesn't cometh unto me the father told me I was invited have you heard of the father tonight have you learned of the father have you got your invitation come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden what better invitation than that if you've got if you're lading down with all these burdens and things come come and he'll take them away from him he'll take them off of you he'll give you he'll give you a burden bear they'll walk beside you and help help you along life's way John chapter 16 says these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs but I shall show you plainly of the father of the father see a man can't draw you a man can't call you a man can't give you this imitation this invitation comes from God and when you've got this invitation you can come with confidence the invitation John chapter 4 Jesus answered and said unto her when he was talking to that little woman at the well if thou knew it's the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldstas have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water all you think about Jesus talking to that little woman at the well saying if you knew who you were talking to then you would ask me for water that's that's the invitation that I'm talking about tonight if you can recognize who's talking to you tonight that it ain't just some man behind the pulpit that God's speaking to you giving you an invitation to come to come freely foreign the bridegroom has so many guests that he's going to have and he gives out all these invitations he knows he knows he's going to accept you don't want to turn down this invitation an invitation to the marriage Shepherd of the Lamb oh you think about when you're invited to this wedding you come up with your invitation and you you meet the bridegroom at the door he's standing there and he's he's going to give you something what's he going to give you he's going to give you a robe you come up with your invitation I've been invited I have my invitation and he puts his robe around your shoulders and you know what that robe does is it covers up all that past covers up the outside covers up that drug addict that that person that was all living like the world it covers it up the bridegroom stood at the door to receive the invitation and each one that come with an invitation the bridegroom that he he put a robe on everyone that come in as identification put a robe on everyone that's good or bad rich or poor all looked alike this robe is none other than the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the robe and it covered up what they're outside had been that road where the holy ghost covers up all your past it covers up all those mistakes you made aren't you aren't you glad for a gospel like this you've got a robe that can cover up all that pass [Applause] oh oh once that pass is covered let's just you can forget about it because God's forgotten about it forget about it because it's already covered he's covered it over oh thank God that we've got a covering like Ruth there when she laid there at the feet of Boaz and she wanted to be covered over and he spread his skirt over her and that was typing the Holy Ghost it covers over all your past to redeem you by the blood of the Lamb to cover you oh if you feel that tug on your heart when the gospel is preaching being preached that's the greatest thing in the world to know that God wants to robe you with his righteousness with the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't matter if you're in Nicaragua or the United States it don't matter if you're rich or poor old or young it doesn't matter there's a robe for whoever has an invitation Whoever has an invitation my brother Adam said then if the wedding garment is the baptism of the Holy Spirit how are we going to be represented any other way if the first church age had to come by the door Christ Jesus be baptized in the Name of Christ Jesus Christ receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to put on the wedding garment how we come in any other way if you come by the Methodist by the Baptist or the Pentecostals or any other denomination you will be bound and cast out into outer Darkness you've got to come by Christ Jesus the way the door of the truth and the life one day that voice is going to call one day that church that bride is going to be gone one day the church will be called up one day the plays are going to be found or the plagues are going to fall and people are going to be bound up and cast into out of Darkness where will you be found so in Revelation 4 1 it says the voice which I heard was as it were of trumpet talking to me that same voice was speaking up in heaven y'all I know how it is on Wednesday night as soon as it gets to eight o'clock everybody starts running down so I'm not going to keep you late that same voice was speaking up in heaven come up here and I'll show you what's fixing to take place I'll tell you what's fixing to take place it's the bride's gone the bride's been called up so now now everything changes the scene changes because now it's a seat of judgment not a seed of Mercy anymore not a seed of Grace but now he's telling John I'm gonna show you what's going to happen now come up here and I'll show you what's fixing the takes place take place all these Christ rejecting Godless Sinners I'm going to pour my wrath out upon them it's going to be a terrible thing you know when these things have been prophesied in the Bible this coming I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord aren't you glad he gave us a message to call us out to give us a way of Escape so that we don't have to face those things I I'm so glad that God gave us a message to know that we're not going through the tribulation I don't want to go through the tribulation I surely if you knew if you understood what the tribulation was going to entail then you wouldn't want to go either just as certain as this book is written there's going to be people stand there and be asked for a reason what was the reason why you rejected it what was the reason why you turned it down brother Brown was saying it behooves us as Sons and Daughters of God to check up on ourselves every hour of the day off so think about that now tonight when you go home and you're riding in your car and I think sometimes you know you might get in a spot where you're like well I'm sure I'm sure I know but let's check up let's check up and check our life check up our actions check up make sure make sure that we're in line with what the word says that the bride is supposed to be doing in this day check up on ourselves every hour of the day let's not get to a place of arrogance and boastfulness but just keep humility is the way to go up come up here I showed you the church ages on earth now come up here and I'm going to show you something take place up here Christ had left Earth he had gone up into Glory the church age was through his Spirit was finished here he was calling for John to come up and immediately he said I was in the spirit you know when you hear the voice of God speak to you something happens you know brother Ryan we've heard we've all read all those quotes where you want you want to get get in the spirit get in this how are you going to get in the spirit you begin to meditate upon God's word think about what his promises are to you because when the voice of God speaks to you something's going to happen that's what that's why he got in the spirit because he heard the voice of God when you hear God speak now not the minister not your pastor not your mom and dad but when God speaks Everything Changes oh you think about Samuel laying there in his bed one night and he thought he thought it was the priest calling him but he began to realize it wasn't the priest it was it was God calling him Samuel Samuel I got something for you to do or if we could get in that mode tonight to realize that God's calling you because he's got a purpose in your life that he wants to see fulfilled he wants to see he wants to see you live for him he wants to see you walk for him he wants to see you do something for him in your life I want to think that tonight tonight you could go home a changed person that tomorrow when you wake up tomorrow you could live for God and the people that you encounter at your school and the people that you work with that they can see different person somebody that's living for God oh that's that's what God is calling calling us to tonight brother Brown would say he'd say did it happen to you like that it did to me and I've never been the same since did it happen to you like that I can say that it happened to me like that I heard the voice to God one day I heard the voice of God speak to me and it changed my life I was never the same since when I heard the voice you know many times I would sit in church when I was a young man and I'd sit there and I'd fall asleep and I'd I'd wish the service was over and I'd get so excited when when the preacher would close their Bible because that meant we could go and get out of there real quick but one day that was me that was me hearing the preacher but one day I heard the voice of God speaking and it changed everything when you hear the voice of God you won't be different you'll be different you'll be different all right and his sheep are going to hear his voice his sheep are going to be able to recognize that voice his sheep are going to be able to sit in the congregation and say that is the voice of God speaking to me oh oh and you can recognize it it's God speaking to you giving you something that you can overcome with that his sheep will hear his voice John chapter 10 it says to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadeth him out oh when God calls you he don't just call you but he calls you by name he calls your name right out of the Bible today if you'll hear his voice Harden not your hearts is in the provocation if you'll hear his voice is what Paul said if you don't Harden your heart but listen to him listen to that voice speaking to you you know it sounds crazy today to think that God can speak to a human's heart you go out you try that go out to people and tell them well God told me something and they'll they'll look at you like what but I believe that God can still speak to a human heart and and all my I'll say like this tonight that you must hear the voice of God you must hear the voice of God oh would you really realize what that voice of God means you're you'll read the opening of the first seal different you'll read you'll read a revelation four different when you hear the voice to God what does that voice of God speaking God's speaking to you that this this tonight is for you that this sermon is for you that the promise of the Holy Ghost is for you that the Capstone is for you that the seals are for you and it's the voice of God speaking for you that I've got a promise staying there in the Bible for you and you've got to accept it the voice of God is your invitation and when you hear the voice of God tell you to do something it'll tell you it'll take you to move it'll tell you it's time to get up and do something it'll tell you it's time to get up and claim it time to get up and claim your healing it'll tell you that this is the thing that you've been looking for this is the thing you've been looking for all your life when the voice of God speaks to you to let go that in your heart come unto me this is is that is what the voice of God will speak to you in John chapter 5 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word if you hear my voice and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's passed from Death unto life verily verily I say unto you the hours coming and now he is when the Dead the dead shall hear is the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live now what's he talking about in in that verse right before that he said if you hear my word and believe believeth continue in faith believing you've got eternal life and you've passed from Death unto life you've passed you were dead and now you're alive and now in the next verse he says when the dead hear that voice they that hear shall live oh you think about that tonight he's sitting here in this congregation if you're dead in your sins and trespasses that you can spring to Life by hearing the voice of God preach to you by hearing the word of God and one day if you die and go down in the ground that voice that you heard is going to cause you to come up from the ground and if you don't die if you if you tear if you if you continue living until one day you come to the fullness the full stature with all the bride around the world one day that voice that you heard is going to catch you up and you're gonna live with him forever oh you think you think all those things that John John Saul he was he was looking at you he was looking at what we're going through right now he's looking at what's going to happen to the bride John was a type of the Rapture church he was a type of you he was a type of you just like Enoch was a type of you just like all these things that we read about are a type of you immediately after the church age is over this layout of seeing in church age then comes the rapture the church goes up like John did into the presence of God he said John I can't talk to you down there no more because I've left down here he's gone he's left down there down here so he said I've come up higher come up here with me come up here with me because I got some things to show you oh you see the word of God ain't taking us down he's taking us up you've been going up your whole Christian Journey up up up up up and one day like John come on up here and tonight I want to invite you let's go up come up when you look in the Book of Revelation you come you're coming up come up look look through John's eyes let's look through John's eyes and see what he saw you know brother said Paul was called up to the third heaven was forbidden to tell about it he got called up and he saw all sorts of things open up to him but he couldn't come back and tell it and first in second Corinthians he said I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I can't tell God knows such in one caught up to the third heaven John was caught up and wrote all these things in Mysteries and symbols but now it's revealed God sent us a prophet to preach the seals to us so it would be revealed in the last days so we could look in the Bible and read it like a newspaper so we can look and see we we know what these things represent we oh to think what a blessing it is to be able to read them and know what the Seven Stars are and the seven churches and to read and know what the voice of God is and what the open door is it's revealed now it wasn't revealed in those days but it's revealed now brother Brown said as we go along and I'm not I really am not going to keep you long so y'all just hang on with me just y'all okay just for a few more minutes see I after I asked for permission and y'all gave it thank you John was a type of the Rapture Church he's a type he's a type of you sitting right here now to everyone that hears this word John represented him John think about think about that when you read the book of Revelation that John represented you John was a representative of the blood of Jesus Christ testimony of the word he was a witness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with a personal fellowship with Christ now if you've got a personal fellowship with Christ sitting here tonight that John was a type of you he represented the entire church that every man woman boy or girl that ever believed in Christ accept him on the same grounds he'll be summoned someday come up hither be called up before the tribulation John had an opportunity to see like a like see all the film strip played out to see how it was all going to end out he had an opportunity to see the rehearsal you know brother Ryan said that Cecil B in the middle when he when he preached that uh what priest when he when he made that movie The Ten Commandments he invited all these ministers to come and see the movie before it was released so they had a chance to sit there and watch the movie to see how it was going to turn out before it was released to everybody just like John was had an invitation to come and see the whole film strip play out before it actually happened he saw the preview he saw it just as though he lived on Earth and saw the whole church Ages come to pass to the coming of the Lord the whole book of Revelation he saw it God showed him the church age and the coming of the Jews and the pouring out of the plagues the Rapture and he saw all these things happen just as though he lived right down through the whole thing and he saw it all happen he showed him the film that he's turning and it says the the first voice which I had heard was that was as it were a trumpet talking with me there was a voice that called him the same voice that said to John come up as the same voice that'll turn some of the church someday the same voice that someone John to come up is the same voice that someone's lit dead Lazarus out of the grave it's the same tonight and I will just call the musicians up and we'll close on this that clear sounded trumpet said Lazarus come forth they're a man dead and rotten shook itself and come out of the Grave walking nothing uncertain about that is there brother no uncertainty to there there's nothing uncertain about the voice of God and brother Brown said this and we'll close on this that it's the same thing tonight when a clear sounding voice says sinner repent I'll give you eternal life repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the summons there's nothing uncertain about it let's stand to our feet and just Worship the Lord there's nothing uncertain about it when you hear the voice of God if you haven't heard that voice of God I just pray that that you don't get any rest that that God will put you into a place of desperation a lot of times we're afraid to pray that way about our kids but oh if you gotta gotta break got to get you to a place where you're just so desperate to hear something from God you know we're we're a needy people we need we need God we need God and if you need tonight there's a God here that'll answer whatever your need is if you need healing if you need salvation if you need prayer there's a God here that can come on this scene for you you loving tonight amen let's sing something dreams [Music]
