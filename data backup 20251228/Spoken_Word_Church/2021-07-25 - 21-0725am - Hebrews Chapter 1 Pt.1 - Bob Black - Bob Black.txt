========================================

all right if the brothers could pull up in the back uh hebrews chapter one i was kind of looking for a topic to talk about and uh hebrews as a good weighty subject to kind of go through and has got a lot of things packed in here so um maybe like yeah i think one of jesus's parables was talking about the how the bible is like a scribe's got a treasure box and you can pull out things in your treasure box and just kind of start unpacking things so um this morning maybe we'll look into the treasure box and just pull things out and go through i'm going to be careful with the time and wave at me if i all right so you know brother branham i was i was reading through the he preached several sermons on hebrews and i was reading to uh the first one um where he kind of outlined kind of kind of gave a good background on hebrews and he talked about uh you know that paul was the writer of the book of hebrews and a lot of people don't know if he wrote it or not and and uh because it was so grammarized and you know there's a lot of comparisons between the life of the things that paul wrote and the things that he did how he he uh wrote many things that they could read about in the early church and at the all the a good chunk of the new testament and then brother branham preached and we can read and and you there's a lot of comparisons between those two and and um the the first church age in the in this last church age and i think it's interesting that you know brother branham i had the the church age book which was grammarized and kind of polished up and that's one of the the things with the heat book of hebrews it was it was a polished kind of form of greek and that's one of the way the reasons why people say well i don't know if who the author was it doesn't seem like it's quite written the way that some of the other things that paul wrote because it's polished up it's grammarized but we know that that thank god for a prophet we know that that paul was the author of it so in the book of hebrews brother branham said it's paul's key letter and he was trying to show the hebrews separating the old testament and showing that the old testament was a shadow or type of the new it's a shadow it's kind of like you know look look here look at what that is and then we look over here and see what this is and the old testament you can they had the law and and lay down all the things kind of like it got you in prison and so paul's showing now you're in prison you need a way out of prison and he's and he's he's kind of showing the difference between you you got in prison you're like behind prison bars you've broken the law you you've you've made a mistake and now you're in prison and so then he begins to show he begins to open up here's the way out of prison and begins to point the way to jesus christ and he lays out that framework of now i'm going to show you who jesus is and and why he's greater than in in in the first chapter why he's greater than all the angels all the prophets all the ministers that have spoken this man is greater than all of those things that maybe you think you have an understanding of the hebrews that he's talking to you by by your understanding of the the things that you've studied now he said the the law was a type of the grace but law had no saving power in it the law was a policeman the policeman put you in jail but you see it taking grace to get you out of jail amen now you know brother branham when he when he outlined we'll get the description just a second but just to put some background he was given some perspective on on paul was saved and then he went off for a long time to three years or so to study and and and brother brown said he came out of that that period of study realizing that the church needs to be balanced and he said this book of hebrews was was really to kind of establish balance and the the reason why we need balance and and he's outlines this in the in that message that he preached on hebrews he said now on this side when people get converted their minds is sit right on christ and if they're just a little scholarly and don't keep under prayer they'll get real cold and stiff and starchy and indifferent and then if they're just a little bit nervous if you don't watch they'll just get radical and wild on this side seat they go into sensations and everything so there's the two complex the two extremes to get real cold and starchy or to get real wild and fanatical he said but now but the real church is a real sane gospel right in the middle of the road it's not cold and starchy neither is it fanaticism it's a real good old warm gospel heartfelt love of god going right down the middle of the road calling from both sides amen that's right and see now paul he said now paul wanted to get this church right in the middle of the road so he went and studied three years on the scriptures that he knew therefore paul wrote the bigger part of this new testament so paul's objective was to get the church balanced to establish them in the scripture so they wouldn't go off too far on this side wouldn't go far on that side but they know what they're believing he said now notice now we're going to start getting this background now where he's at writing it from prison and he's had all this experience but first this experience was first proven and this is his key letter to it this is his key letter romans and ephesians and so forth have their place but this is the key letter so the theme of the very first chapter he said now the whole first chapter is exalting jesus and separating him from being a prophet this is not just an ordinary prophet this is this is a god prophet he said that's the whole thing now i'll try to get to it just as quick as can now so we won't stay too long he said the first chapter is separating jesus from any prophet or any law or so forth and showing who jesus is so the first the whole book of hebrews is showing the superiority of of this new revelation the new testament and it's showing that the superiority of christ so that lays the background to get into hebrews chapter one so let's dive in and start unpacking some things in hebrews chapter one verse one it says god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets so god in a lot of different ways a lot of different times spake it's so who's it doing the speaking it's actually god doing the speaking and he spoke to the father and the fathers were were the all the moses and elijah and all them the we talk about the patriarchs being the foundation all those back back there that's who he that god was actually speaking to and he spoke to them through prophets so so again if you go now go to verse 2 and he starts saying now this man that i'm talking about is greater than all of these prophets all these men that we read about he and he's again he's speaking to the hebrews now you know about moses and you know about elijah you know about daniel and all those but this man is greater than all those all those prophets so in the old testament he gave his message through prophets so let's let's just dive into that now what what is a prophet and and you know sometimes we kind of forget what a prophet is your prophet is not just like a a good person that came on the on the scene and and somebody that we read about like a a a tale or whatever now now brother brown i just wrote some things down that he said about prophets he said now now first of all a prophet is going to be when a prophet comes on the scene with a message they're going to be rejected right as that's one one thing to look out for and he said never in all the history of the world did ever the church produce a prophet never did the church produce a prophet he said search it in the old testament new testament or in this day and the latter day showed me any prophet was ever raised out of the church in the last day right no prophet ever came out of the the group think of that day it wasn't ahab and jezebel that produced a prophet it was it wasn't babylon that produced the prophet of daniel they they all came out with a message straight from god that contradicted everything that seemed like the world of that day believed he said show me one ever come up out and showed me one time that a prophet a real servant of god that the ecclesiastical system of the world didn't condemn now that's one thing even when jesus began to preach he began to he began to blast the people of that day for for uh their their ancestors the that had killed the prophets and now he was saying now you're guilty of doing the same thing right you're you white you go out and white watch the tombs of the prophets and and your fathers are the ones that actually put them in the in the grave and so in matthew 23 for example he said woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets if they're saying if we've been back there we would not have been doing what they didn't realize they were actually doing there at that same time wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that you are the children of them which kill the prophets my that's straight talk right there but you can see how prophet that always has that characteristic of rejection a reject being rejected uh uh and so jesus is blasting that so what is the prophet amos 3 7 surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret un under his servants the prophets so if you look online the definition of prophet just looking at a dictionary is somebody who speaks in behalf of and interprets the will of a super supernatural being a prophet is actually speaking the will of god they're actually speaking and interpreting what god wants done often rebuking or predicting events or an authoritative person who receives and communicates a message from god now do you think you think about what a privilege it is to have heard a prophet in this day to have heard direct from god a message that is not like stand alone but can be compared back to scripture and then actually gives the correct interpretation of scripture like the things we're reading about in hebrews and he said a prophet now these are the things that brother brahm said a prophet is a vindicated person i've indicated me that's proven it's proven out like for example when you hear if you hear a prophet say something's gonna happen there's gonna be a tornado or watch out there's gonna be somebody's gonna die or whatever then hold on a second see if it comes to pass and when those things begin to come to pass then you know it's proven out or for example if god actually has his picture taken when somebody then that's vindicated if you know you're in a service with with whether a prophet is speaking and he says watch out there goes the angel of the lord and it begins to move through the building and people begin to shout and rejoice wherever that angel of the lord is or people come up on the platform and you know that the presence of the angel of the lord is there and and he says he identifies it and begins to speak things in people's lives then you know it's vindicated because it's proven out a prophet is a vindicated person from birth coming down with the word of the lord a prophet means to give a personal experience under inspiration or foresee something he says see what a prophet is for he's not a healer he's to find out the will of god for you to find out the will of god so he's not a healer he's to find out the will of god for you and then if you can find out by by kind of opening up the scripture and showing that it's the will of god for you to be healed then you have confidence and you believe and you can receive your healing he said a prophet is different they're born a prophet and they come up prophets all that they say must be true every time or cannot be recognized as a prophet in the office so they're born a prophet so like make two or three years old he had his first vision or whatever but he wasn't born again yet but he was born a prophet he came into the world already a prophet the word of the lord came to a prophet what is a prophet is a witness to foretell to show a vindication that he is a diviner of the divine word the word of god came to the prophets a prophet is the word we know that the word prophet means a divine interpreter of the word the divine word is wrote and the prophet has the divine spirit of god within it to give the right interpretation of the word and he said now listen to this why does god send prophets he said we're so dull in faith till we fail to see him that's the reason god sends prophets to the earth see people won't read their bible and they don't they just go so god always sends them a sign and usually a prophet is assigned he said a prophet is a preacher true preacher on the word that stays with the word and they bring forth a revival that gathers that elect out of that generation and he said a prophet is an office of the church not a gift in the church but an office in the church not a gift that can just go from one to another but it's actually set an office in the church he said they're ordained predestined by god's foreknowledge to be what they are amen they're born prophets prophets are not made it's not something that's made that's that's you lay hands on and then there they begin to prophesy or something like that they're actually born that way and a prophet or a seer in one word is considered in the old testament is eagles now he said a prophet a prophet sees while he's awake and you know the way that brother brown described that is it's like you dream while you're awake your subconscious and your conscious are joined together and he said both of them are right together he can't help that now if your subconscious is back there there's no need of you trying to see a vision he wasn't made up like that if your subconscious is here in a dream if you're a dreamer not a vision and this man sees visions can't help it he's just made up like that now instead of going to sleep a seer is one conscious he doesn't go to sleep like the dream does but it's just so close to him till he just breaks from one to another and that he sees things just like a dream now we know that prophets weren't just in the old testament they're in the new testament as well because we know that there was the prophet agabus and and and so many others and and then in this day we've heard the voice of the last day prophet and and you know i was sharing with brother wade i was talking to a preacher somewhere and he was relating how that a prophet had come to his church and and there's prophets in latin america and prophecy in africa the prophets there is a five-fold ministry and there we have all five offices in the chur in the bride today active and and prophecy and of course you go back to how do you tell a prophet how do you tell a real prophet you make sure that they're vindicated and proven and the things that they're saying come to pass and then you can recognize and benefit so now lay that background in the old testament they heard a prophet so prophet is like a trumpet that's communicating what what the will of god is so in the old testament they heard the voice of god through a prophet but yet in hebrews chapter 1 verse 2 he said now they heard through prophets but it hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds so now they heard through prophets but now now here in the new testament here that paul was speaking about we've heard from the one who was the voice behind the prophet he actually manifested and walked in flesh and and spoke and shared things with them and see brother brown said the prophets of the old day was the spirit of jesus christ it was the spirit of jesus christ actually speaking through them moses you know was a kind of a type of a prophet joseph was a was a type of what one day would come that jesus christ would would be manifested and he said in that day he spoke by the prophets but this day through his son that was the word of a prophet there this is the word of the son today amen so see how paul was comparing that was the word of a prophet then but now we've got the word of the son direct the word of jesus christ that was the word of a prophet there this is the word of the son today he said in other words if you're looking at the shadow the negative you might make a mistake but this is developed the picture is clear that was by the prophet this is by his son so the one that the prophet spoke of is now now clearly represented he's declared that was by negative this is by positive amen you see it there isn't a chance to lose it's a positive thing this day through his son now so he says whom he hath appointed heir of all things right there in verse two right hathan these days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things so he had an appointment an appointment now brother branham explains it like this he said the appointment was made back of course it was made before the foundation of the world he's going to be heir of all things but he had an appointment that was declared in genesis chapter 3 verse 15. amen where it says that i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so the one that was gonna that that appointment was speaking of is he's now paul this is who paul is talking about there the appointment was kept the appointment was kept and he showed up to die on the cross and and destroy the works of the devil because it says and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so his heel was bruised on the cross and he bruised the head of the serpent through the act that he performed and kept the appointment that god made before the foundation of the world whom he hath appointed air of all things by whom also he made the world now now the brother yesterday was kind of getting on this in his sermon i really i really enjoyed that i'm looking forward to today because uh he was speaking on how that who by whom also he made the worlds that that there are actually that this this man that paul is speaking of actually created all of the worlds that like as he was speaking on yesterday you can look up into the night sky and see all the stars and all the things so who made the world brother said christ christ made the worlds world's plural and hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 and i i know i've got just a few more minutes i'll be winding up here in just a second he said through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear now think about everything that we see up in up in the night sky all those worlds were actually framed by the word of god and kept in place by the word of god and so you think about that if the if the word of god is powerful enough to frame the heavens and the worlds and keep them in place and keep them in their orbit and doing what they're supposed to do then the word of god is also has power to keep you in line and keep to give you structure in your life and to put you in your place and to give you power over the enemy now brother ram said in questions and answers is there more than one world he said yes there's worlds of worlds now think about that worlds of worlds hebrews the first chapter the second verse and the third verse there's worlds of worlds god created the world w-o-r-l-d-s to drive at home worlds he said go out here to mount palomar mount palomar and there's an observatory in san diego and he said and look through to that observatory there and see a hundred and twenty million years of life space through that out yonder at the worlds and the solar systems and the solar system out there how the worlds and the other suns and moons and worlds and stars and 120 million years of life space and then beyond that still more worlds and moons and stars so this is the one that paul is talking about you've heard all the prophets and all of the stories of the old testament and you've got the law but now i'm telling you about the one that was appointed air of all things that made all the worlds i'm going to tell you uh and if we when you go over into hebrews chapter 2 this is why you need to pay attention to the things that this man has said is what paul's saying in chapter two if you if you've heard the word of the angels and the ministers now hear the word of this man and that the musicians can go ahead and start coming forward hear that hear the word of this man that's made the worlds that's framed everything with the word of his power that's framed everything up this man this jesus christ that we serve and we'll stop her there i i i can't believe we want to make the verse 2. anyway right
