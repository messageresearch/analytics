before we're glad to have him good to see him in the church am that's right good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to where we've been reading from Ephesians and where we were Wednesday night from Isaiah 55 so we just try to pick up the thought uh we had company there and it's kind of Amen going to be hard Joe and Richard had spent the whole Services getting it all lined up to where we could get it on here and you know and then I didn't use them so I told him I said well we'll use them today we'll get that so you know they were trying to get all the quotes now we ran some but I hope you brought back what you had some of you at least to where that you can you know from this past Wednesday and we'll we'll got a few here that run off to where we can see all right Ephesians 1 and Isaiah 55 father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things and we thank you Lord that you are God and you change not and then we can take our dependence upon that to where that we can look at your word and we read it we realize that you are real and that you will speak to each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins Lord and cleanse us from all unrighteousness make us to be what you want us to be you have your way now as we read your word you come and you speak to our hearts because we desire that more than anything else in the world Lord we ask you to just teach us thy ways that we may walk there in forgive us of our sins again we say because that's what we want to be covered we want to stay and be what you want us to be guide us now in Jesus name amen Isaiah Joe when you get on to Isaiah it will start back on verse one so he'll have to redo that and run it back up okay I just picked that up if he hears me he can pull it back to Isaiah real quick okay Ephesians 1 verse 3 and 4 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen all right so now let's go over to Isaiah and we'll start at verse one of Isaiah 55 and read down through verse 11 listen to the reading of the word now listen whole everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and be and he that hath no money Come Ye by and eat Y come by wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfi not in other words natural life things right right hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mercies of David behold I have given him for a witness to the people a leader and a commander to the people behold Thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and Nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God that's right for the Holy One of Israel for he hath glorified thee seek ye the Lord while he may be found that's right call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake their way and the unrighteous man his thoughts let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon that means really he will multiply to Pardon right that's what God has done for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from from heaven and returneth not thi but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth in B that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where in the thing where unto where to yeah I sent it that's it all right you may be seated to the Lord as blessing to the reading of the word appreciate your one yeah this is the ones we had now if you if you brought yours from Wednesday don't take these because hold your hand up if you need one if you don't have the ones for Wednesday night hold your hand up and let them bring them to you and everything and I realize you know sometimes you do take them home and don't bring them back still you know we uh we want to that way we don't have to make so many we got the screen to go on and use it but in this series now for a while I want you to have these quotes to go home and read because I believe it will help you to uh you know to understand a lot of the things of under way life is and way things are but you know we just uh we want to do that now way will'll be speaking this afternoon Lord willing U I had a little bout yesterday with a uh bug I guess you called it silences or something and you know had to run up to the quick care and get some shot and stuff like that for them to get my temperature down but I'm all right there's no problem so don't worry just keep praying for me I appreciate you praying for me I appreciate brother danan came in said he was praying for me and it was at the time you know that I was having so much trouble so we appreciate that appreciate God using you to pray one for the other cuz that's what we need we need to be in in love with each other and to to you know look into that all right now what have we been talking about as we read in Ephesians there we've been talking about how that we we chosen in him all right and then we know for assurity of one thing that he is the word am all right now not to just say God is word see we we get to thoughts in our mind uh you know uh ideas I was awake this morning about 5: till 6:30 laying in bed and just you know just just thinking things over you know I like to do that I like to just think about what God is and in his doings and and ways and uh just watch it unfold in your mind if you'll just get away from your own thinking and get into God's thinking See it'll change the whole thing that's why I read the scripture there and we tried to speak a little bit as I said Wednesday night there on um God's thoughts you know and how real they are and and things like that but see we think that uh see we we say that here we are and we're real you know beating on the pit we think this is real right but we ought to realize that and and I got this in the next message or two that we will get into it and uh you know God is real amen and You Know that heaven is real am but see we we think about it as just being you know some something and and you know but we're the real now that's as carnal as anybody can be in our thinking I'm sorry that's just my way of expressing it see you mean we talk about a God that could create us but yet what was he before the world yeah was he just a glove floating around cuz there was nowhere to float there was no atmospheres there was no doings and we think he was just and then he had an idea and he said we'll do this no I'm going to get to it one of these days and prove to you the Lord's willing by the scripture that heaven is real amen yes sir that's exactly right and God is real that's the thing I'm trying to get you to see the main thing of all of it but we'll get to it on a letter message but you just think about it brother Dale believes in a real God Amen what do you think eternal life let me ask you this this question cuz this will be about three or four sermons down I know but what do you think eternal life is you think eternal life is like a a shock of electricity is that what you think it is I mean you think eternal life is a shock of electricity that standing there on the day of Pentecost and then just you know right m I thought eternal life was a person amen that's right right amen do you think it's just some kind of a shock you got some kind of a feeling you got or some kind of a thing come on brother amen no see that's what I said that'll be 10 messages I guess down the road but and see that's what I want you to think about that we were chosen in him before the world that's right all right and in doing that see we're trying to keep our studies now remember how we're doing we're trying to keep our study is is we haven't come to earth now I'll tell you when we we we change courses and come down to earth and it may take 10 or 15 more sermons to do it but you know then we'll talk about coming to Earth I'm trying to get you to realize that heaven is real right amen that eternal life is real right see it's not just our thoughts that's what I'm reading the scripture about see our thoughts are not his thoughts our ways are not his ways Lord amen all right and see in doing that then we'll keep ourself back our until we come down this way so what we've been dealing with we found out a good many things has Tak a place before there was even the foundation of the world or anything right you know and and we still hav't covered nothing of job and and you know there and where were you and we haven't even got into the uh loue Book of Life we haven't got into them we have still some more messages to go before we we leave heaven and come to Earth in our journey but see I'm trying to get you to think about the how real it is there amen and see you say but but brother Dale this is this was only in his mind you know see that's our thoughts cuz we've read enough of the prophet's message to be able to pick out the quotes and and say things you know and and that's right the his thoughts was the thoughts in his mind that's true but how real are his thoughts right amen and as I said are we thinking it's just some before the world is just some kind of a a a glob or some kind of a something of God and just nothing just nothing well remember this and it'll help you we live in a dimension called LifeLight and matter what we call a third dimension all right now fourth dimension is like demons travel in it and Spirits things like that taking place the prophet said and like TV is a fourth dimensional product and they're getting these ether ways or what they call them so filled with all these phone systems until they're having to break into these other things to be able to to bring everything forth and where now you can just touch a button and call Africa you know just like that see uh it's getting Beyond almost Beyond human thinking of the ability right but remember I said we live in life like and matter fourth dimension is more real than we are that's what I want you to break away from I want you to break away from your carnal ity I'm talking about me okay you all of us amen fourth dimension is greater than this Dimension okay The Fifth Dimension is a place that's prepared for the devil and his angels right and people that are going to be in hell right so that's more real than we are right all right sixth Dimension is all of the Christians that have died which would have to cover the old Testament people you know that will will come up and cover all of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and brother random going there you know beyond the curtain of time he didn't just see glob floating around or thoughts well I thought I saw something he saw people amen he saw trees he saw things that's a whole lot more real than we are and look there was still more above because M he said where's Jesus i' like seen me he said he's in a higher Dimension y the seventh Dimension now we think that this is the real thing well okay if you think this is the real thing just remember when them toes turn up you're going somewhere right all right amen that's right am I right amen you know what I mean when you pass on you're going somewhere right right now wouldn't somewh you're going to be more real than what you are cuz there got to be made a place for you to abide see you know but we we're tied to hear right see and you know if I could just get into words what I see about it I believe it would change a lot of things right but anyhow we say but but brother Dale it's just the thoughts of God now what about the thoughts of God now remember what we were talking about there Wednesday night that God and we'll read something in here that God could never have another thought n that's right a different thought thank you Lord his thought is perfect amen amen and it can't be changed there's no no doings in it that would you know we know that right see then his thoughts are Eternal and a part of him yes amen right see and that's what I was trying to bring out Wednesday see your your your thoughts is part of you like Aon was coming in there ho to go life and we was about you know like this brother said one day he said the only time he knew he was take caring on an intelligent conversation when he was talking to himself you know you just you think about it you know we live a of our thoughts when I ever do a funeral or anything I always encourage people to remember the good right you know the good part of life and you know after a few weeks of grieving and things you know you'll start kind of grining about something then you'll remember something else and you kind of and you know you can start living off of good things that you remember that's just part of your thoughts well Sur if we could do that all right now our thoughts as I was trying to get across the D see that's what created all of this right yep the world you know God brought the world now you understand what I'm saying God brought the world but we take the things of the world we make a nice pull pit we we make a Pew for you to set in we make a car for you to drive you know when our plane to fly in and all of this that cuz that comes from our thoughts that's right correct and and and if that would be bring this to look like this I mean none of you we always say it none of you want to go out to Donnie would but go out and get an OA model and drive home today and at 90° he would cuz he'd be tickle tile but no that's right we used to leave and go to my aunt and uncles and I remember when when for you to go from our home to Atlanta was a Day's Journey any of you remember that no see you're not old enough and if you old enough you you had better cars than we did we had to stop three or four times we was over in South Carolina one time one of the cars messed up and it' run on level ground but it wouldn't run wouldn't pull up a hill so the only way to get the two cars back home what we do we put the one run in the back and we get to a hill start going up we run the back up push him over the hill kept on going till we got home you know but see how would you like to go back to that see our thoughts is what we're working on is continually opening to bring into greater things all right and truly if that is just a human thinking right amen then what are the thoughts of God Amen when them being Eternal and he cannot think of anything different from what he thought right because that's that that would be contrary all right so now let's read about that and keep that in mind of what we're trying to say see cuz the thoughts of God are Eternal but now get get away from one thing with me if you would please see we think it's just God sitting the thought well have a thought no no see that's our ways right you know that's our doings and our ways and things of of of doing and but think about God sitting there in heaven and I think it's a beautiful place but sitting there and then he begin to think you know why he begin to think we gave it to you that Wednesday night cuz the prophet of God said he had attributes in him that's right it's on the back of your notes on the last one today had attributes in him he said what is an attrib is just a nature God had a nature in him to be a savior healer father right all that was within him so it wasn't just him sitting as we thinking by himself eternal life right is what we're talking about amen eternal life you say brother you believe that we was back there in that eternal life don't ever forget that I'll give you there's a couple of quotes in today's message he said not your being here no that's right I'm not talking about Body Spirit Soul or Samuel Dale right or anyone else amen all right I'm talking about eternal life amen and if we was not a part of that eternal life we never will be other than we could be given eternal life one day amen that would still be in God's thinking and knowing that if he created a world that there was going to be more people than just the Bride As we call her or The Offspring of God right right see then let's get the word Eternal and thoughts together to where they can we can see that we existed sure in his thoughts right all right now that's seemingly pretty easy to handle right yes I mean it's pretty easy to handle a point that we think about well it was his thoughts about us he thought about us and you know that that carries on and that's been good enough until we have come down to the time now to understand amen and get into view all the things the prophet has got and bring it over that's why it just takes so long I think it's 30 30 31 quotes on here just a little bit and I could preach an hour off of each quote but to see the thoughts of God the prophet of God said it's not like a man with a blueprint no that's right now he gets it down and I gave you a quote which will show you one and the other I like to do that it's not like a somebody taking their mind and and figure out what you're going to be on no now that's what we do right right and I got a quote in here for brother around covers it the man gets the thought he does this and that and the other and just remember that the writing of the Bible come on the writing of the Bible was a prophet that was specially designed right you know now follow me through to where he could pick up that thought right amen right like of all said where did Abraham get that thought well know Lord I'll give you 10% the Lord said hey that's a pretty good thought I'll write it down now that's not exactly the way God does see Abraham picked that thought up that was part of God's word before the world right see and and the thoughts of God see those prophets would pick up those thoughts and transmit it down to you and I then we we're so blessed in the last day see that God sent a prophet right Amen to us which would not only be and somebody remind me to get back to this in a second would not only be a a uh a prophet but this would be a born again believer see no wonder brother r that said you know said you're greater of all why because he was not only a a prophet chosen a prophet right first thing he remembered was a vision right and thing but yet not only that he was a born again believer now you say but now brother Dale said uh those prophets see they received the thought of God and they spoke that thought all right we agree follow me but you mean to tell me that a Old Testament Prophet receiving a thought of God would be greater than a new testament Christian Christian born again believer as to pick up the thought of God you mean God would think more of the prophets of the Old Testament than he thinks of you and I his children there's something wrong with our carnality there that's right and then you take a five-fold Ministry and you bring her in the New Testament right and that's why she picks up the thoughts of God to bring to the people amen but yet still God speaks to you right amen that's that's righty come on that's the thing that I've always tried to get you to see it's not all that's in the preacher that's right that's right I'm want you to see God wants to talk to you right that's right sit down sometime and just think it over well I might get confused if you got the Holy Ghost how are you going to get confused right come on lack of information may cause you a problem right exactly y but how are you going to get confused if you got the eternal life amen that's right that's right see why can't you sit down sometimes and just think about the great things of how world and life is and how that heaven is more real than what we are amen amen see because that's the thoughts of God that's right that's the point I'm want you to get that God can transmit his thoughts into you now if you have eternal life now he he would transmit thoughts into man's mind that didn't have eternal life right you agree the Old Testament Prophet said didn't have eternal life right all right now if he could do that why can't he transmit into Born Again Believers his thoughts right and you realize who you are and what you do that's right all right so let's read now okay this will be taken from 149 of the church a book really s Church age watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust now go on back totally before God was God God is an object to worship no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as eternal spirit y listen the bride was already in his mind amen see Earth her we just in his mind he was just thinking about us coming down here now I want you to get that away from me I'd like for you to get away from you one thing that God set up there and thought things over of what we're going to be down down here you'll never get the story of eternal life you'll never get what we're talking about the Eternal thoughts of God if you just dwell on what he thought of what we're going to be here that's right y that would not be that's not even sensible all right so let's go so bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not right okay the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can say this see this you will see many things amen God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior amen we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as God must be omniscient knowing all things right and if he's omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself right nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge that's right if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that's not scriptural right he's omnicient he never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be transmitted into substance and form that's not it that's the way we do things right yep but they are already real and eternal and part of God that's right right amen already real and eternal and part of God right amen now remember what we're talking about I keep putting this on because I don't want somebody out there to get the wrong idea there a lot of people in this message believe you come into the world with eternal life you don't need to receive eternal life he always was eternal well I don't agree with that amen pure flat blunt as much as I can say it what can I say to make it harder right I don't agree with that amen I believe you have to receive eternal life amen amen but once you receive eternal life yep it's the same person of eternal life right it's not a zap of electricity that you just ready to feel something you think I got the Holy Ghost see and they don't do that right I saw God when I was 11 years old and I know better than that so don't ever try to talk to me about about God not being real now there just no need of it see anybody on the Internet or anything just ain't no need to worry about it because brother Dale done gone too far I guess I believe he's real I believe the Holy Ghost is a real person I believe it is the prophet would call him the person of Jesus Christ Living in each individual now how can you explain that right 7 billion people in I mean 7 billion people in the world today and God could give every person eternal life you agree and each one of them would have the person of Jesus Christ Living in them by the new birth and they'd still be no less God they'd be more God Amen that's right all right see then we need to get it lined up in our mind and our thoughts I just don't want somebody thinking well they believe that this no I don't agree with what those brothers are preaching that are come in the world with eternal life no no sir I believe we come into a world with a representation pre from predestination like a little woman that dwell had brother around said in the future home right right I believe in that y but I don't believe in coming in the world with eternal life you're going to make me an eternal Sinner and I don't agree with that amen there is no such thing as an eternal sinner amen that will not work all right going down now to some of these I skip because it's a little between some of it's not page 150 the church age book somewhere in church age now it says that he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from it that's right you remember what I told you the other day because people had argued that where it says in the beginning was the word word was with God and the word was God the trinitarians use that word with as a a a statement that they got to be two people right well who was he with well he was with me come on you already to know what brother Dale can quote brother Brown's message when he has to cuz it's always Ling in that brain brother brandham talks about how that not only were we with him you know in the form of with he never existed without me and you right amen that's eternal life amen right well then that give me eternal life no because you got to receive it right cuz that's the plan now listen if you think you come into into the world with eternal life what's the purpose of Jesus Christ dying what what's the whole reason what's what's any Worth to the to the death of Jesus Christ no cuz he couldn't come to redeem us right redeem means to go back where you come from what would be the purpose of trying to talk about anything you would just have us coming along and hey always was no right this don't work with me now I'm sorry amen I'm wrong forgive me pray for me all right page 151 the Samaran Church 8 according to Romans 4:16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it in the Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promis having as having to do with election are the choosing of God that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the Royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated forn of God and we in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God ET eternally do not express until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride now I thought we believ it was not the person that come predestinated eternally what it 154 Church a book but it was the seed or word that come predestinated Eternal not the person though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ is a very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source right right was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even the Lord Jesus Christ right now something being of the same Source see that's where the trinitarian concept came in because the trinitarian concept that n a council the argument was whether or not with Jesus was God or another source you know another God or whatever something in a source that was the argument at n see whether he was God or another God or another source so then they developed the point of God in three persons cuz they could read enough the Bible and it didn't develop out of it right real quick it took maybe 300 years more to 6 or6 and then they began to develop and bringing in the uh three God Trinity Real Deals and all like that right if you'll study your your history part but see being there they they found out or thought they had it figured out because they said okay he's one source and he's another source now when you got two sources you got two different people right brother Dale you don't believe that Jesus was a separate identity from God no Ser I believe he was almighty God in human flesh I got enough sense to know the flesh was not Eternal but I got enough sense to know too that in his resurrection his flesh what's made Eternal so we have no arguments today over it right I was thinking there when it was over in the Psalms readings you notice it said he chose David and made him these things and you know that that was probably a thousand years I don't know how many years between where Isaiah was writing and where David existed and it was just like he said I've made him just now I just made him there right see when God's talking he's not like our peanut brain that's right but when you say something is the same Source all right mhm see then what source are we now remember we're still back before the world what source are we we have to be a part of that eternal life that's right if not we're another source you bring us over here with that form in mind over that you're thinking see we're another source here upon the Earth no we're talking about back there right but Brother D you're making me think that that I was back there me and you wouldn't back there Body Spirit Soul as human beings that's right right amen we're only back there as the part of eternal life amen right that was imparted unto us by the new birth that's the part that is the Eternal that's God's Eternal thoughts see that way you don't have any trouble with it I can take all the scripture then and it it all ties together you know I I don't have any fear of preaching what I preach because because not did I just give all the quotes but I don't start on something like this until God has unfolded it to where that I can see it and then I try to tell you about what I see because I'm trying to get the thoughts of God I'm not just trying to get a thought from brother brandom amen he's the one speaking it but I'm wanting you to think about it right let go God speak to you why are you afraid right well I ain't going down there listen brother Dale he might I might get confused now you come down here you find out you already are amen and that's no joke no no sarcasm or no hatefulness or nothing just the truth right yes sir why are we afraid of something if you got eternal life amen why are you afraid of the word of God CH say something wrong if you're afraid of that's right that's right but get what I'm trying to get to now if we're of the same Source then that Source could only be the source of eternal life right right if he's Eternal we're Eternal all right we've been through service at a service that we're a part of God all right we've been through services that we're we're we're God made manifest we're his offspring right see we've been through those things to try to bring it down and like I was saying about with God see John there brother R doesn't mind saying that we were with God but now how was Jesus with God in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God he and the Word was one right see I preach while that comes back but see in Genesis when he spoke the word y we'll get to 116 so s we'll get back to there that when he spoke the word there was no way to change it amen his offspring was going to come amen that's right because that is the eternal life okay now look at the next one in number four in you notes this is taken from uh the Mighty God unveil before 1964 629 but when he come expressed exactly like the Testament had said he would be expressed then all those who were redeemable y believed it y because they were the thoughts of God y why do you believe in Salvation yep that's right well now brother a lot of people in the world believe in but now you you know what I'm saying why do you believe this message right and why do the world don't believe this message right most the religious world don't believe this message right because they got some other thoughts right that's right but how can it be that we right so what were we we were redeemable because we were the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to God as many as received him to them gave him power to become sons of God because they were redeemable they were from the beginning in the expression now if you look to your notes you have to see it's not on a lot of there a computer hooked me up wrong okay let's get a little bit CU I know we ain't going to get very far but look look the next identify Christ of all ages 19640 401 now we find that in St John the 1 chapter beginning with the first verse it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God now that's the attributes his words they thoughts now they're not expressed so it was a time now which one getting that though you'll see one we on oh we're on the wrong Jo on yeah okay we're supposed to be on number five that's that's number five yeah okay that's number five I'll get back to what I was on the other I was looking down on the page and reading it off here okay number five so what I mean attributes was his thoughts right and a word his thought expressed right and then that was in his thinking and when he said let there be and there was let there be and there was now you know when he said in the beginning let us make man amen you know what brother R said about that one time he he said it was word and spirit you know what he said it was another time he said God was talking to the animals what he doing he talking to the animals when he said let us be let us make man see it's not always that we think about let us is just got to be half a dozen people word and spirit one okay and word word is a thought expressed and then that was his thinking when he said let there be and there was let there be and there was and now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking before there even was a world you were in Christ amen in God in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is going God himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled seen and so forth and that's what God is the whole thing that's right Paradox 64 206 to be served but real genuine Faith don't move them disciples couldn't explain it but they know there it was listen see it has to be something that God planted had to be his thoughts before the foundation of the world when he planned the whole redeemed Ephesians 1 1-5 he planned the whole thing before the foundation of the world his his thoughts and this is the attributes of his thoughts this is exactly what we are right life is a thought expressed sure right what we've been to all these years or thousands of years on Earth as the thought of God Express but you know what his bride being a part of him is an expressed attribute now right amen but it's when you receive it right amen you got to receive eternal life to be a part of eternal life well what do you mean Eternal Eternal if I got Eternal always had it that's as far as God is concerned that's it amen that's see what you don't realize to think of what you're doing is you're taking Satan's lie in the beginning when he begin to want to do and said he wanted to be as God then he wanted to be like God later on and he wanted to become God there in the scriptures why because that's what he wants to be right yep you're picking that thought up from him instead of taking God's thoughts cuz God's thoughts never will make us go wrong right amen amen there's no such thing as going wrong with God's thoughts amen they won't cross each other they won't do wrong his thoughts is perfect and eternal amen he can't change it that's right he can't think of you being one thing here and then something else over here that wouldn't work we not do that with our own thoughts all but look the token 1964 308 paragraph 38 and any Greek scholar knows that that's the word eternal life comes from the word Zoe Zoe which means God's own life that's right and the only way that you ever can have life there is only one form of eternal life and that's God's own life in you see then you have eternal life because he is the only Eternal there is and we are the attributes of his thoughts before there was even a foundation of the world or anything all this is just his thinking and we're the display of his thoughts of what it was that's all we're doing here as Christians we're just living out what God thought before the world Amen and knew that we would be so why would it be any trouble but he also knew in this last days there going to be a change amen this is he not going to church and being good and and and you know just amen we're not talking about that this is the only age where man had to be concerned with this entire being that you're looking at amen that's right see we wasn't concerned in the ages about we were just concerned to go to heaven get saved go to this now I'm not saying anything wrong now for you you get me wrong you you got the wrong idea I wrode by a place the other day it said 18 converts and I thought call I hope is 18 right that was all my thought right I didn't have the wrong thought I said I hope there 18 convert yep you know come man wouldn't that be something 18 converts brother Bram go over in Africa and have 30,000 in one service that something cuz see I'm concerned with people too Amen brother all right so where we at identification 1964 216 paragraph 51 52 3 4 and 5 55 you know then see God came down and the character of God was Christ he he was the reflection he was God made visible notice God made visible in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then no God is an object of worship only thing he was was the Eternal y see that's what I've tried my to drive into us we have educated ourselves enough to know that when somebody walk up to us and they say well you know God we you don't even know the story God's just an object of worship yeah right is it where M Cliff we know he always was God right you said no no no he wasn't he always was the father he always was the Healer he always was the Savior if not where did it come from I tried to drive that into you for what for years now that God never gained an attribute by coming into this world he displayed the attribute when he made angs and they worshiping that was a display of the attribute that was not the attribute the attribute was God but see we think we're so educated into it that we we think we know all of the quotes yeah and well and good I'm the one who taught you those things but I think it's about time to be able to get p a quote to get back to what the man's talking about yep that's right well he didn't read that right he missed that no what was a man talking about right and he explains but look what he said oh see we think we know all about it he wasn't even God then no God's not work only thing he was was the Eternal and in him was attributes those attributes is god father son Holy Spirit healer savior Redeemer Advocate what else you want to name off right that was a part of God Amen we look at the display of it yes see yep all right and you better remember one thing now you're going to get to this one day so you better write this down and remember it before he was God in his thoughts of being God the eternal life that I have already existed absolutely yes sir you better write that down absolutely you can say brother Dale's going off on it let it you can go what you want to eternal life is eternal life amen that's right only thing he was was the Eternal and in him was attribution those attributes were thoughts those thoughts were expressed to words and words was word was made this what is it it's all God becoming tangible and you are a part of God and Jesus come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem Y and them as soon as it strikes them they see it because the life is in there the life is in there you the life of connection the connection backward right why is it you receive this message and others walk away from it life you right yep y amen but if the life isn't in there then what can they do see they don't see it and they'll never see it that's right that's right amen you say will that make no it don't make us and the whole thing is Jesus said that day you'll know that I'm in the father and father in me and I in you and you in me now that's easy to explain I in you how many years have I been on that where Jesus said I in you okay New Birth comes into us we have his life now explain you and me come on I'm read the Bible That's Right Jesus said I you and you in me see the Bible full of the great beautiful nuggets and we just read it that's right and get an understanding he said it's like a husband and wife let's get a few more first as we would see Jesus 64318 in the beginning God was not even God he was the great Eternal and in there was attributes attributes was his St thoughts then he become a word like this and a word expressed well a thought expressed is a word and a word a word express is a thought then remember if you ever was in God's thinking you'll always be there if you got eternal life that's simple is y if you got eternal life see what are you you're the expression or the attribute of of his thought for this age and it's not not you there's only one eternal life and it always existed and you in his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it isn't what we think what somebody else thinks it's what God Eternal you always was see in his thinking that's right always was in his thinking right we only got three more Pages too just remember we haven't covered it yet we haven't got on to the word redeemed yet but if we talk about redeemed I thought we believe redeemed means to go back where you come from that's right see we really got to step up in our thinking on a deal in I mean not a deal of quote in a church seal book excuse me for deal you know that we fell from eternal life that's right right yep absolutely see I know brother always T you that you can't fall from eternal life cuz that's not we're talk what we're talking about right the Adam felt from eternal life to death in the garden right that's right but he never lost the eternal life that was in his soul right man no way you can't lose eternal life that's right so when we get to it one of these days and we talk about falling from eternal life just remember it's not our words right it's not our thoughts it's what God says it was the way he brought us here right y not a fault the way he brought us here okay give you a lot of things ahead of time cuz see I I know where I'm going to be going eventually with all of this so he says in the identified Christ of all ages 6441 he's talking about and we find out in John the first chapter beginning with the first verse it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God now that's the attributes his words they thoughts now they're not expressed now we on the one I was trying to read off of Cu what I was doing slide it down like this okay now what's what he saying it wasn't word now I don't have these written down so you know I try to just speak as I can off of it you order to be able to remember it's in the second seal I'm pretty sure maybe the number will come to him in a minute but brother randam said that God had thoughts and he said it were not word yet now listen sure he said he spoke it to Moses he said it was God's thought he said then it become Moses thought he said then Moses spoke it it became word right amen right see when Moses spoke it it became word you know what God's want me and you to do speak it come on we got to speak it to be healed yes right you got to speak it to be saved that scripture in in Romans there I remember that I heard it so much in the Baptist Church I got didn't want to hear that scripture to the Lord he said get away from that it ain't what I'm saying but in the Baptist we just read it you know to the whole congregation is a blanket if you just can believe in your heart and confess with your mouth you're saved so just come on up here and shake my hand and go back that's reason I didn't quy I was 18 years old before I'd ever even step out but see because I seen so many come up and it's like that little boy said you heard it told you know right he's asking all of them in a little group that came up you know what the Lord do for you today Lord save me that's one little boy say what God do you ain't done nothing yet you know what he's probably the most honest one in the whole crowd right that's right cuz he just telling it like it was y see I wouldn't going to be no hypocrite about it right but you see God's wanting you and I to speak the word what do you think this is all about oh only for brother Rand to speak the word big man in this message that's what he says said the spoken word was only for brother randam and and the Lord Jesus well then we're going to have to rip out the Bible and we're going to have to rip out the message of course that ain't going to turn nobody away from listening to him and I'm not trying to because I don't want him here with that thought about it it take me a year or two to get that out of them but now listen say now now they're not expressed right yep there was a time when God's word was God's word but it was not an Express word right you agree his word was before and he was going to you know everything was there in him in the beginning was his word but there wasn't a world right and then he spoke it and it was expressed amen right see it become the expression that's what we talk about that he wasn't God until he created angels and any wor he's always God he always was the Healer you said no he couldn't be a Healer cuz he was lost see we got quotes how many quotes brother see we keep breing salvation made an expression of the thought the thought was already there he always was God he always was the Healer he always was the Savior oh my Lord you want to go on to 2:00 that's quit listen 1964 409 which identified Christ of all ages that was paragraph 20 this is going down to 68 6970 71 72 now in first John or St John the first chapter we find out here is what the writer said then the inspired by the Holy Spirit he wrote this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us may I break it down in the beginning was the Eternal he wasn't even God God our English word god is an object of worship but he there wasn't nothing to worship him he was just the Eternal in him was attributes anybody knows what an attribute is in other words it's him in him was his thoughts just thoughts that's his attribute then his word and a thought expressed is a word in the beginning was a word because it was even before it was even expressed it was a thought attributes right in this thinking he was to be God probably created the Angels first then he was worshiped he was God then in him was attributes to be father to be son to be savior nothing lost but watch it something had to be lost amen the fall is not not something that Satan pulled over on God something had to be like lost so there had to be a way made for that yep to be healer nothing sick so he had so he had something had to get sick so he could heal it it's only displaying his attributes right you see what I'm saying a way had to be made y now this goes on to where we we back up right here when we come down and see drop out of heaven and come to Earth y right so it had to be in God's plan and purpose to bring man into the world and to know if he gave us freeo agency we would choose wrong right you said but brother Dale is not show today you better be careful but I've got eternal life Adam had eternal life but Adam didn't Adam didn't believe Satan Adam walked out with his wife thinking some way he could get her back and that was contrary to God's word right because there was no way Adam was going to get her back no sir because that was God's plan and purpose not that he made the man fall he couldn't make us fall and condemn us for being lost that's right come on but he knew all he had to do was let us be here that's right you know right now if something don't come out of this message to take you in a change we're going by the ground that's right we may be around here 40 more years somebody else will be up here screaming and hollering this but if we don't get it revealed to us right that's it amen we're freeo agents today that's right yes sir you got a right to go home and say brother Dale's off and I ain't listening to him no more that's you're right that's right but what does the Holy Ghost Say that's right Holy Ghost says well I don't understand him a lot of times well don't worry about it I don't understand myself I just wait for him and I lay at bed and I said this morning for our thinking about heaven thinking about God thinking about everything being real eternal life to the real person not a thought it's not a apple of electricity no amen oh it's so much greater than a apple of electricity electricity and him in I quote what was thinking I was listen or looking this morning at her it's either in here one when I get to it but it's like brother Rand want to say and he said you know that it comes up T night you know Darkness like but he said at night it's so light now he's not talking about natural things it was in The Darkest Hour of the Christian church when God stepped on the scene and remember brother brandom said there was just a little bit of Halo of light left and as a matter of fact he said I put that in there you remember that he said I put it in there God showed it total darkness but you know what in total darkness is supposed to be the greatest light of all right cuz that's what I thought we believed there where talks about in the scripture about when the towers fall and the light of the sun would be seven times lighter and the light of the Moon would be same as the same as the sun that's right you know in Goan mhm Egypt was black till Let It Feel It In Goan there was light you know I don't understand them people I know it's just human well I mean I'm a dummy but I I look overly if I could just make it to that light you at least I could see me sitting over here day after day and it's black right ah come on you don't want to go over there with them because you be one of them nuts well that's okay amen all right let's read a couple more should be number 12 when you note 64 44 415 Christ is identified the same and all a matter of fact you had to listen to this whole message Christ identified in all ages it would be a good one to just get and do I I thought about it this morning if you would just you need sometimes a help to be able to lay out something for you to study some people will say you know brother Dale what should I study that you have time why don't you just take like one service one time a day and just listen to a tap and won't you just start like in 65 and go backwards right you know just take one a day you know you'll see that brother Dale's right about what he's saying because you'll see brother if you can't see as much quotes I give you but you know but it just give you the idea of how beautiful this message is okay Christ identified the same in all ages say paragraph 1516 God like in the beginning he was just God well he wasn't really God he was just the Eternal God God is an English word god means an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him he was self-existing Elohim so there was nothing to worship him so he was just the Eternal the great Eternal but in him were at was attributes and attributes is his thoughts just like you have to think of something before you speak it right then when you speak it it becomes a word all right so now that's what God wants us he wants us to speak his word right you got to say you're healed you got to say you're saved you going to have to say you're changed somebody going to have to say it and then walk into it just how just like you have to think of anything because before you speak it then when you speak it it becomes a word and then he is the Eternal and in him was attributes and he spoken and it was the word and the word is made manifest and the word is made manifest is God becoming material all right that's right let's take the next two which is it's in the same message now the Mighty God unveiled so brother Joe may have to split from 71 to 78 I was trying to help them and found out we can't help just you know I'm lost in this trying to help I just go ahead and print it out and get it to they figure it out all right this is on the Mighty God unveil before us 64629 paragraph 71 so God in the beginning was life the Eternal one in him was attributes and those attributes become words became words and the word became flesh Jesus was the Redeemer to redeem means to bring back if he has to bring it back it had to be somewhere to be brought back too so you see all people will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning in God's thoughts now that's simple that's not degrading nobody now paragraph 78 but when he come expressed exactly like the Testament said he would be expressed then all those who were redeemable believed it y because they were the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back brought back to God as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of God because they were redeemable they were for the from the beginning in the expression that's right listen we talk about redeemed let me just cover that just a second anything that's redeemable means it goes back to where it come from all right now this world was a creation by the word of God that's correct amen you agree amen see it was a beautiful state a state or what you want to call it perfect and you know it can be redeemed mhm and this world will be brought to a condition one day of like it was in the beginning only I believe it's going to be stepped on over right I I'll get to that in messages later I believe this world is going to be Eternal amen it's going to have to be be given eternal life CU see if it goes back to where it was it would only go back to an existence of when God said let there be all right see and that would be redeemed now and there will be people on this Earth yep that God saw and come into the world and do things like that and as far as they can be redeemed that's why he would say it see that everything's not redeemable see as far as they exist to where they done what they done to to for God to look down a cup of water in my name or or or something good that was done see now that people can only be redeemed back to that place see which means they can't come back to being Sons and Daughters of of a living God right am they will only come back to the existence of where there'll be foolish virgins fifal Jews the things like that even the 144,000 that receive eternal life on this Earth will be servants to the bride right amen right that's right yes and see but yet see there's a people that can be redeemed y right there's a people that can be redeemed that's right you know why because they're redeemable amen right amen and we can be redeemed back who where we were now that's where God's going to have to give this body spirit and soul eternal life that's right to change you know and everything else and then that way we'll be Eternal but the New Birth has already made your soul Eternal yep if you have a new birth today your soul don't have to be Eternal it already is eternal amen amen that's right and that's why we could be redeemed right we'll get back to that and see get to where we can cover it let me say this to you and you study on it for a while about the lounge Book of Life brother col is your name written in the lounge Book of Life no I know he here but he knows I'm fixing to pool something but and James colly wouldn't didn't there Ray Gabriel was not written in the Lamb's Book of Life it's written in the book of life section y go to Invisible Union where the Prophet say it's got to be transferred and once it's transferred is not that same name right see we're going some more folks we're going back back to the real you that's right yes sir and your name of natural life was written in a book but the book of eternal life that name is not the same here as it is over here see we get a new name amen think on these things because see the message is not cuz I've always told you I've been in a Revival ever since I've been in this message and doesn't matter to me how sick I have L your brain just run in you dreaming crazy dreams all night at 5:00 when I woke up just lay her look at things right and see it that's real take what I said about them Dimensions while ago because that will be the key later on which dimension do you think is the greatest right the seventh or the one you know right 1 2 3 is what we're in which we're into lifel and matter Y and even Einstein says in this Dimension if you had unlimited eyesight you would look out and see the back of your head but you see the word of God is eternal not letters on a page right the thoughts of God are Eternal not just because he thought of it I've always told you that right I've always said that I didn't want to be I didn't want to be thought of in heaven I mean that's wonderful that would be great but that's not the story I want to be part of the Thinker am that's right how many years have I been preaching that part of the Thinker the one who done the thinking is there any difference in the eternal life that was in Jesus Christ and eternal life in you that's right what's the difference that's hard to comprehend that's right yeah you just Bel little in him no no I'm trying to upgrade us Amen to get us to see right come on Brothers think on these things I'll get the rest of these notes Wednesday still got sermon for next Sunday I pretty good sh but what about the thoughts of God and what about those thoughts being Eternal that's right and then we are the same Source you remember that we come from the same source so if we come from the same Source the eternal life that I'm talking about would have to be the life of God right not a new doctor I want to get on that when we get to where it says and you can look at them and there's probably about 50 of them where brother random was talking about or maybe more than that about the the coded man you know that got up and preached the first sermon he heard and said he started all the others down on Earth preaching and said they said old man brought him up there and here brother ROM saying what in the world they bring an old man up here far he said there he was old man a little room of hiring said old black suit on you know I mean black coat around him and said he started off up in heaven you know I'd like to been sitting there listening to that sermon yeah that's right brought him down the horizontal rainbow he said he said while he clicked up his heel said you ain't got enough room up here for me around said now I wish I had had part of that but see that ain't all that was said along those things cuz this is what I want to get on to one these days brother brandom are you preaching a new religion see that's what everybody thinks we're doing right right the denominations think we're preaching a new religion you agree that's what they think about it's cuz that's reason don't want it but brother R said no he said the oldest religion in the world my nurse said when did that start he said before the foundation of the world Amen that's right oldest religion has ever been let's stand again right thinkk on these things go ahead 176 176 anybody have a need bless Jesus is oh all glor
