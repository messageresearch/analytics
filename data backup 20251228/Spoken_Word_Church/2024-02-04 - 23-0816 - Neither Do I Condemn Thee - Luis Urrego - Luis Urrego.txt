hope that you all enjoyed the services this past weekend and we're still basking in that amen and uh we just thank God Amen because he's an untime God Amen and he knows what to give his people and in the moment that they needed amen so we just appreciate the Lord amen amen let's just bow our heads before we go to the before we read the scriptures our heavenly father we thank you Lord God once again for the opportunity that we have to serve you Lord and Lord God we take father a few minutes of of the of our day Lord God to at this moment Lord to just read about you father to learn about you Lord and to Father for this word Lord God to make us more like you Lord Lord we ask Lord Jesus that you would uh forgive us for our sins father if there's any iniquity Lord God anything that we may have done wrong even even any bad thought that would hinder the service father may you just Lord forgive us help us father to receive from thee and Lord help us to re be Ed leave here edified Lord and you glorified Lord Jesus and we just father God we we invite your presence amongst us father God and may be just a few of us here Lord God but Lord if you're here father God that makes up the majority Lord and so Lord we invite your presence now father we we just commit ourselves and myself into your hands Lord use my lips Lord Jesus to speak according to the Oracles of God and we ask these things now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord Jesus just reading John chapter 8 amen I want to title this neither do I condemn thee those are very familiar words amen because it was the King of Kings amen who said them amen and that is what he's saying to you this afternoon amen amen neither does he condemn thee amen if you have done what you were supposed to do amen there is now no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus now to no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus because if he would have left it as as as there is no condemnation then just go ahead and do what you want to do you see but there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus right and so we're going to read here about the woman uh the woman that was caught in adultery and this sparked my attention this week because if you remember brother hos who was here this past Sunday from Honduras he has a powerful testimony that's just a little minute portion of of what he said because due to time but he he he was he was backsliding for for for a while he was born and raised in this message and he was backsliding for a while and and we were we've been praying for him for several years and uh the family has Brethren there in Honduras have and um he came back to the Lord he just couldn't get away last year early last year the Lord he said I I just I need to stop running from the Lord and prayer was answered it took it took almost 10 years but prayer was answered and uh and so he got to a level of maturity you know where he said you know I I just can't I got to stop running from the Lord and so and and the things that that that he said you know many of the times that I dealt with him over the phone in the past several years that I've talked with him yeah I do counseling over the phone too with the Brethren uh in in in the in the uh outside of this outside of this country you know they they call and so you know you want to you want to help him out but he was he was a special one to me because you know he was young and I know what the Lord had done in his life be before and so I knew it was nothing but Satan he got carried out he he got a girl pregnant and he had two children by her and everything but uh he knew that he was doing wrong the whole time and what was hindering him from coming back was this exact same thing condemnation he he felt like like like like he had just done so much that he could not come back and you see if if he would have just kept that and stayed that way amen I wouldn't have received the blessing that I got by him telling me his testimony that he did this past weekend so you see we all have our our our we all have to go through certain things in our lives Amen in order for us to be able to have a testimony you see and there's no test and there's nothing that you went through there's really no testimony that you can give he's got a testimony and so ever since he's come back Satan has been trying to kill him especially with that car accident that he had different things have been happening I believe God has something special for him so and looking at this uh uh this scripture right here it it just it amazes I'll never look at this scripture the same again amen and I hope that tonight amen that that that that you see what I see amen because when I was looking at this and I saw some of the things that that that that that that we're about to read here I I I just seeing some things just coming down here to church I felt like shouting in the van it was it was so good amen so I hope that that that you receive the same blessing that I reive amen and the ones that are not here well they they just missed out then praise the lord well let's read John chapter 8 amen it says Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again in the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down down and taught them and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery which was a bad thing it was it was a it was a top sin adultery it was a sexual sin and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him Master the woman was taken in adultery in the very act now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou and so verse six says this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not and the Bible doesn't say that he didn't hear them he was just acting like he wasn't listening to him but he was hearing everything he they were saying amen praise the Lord with that you may be seated amen and we'll just we'll continue reading this here in just a moment amen now brother brandom says here in the in the message the God's power to transform he says the following he says and God can write God wrote the Ten Commandments amen with his own finger he wrote on the walls of Babylon once amen with his finger he stooped down and wrote In hand one time with his finger and he was talking about BR was talking about this particular scenario God can speak God Can Read God can write God is the Fountain of all Grace and power and of all Divine wisdom is in God so therefore knowing that he is the only Creator there is there is no other Creator but God Satan cannot create at all he only perverts what's been created but God is the only Creator amen so God we know he is the Fountain of all Grace and power amen praise the Lord Jesus I'm so thankful that we have a God that that is full of grace and mercy and and and I believe that he has more grace than we even attribute him to even having amen because in our minds and in our in our carnal Natures amen we are condemners y right by Nature we are that's right oh we we're just condemners and and we like it because it makes the flesh feel good but you'll be surprised amen who's going to be in heaven and who won't be in heaven that day it'll be more people than you think amen that'll be there amen that will enter in and receive eternal life than what you and I think that will be there because God is all about the saving of the Soul amen God is all about amen Grace extending mercy and extending Grace praise praise God he's a god of Second Chances third chances and fourth chances amen he is a God Amen of Grace amen and I believe that that that in this hour amen when you've fully come in and you've accepted that Grace amen then what happens that Grace is going to make you walk in his statues you see with a a person that is not shown Grace if you just give them the rod of iron and the rod of of of of of uh uh you know punishment then that's they're not going to experience Grace they're not going to they're not going to walk they're not going to want to walk by the law uh by the word they're not going to want to go to church amen they're not going to want to do these things amen that can they can do on their own if someone shows Grace and this is exactly what happened here in the in in in in in this example that we're we're just reading Jesus showed the grace first then he explained to her he he he didn't he didn't justify her sin he knew that she had sinned he says he said he told her at the end go and sin no more so he knew that he had done it he knew that those priests were right but there was nobody else Amen to condemn her there because those priests weren't condemning her and neither was Jesus the god of Creator who created her amen and probably saw the whole scene in his mind amen knew that she amen that had done it but God's grace was there amen so if if if we read there in and starting at verse one again we'll just kind of go verse by verse it says Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them I want you to to to to to see the the setting where they're at Jesus is in the temple teaching the people it's key that he that he's in the temple because of something something that we're going to we're going to see here in just a moment amen he was in the temple teaching the people he could have been anywhere else teaching the people but he went to the temple to to uh and and sat down and taught them and it says here and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman unto him where in the temple a woman taken in adultery and you you can imagine this this this woman was probably I mean I don't know maybe she was she was uh taken and she was probably in and wrapped around in a bed sheet I don't know maybe she was she was naked the Bible doesn't say but she was just sat there right in front of Jesus and and these Pharisees didn't care not one bit about her they didn't care they just they were out to get Jesus they didn't care anything about her right brother and if you keep reading if you keep reading in just a moment as we're going to keep reading they honest they really even though they knew the law they really didn't even care about about the law they knew the law you couldn't tell you couldn't tell them that they didn't know the law they knew the law of Moses like the back of their hand but did they follow it it's one thing knowing and to another thing and another thing obeying it you see praise God you and me amen could know this word we know what we got to do we know that we have to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but if you don't go and do it that won't serve you it won't help you at all amen these Pharisees wearing the same condition amen and and and we have a lot of a lot of young people and we have a lot of people amen they know what they got to do they've been taught well they just don't go and do it and the Pharisees were exact same condition right they knew what they had to do they knew the law but they just loved themselves more they loved themselves more amen and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst he man I I you know you asked the question how did these Pharisees know where this woman was this is a legitimate question how did these Pharisees know where this woman was because you and me amen we we know that in this world I mean this this this is a perverted nation that we live in and we we know that this this nation is is sinful and sexually sinful amen but we don't know who's committing adultery and who's not yeah right how how did these Pharisees know that this woman where she was at committing adultery and and and second the the other thing is that why did they not bring the man that she was committing adultery with so either she was being set up or maybe the man was one of the Pharisees right so they probably took advantage amen at that moment to say okay let's use this Amen to get to get at Jesus because we've been wanting to get Jesus for a while so let's use this amen uh and they use that woman like she was trash can you imagine that the most religious people of the day only thinking about themselves using this woman like trash before the god of creation amen amen to to to to to let the people know hey this isn't the Messiah right amen just watch they say unto him master and they use flattering words Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act amen now Moses in verse 5 now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou now really if you look at it they were only given him half truth because when you go back and read the law amen this is what Moses said in the law if you're reading Deuteronomy chapter 22 now you stay with me okay Deuteronomy chap 22:22 it says this if a man be found lying with a woman it was talking about the man right lying with the woman now a man usually is the one who has the the the upper hand over the woman right so if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband then they shall both of them die both the man that lay with the woman and the woman so shalt thou put away evil from Israel that was the reason why God God told Moses Amen in the law to let the people of Israel know this is this is got this is so that you can know and understand and even your children know that this evil is not put up with cuz even in the law in in the Ten Commandments God's one of The Commandments Thou shalt not commit adultery so God hates adultery and God hates an adulterous spirit amen right so so so we see here also in Leviticus 20: 10 remember this is a man being caught in adultery both of these verses that we're reading and the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife it keeps saying a man that committeth adultery with another man's wife you could say you could easily say oh that's just a the the man a man which represents a man and a woman no but it says the man that committed adultery with another man's wife right even he even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife the adulterer right the adulterer which is the man and the adulteress shall surely be be put to death my goodness I'm glad I didn't live in that time I'm glad here in America they're not living in there in that time too cuz they'd be a lot of stonings out there on the streets there'd be a lot of stonings out here in in the world can you imagine amen that I don't know how they come up with the with the 8 billion people in the world Amen but can you imagine it'd certainly be much less than 8 billion [Laughter] people there's a lot of that that goes on Amen but thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ amen thank God for his grace amen and so we keep here so we see here amen that these Pharisees they brought this woman with no man they said to her they said to Jesus the law says the law of Moses says to Stone to Stone her but in reality what the law of Moses was saying if the man is caught with a woman not if the woman is caught with the man right you just read it with me so the Pharisees they were twisting the scriptures Amen in order to obtain what they wanted to obtain right this they said tempting verse six back in John chapter 8 this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him amen so we know that we know saints that we we have an accuser amen the accuser of the Brethren amen he's always there we know it's nothing but Satan he's the one amen when you feel like you don't want to go to church or when you feel like you you you just can't keep serving God and you feeling you're feeling like I don't know if I should keep walking in this way what am I doing he man i' just rather go back in the world you know what that's Satan talking to you and that's not God Amen that is not God at all that that's Satan amen trying to derail your your your walk with him with God he's the accuser he accuses us before before him day and night amen but I'm thankful that he is the high priest amen that he's interceding for us amen and there's a bumper of blood amen that he can't go through amen because all God is seeing is that bumper of blood he doesn't see you amen per se but he sees you through the blood amen if you are under the blood amen praise the Lord Jesus I'm thankful for the blood you know brother Bram said that they were taking the blood out of the hym books amen back back in his day amen but I I I I can't I can't do without the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen amen and and we've said it before but you know it's not the literal blood amen that saves you but it's it's that life amen it's that representation amen that that that that that's what saves our soul amen praise God now remember that Jesus when he was writing here on the on on on the ground let's continue reading this verse it says here but Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not not now we don't know what he was writing the Bible doesn't say what he was writing there's commentaries out there that that that think that they might they might think what he might have been writing but nobody knows for sure amen but everything that we look at amen we should take it back to the word right we should take it back to the word amen and so Jesus was right here amen he just stood on the ground he just said sat there and was just riding on the ground amen I don't know maybe he was just maybe he was just doing this or maybe just I don't know what he was doing but he is God he's the one who created that dust in that Temple he's the one who formed the the the the ground that he was standing on and so he was there maybe just riding on the ground maybe I don't know he was riding the things that the Pharisees had been doing John so and so did this the other night uh uh uh uh uh Mark over there did this the other night and uh and maybe a few of them were taking a glance at that how does he know my name I don't know maybe but the Bible doesn't say and so we you see here that that he was caught amen Jesus was caught in a trap because they asked him what would what do you say the law of Moses says this but what do you say so now they're throwing it at Jes Jesus lap so now what do you say Jesus amen and Jesus was caught in in in a in a trap because if he would have said if he would have if he would have if he would have acted on a whim and said yeah Stone her yeah she deserves it amen the people that she he was talking to and that they loved him and they saw that he was merciful and that he was a loving God what would they have thought of him then not a gracious God not a not a loving father not a loving Jesus amen he's just a harsh amen just as harsh as those Pharisees is Right amen but then on on the other hand amen if he would have said no don't Stone her don't don't Stone her then they would have accused him of breaking the law right that's right and and and furthermore in just a moment the next scripture that we're about to read they would have accused cuz remember those Pharisees knew the the law but Jesus was the one who wrote the law so he knew it better than they did amen so so so let's let's read here uh just a moment at Numbers Chapter 5 if you go with me to Numbers Chapter 5 because when you look at Numbers Chapter 5 we just read in in Deuteronomy and Leviticus when a man was caught in adultery right they were both to be uh stoned a man and a woman but now in Numbers Chapter 5 this is how God dealt with a woman suspected to have committed adultery in the Old Testament how many want to read about that it it's sad but but but this is what this is the word this is what happens now I'm going to read to you in the NIV version so you can kind of understand it a little bit better but you can go back and read it in K King King James version so this is for the younger ones to understand a little a little better I'm going to try to go as quick as possible but try to concentrate here what's going on then the Lord said to Moses speak to the Israelites and say to them if a man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him so that another man has sexual relations with her and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected since there is no witness against against her and she has not been caught in the act and the feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure all right everyone's following so far then he is to take his wife to the priest he must also take an offering of a tenth of an epha of barley flour on the behalf on her behalf he must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it because it is a grain offering for jealousy a reminder offering to draw attention to wrongdoing you know I'm I'm surprised I'm amazed at how many offerings there were in the Old Testament I mean there was even an offering of jealousy this is the offering of jealousy the husband got jealous of the wife you better take that to the priest I'm jealous of my wife I'm I'm accusing my wife of so I'm suspecting something Amen brother but before you suspected something you better you better provide the priest amen these things that that God was telling him that he must do now watch this the priest shall bring her well let's see he must not pour olive oil verse 15 on it or put incense on it because it is a grain offering for jealousy a reminder offering to draw attention to wrongdoing verse 16 the priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord amen the S the S the Pharisees amen what did they have that woman do amen they just threw her down Amen in front of Jesus Amen and Jesus being the priest amen the priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord before the Lord remember that then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the Tabernacle floor into the water can you imagine amen us having a a service like that what kind of church service would that be amen when you go home amen that day that evening man that was an interesting church service brother Wade was over there putting dust in a in a in in in a bowl and and putting it together amen what was he concocting but this is what the Lord told him to do but but but I I I want you I want you to take a look at this amen because go back to what Jesus amen with the adulterous woman there amen what read this in verse 16 it says the priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord then he shall take some holy water amen who is that holy water Christ in a clay jar Christ Christ amen in a clay jar a vessel of clay Jesus was right there in a vessel of clay in human form right in front of this woman and put some dust from the Tabernacle floor into the water some dust what was Jesus doing when he was riding on the dust in the Tabernacle amen so it was it was Jesus amen the holy water The Vessel of clay riding in the dust in the Tabernacle touching the dust becoming one with the Dust in the Tabernacle I don't think that was there for for for just to be there this is the Pharisees knew that this is what they needed to do to this woman but they didn't use this scripture amen they used the other one about stoning about stoning her when really that one didn't really apply to her this one was the one that applied to her right I thought that was interesting amen praise God and then Verse 18 it says after the priest has had the woman stand before the Lord you know what that the Pharisees were there trying to prove that he wasn't Messiah but in them doing that they proved that he was the Messiah they what if you ever do anything wrong young people if you ever sin or do anything amen the best person to run to to be before is before the Lord amen that was the best place for that woman to to be before amen was before the Lord amen most people amen they want to do like Adam when they sin they want to run away from the presence of the Lord and make their own covering and do something about it themselves amen but this woman amen the priest they dragged her under thinking that they were going to do something uh uh you know find uh make Jesus look bad but in reality they were actually making her look good praise God am amen well I don't know it made me uh want to shout inside when I saw that praise the Lord after the priest had has had the woman stand before the Lord he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder offering the grain offering for jealousy while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse amen now just to make it make it short I could read the whole thing you could go back and read it your yourself amen the rest of the chapter basically the priest would take this water put this dust from the tab from the from the temple or from the from the from the temple put it in there mix it together and this woman would drink this and if she would drink it and and and and basically if she I I I if supernaturally because this the priest wasn't doing anything he was just obeying commands it was the Lord amen that was doing something right there you see God is the one that discerns the thoughts and the intents of the heart it's Jesus that that that discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart so it was Jesus there in that Temple that day he was Discerning the thoughts of the woman and the thoughts of those men as well so it was this priest would put this and this woman would drink it and if and the Bible says that if she uh she would it would cause a a a a scar on her on her thigh and uh uh and if her belly would swell then that means that she did commit the ACT but she was doing this before the priest the priest would ask her and say did you do this and if you if you did do this you drink this and if your belly swells basically almost kind of having like a like a miscarriage you know it's what it's in another translation if you keep reading and if if if she has that if that happens to her then that means she did do the ACT but if nothing happens then the husband would have some explaining to do back at home can you imagine both of them going back back home well honey I guess you're innocent yeah but you sleeping in the dogghouse for the rest of the year so you better know what you're talking about before you accuse somebody of anything you better have some proof amen cuz then it won't go well for you amen afterwards praise the Lord so this was the law of the of the woman amen who was thought that she had committed adultery now the in this particular scenario Here with Jesus the woman was caught in the act of adultery now whether she was set up or whether whatever it was the Pharisees knew where she was at so they grabbed her and and and and she she did the ACT amen amen praise the Lord now in Romans chapter 8:1 it says that that there is therefore now no condemnation Amen to them which are in Christ Jesus praise the Lord who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus amen where was she at she was in the temple standing next to the temple she was in Christ amen there is therefore now no condemnation when you are in in his in his presence amen praise the Lord Satan will still try to bombard you with condemnation ation amen you're still you you you you know you did it God knows God knows you did it but as soon as you confess it amen it's in his SE if or for forgiveness to be remembered no more and I don't know how he does it but he does it and I'm thankful that he does it I just praise God for it amen I know many of you could say the same thing amen you know we've been talking about justification lately amen and and Justified as if you've never done it that kind of justification like you've never done it in the first place this is how Jesus was justifying this woman amen I didn't see it neither did they but I know you did it but don't do it again amen that's right and left it at that praise the Lord for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law La could not do n you see the law could not do Amen in this scenario the law couldn't help her in this in this scenario but watch what what what what watch what's next in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh in that likeness of of a jar of clay right and for sin condemned sin in the flesh amen amen he didn't condemn her he condemned he condemned her sin didn't condemn her amen you and me don't have to we don't have to agree with with what the world does out here we don't have to agree with what people do out here no that's condemnable the things that they do we don't condemn the person we condemn their sin amen praise God that's amen that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit I thank God Amen that we have God himself who wrote the law and he was the one who was able to fulfill the law amen you don't have to fulfill it I don't have to fulfill it he's already fulfilled it for you praise the Lord Jesus all right so let's continue here in John in John chapter 8 verse 7 it says here now so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast the stone at her he didn't fall for their trap amen right how can you deceive the word when it were the author of the word when he was the one who wrote the word he was the one who wrote that about the taking the dust from the temple and mingling it with water amen y he was the one who wrote that so the priests were trying to make him looked dumb but he he said I I'm I'm not an idiot I know what I wrote that's right and I'm not falling for your trap he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground so he was continuing to mingle himself with that dust and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience at least they had a conscience to do that man they didn't have enough conscience Amen to do whatever they they wanted to do with that woman or or drag her make humiliate her before the people they could have been children there they could have been anybody there for for all we know they didn't care amen they just wanted to make sure and get at Jesus because Jesus was robbing them of their popularity Jesus was robbing them of their of their trust before the people amen and they wanted to do everything they can to get at to get at Jesus and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and watch this and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst amen I want you to know saints that this walk is between you and Christ amen young people when when when when you f fall if you make a mistake amen that's between you and God God wants you to be in his midst God wants you to come to him amen so that he can do what he's what he paid and died for for for on the cross for you to do amen so he's got the gift ready for you he's got the the the the the the the the the antidote I guess you could say the the the medicine for you the problem is is that we don't take it but it's there available for you amen abely and so you got to have your alone moment with with Jesus Christ just like this woman had her alone moment amen praise the Lord when Jesus had lifted verse 10 and when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto Heroman where are those thine accusers amen where are those that that brought you dragged you here maybe naked dragged you out here in front of them where are they at and watch what she says she says and then he asked her hath no man condemned thee in other words he wants her to to to to to to realize that no one condemn thee he wants her to reply to him amen yeah I'm not condemned Lord I'm I'm free you you got to accept your freedom yourself first amen but God can't set you free unless you realize that you are set free and he whom the son set free is free indeed but all Jesus can do amen is just un loose the the the the uh unlock the chain right you're the one who's got to who's who's got to walk free amen from your condemnation from the things that you have done in the past amen God can't do that for you he's done that already for you you just got to accept it and walk free Amen brother Brandon would always tell that story about Johnny Crow was it Johnny Crow not Johnny Crow but uh yeah the little the little crow that that always that always thought that that that that he was he was always chained you see but but but he wasn't you know he was he was not he was he was not chained up and and everybody all the other crows that that that they were flying around him and say hey Johnny come on and and eat corn with us and and be free with us and and he said no I'm over here just um I can't I'm stuck in this chain and I'll think I'll just die here well those those those crows couldn't do anything for him no nobody could do anything for him here man nobody can nobody can free you from that mindset amen if if if it's there you see right it's something that you have to do by yourself you have to come to terms with God you have to you have to do that on your own amen God's only done it up to a certain point but there's a part that you've got to do as well amen amen so this is what Jesus is asking her to do where are your accusers hath no man condemned thee amen and she said verse 11 no man Lord no man Lord no man has condemned me and Jesus said unto her uh neither do I condemn thee amen what a what beautiful words to hear from from the Lord himself amen neither do I condemn thee remember this is woman this woman is being shown grace even really before the they were still living under the law think about it at that time they were still living under law and this woman is being shown Grace in such a way amen that that that we can never understand amen because she did the deed but she she was tricked into into that position that she was at amen right God knew that Jesus knew that amen amen neither do I condemn thee but watch he doesn't justify her sin he says go and sin no more amen I don't condemn you no man here is condemning you they're gone they feel they they feel condemned themselves cuz they knew that that that they had sinned before and probably with that woman I don't know right what kind of Hypocrites are those I still you you really if you look at the life of the Pharisees I me they were Jesus was was just and and and ring against them and man the way they they were and the life that they lived amen was very very very hypocritical and that's why he was he was he was always in Con in condemnation mode in their life right I I know that there was there was probably uh you know he was he was merciful to to um uh the one that came to him by night um Nicodemus he showed Mercy to whoever wants Mercy right even to the Pharisee amen but he had a some big issue with with with these Pharisees because the people looked up to these people amen you know in this hour Saints you know we have people that all they do is condemn we got people that left this message amen and all they do is condemn the preachers that that that that that are in this message the people that that that that that still believe believe this message they talk about them look look what he said this here in this sermon and and this this right here and you know what that's the exact same spirit that the Pharisees had it's a spirit of condemnation and where does that Spirit come from right Spirit of the devil amen amen cuz Jesus is not around condemning but the Pharisees were amen but he tells her he says neither do I condemn me go and sin no more amen and so Jesus Jesus knew that she had sinned amen but he was now showing her grace before discipline and instruction amen amen I think that's key uh parents amen when be that you show Grace to your children amen they're going to they're going to make mistakes and they're going to do wrong amen but if you come at them with a point of with with with Grace amen and then give them instruction then they'll they'll be willing to listen to you right brother but what is our first reaction our knee-jerk reaction the knee-jerk reaction that Jesus had was yeah condemn her Stone her yeah you're right no he he was probably thinking about it right in his human in his human mind but him being the word amen he's like I know what the word says right and so our knee your reaction sometimes is is is to condemn and our our our daughter and our son amen they did something amen they deserve this they deserve punishment amen but what is the Lord trying to do amen what is the Lord trying to do in the whole situation praise God and you stop and think amen before you condemn you show Grace cuz I'm telling you Saints amen you're going to do much more showing Grace to people than than you do condemning people and sending them to hell you do more with love than you do with with condemning people and yes they broke the law and yes they don't come to church and yes they don't do none of these things amen but you show Grace to them you be the example you be the example of the one that does come to church you be the example of one that does hold the door for the for the elderly person that's walking out the door you be the example of the one that that that that that does nice things for one another Paul said be kind to one another right you be that example and that's you showing Grace and you know what and the one that does not is not doing it and the one that you think is rebellious and and and and and is just just rebellious and obnoxious maybe they'll see your example yeah and say you know what and you may not know that they even even thought that but later on in their life they they you know what I learned that from Brothers so and so but he never said anything to me about it I just saw his life I just saw him doing it one time I just saw her doing it one time amen that's why our actions amen speak louder than words that's very true amen Jesus actions amen spoke louder than any condemnation that he could ever do amen and what do you think that woman went to do the Bible doesn't say after afterwards what happened to the woman but do you think that she really then took heart to not do that again I think so because she was shown Grace she was shown Grace amen every reminds me when brother Brandon preached marriage and divorce and we're we're we're about to finish up here remember when brother Brandon preached marriage and divorce I'm not going to preach marriage and divorce so don't don't worry but when brother Brandon preached that amen there was people there was confusion amongst the the church the church the churches you know cuz you had there in that congregation there was people that were married three four or five times had children with multiple women and different things brother Brandon knew all that and he was faced with that in brother bram's life he never condemned that because why if he would have if he would have went ahead and condemned all those people and and in their position positions and things like that amen then then he would have when he would have gotten the word from the Lord then he would have have to retract everything that he would have said he got that word from the Lord and what did the Lord show Grace Grace and some of those people are in worse conditions that we could ever be am and they were given another opportunity but here's the here's the here's what the brother banam told him he said go and don't do it and teach your children not to do it again so he he was giv them the grace first the Lord was giving the people the grace first then he gave them the instruction right go you're free stay the way you are but don't do it again right and don't and teach your children not to do it again amen Grace first then instruction why because when Grace comes first then the person that's receiving the Grace will be able to accept that instruction much easier right but when you go in there with the condemnation first and the the law says this the Bible says this you see what it says and and all that amen more than likely they won't hear you out they're already they're already upset that they got caught they're already upset and and and and and you know young people especially amen that they got caught right they don't want to be talked to amen but you show them the grace yes so your heart I love you I love you and and and and I I'll do I just want to see you that's what I told that's what I told my daughters I want to see you amen I want to walk you down the aisle to the right man right amen that that's what I want to see amen and I love you and and I just care so much about you they'll be melting it helps because why it helps me when God speaks to me that way and then I can read his word and I say well yes the word says not to do that this this this this Lord I believe your word amen praise God and this is what this woman received what a great God that we serve amen praise the Lord so you know and I'm not giving you I'm not giving a license to go do whatever you this Jesus clearly condemned her act he told her don't sin anymore don't do it again but he didn't condemn her where are thine accusers I don't see them Lord neither do I condemn thee right amen I want to hear those words amen every time I go to Jesus and and then next the following week when Satan is is bombarding me with look what I did the week before and and look and and I go to the Lord Lord help me help me I I still can't Jesus is saying I don't I don't know what you're talking about amen you know one of the things that really struck me about hos when he was telling me his testimony he was he was telling me he was telling me uh you know he he was saying he was fighting that thing of condemnation you know and he was just telling he was telling the Lord he got down prayed to the Lord and he said Lord help me to just forget these things the way you forget about them help me to forget the the the the the things that I have done even the the the the woman that that I did these things with helped me to even forget her you know she's she's the she's the person uh I want her soul to be saved as well but help me to forget about about these things he said that the he said he went to sleep that one night he right before he went to bed he prayed that and he just he said he was just sobbing before the Lord and he went to bed and he said the following day he woke up he said brother Luis you won't believe it it felt like it was like I woke up like I was a a a like a big weight was lifted off my chest and and and and and he said that he had forgotten uh U he it's not that he didn't he he says it's not that I don't care about the the the the his his girl's Mom it's not that you know but it but it's just like it has nothing nothing he can forget about her easily which in turn forgets about the things that he has done you know it's not upon him anymore you see and so God heard that prayer gave him freedom and that was that freedom that he needed so that he can continue with his walk with God Amen and so God can do that for you young people God can do that for you even adults amen we we experience condemnation just as much as you all do why because we've we've lived a bit longer and we've done more things dumb things than than you have and we're just here trying to warn you and so that you don't go that way you don't have to go that way young people cuz we already did it for you we know what it's like and so you so that you don't have to do it but what a greater thing is is that he's already done it for you amen he's already paid the price for you so even if you do fall make mistakes there's a way out there's a way of Escape Lord there's a way amen he's in the temple you just got to be before him go before him he's right there ready and saying neither do I condemn thee
