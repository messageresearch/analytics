it's like somebody fills your pocket full of money and turns around and walks off thank you we ever ask it's good for us it's good for us to repent it's good for us try that on healing sometimes and all at once it started his hands all the way up and down the back of my leg and all through my back chiropractors i got work to stand here and preach for an hour i was in constant pain cramps stand here hold on he said well you didn't tell nobody i don't like to brag on the devil i like let her cry why because my healer he's already told me i'm healed tell me when he's gonna take away the pain that's none of my business when he's going to take it away i'd go hunting down in the woods i was really afraid i was afraid i couldn't make it back even four-wheeler to get out you'll act like it you know what that's so bad why are you going to go around with fat yeah oh i'm in bed for the 40 seconds me no you're the one who don't understand you want somebody to touch you i've told you this before you don't like it there's people that rather stay sick where they get pitted keep your sickness it'll come to pass a problem of reality here to the national director you got what you thought you said you made a habit i don't care what it takes to get there i would run around and say that like to talk about the faith to brother see when the sister left to see her she had something in her mind she's thinking she wants something she has a desire all right she put forth her effort to walk this car it's always when you believe you don't have to be pretty far that's just what we do to help you we you have to walk back um he's in the grave waiting on you and i to call him out of there sing and worship have a good time you've got a testimony you want to give it come and tell the people are you afraid to say you're healed god says you're healed oh if i just had thus saith the lord that is the say of the lord the word of god says you're healed that's right amen now you're denying it when you say you're not all right that's right quit negative confession quit being sicily about it all right amen and start saying it right and walk into it that's right what are you trying to make something happen no i don't have to make nothing happen i'm saying god will make it happen amen you always hate it amen that's right who'll be first sing a song justify the testimony testimony come on here come on up here we'd rather have it up here where everybody can see you we can hear you well he was out here preaching on love and and forgiveness and love and i was back there wondering was i gonna live for the next five minutes i was so sick everything i have eaten for two weeks i think was coming out of me i've never had anything like this before just like pins and needles sticking all over me and i thought i'm fixing to faint i really i and i thought if i could just make it to brother sam's chair and stretch out for a minute i'll be all right but i knew there was no way i could get up and go in there and in a few minutes here comes lisa i know she's not gonna mind me telling you this and she said sister gil is there anything i can do for you and i said lisa just no just pray i'm so sick and so and she said well i'm gonna go stand back outside for a few minutes and give you some time in here by yourself and she came back in a few minutes and said are you all right and i said yes but she this is precious she got down i don't know if she was on her knees or what she'd have to be and reached in the bathroom and took hold of my ankle and you know what all of a sudden i just started feeling better and better and i told her i said lisa i'm feeling better amen and i said just let me be here for a few minutes you know and i just started feeling better and better and lisa thank you i thank god for touching me through you amen and so he's out here preaching and it's happening back there in the bathroom anybody else he'll be next just a word sing a song we want you up here where everybody can see you where everybody here amen which one um one protestant just mentioned that you know when i came up from prayer i was talking i've been talking to sister gill about it here they know you do one right here thank you and um that experience that i had um what was the mystery about it or if that's the right word to use i had so much stuff on my mind to say and sometimes brothers say have a hard time understanding me you know sometimes with the accent and i'm saying to myself how am i gonna explain all this so how am i gonna get it out but that's what i was really thinking too how was am i going to get it out and the music and everything playing and when he said you have what you asked for right the first when he said it the first time a doubt came through my mind and he looked me in the eye and he said it again and i guess that is when it really hit home and since after that i just want to say that i feel different hello i believe i am a different person right and i believe that i'm ready thank you he's got something to say he won't do either one of them and both of them might be fine i almost married something thank you my dad used to say better late than night yeah but half time i've always run late amen well though i'm glad we're here tonight amen we wouldn't miss it for nothing i certainly enjoyed that enjoyed that amen the minister there brother jason amen that's the truth all right over the years how many yo i've not gotten near as many years in as brother sam you do there but over the years i have seen over and over just a root of bitterness get in somebody's life right you know and and good folks sure just good folks don't mean no no harm to anybody right we give you the shirt off their backs right we've all been there considering about ourselves so many times you know right but then just some some little something get down on the other side and they don't the people don't necessarily have to even say it it's just something you you you perceive something you say well they don't like me or they did this or that or whatever and you know it it struck me one time and i'm not going to preach but i don't know all right but you're going to give me an hour and a half i'd like to see you go out ain't nothing worse than getting a reputation but you know it struck me one time about who's telling the truth and you know we could say well i saw i saw brother dale i saw brother wade do such and such a thing and you know what with these natural eyes we might have seen it right we could have actually saw it right right but what these natural eyes didn't see between the time we saw him do that the time we started to speak that to somebody or do something might have just been brother wade getting down on his knees right right and said oh god right exactly i shouldn't have done that or i shouldn't have said that and then we go forth and we said well i know my brother i know he did this and that i want to ask you something who's the liar then right right brother wade and he says listen you know i did it's under the blood right the brother would sit there and say well they did this and no no because you're seeing this in the eyes of god right he never did it to begin with right right right when brother brennan begins teaching and preaching on justification he's not saying here that you know it's not just as though they didn't do it he said they didn't do it again they never did that right right you know we ought to be the most freest place in europe that's right because we can raise our hands and say oh amen i am the redeemed amen i'm the redeemer but you know when you're saying i am the redeemed you're saying that god has taken you from some place someplace it was out there and he put you back where you were at to begin with who were you at to begin with he said he created them in his own image and perfect he created that very image of god amen amen when he spoke he spoke a perfect right individual right he spoke a perfect life right he spoke a life that that has no doubts it has no pain that has no hurt brother i really believe when you were sitting there and you're you're struggling trying to say well lord i believe and i'm going to do that anyways brother branham said when you recognize that the word of god is evil right you've heard from your theopoly right yeah and at a time when we're sitting there and that that word of god might have been by his stripes i'm healed right it might have been you know to speak the word speak to this mountain it shall be moved but you know when you begin to feed on that word you're hearing from that body that he created before the foundational world you're hearing from that word of god right amen and brother branham said that body is is what i forget what year he said this is it but it's just not even 20 feet away right right right you know i'll just say this is my personal belief here belief here tonight but i believe we're closer than 23. 2012 was a rough year i'll just be honest with you buddy i don't know how we made it through in a lot of ways it's been it's been rough and and i don't look for it to be any better naturally physically speaking in 2013. it'll probably be even a lot harder right right but you know what i'm going to be closer to my 2013 that wasn't 2012. i'm gonna be closer to my theory in 2013 than i was in 2012. why because i'm going to keep feeding on this eagle friday right that's it we got a lot to be happy all right this past year i told the church at home i said my you know we look at the different things well i've got this problem and i've got that problem oh my you you ain't got no problems now that's a hateful thing for a preacher that's a hateful thing for somebody that has helped me preach everybody knows preachers think of the problems right now but that's a hateful thing for somebody that's got the easy life you know to say to somebody that's out there working and struggling and having this and that and everything else but since you ain't got a problem in the world right right right you've got opportunities right gloria all right amen it's an opportunity for god to show himself great in your life amen right right absolutely i thank god for all the opportunities amen god will make this child a blessing amen amen lord amen amen god bless you sir amen getting ready i'll just say this you know what brother dutch was talking about steve wade was over praying in there you are doing talking about how bad he is he's asking god to forgive you know being pastor puts you in a position i remember brother here one time he said anybody that ever says anything says i'll bring the stone and let's see you know the first one i said brother if you bring the throne the stone i have to throw it that's because i'm pastor right that's serious i said i gotta throw this down whether i want to or not i got to throw it because i'm the pastor but you see i used to worry about that being pastor where the bible says turn 61 over to satan for destruction of the flesh that used to bother me because it's pasture maybe sometime i have to do it i searched diligently to find the answer i found one day worth it you can't turn somebody over to the devil i know you're thinking the bible says it he said the bible says turn since you went over to the devil you're not reading you're reading what you want to read i found where the prophet said it this way he said you turned that person over to god amen he said then they turn them over to the devil god does you know see because i can't turn him over to the devil because like i said what if it was waiting i'm turning over to the devil he's over there praying and he's asking god to forgive him and i'm over here trying to kill him you see the bible says exactly right the prophet gave us understanding see then that way you just bring them you've got to go through stages you've got 30 days examples to go and somebody to witness what you're doing and then you bring them before the church and then you lose them for god to do what he wants to do he said he'll put a devil life for him he'll bring him to the right and it ain't you having to do it right you see him doing his work that's right oh hey uh please hello it hallelujah what's that turtle bye when i was born again is is i is i thank god for especially michael and i know everybody that's grown up with michael he used to be a real handful but i was talking to him a lot of people have been praying all through the years and even one year we were not there i could feel the prayers but you know i mean it was just what i would go up and they would know me i was talking to his uh english teacher the other day and she said you know what miss kaliningo we just love michael you're such a good example to all the other kids and we call him angel for all your prayers now i say i'm so proud of my question see where the festival is huh um him is through is is oh foreign foreign is is okay the coffee has sewn maybe some cream up in here we have people from all over the world we have them from zimbabwe trinidad kenya and then we got sister regina tell around here that you've got to love each other we talk about each other a lot you know you talk about being truthful in everything you don't not complain be negative and everything but what i tell is the truth i believe you know but let me tell you what i doubt there's anybody in this house right now as old as i am and i'm going to tell you that's right i prayed when i left the house today lord you either give us back tonight in the morning or wrap yourself in your mouth right you know man and i don't uh remember how long we got to go i don't have a long rest of me he gave me is lord i have you and me thank you for your blessings thank you your blessings i'd and before you even ask him was on the way is is just remember what is help is on the way just hold on my savior is but i believe it happened the i wasn't there that morning when mary but i believe it happened it's like the bible says that a lonely man named jesus you would sing i wasn't there a lot of people don't know there's a little lady that was singing up here she used to sing with atlanta christian choir but you know one day he got where she couldn't sing what they were singing so when they got down to father son and holy ghost blessed trinity one of those something like that she couldn't sing it she had to quit she couldn't sing what they were saying because she had to quit that's god in our lives come on brother on me and all four i gave my heart to the lord seemingly that's when my troubles begin and 02 my younger sister dies manually oh four well i had myself checked out and well andrews the lord probably through i mean that was uh it was a close brush you know that's approaching six years then we all found out that i don't bounce too good fell through that roof and made a mess out of me and thank you lord for bringing me through it and thank you lord for my church family yes uh we all went to it together you know being surrounded by people like you uh you wouldn't let me give up that's right nobody's right but anyway i i thank the lord every day right brother dale he said i don't want to give the devil credit for hurting you know i don't either over six years now and i'm not bragging on the devil right but i don't know of a day that i hadn't heard right and uh but i know but i know what keeps me going amen lord give me strength i've been hunting with robert dale brother dale no way i'll see you right there we went to kansas and uh i didn't think there was any mountains out there well me and brother dale we walked up our river basin just like this just straight up and i told him i didn't know that i come here to go mountain climbing but i think that was pretty easy today man and that was only just a few months after after the lord used those doctors to put me back together but i thank you for uh for everything yeah good glory all honor glory praise the lord over two weeks talking and life and every day doctors say we got to do so and so he said just get on with it y'all know that wasn't real me you know one day woke up he's a miracle working god he was busted up never formed had to do all kind of operations had to do all kind of mendings and fix them but he's still god stayed there in the hospital salon so much still they thought i was his daddy and joyce was his mother somebody came to the hospital one day looking for him they said where is danny fountain they said well his mom and daddy just took him down it's no joke for two weeks we ate and slept in the hospital but god brought him through yeah there's a there's a lady back there sister back there asked yeah today she's saying not today and not not right now and i said well how about 15 minutes from now i get sister jackson because she might want to sing fourth and this brother this brother that's come with us tonight if you make a little music or sing or whatever don't be bashful even the rest of them are bashful i guess i'm wearing for one right here because we see we believe god is real amen amen and i'm not one bit behind on one thought i'm looking forward to the greatest year that you've ever had that's right he said what if the rapture don't come from what if it if it don't i'll say next year that's the greatest jeremy amen that's right see my testimony is always positive all is well he's right on time there's nothing out of cater he said well how come we're here 40 something years after the prophet left the scene right why did israel have to stay almost 40 years in egypt because of rejecting moses when god's phone right people's phone but you know when they got to crying out and wanted to be delivered they were delivered right but around said each age falls and goes to the ground he said if people start crying out for deliverance he said god opens up another age and brings another message another time come on sister i'm just talking to y'all get here okay uh let's uh remember sister amy kishan right she and her family if if you know if old satan's slew foot ain't working on me he's working on that thing he's the faith is a simple thing that's believing in god accepting what he said and then just thank him for it then go say it thank god for my healing you remember the blind man that put around the toe he was healed for days he was out there saying extra extra so in the background nice drops i'm healed i can see he sits down in his barber's chair and the barber's cutting his hair and the barber's kind of making light of him said i thought that man soldier good hill he said by his drops i can see about that time his eyes came open and he goes running the streets it's not for us to question where they're going what time it is it's for us to believe in god amen yes trees so till we if this is uh foreign me oh in the sky and i say we have been here me is forever me oh word of the lord it's been five years since we've been back now i'm so thankful too that uh a lot of you don't know but i was in pretty bad shape i mean health-wise i hadn't walked with a cane i was told when uh when i left the church that i'd be dead in six months it's been over five years thank you brother richard sitting in a wheelchair down in front of a church one time i wouldn't give him two weeks to live that's right i was really afraid to pray for him because it was kind of a touchy situation i made my way around finally just got over to him just laid my hands there that's the lord touching me i believe god singing a song one time in service he said he loved this song it's when we all get to get heaven i didn't want to take a quick moment and and give a little bit of a testimony that about my life and the things that i had done uh you know i used to teach understand years ago here and turned my back on god and walked away and did what i wanted to do instead of what he wanted me to do unfortunately i paint dearly both physically emotionally psychologically and financially okay in every aspect i've been hit uh you know it's uh it's been kind of tough because i've lived every kind of wrong that you could ever think of i've tried to drown my problems in alcohol smoking tobacco all kinds of stuff okay but i never found the answer that's right and uh it took going to war seeing some horrible things and coming back and realizing exactly what i had right right in front of me the whole time and god took he made a difference in my life he's he he caught me at my weakest moment and smashed a hold of me and showed me just how weak i really was no matter how physically strong i've been most of my life my physical strength meant nothing that's right and my sons they love singing with me and for a long time while i was doing my thing i couldn't sing a gospel song all the way through my boy stopped i couldn't see and everybody knows that i love to sing and i asked god that if whenever he brought me back not if but when he brought me back that i could have my voice back that i could sing amen and i would sing for the rest of my days and give him give honor to him through sin yes sir and now my little boy here wants to sing the song with me and we actually whenever he heard it he wanted me to download the song on my phone the only one i could find was alan jackson okay you know what i mean i still got the song on my phone and we're sitting there singing it at the house he said daddy said i think i like i like the way we sing it better in church i said well okay that's that's fine you know what that that's great all right so we're gonna give it a shot all right and i always tell sister esther that i'm terrible with keeping with music so hopefully he'll be able to do a better job than i would i have no idea you'll move a little bit where he's gonna get you better let's move over this way a little bit and he'll be able to hear us too all right where you want to start you'll start the at the course or the very very top what song it's uh when we all get to heaven page 166 in the spiral and if y'all want to sing with us be my guest because as everybody up here in the group that is going to sing here a little while found out i sing better with other people love of jesus the is me when we is is me for the corn you sing come on take us on the part amen sure just to find a little bit of church yes you need to get them okay i'd like to say that we always enjoy being in church right right it is that's pretty much what we live for right now and more and more as time goes on right right because the bible does say forsake not the assembly amen of yourselves together as the manner of some is and i know some of them right right thanks so much for more yes as you see the day approaching do you see the day that's right all right that's it that's the fun thing if you really see the day approaching if you really see it you'll do something about it right glory if you don't you won't right that's very a very simple equation right amen that's right very simple you know the lord has been so good to me one song says he set my captive spirit free right man amen i'm in a brand new world since the lord saved me right i've been in that new world now about 33 years fact is the eighth day of this month is fixing to come in the eighth day of this month will mark 33 years that i've been in this brand new world amen and i'm going to tell you when i step out there into this wonderful creation and i look up in that sky and at them trees you know from time to time it comes back to me all over again that's brand new trees right there you know that's right that i'm looking at i believe the bible said something about or maybe it's a song that says the trees of the field shall clap their hand and you know everything that the lord made praises him except for lost humanity right that's right so i thank the lord for delivering me from a wicked life of sin 33 years ago yes sir yes you would have had to know how it really was and if you hadn't known how it really was then you you'd have had to have a lot of that thing that we've been talking about here tonight called platelet right exactly otherwise you would have poured out your little book and you're to mark my name out right forget it right you see the thing about me was i was raised to know what i needed to do as i come into my teenage years and the lord began to strive upon the waters of my soul and i walked into that valley that's called the valley of decision and i made a decision right and the decision that i made was a bad decision and i walked out into this dark world of sin and i got so lost out there that what it actually come down to with me brother dale was that i decided that i would be an atheist what can the law do for somebody like that i'll tell you what he done for a lot of them he cut them off yes it is that's what he done for a lot of them he cut them off he didn't cut me off thank you thank you glory well i had somebody that was ringing the prayer bales brother they was ringing them regularly i know what this brother's talking about right here when he talks about being delivered unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus and i understand what he's talking about when he said we don't deliver them unto satan we deliver them to god and then god does whatever's right right in the best interest that's right sometimes it looks like sometimes as i would say it cuts them off but right right yeah but anyway i had somebody that was praying for me gloria i had an old daddy he's been gone nearly two years he was praying for me and um i remember a time as i began to get into that dark world of atheism and i was running from the call of god and ain't no other way to run but in the darkness and unbelief that's the only way to run that's where you're going if you run from god you ain't running into the lights you running out of the light and away from the light right so i was running and i was running from god and i began to run into that dark world of atheism because i didn't choose to believe that i was going to hell even though i know that i was unless i turned them well one uh day i still lived at home i might have been 16 years old i was uh around the house i can't remember exactly what all i was doing i still lived at home i was around the house i can't remember for sure exactly what i was thinking about that day but most likely that's what i was thinking about because that's what i thought about all the time was how that i don't believe in god and i'm going to disprove his existence in any way that i can mama go to the library and give me some books about ufo i want to know more about that well poor mama she she done anything little boy wanted her to do she went to the library and brought back a big stack of books about because the way i looked at if you could prove ufos you could disprove god and that's that's that seems to be the way that the the the big brains of the world because they're always looking out younder gazing at them stars and at them planets to see if there's any water or if there's any molecules right or living sails or dead cells that they should say they used to be alive they're always a looking brother trying to find it they're looking diligently definitely because evidently they believe if they do they've won this war against god against the belief right in the living god right well that's the road i was taking that was the decision that i was making one day i was around the house and i i come into the house and i went into my room and laid down on the bed and as i said i don't remember exactly what i was thinking but most likely my mind was on them atheistic thoughts that i was entertaining in my mind all the time back in them days well i laid down on my bed and i was laying there and on the other side of the wall i could hear my daddy praying praise the lord thanks god his room was right on the other side of the wall from my room i was laying there and i could hear my daddy praying and they wouldn't nothing unusual about that that was commonplace i was used to that right with nothing uh about it to disturb me i heard it all the time well not all the time but i heard it on a very regular basis i hear my daddy praying he spent a lot of his time in his room praying well i was laying there and i was listening to in the back of my mind listening to my daddy praying probably thinking about atheism while i was listening to that thing and praying and a little bit i could hear my daddy speaking in another tongue and i laid there and i listened to that and the thought that was in my heart i can tell you at that point what i was thinking the thought that was in my heart was they wouldn't have to be anything real about that a person could do that within yourself that wouldn't have to be a supernatural thing right or a supernatural word you see i didn't want to believe it was real i didn't want to believe it was a supernatural i was laying there listening to my daddy's as it began to speak in other tongues and i was laying there in eyes disbelieving that's what they call it nowadays the bible calls it unbelievable i was laying there in unbelief listening to that in unbelief doubt working in my mind in my heart unbelief setting up on the throne of my heart even as i was listening to the gift of the spirit in operation and i laid there a little bit and all of a sudden there was an utterance that came forth out of that vessel on the other side of the wall something like i had never heard in my life and ain't never heard nothing like that since never have i heard such an evidence come forth out of an urban blessing shortly i got up and i walked out of my room and down deep in my heart i knew i had heard something that it wouldn't be possible for a person to do right within their own actual ability what it was is this right here the good holy ghost spoke directly to the thought of my heart he let me know if i had been able to acknowledge what he was letting me know he let me know that boy i know exactly where you are i know exactly what you're thinking amen that ought to have wiped the slate clean it ought to have wiped out that whole system of unbelief that was setting up in my heart and in my mind it ought to i've gotten rid of it it ought to have eliminated it and if i had made a conscious acknowledgement right it would have done it i think this is tying in with what the brother preached and out a little bit there if i hadn't made a conscious acknowledgement in my heart and in my mind that that's god speaking to me but you see that acknowledgement didn't happen i walked out of my room and i dismissed that or i didn't just consciously make an effort to dismiss it it just drifted away and i just forgot about it many years later after i had walked back into the light after that i had been delivered unto satan and found out what it's like to taste of the torments of hell just a little bit in the present existence and i walked back into the fullness of the glorious light of the lord jesus christ then i looked back into my past and i began to see things that i had forgot about were that the lord brother pointed me out right right from one time to another down through the line of time that's just one experience that i could tell you about right now what it took for me to get back to believing in the lord enough to where i could be saved brother dale i had to be delivered unto satan if you ain't never been down that road that's hard for you to get a hold of it bites the business says most likely you can't get a hold of it if you've not been i'm talking about ain't no trouble for me to get a hold of it because i've been through it and then i received a glorious experience of salvation yes sir amen one that the that the uh accuser has never had the courage to challenge amen that experience that i received on january the 8th of 1980 i laid on my face about four or five hours that night and i thought i had blasphemed against the holy ghost i felt like it was over and done with it but they just wouldn't nothing else to do because i couldn't face being lost eternally after about four or five hours as i said of laying on that old rocking chair there in my mom and daddy's living room i couldn't say nothing but have mercy that was the only words that i could have glory right right right and i didn't feel like there was any question to me i mean i felt like i was and i got into a trance and i lost track of work where i was at who was around what was going on i lost track of all that and i began to raise up and and bow back over and raise back up and i didn't realize i was even good and all of a sudden way down in the deepest part of my innermost being i felt an instantaneous change take place amen and when i did i realized right then the realization come into my mind not an imagination right right but the realization come into my mind that my soul was saved and immediately the realization come into my mind that my name was being written in the book of life right then and if you throw the five gallon bucket of ice water over me it wouldn't have took my breath away no more than that experience did right now sure and when i come up from there as i said i had an experience that the accuser has never had the courage to challenge amen he's challenged me in many different ways he's told me a minute be the time boy you ain't gonna make it you're going down in defeat this time and truly i felt like i was it's like brother david said we don't want to lift up the devil again but still we need to acknowledge that the devil is much on his job he is very much concerned about accomplishing his goals and he's very diligent in the pursuit right of his objectives right we've heard it said mean to be the time have we not heard it said the devil don't miss an opportunity right well anyway we could tell many experiences many blessings that the lord has given us but we're still i haven't said it all and i think we've told you as much of it as we could tell you about we're still just nothing right i just know that's right they just ain't nothing to me right yeah the grace of god and paul said by the grace of god i am what i am right and i hear preachers repeat that from time to time you know they think that sounds big to say that that way by the grace of god i am what i am that sounds you know they sound like power when they say that you know i told my son i was sitting in the living room talking to my oldest son a few months ago or a year ago or so i told him i said i don't say that and i said there's a reason why i don't say that by the grace of god i am what i am i said i don't want people looking at me and saying is that the best right i'll tell you what my soul is stirred more and more in this day and are we living i'm looking for any opportunity to let go of my savior yes sir if i can sing a little song you know whatever i can do yes or no i'll try to sing and i've not even got the words to this but um you probably know it i'm not sure what you do it might be in this you looking book oh old water savior is probably the name of it all the saviors probably do i will catch at least i pretty well know it but not whether i've got the right gears whatever you want to go in you know there you go is oh you oh oh is he left i'm is is his heart was broken oh is is is oh this heart his hands were he gave his last foreign hallelujah what a savior as it comes when it comes amen all right yeah i just uh appreciate what god's done in my life i can take you took place in my front yard when i felt the presence of the lord but i've strayed from there over the years but i i know he's real because i was right there he came in that presence you know marked the spot and i believe a lot of that because of what i've done is why i've had the trouble in this flesh and suffering for sure sicknesses i've had i believe there's a young minister in this message that was mentored by our pastor who suffered in the flesh all right and i'm telling you that we have to ask for forgiveness my brother danny i was supposed to be there that morning i was supposed to be with him when he fell off that chicken house for something happened and i wasn't there i don't know what i cannot remember but it was he and i were going there with jacob and we were going to take meal off this chicken and i asked for your forgiveness bro but that's always troubled me in my heart right this time i have here jacob fountain many years ago always pray for the brother yes sir the young people you don't see here amen you know sometimes i have to stop and ask myself maybe they see something maybe i'm out of character when i'm not in the presence of the bride maybe they saw me do something and then maybe i did something wrong they said that's not real but the brother that was just up here man i thought coke was a real thing but i believe that brother he's got the real thing and he's trouble and he suffered for it as we all will but i just ask for your forgiveness i believe in hebrews 11 5 is my favorite scripture in the bible by enoch and this is it it's a testimony so please god you need to stop and ask yourself what is your testimony and when brother dick asked about a testimony the other night it troubled me that i didn't take the opportunity to share what god has done in my life you know i've never been without a job more than a weekend we pray for me and for a job here right i was staying at work one day and i was praying i said lord if it be your will i change jobs give me a sign i put my resume on monster.com years ago and after i made that prayer 30 minutes out of the blue a head hunter called me and asked me do i have an opportunity would you be interested in a job and i hadn't spoke to anybody in five years but i prayed in 30 minutes of lord sure amen amen i go to this company that hadn't had a profit in five years they give you 52 of your monthly earnings and bonuses if they make the numbers they have made a profit in five years i've been with them four and a half four years now and from january one three months after i started they paid a profit bonus every month 52 37 that's an extra check two checks a month and lisa if you're not getting tithes on that see tan but i'm telling you it's worth it but it's it's almighty god and i don't see how anybody can walk around in this world that doesn't believe in god right sterling going through what he did right the fear that he must have had in his heart as a young person but think about somebody doesn't even believe me you know when i tell the kids in sunday school my dad had brain cancer and sister milker forever over he called i had we had a fight and sometimes he told me i don't ever want to see you again we would go two or three years and i would call you know because because of all these things that i didn't have i had trouble with all the time now the blue i'd walk up two or three layers i said how are you doing he said where you been that's where you told me never come around again you know we were too much alike yes but i got a call one night and uh be glaring somebody wants to give you a horse i had seen my dad in two years and he comes driving up and calls me and says meeting in perry georgia i got a horse for ashley so i get down in perry georgia and he's riding around with a lady that was his girlfriend high school that should have been a sign something to me right then but his girlfriend in high school he was all red-paced he'd been drinking hard and i never thought anything about it he gave me this horse and i'm walking his horse around the rescuer like a dog because i don't know what to do with the horse i get the horse on call weight and then i said we gotta build a fence yeah all the church i mean was over we're putting fence up the next day but anyway to get to the short of the story is he called me about a couple of months later so i called tayden goodbye and this was in the afternoon i said where are you going he says i'm going to hospital i ain't coming out and you know i didn't i had talked to him a month so i didn't know what was going on but this has always troubled me so i got to give up my heart so i called sister milka or something happened sister milken got me one of those emergency flights down in florida of course he'd already gone in surgery and come out of surgery and all the machines are doing wonderful things and all the signs the bottle signs are good well i had to make a decision whether to remove they said he was brain dead from the surgery and i had to remove the machine so i called brother wade i said brother what would you pray with me because i believe that if it's god's will right i'll lay this bible on him and i will pray and he can be risen up if it's god's will but you know he doesn't have the faith i had my father didn't have the faith i had right that's where he fell short i had the faith that i that it being god's will he'd raise up and i believe that today had been god's will and every time i've gone through surgery i know that i can lay down on their table and i'm gonna come out of there because i have the faith that god's to raise me up if he doesn't so be it right and i'm going to go in there believing and that's what i want to tell everybody right and that's what i want to tell sterling and anybody that comes across any challenges your faith you've got to believe right right when they talk about this world being insane it's those people that don't believe i don't see how they can get from day to day right yeah i don't know that's right and that's why we have the chaos and everything we have out there right but i just wanted to share with you that that uh my god is real amen you know i'm saying before you you know i had osteomyelitis in 2007 and if it wasn't for my why praying i cried i'd work every day and i go home crying to god take me i was in so much pain it wasn't for my pastor he was there with me every minute when we started going through this they said well it might be cancer then it was saying all kinds of things right they didn't know what but i confess from the very beginning that he's working i can tell he's working in this i told brother dale he said well then it's not cancer i said see he's already started to work right he had been confused he had the doctor's confusion right they didn't know what was going on right and actually took the cdc to figure out what was going on center of disease control but it took the prayers of saints right amen and the word that healed me and i just i'm confessing to you tonight that my god is really amen there are some things there are some places is is his love for me some folks lay down and leave me alone is is is nine minutes julie are you coming at the same i want you to hurry running out of the seat late in june or june all right come on children um they practiced without me yesterday so i sang mine in the shower tonight really good i'm not like robbie robbie like to sing with people i sing a lot better by myself in the shower you love the lord good to be in the house of the lord we're getting ready to start a brand new year never been 2013 before hasn't it what are you seeing let me give you a little background on this song that we're going to sing uh brother ernest mo was one of the first preachers or the pastor of the church in 1971 and that was the assistant and this was one of his favorite songs and he passed on several years ago but this is his youngest daughter and that's his oldest daughter i'm sorry but we're going to sing it in honor of him he's my king i have a friendly mind walking with me making my pathway shine jesus the one i love gladly i sing praises to him is is he is forever is my me he is is is glory i will sing the story we're gonna sing a few more for my journey now and he tries to turn me around is oh around now many years ago oh the world is i gotta make it oh is we're gonna do one more well you know thanks brother ray gabriel my wife is a since this video went barrel we had no one viral hey i don't care me is i'm heading home i'm heading home oh hold yeah brand new year yeah stroke of midnight they're out there having their time hoopla and going on would you simply take the time and pause and take the communion and just think about our lord and sake what a wonderful wonderful day what a wonderful time it is nice and probably read it without even looking at it but i don't want to miss the wording you have a wonderful time tonight enjoyed everybody in the singing being here doing thank you god for sending brother jason to be with us preaching this weekend we had a wonderful time when we come into a new year and have a great time saying lord we can sit back and feast upon the word and let it dwell in our hearts but it's like our brother was saying to hear a message is fine but to be a message is different that's right but they're saying in the message now that brother branham wasn't infallible well i'll agree with him he had problems he was a human being but the message is in fact amen the message is thank god for the message amen but let's just read our scripture forever received with the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you it's due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cut when he had stopped saving this cup is the new testament in my blood this duty is often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord you douse you the lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup but he didn't eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep first we would judge ourselves i love this scripture we should not be judged if we judge ourselves and everything gets out of the way but i love this see but when we're judged what does it say we're chasing to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world for my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hungry let it eat at home that you come out together in the condemnation and the rest will i sit in order when i come it had gotten in the corinthians until they were just eating and meals and things you know and doing things paul was chosen to set an order telling them about the communion what a wonderful thing but about a man that was not there when the holy ghost originally failed but a man that was chosen to tell us about the communion and speak about it when others couldn't speak about it they could tell you what happened but he told us what it is listening to a tape the other day and what around them said that they were emphasizing you know doing and said and i know this happened that they would gather together and they would have a time together and they would listen to the writings of the bible the memoirs or what those big words are and then they were encouraged to follow after that and pattern after that and he said then the communion was passed and they took it and said then when some that were sick you know not able to be there he said they took the communion to their house and served them to communion we had a brother one time that was real sick at home and i just felt that to do that and we sent the communion to his house that night and the lord healed him amen don't you but says the bible said they come together to turn one for another let's just have a few moments of silent prayer as we pray one for the other praying that the lord would bless us all if there's anything in our hearts in line let's get it out of the way but we don't want to drink damnation to our own sails get rid of it no one is worthy to take the communion right but god has made us worthy by his blood so that we can protect let's all pray together father just be with each and every one of us here tonight we know and realize that as we just said we're not worthy for these things but you made us worthy you come on the scene and took our pro our side and took her place and made everything work you paid the price you even went to hell that i don't have to go right you took everything away that i don't have to worry about it now as we protected this communion in this new year may it have a meaning of greater understanding to each and every one of us that we make lord walk in your love we thank you we love you we thank you for the word that we heard tonight we ask you to bless our brother lord as he continues on and going and traveling all lord you take care of them and all in this blessing god we love you and we thank you in jesus name the bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread that's been made here tonight we know and realize that this is not your body but it's in representation so as we protected this we ask you to help us to remember we know that your body was a manifestation of the word of god it came into being father as we to not partake of this bread we ask you to help us to remember all of these things that we may all be our jesus to be sanctify the bread and the partakers in the name of jesus christ i never take the communion there my mind doesn't go back upon the children of israel now the last thing that they were getting ready to leave to go out to a land that had not been food the last thing they done was touch the communion that meaning to them that it would mean a new day a new time a new opportunity to be able to serve our god that bread would be there he never forgot him either you know he even came down and was the bread in the wilderness but they could eat the natural things that he or supernatural i guess you would call it things because that bread was perfect they never had any problems even their shoes the bible says grove with their feet and they were journeying through the land eating of that bread that was called manna that was an example there of speaking of what they had done before they were leaving take the communion commune means to fellowship it takes two people to fellowship and that way then you come and you fellowship around the altar of god you take bread we don't do like we used to do in the churches and we're not throwing those stones and nobody's just telling like it is we used to in the baptist we would order our bread it was made by someone else and brought in we would keep it for months before we took the communion and then we would just refreeze what was left over and keep it for the next time we found out that we're not supposed to do that that's right it's supposed to be burned you take the communion tonight this bread will be burned and finished before another day comes because we know that it represents the word of god man father we thank you for this wine notice went through the process of aging yes the word it has come to a position now that time will not bother you it will only make it better we realize realization this is not your blood no more than the bread was your body but you was telling us of a great thing that would take place that if we partake of that bread and that we would drink this wine that even in the natural tomorrow or even in this day this will create blood cells that's within our bodies because of the little bread and the little wine and as it does then we will be able to say we are a part of this we're not just playing a game we're sincere about it lord we ask you to sanctify the wine and the partakers that we may all be together as one in you in jesus name that's not the body and that's not the blood but it's in representation in representation of what our lord and savior done for us when he had finished the meal they had and he turned around and not contrary to some people think that he instituted something new way years ago was preaching a message from it in the old testament showing us that even when they took that lamb and that eight and they were getting ready to leave that they actually done what we're doing it was a manifestation there not just a new thing to come along in the new testament it was a happening that was in the word and jesus fulfilled it when he passed out the wine in the bread you say well do we take wine grape juice with sour we don't want that it can't be a type of something eternal if it's sours on you set your grape juice out somewhere and watch it it was wine well i you know you can't do that because everybody drinks wine but you know jesus turned water into wine we're a wedding one time but yet we don't want to have anything to do with mine or something it's because of what we've been told of our life instead of being what we are one little sip of wine i'm gonna put you he said if you're an alcoholic and tony take a sip you'll turn back to be an alcoholic not if you're delivered you won't but if you've been delivered then all is well a symbol what about in the symbol when we get there and have the wedding supper right looking forward to that you know it's going to be the communion it's not going to be beans and taters i don't want to mess up your doctrine it's not like that it's going to be the community unleavened bread made today destroyed tonight or this night do not hold it over because that that little manna that they ate in the wilderness you remember they tried to hold it over it soured on them you can't do that each day has a word and a thought from god and we must walk dirty not a happy new year then but let's partake together amen can be seated for a second when we're getting through we're going to have the foot washing tonight because we do firmly believe in the three ordinances foot washing water baptism and the communion but just to save time and not to do we won't have to put washing tonight but we will go down and kind of in reverse of where they did there in the in the bible because in the bible they ate a meal and then the third had the communion went out well a little different time isn't it so we've had the communion and now we'll go eat some natural meal together and have a good time fellowshipping because there's no need of trying to go home and you don't have to go down to uh you know waffle house or awful houses and some call it to get you something to eat danny loves the waffle house you don't have to go there there's some food downstairs we invite everybody to each knowing this all fellowship together and have a good time to pray one for another make sure that you tell our brother tonight how much you appreciated to mention how much you appreciated the services this weekend i know it's been a wonderful time been a good time fellowshipping you know and all together come find out he's just a plain old cow raiser when zach gets along good they want a lot to talk about but we just appreciate it appreciate his wife coming with him and just they're welcome here you know because we believe that he's trying to do what the lord wants you to do let's stand back together have a word of prayer go eat a while and then go home when you like but a good happy new year to you a good time to worry that you can say we were not out hovering like the rest we were having a good time fellowshipping with brothers and sisters and wouldn't it be nice for the lord to come while we were doing those things could you think of any better time than his coming than to do that because it's it has something to do with it don't appreciate all of you coming having a good time appreciate brother dustin's wife coming being with us and we just say thank you lord for all things right father we thank you for this day we thank you for this new year that we've entered into we look forward to it we realized and looking forward to it it may be the worst year that the world has ever seen but yet it'll be the greatest year the little bride of jesus christ has ever seen because our savior is coming for us and lord we just thank you for all the time thank you for the word tonight thank you for the people gathered together and lord we pray that you would go with us now as we eat some natural things sanctify the food and all of us together in jesus name amen
