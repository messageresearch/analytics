amen Open the Eyes of My Heart Is that it praise the Lord wonderful that I may see you in Your Glory Hallelujah absolutely amen just before we come to preaching uh we sing that song it's just become a favorite to us in the church back home uh it's um in moments like these I sing a song I sing a love song to Jesus amen and moments like these I sing a song I sing a love song to you now we've kind of added a few little bits and pieces there and here and there amen but uh uh it's wonderful amen singing I Love You Lord never fails to have an anointing on it never feels to have an anointing of God on it and it just uh gets me just right into the message and we're so thankful this morning for that praise the Lord just want to say how nice it is to be be back Amen in Lula praise the Lord in Georgia and it's a strange thing because when I go up to the other states but uh I preach more in Georgia than any other state you know didn't didn't realize I but I do amen and uh when I leave tomorrow we're

anyway jacine sends over our greetings to you all this morning praise the Lord I never asked her about the weather in Ireland so don't it's not as hot as here I can tell you that amen so praise the Lord but it's wonderful and we did have a wonderful time yesterday amen I brother Boyd's there brother H there we had good fellowship with all the saints and brother Robert there our visitor amen and uh it was wonderful and the Bible study was good praise the Lord amen that's our uh when a person uh seeks after God with all their heart amen finds repentance finds baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you will find the Holy Ghost amen he will lead you on to it uh I don't think I'll be speaking about it today brother Samuel but I I didn't want to get I just want everything was just in such a perfect order I wanted just to leave it there yesterday amen uh but I will say this we were uh preaching a message on the concept of the bride and uh you know God being Eternal his thoughts have to be Eternal and uh Paul says that I may know even as I am knowing right and if God ever knew us amen well where do we fit into an eternal thought it has to go back into eternity amen and uh praise the Lord that if God thought about us then and here we are manifested today amen still in his thoughts right still under his observation amen under his care and he can never ever we can never uh ever get rid of them thoughts as it were you know because brother Bram said that the bride was the Eternal thought of God and so that's where predestination and things come in amen and uh praise the Lord your name was written in that book amen before the foundation of the world because you were in the Eternal thoughts of God and when you come and seek him with all your heart and fill him and I would say if there's any young persons here today that uh certainly uh don't feel that they have the Holy Spirit Well just you keep seeking God Amen and and it's essential to live you'll never live in this world without the Holy Spirit exactly amen there's too just too much going on out there but when you've got the holy ghost sealed in you'll be sealed to the day of redemption and I'll tell you what we'll all make it in Praise the Lord and God will make sure we make it in look folks it's not anything that we have ever did it's not anything that we're going to do but he will keep us we are kept by the power of God Amen he started the work I think brother Samuel said that at one point and he will finish it praise the Lord so it's just a matter of trusting simply trusting every day and just knowing where you are knowing that you're a a stone in that body Hallelujah and that spiritual body of Christ amen and you take your place and your position amen and it's so wonderful so I'm I'm so thankful amen that God in his great concept of a bride and how that Adam fell but amen that's where it all came from that's why with spiritual death and how we had to be reborn spiritually amen and get into that uh Fellowship amen and be reconciled back to God as Sons and Daughters of God you should know the B Paul says that you know we would be WRA your bits if we didn't know that we're a son or daughter of God you would know that this morning amen praise the Lord you know what your own situation is today and I hope everybody can say that I really do that everybody can say I am a daughter of God or I am a Son of God whatever it is this morning praise the Lord but I just want to say a few things brother some of a may watch the time praise the Lord but uh amen and uh we had a wonderful time since we've came here uh just just over two weeks ago and uh uh praise the lord we have uh enjoyed the fellowship around uh the bride bless the Lord and when you go in and see the state of uh the things people don't look happy you know you just go to Walmart and I tell you what you count them on your hand how many people you see smiling and and you know uh just what a peace about them and they're not too many they not too many amen and a s it is but we know the are we're living in I see it by home as well and uh certainly uh praise God we keep praying even back home on our own Catholic Donal that uh people will still find the Lord I hope they do amen but uh it's wonderful to meet with people who know God and know the reality in their life of Jesus Christ for that's what it all about isn't it amen that's what came out yesterday praise the Lord when we know him in the power of his resurrection uh bless God it's so it's so wonderful amen and the camp meetings were wonderful this year P deck was said that that just didn't get up this year I know brother Samuel and sister Peggy it's great to see her doing so well amen I know there's a lot of pain if you've ever did a thir if you ever had a kidney stone you wouldn't want another one I can tell you that praise the Lord you wouldn't be asking for it in your Christmas stocket anyway you know uh you know I I had one too but the Lord delivered us wonderfully you know and it was so simple and I think one of the things brother some that Satan tries to uh come on because you know it's the mind is is always the botle you know and Satan tries to come in the realm of the mind and you know if he can't get you one he tries all he's always trying trying to Le nures for you trying to uh take you off the path even with a little wrong thought but you know um he would say to you will you see sister Rebecca you haven't got enough Faith but that's not right because we we have faith praise God Amen no matter how small the faith is like I told her just very briefly yesterday when I had that stone and it's a marvelous story but uh up in the hospital uh I I was just lying there in the bed and uh I just remember I was in a kind of a Twilight world you know I'm sure you've been in there and I was in a kind of Twilight world and I'm thinking to myself you know Lord I I've preached to your people Faith I've always preached faith and yet I don't even know if I got faith myself to be healed and I remember very distinctly saying but there is one thing I do believe that you are a Divine healer amen go to the gve believe or not there's at least two people have come up to me since I've come over that had needs in their body and they've testified that the Lord's met the needs amen somebody that couldn't shake something off but it shook off now I tell you that praise the lord well it's wonderful Hallelujah and so uh just like and you excuse me for doing this but just like like that that was gone amen and so I didn't feel any pain and I woke up I came come right out of it all come out of that Twilight Zone and this man in the next bed said oh you're feeling a lot better now and I said I sure I'm amen so then of course the consultant come in and he said well we'll keep you for a day or so you know in the end times they wouldn't do that today they throw you at the door you know we need your bed get out you know but there he said well let just St and anyway uh the next morning uh I passed Stone night so sister Rebecca all is well praise the Lord you keep believing that it's you know as I just reading in the little scripture you know that it says that Sarah conceived strength to bring forth Isaac amen she received Faith to conceive that amen that's what it says in Hebrews chapter 11 you read it yourself and it says because uh amen she judged him faithful who had promised praise the Lord if you can if you can put your all your faith on night judge him faithful that is promised I tell you something I'll open up always well it always well amen so praise the Lord since I saw you last say I just miss brother dick again he says this morning long time no say well it's just a year I suppose a year is a long time you run out of years don't you but uh not getting any younger wish we were younger but uh praise the Lord um uh the last year we we went over in November uh we went over to Thailand and I love brother Nom he's a lovely Pastor you love him here and uh he's 64 I so uh like like the rest M his best years are gone but uh Nepal Tha Thailand is such a lovely country they're such a lovely people and uh amen I just trust and pray there be more bride you know the little that he has there but they believe the word they are completely totally uh part of the bread of Jesus Christ because they believe the word amen they really do everything that's in this message amen uh that's precious to us they believe it and he's a wonderful man so we had three special meetings there and the Lord touching the people and it was wonderful I really enjoyed it and then we flew down to I just tell you a little story because if God is this precise maybe it'll help somebody this morning when I got into the flew into uh the Bangkok then usually they they have a little uh kind of a a Terminus for buses you know because of the price rather than have the big buses in the in the airport all expensive so you get a little uh bus you know that carries you over to the ter terminal about 10 minutes away a bus terminal so a little shuttle bus and it's free so I went over there and I went up to the the counter and said I want to go to Arna protect and says fine she could speak English and uh she's fine and she says now the bus goes at 5 and I said well used to go 2:30 she said yeah but that's been changed and I said okay so I I that's okay so anyway I was waiting to 5:00 and 5:00 came now they have these big yellow buses that go down to ARA pet and go right on down to the Cambodia border and uh 5:00 came and there was no yellow bus and I'm thinking something's wrong here you know so anyway I'm I'm sitting there thinking and all of a sudden uh something got me off my feet the G and and I just went right back to her and I said look there's something wrong here because you know you said at 5:00 the bus and the fellow Bes her he can speak a bit English he said that bus is gone and I said how could it go I was sitting there waiting for it I said it's a yellow bus he said no it's a blue bus I said I've been coming here for the last 5 years it's been a yellow bus you know and he said oh yeah that that they've changed their times too you know so I said thanks for telling me that but she was embarrassed and she just picked up her cell phone and like that there and she talked to something and then she said will you come with me and we walked out onto the main street right she th the taxi and there's plenty of them there you know and jumped in and I'm just following where are we going now then then about a mile down the road maybe mile and a half I I seen this blue bus in at the side where it could park and he had his flashers on the GU and I thought oh my she must have called this guy here so anyway uh she she talked to him and he kind of looked kind of give me a funny look you know yeah yeah yeah yeah and anyway so I got on and it took me down to ARA protet now can you imagine can you imagine that if I had have not got up at that very second to go to that desk right because I'll tell you what when I got on the bus it wouldn't have been any more than about a minute to two minutes than he was on the freeway he was on the interstate and he would not have turned back off the interstate for anybody and I would have been sitting in that bus station I probably got somewhere to stay all right but my the whole program would have been broken but the Lord knew that it wasn't my fault and he made up for it amen just at the right precise moment amen and I I I did I when I came back going to Vietnam I I I talked to her about it I just had a few words were nothing too hard but you know I said like you should explain these things to visitors they don't understand that you know that these changes are made like that so anyway it all worked out well and what I want to tell you is that God's never lit right amen when you need him at the right second at the right time he be there that's the truth praise the Lord so we went on down to Vietnam and oh the brothers in Vietnam are so lovely praise God that the message is really established there many of the the brothers are just on fire for God and it's wonderful to see it um a brother Nam would be really uh the special brother that they phone me up with Ireland and they send me emails and I send them back and uh he just got married there a couple of weeks ago and he asked us would we uh uh send over a prayer for for for to be prayed over them when uh their service was going on so we were happy to do that and um and it's wonderful to see them married and she's a a good girl and uh praise the Lord he's a good boy he's serving God and they can reach where we can't reach amen they can go where we can't go and uh praise the Lord so I'm so glad to be able to help them and it's just like a father to them amen that makes me feel old but that's the way they're young and brother V the translator wonderful Beau F little fell and his wife was pregnant and she she was asking for prayer for ex eema isn't it I think it's on the you can get that on the leg oh her feet were just pure red and uh so I just prayed for the lady and uh I know one thing that the next day uh they come in and she said that they were healing they were starting the healing was on so at the end of the tour she said that the healing they were cuz he he wrote that in email to me that our feet were healed amen so so I'm thankful that God can do anything amen you know if you just get along with God he'll tell you I can do anything he created the whole universe amen what's what's moving a kidney stone amen praise the Lord taking axima away amen from anybody and anyway so when the little baby was born uh the request came through uh would I please bring it up on the on the screen cuz it sent me over the pictures and Anointed with oil and pray for it amen now there's a new one amen I did Hallelujah we did amen praise God that was so wonderful praise the lord it's nice to see the people that you baptized still going on with the Lord amen and we had in Vietnam every time I go the all the three visits that I really had there have been four times but the three visits that were really organized U properly the first visit was just a like a kind of just to get an introduction but uh there's about 24 25 pastors that would meet at the home church and we'd provide for them all folks yeah you know I'll tell you what don't ever think that the finances and you know you've seen brother deal give me uh money every year and we're not here for that I want to tell you that I am not here for that at all but I know one thing that we've been able to use it to bring them brothers down people like that to bring them down pay their bus fairs cuz they ain't got the the money and and give them food there and then at the end of it they they they they the uh brother Nam was saying you know if you could help them out a little bit you know they would like that so they got all the we divided what we had and put it into little um envelopes and give it to each brother you know and they all go away up happy back to their own uh places and it's wonderful after all the teaching of about three days three days teaching and uh everything that we could think about that we would we would uh uh uh teach to them and read it on the board and The Interpreter going through it all and one of the brothers just to give you an illustration one of the brothers he um he said um uh you talk about FES and sevens a lot and I said yes that's right and he said what what what does what does the numbers mean and we were able to go through the numbers numerology with them from as many as I could remember off the top of my head just like brother Samuel yesterday you know it's kind of hard to get it all you know if you haven't really studied for a certain time you know you're you're coming from your heart and from what you know and uh but it was wonderful time and they all writing like mad when you're saying things you know taking it all back up to their own places and there's two two pastors come down there they're so thankful they would come up and they would say to The Interpreter tell tell brother brother that you know just how much we respect him for coming to Vietnam and and tell him that you know

be good hasn't it amen it has to be good and I'm so thank I'm so thankful for Hallelujah I really am and you know when I was there as well um I remember when I was getting introduced to the pastors

locked it was locked and and I said sure we'll pray for your leg and I would KN down that the other brothers but no he meant n amen weit the asked you to pray you pray now so okay all right we'll pray now you see but then uh he started to kick out his leg and the big smile on his face and and he was going around everybody showing him kicking out his leg and all the brothers are all praising God and it's wonderful that was locked it was truly locked I saw it with my own eyes and uh so thank God and then the next morning I shaking hands with him and I pointed down to his leg you know smile has your leg like you know there he starts kicking it out for me you know so I we just we're we're thankful we're thankful for everything praise the Lord we're thankful for everything and you know um the little woman that was saved I'll never forget her she' hardly a tooth in her head and you know she came in she wanted to accept Christ and we just knelt on the that floor with her and led her to the Lord and she prayed that prayer I believe with my heart that that little woman saved and I tell you what I gave her a Vietnam Bible and she was cuddling into her heart and I said you tell her the next time I see her she will be a young woman amen so thank God for it all and uh we're so glad they they just miss us so much they say you know uh and that was only there in November and when are you

cuz I'm praying about that amen I doesn't it's never ever bothered me once God said you go I just leave the rest of him he'll provide he will provide amen praise the Lord so it's wonderful and they're really serious they've got the right interpreters they've got everything amen all I will need is for just to find the time and to find the will of God but I certainly felt a good strong puller so I just wouldn't like to say okay but I will be going to India in November uh to see how the brothers and sisters are going on and the church that we built it's the most beautiful thing folks in the world and I'm sure you've got a part of it brother Samuel to know that there's a church a lovely Church sitting there right in the middle of India amen that we built Hallelujah that it was our finances that we built it Hallelujah I brought the gr amen our fellowship and that church went up and it's there to this day to the glory of God and the people that are in it believe this word hallelujah I think that's wonderful I really do well I'm sorry I didn't mean to speak so long about that but God bless you and if we will turn to our Bibles and you can stand again if you will with me amen and I'll just read uh I've got other scripture here but I just read in in uh 1 Corinthians uh 10 amen and the Apostle Paul says 1 Corinthians 10:1 says moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant hi that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized under Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat he's not talking here about physical meat he's talking about spiritual meat and he said and all drink the same spiritual drink amen you see for they drank that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ amen amen I'll just leave it there for the for for for for uh amen you can read on at another time but we'll just leave it there for a moment and we'll come to the heavenly father gracious God this morning dear Lord Jesus as we come and thank you Lord uh this day of the week the first day of the week that you rose from the dead our Prophet told us that we honor your Resurrection by coming together on this day Lord a day that most of us don't have to work Lord maybe nurses or people Lord have to work at times but father most of us don't and we're so thankful that we can take this day as a day of rest a day of worship and a day to hear your word and to Lord consecrate Our Lives aresh to live for you so father we come and we thank you for the privilege to stand behind the holy desk and Lord we're asking that your holy spirit will speak that none will be seen save Jesus Christ only for we ask it in your Holy Name Lord Jesus amen amen amen praise the Lord you may be seated and it is a very simple or uh uh the title amen Christ the Rock of Revelation and of course the the the reason for the title would be when when the Lord said to Peter uh uh Peter said Thou Art the Christ uh amen the son of the Living God and and the Lord said to him uh Peter flesh and blood is not revealed that to you you know I I I don't think you get saved or we could get filled with the Holy Ghost if it wasn't a revelation it has to be amen a person that would say to brother Bram God doesn't reveal himself anymore that's nonsense amen praise God God will speak to you today Hallelujah I hope he does Amen you know a new thought a new thing today to your heart I believe it heart so God will reveal himself as he needs to reveal himself to you amen and I'll just give you an illustration of May that uh when we were up there in the camp meetings uh and we all know about the Lamb of God this is just very briefly we all you know when John said Behold the Lamb of God and we know the reason why the lamb and and all that there but you know sometimes maybe we think that um that that's it finished Jesus died on the cross that's the Lamb's interess or uh part plan but you know it's not amen because it's the L that takes the book amen it's the lamb that opens the book it's the L that gives the book to John praise the Lord and I'll tell you what amen at the end of it all it's the lamb that the the the the bride's wife amen and the Lamb's wife has made it's the L's wife amen so there's more to it than just saying Behold the Lamb of God you know that he's going to die for our sins it's much more deeper than that and and not only that but praise God we it off and I'm sure you do too but there's a country far beyond the Starry Sky there's a city where there never comes a night Amen on by and by we will go there Amen in the city where the lamb is the light so I tell you what you start off in Genesis and you got right to the Book of Revelation so that's what I'm saying and I knew I said I never thought about it like a nth you know and and praise God so God can speak to you you every day Hallelujah and give you something amen well you know in in Exodus 17 praise the Lord amen that uh we we are told that uh Moses was told to stand on the Rock and he said and horb and he says and th shall Smack That Rock and smack the Rock and he shall come out water and that the people may drink and so Moses did it in the sight of all the elders and of course they did drink amen praise the Lord and uh because uh he called it Mirah because the children of Israel had tempted the Lord at that place amen is the Lord among us or not we should never ever uh uh have that thought is the Lord among us or not the Lord is always going to be among us he said I will never leave you amen he is faithful that is Promised so there's no way and and folks if there would be anyone today thinking you know well the devil's been really bombarded me and I feel God doesn't love me I'm maybe not what I should be or something like that but amen it's not praise the Lord uh where we are but he said I will never leave you right and his word is true Hallelujah so not leave us amen and for and confirm the word and so here was Moses and uh he Smit That Rock Amen then of course of you go on over to uh numbers 23 which I want to come back to later in the message amen but we we see that when Moses is told again they're uh thirsting for water I mean you know it was Israel that got themselves in this sitation they were most times we as we get ourselves into the situation praise the Lord that we get ourselves into and uh and so uh they would not need it to go through the Wilderness amen but they said to them there can the Lord provide a tiil in the wilderness and he answered it right away yes he can Hallelujah more so than maybe your president who can say yes he can amen so we're not going into that but I tell you the Lord can make a table in the wilderness the Lord can say and them fil di all around the camp come on but when they lust it with it in for their M amen he slew many of them that day so you don't tempt the Lord amen for he will not tempt you the Bible says God tempts no man neither can he himself be tempted so we know that to be the truth praise the Lord then uh so uh Moses was commanded to speak to the Rock right to speak to the Rock and uh well just think about it I'll just give you this thought before I come back to it again later but what have he had a SP to it that's right just think about that okay but he didn't speak to it he smot it with his with his judgment Rod he hit twice and uh praise God uh he broke the scriptures and the scriptures cannot be broken Jesus said that amen the god of Glory said scripture cannot be broken come on and here was Moses breaking the scriptures amen by smiling that rock twice right and so Hallelujah we'll come back to that just in a while amen and then just to give you a little H H background of a May because and I know you've been through these wat you've been down these roads but I hope just something this morning will will bless your heart amen but uh praise God there is many rocks you know that uh brother dick was saying there this morning he likes some documentaries and even about Ireland and things like we do have a lovely country amen and uh I think there's one of the little TS is thinking of building a kind of a roof over itself so so there you go amen keep the reite amen they are turn I don't know but praise the Lord uh certainly the only thing about our country is that when Columbo was alive they reckoned there was 300 churches in Ireland right amen now there's only four actually you can nearly say five because uh just when I come home from uh when I come home from uh uh Vietnam and Thailand we had the pleasure of baptizing a and his wife they live in another County from us a couple of hours away and they come up as often as they can but he certainly got a good grip of the message and he had been baptized but you know not in the the way that the Acts of the Apostles that Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and we don't want to go into that you know it's the truth and that is the word of God Paul says let any man that teaches any other thing be a cursed so you can't it's the word of God Amen they don't have a a a revelation of the godhead and and that's the truth so we have and that makes it all a difference and he was I baptized him again and his wife in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that was a wonderful thing amen but there was a great rocks in the b in the world there's the rock of J seen with my own eyes and then I seen a a documentary one time on the euin I think it is ucin part is that what it is in California that's a massive granite rock it's massive you see and uh then of course in in Australia there's a rock there's great rocks in the Bible I if you look at the type of them the type is Christ amen there was a rock and horb I think the Jews actually believe the old fathers believe that this rock that Moses uh uh smoke at the beginning that they they they to it that around the Wilderness amen some believe that but I don't think but something do believe amen but the greatest spiritual Rock in the whole world today is Jesus Christ amen and certainly believe that don't we and amen and well there is none holy like the Lord just a little backr there none holy like the Lord for he is there's no Rock like our God Amen and we know that God put him in the Cliff of The Rock and let Moses see his glory amen also it says in Deuteronomy that uh he brought forth water out of a rock of Flint imagine that a rock of Flint just completely impossible to do it in the human thought and is it wonderful when you get away from the uh what God can or can't do it's wonderful to see him doing Miracles like that for you know he's valuable amen praise the Lord to speak the word and whatever he will say will come forth amen it's so wonderful hallelujah praise the Lord then of course it's it's always wonderful to make it personal that's what I would like to do this morning with you you know I know that the Lord is my rock brother and and many of you people have been coming here for years you know you don't need anybody to tell you that the Lord is your Rock Amen praise the Lord the Lord is your rock and your Fortress amen and your deliverer and your strength and praise the Lord uh your horn of Salvation and your high tower so it's good to know that that's a personal testimony and as the old Scottish I remember my my my uh nephew and he's a smart boy I mean he went to University and he would TI me a nuts with mathematics I tell you what I wouldn't have go hit a junior great heartly think but you know he's went right up to uh the university level amen uh in mathematics and he was tell me one time that he was studying on the doctrine of justification by faith so I wrote back a little email and I said well you know what the old Scottish preacher said and I said the Scottish preacher said it's better felt than T and not right sister amen yeah you can study right you can have it all work perfect M and and the university they would stom it 100% you know that you haven't experienced it amen you haven't experience it so it's better to experience it amen than just talk about it Hallelujah so if he's your Rock Amen you've had an experience and the Holy Ghost is an experience a Salvation is an experience hallelujah praise the Lord then he said the Lord liveth and blessed be my rock my rock Blessed Be My Rock and not the god of my salvation be exalted of course you're coming into the eagle territory there cuz we know that that eagle will go to one rock we know all that but I want to move on uh praise the Lord and uh it says in a time of trouble he shall hide me and a provision did we read that this morning the Lord is my light and my salvation I'm not thinking may be dead amen and it says uh it says and in the secret place of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock hallelujah and that rock is Christ Jesus morning is where I'm sitting as an eagle of God Amen and I can fly Hallelujah and come back to the Rock Amen uh that's where he what he has done for me he in Psalm 40 he has said he brought me out of a horrible pit and amen out of the merry clay where you're sticking and you can't make it uh fit together Hallelujah and uh it means stop trying praise the Lord stop trying and folks you know uh I've often I've often thought this and that's so true you know I would say most of us brother Samuel you know you you every one of us like to have things under control right okay so you're I'm going to do this I'm going to do that and I'm going to have a time of prayer here you always like to make you know to have things under control you're you feel like to feel that you're in control right and there's a certain degree of of honesty and truth about that amen cuz you couldn't run a business if you weren't in control of it so there's a certain degree of honesty about it but sometimes when it comes to your life and you're trying to plan your life in your little boxes and squares you see and you're going to do this and you're going to do that and when you finish this you're going and you know something all of a sudden you get one nasty joke right amen and then some circumstance Rises up where you are not in control right and you know amen you're not in control praise God like even say sister Peggy going for an operation you know you're not in control if you know what I mean there's nothing physically brother Samuel can do he can't go in there all the garments and say I'll take care of this amen you know you got to trust the the surgeon but ultimately our trust is in God and that's what it's for that we'll come to the place when we're not in control to say Lord thank God you're in control Hallelujah that's the wonderful thing about it because he's brought us out that clay and set us on a rock amen amen and it says uh when your heart is overwhelmed when your heart is overwhelmed when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I now if I asked you this morning if I said is anybody here that's ever felt like you were just overwhelmed amen I'd be very surprised if I didn't see any H going on Amen you know what I'm talking about I've been there too praise the Lord I've been there too overwhelmed amen praise the Lord and I'll never forget the night when my wife went in the hospital and it was it was the the nurse in charge amen uh and and she said to me that that my my wife was going to die she told me that to my face she said she'll probably be dead in the morning and you know I tell you what talk about being overwhelmed right what are you doing you're told that come on Amen what do you do but you see folks I tell you something now listen she was wrong right because I talked to my wife this morning amen and that was about 6 years ago now or something got there five you see amen she's never been better Hallelujah I want to see the garden that she planted this year amen and I'm always promising the helper but never get right amen but I'll tell you what but it's an overwhelming thing and the only thought that I could think when that lady said that the only thought that I could think was this God has not told me that come on and if she does die the Lord hit it from me right but she didn't die Hallelujah and the Lord brought her through so when your heart is overwhelmed dear children of God this morning just let God lead you to the rock that is higher than you amen you'll find amen oh safe in the rock that is higher than I praise God you'll find yourself in safe hands amen uh praise the Lord because the left hand is always the Providence of God and the right hand that surrounds us amen is his power and authority hallelujah we're we're in good hands amen I praise the Lord uh thy blessed Rock of Ages I'm hiding in thee what is a small storm or it's a big storm it doesn't matter just go run to the rock that is higher than yourself okay amen I just go on here I'm going to leave some of them quotations out praise the Lord thankfully there hasn't been too many people that come up to me and said you know the Bible says for more about a rock and you preach because you be here I can keep you here for 3:00 if you want every quot you know if you want every every T but I have to drop someone M to fit it into the time that we have which is understandable because we're all the same uh back home here we're all uh uh slaves to time we really are amen praise the Lord and uh amen even in that Song of Solomon says oh my Dove thou W in the CFT of The Rock and I want to show you a little quote about that later amen that brother Bram says in the CFT of the Rock in the secret place of the stairs uh let me see your countenance let me hear your voice now you've all came up stairs this morning so what would it mean in the secret place of the stairs apparently in the them houses it was at the back they had the stairs and the stairs brought you right up up there and you see what it is stairs like these stairs means access right means access so let me hide in the Cliff of The Rock and in the secret place of the stairs right the place of access let me see your countenance let me hear your voice it's all to do with prayer amen for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is com it's a beautiful beautiful study amen and you know in Isaiah I'm just going to move on Fast here and Isaiah a man that shall be as a hiding place from the wind uh and I'm sure if you've ever been in strong wind and maybe dust blown in your face you got your C up C over you know you know what this is about a little bit and a CT from a tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as a shadow of a rock in a weary land you know the world is a weary place it doesn't matter if you're rich doesn't matter if you're poor the world is a weary land amen this word there's just nothing to it why because the Bible is right why because Adam did Sin why because we are all every heartbeat amen going toward the end of our lives every last one of us my when you hit 21 you think now I'll never die but you know that's because you're at the zenth yeah but hit 51 and 61 and I'll tell you what you begin to think different amen I said it he said the do he said I'm still eating the same food I'm still not eating what's what's going on here hallelujah you know and I certainly if you love a garden and and I I do the the law and thing they got to get out and do little bits and pieces but I know one thing I know that that Garden is cursed it is that grind is cursed and you see how do you know that because if you were pulling out all the weeds you'd see how cursed it is and they're Relentless amen and you put on stuff that'll kill anything but some of the weeds will just beat the do you know what is it I love a scientist to come and explain that to me say well this is why there's weeds in your garden amen praise the Lord I tell you what we' got it here in the word of God why there's weeds in our garden amen and I tell you all creation is groaning the animals amen amen I saw the horses yesterday we've got horses at home Bo too and you know the cows all they're all groaning they know there's something wrong but they can't talk to you they can't tell you what it is come on Amen but I tell you what PR the lord they're grooming for something well you know a shadow of a great rock and a weary L cuz it can be a weary l and when we were over in Africa and uh I certainly the brothers want us to go back to Africa that's wonderful I I thank God for it I tell you what it's better to be invited than than nobody want you to come back amen but we watched him in the morning I was sitting outside the little room and uh praise God I could tell you so much stories it would be delightful but I just want to stick to the word I but we watched the all the people sitting under the tree amen and as the morning went on and I was Wai for brother diction they would move every so often they would move a little bit cuz as the sun came around in the shadow and by the time we come back that evening they were sitting at the very far side of the tree they obviously they didn't do a big hard day's work you know because the hardest work that did is move the shadow of that tree to stare into the heat of the sun amen but he certainly is a shadow it's wonderful God doesn't want us to get overcome with heat stroke it's a terrible thing heat stroke in India last year about 140 120 120 woo you know I tell you you could go down with heat stroke very easily I mean it I mean it so you pray for us you know and people think you're having a oh wonderful time hard do you know could be sleeping anywhere this year they want to go up to a a village that has that they're introducing the message but there's no amenities there it's a way up in a up in the mountains amen there could be terrorist there could be and they do come in that part and there could be it's a tiger Reserve you could wake up one morning in here or one night and look over there and see it's it's a tiger you know so you know don't be thinking it's all wonderful wonderful because it can be very hard and you pray for us praise the Lord as we go there cuz I it's a it's a joy to me to introduce the Gospel of Jesus Christ I tell you I never said this but listen let me just give you an illustration I went in now and beside the hotel and the police did come but they only they only I think they only checked the uh the Visa that's also they didn't but I didn't see it cuz I seen them coming and going and I was out in the boulevard having coffee so I didn't care and so they they didn't arrest us or nothing but right beside the hotel there was a a a cafe and it's an open fronted place you know they pull up the shutters and then you can just walk in you know and there's no door of such just walk in anywhere you want to walk in and I was what then one night the brothers uh we said what time and I I went in to have something to eat I was waiting for the brothers and I was eating I could know what the tell them what what you know for what to eat a beautiful food and uh there was a person sitting in front of me but I was just there people sitting around us and I was just eating away and this a girl about 18 19 years of age and she turned around and she says excuse me and I said yes and she said may I speak to you and I said what do you want to say and she said I am studying English and could I talk to you a little bit so I knew the brothers were coming I said if if if you want so I'm eating I my dinner I said what what do you want to ask me you see and she was asking all about uh English and all about the different things and about my country and then I said to her uh good Christ that girl had never heard that before I mean when I started to tell her about how the Lord was born sinless and spotless and and went to Calvary because we had sinned in that Garden amen and got to the resurrection I said that's Christianity and that poor girl was just dumbfounded she had never in her life heard that then the brothers ared and they give me a strange look but I says come on Brothers it's okay praise the Lord right here amen and I'll tell you what I said so you take her details you take her phone number and all that there but things like that happen when you're on the mission field and I tell you what that is wonderful praise the Lord anyway let's just move on here quickly and uh in the New Testament it's wonderful uh what greater wisdom could you have than to build your house upon a rock come on Amen you're not going to I know there's builders in here this morning and you're not going to to take some old uh uh place that's Sandy and has no Foundation you know some some Builders might do that you know and they disappear with the money but you know a real genuine Builder not going to do that you need a foundation amen and Jesus called you a wise man if you build your house upon a rock amen amen and we were studying about the home church I've got a little message at down in the motel uh we were studying on that where your Treasures that's where your heart will also be amen praise God that's why every day you come to the word why would you sit and read the word why would you sit there at the beginning of the day at the end of the day maybe during the day and just read a passage from the word and pray because that's where your heart is amen that's where your treasure is it's in Christ Hallelujah if I ask anybody here that really loves the Lord I know you do amen I wouldn't even insult you to say did you speak to the Lord this morning come on Amen because that's where your treasure is hallelujah you know this day is in his hands you pray about it and you're expecting his Blessing and he's going to take care of you so that is the truth that is wonderful amen so a wise man will build his house upon the rock amen and of course the foolish man will not do it and that is sad because lay up treasure in heaven where your Treasures are folks I cannot see it any other way when Jesus said if you give a cup of water in my name amen the blessing will come down how much more when you feed these pastors when you help them also I want to tell you that brother George Smith I met him for the first time in many years this trip I had breakfast with him in Tennessee and he is going to try uh and get us the uh the Vietnamese 7 Church ages and if I can get them into Vietnam by the post I'll do it and if I cannot get them in I will take them personally over myself to H them to the Impostors and say there's your study book amen there's your study book you use your Bible and use that book Hallelujah and you'll not be far wrong right so I'll tell you what so you pray with these things and it is wonderful amen okay there are other scriptures I'm going to H let them go but you know brother Bram said more in a million said everyone drank of that same spiritual Rock Amen every one of them amen and praise the Lord all them a people that had crossed the Red Sea and they at the Mana every one of them we were studying the Tabernacle have you I'm sure you've studied the Tabernacle over the years we had a just in Heavenly places when we studied that Tabernacle you know to think that Moses came down the mountain with the two tablets of stone right but that wasn't the only thing he came down with he came down with in his heart and in his mind right a whole plan for the Tabernacle of God God's chosen place of worship in that day right the only place where you could worship almighty God and knowing that we are Kings and Priests this morning that can go right into the Tabernacle not on the outer uh uh Court not even outside the outer court that where the world is seen so many people going to mow their grass today going to do their own thing today they're going to go up to Walmart and do their shopping and it's sad it's it's nothing to Rejoice about it's a sad thing that people would not put God first and come at least somewhere to even give him thanks and worship amen but here we are amen and so when he came down he had that and he made that and us as Kings and Priests today come right into the Tabernacle and folks you know I'm not I'm not going to go too too far into there but listen when you get into the Tabernacle you come to the showbread come on and the showbread was not made it wasn't the Angel's Heavenly food that came down outside it was only for priests amen and it was made of flow which is a type of Christ amen that pure flower and there was one for each of the tribes amen there was 12 of them all together and two Ros six or on top of one another whatever way they were LED out praise the Lord and that was the showbread amen and you know something that is what we are partaking of this morning amen amen it's the sh bread because we're Kings and Priests and we're actually in the Tabernacle this morning praise the Lord we've had prayer we're at the uncens of prayer we've got the show table Hallelujah we've got the light amen of the seven Church change Angels amen the light of our day and we're right in there praise God and there is no we'll touch it in a moment there is no middle wall of portation no Veil that we can go right into the holy of holies well certainly Moses had a baptism he did CU he said they were all baptized under Moses so if they were all baptized there then he had a baptism John the bap had a baptism he really did and we've got a baptism today praise the Lord as one of the things that brother Bram said that we were to uh excuse me uh to do amen baptism and the fruit washing and the Lord's Supper praise God wonderful and they drank that uh physically they drank from the rock gushes of it but spiritually that rock was Christ amen and they drank from him they got their spiritual and physical life from God Amen and the things that they were doing though they were only doing the type yet God was blessing them amen with the blessing that he could give them in that day amen obviously it was types and shadows and the reality had to come to it the true Tabernacle which is Jesus Christ himself amen had to come but in their day that's what they were drinking and what they were doing that was the place that was God's chosen place of worship hallelujah amen and may I say this if I may please because if I miss some of this it doesn't really matter but just in my heart that you know uh there was a lever before you come into the Tabernacle before you should have come here this morning folks and uh uh really this is the water of the word the word is a washing thing this is the lever here this morning praise the Lord and the lever was made of all the mdors that the woman had brought out of Egypt now you're thinking well glass car could you make a but it wasn't glass it was it was the Bronze or the brass that had been polished that they could see their pretty little faces amen and praise God and they brought that out of Egypt Hallelujah and so God said uh well get rid of the vanity and give them all over to Moses and he'll make a big lver and he'll fill it with water and you wash with that and you'll be most beautiful praise God you'll be most beautiful because character Hallelujah far who passes uh the natural is that right fary person just to see a person's a real Christian amen and not of meekness and love it surpasses any beauty that you could have in that isn't even Beauty in Hollywood not at all not at all amen it will pass away Amen brother Bram said it's some of the most beautiful women and then they old old women and nobody wants to have another see look at them well I tell you what that's what they made the lever out of it and you know that's why we need the washing of the word because it's so easy to be defiled no you don't even have to defile yourself but you know where I work and what I do not everybody they always make excuses for cursing you know in Ireland they'll say excuse my French but it ain't French yeah that's what they say you you you're I'll tell you what we're looks like we're amen we're in the groove here this you know what I mean but the thing about it is just once they've done that you you feel defiled you know you feel you know I didn't want I didn't want them to say that I didn't enjoy them saying that you see and you do you feel the F but isn't it wonderful when you open the word or when the word is preached over you that it washes all that off you're washed but you are washed amen and I tell you what uh it's it's a wonderful thing to just let the water uh wash you amen and cleanse you as you come into the Tabernacle to worship God I need the show bread this morning amen the Lord praise the Lord the smitten Rock Amen well thank God he was smitten you know it well so I'm just going to pass over quickly he was smitten hallelujah praise the Lord amen uh for us on that tree Hallelujah that we should not die folks what if he hadn't have come that's right you know just suppose God searched through Heaven Come on Amen and he couldn't have find one willing to be right but where would that put us today right amen and do you think that we could all go down to Hell and God would be in just he would not be injust he'd be as still as holy and righteous as he ever was cuz that's what we deserved right we deserved we were in the slave Camp of sin amen but thank God Amen that's what it means but he redeemed us right not with silver or gold but by his own precious blood Hallelujah when you think of all the millions of gallons of blood from bulls and goats amen and yet just what he said that day because it was the blood of God brother brandham says amen and just that little bit amen from his body is able to save every man woman and child that was ever born in this earth that would want to come to him amen The Rock was smitten praise the Lord and out of it came the Living Waters amen praise the Lord okay and uh you know brother Bram just said this comment and I like it but I want to just go on he said that uh when out there in the desert imagine that they found this great Plan of Salvation yeah just think about that and uh brother Brown says in the most unlikely place and in the most unusual way that's what we've always had like Moses in the most unlikely place in the most unusual way never seen anything like it before and he wanted I was telling the people I was telling these people from aquador uh that when I was once in Nepal and I I I it was a lovely after afternoon and up in the little wooden houses you climbed up a little uh uh stair a little uh ladder and it got you to a second a second uh uh level and I was sitting in the door I was watching some of the children play and some people out in the fields it was a beautiful day and I decided to get up and I went around the side of the house and just kind of stretched and you know I looked up to the mountain and I saw something that I never saw before in my life there was a huge Cloud sitting right on top of that mountain and God is my judge folks I just bear with it there was a huge Cloud on the mountain and I looked and there was no other Cloud this massive white cloud and the mountain way back there and it was on the highest mountain but the thing that really struck me was that it was exactly the ship of Ireland exactly I couldn't believe it I'm going right around and I see the whole ship as a matter of fact if you look at our country you'll see that up in the top there is a r the middle up at the top there's a lock uh or a lake as you would call it here we call it a lock too and it's the biggest one in the United Kingdom and God is my judge I saw that blue in that cloud right there Hallelujah that day and I couldn't believe it as a matter of fact I I just staggered back when I looked at it and saw it and some of the brothers they they they saw me and they came rushing up they thought I got sick or something and I I went down and grabbed my my camera and I came back and I just took a a photograph of it where it was just moving because it was about 15,000 ft high and it was just moving off that mountain and uh you know in the unusual way uh it's God moves and what what happened was they said what is it brother I said I don't know I mean I I don't know but I but I saw it it was a ship of Ireland right down to the five little fingers at the bottom and that locked there and said I don't know and so when I come home now think about it when I come home whom the Lord give me the interpretation because we know that the voice of God speaks out of a cloud is that right right amen sure does hallelujah praise the Lord and it was the ship of Ireland the voice of God speaking out of a narish vessel amen and here we were in thep PA right on the on the on the roof of the world they call it and this highest mountain that's where it's at and that was the bride amen amen it wasn't the denomination Hallelujah God's Voice through any vessel would be to the bride in the day hour and that was the interpretation God Moves In A unlikely place in an unusual way what a comfort that was to me what a wonderful thing praise the lord well Amen Let us just go on so praise the Lord we're in a journey today brother Bram says with the Lord Jesus that smitten Rock and we're eating mana and drinking the Angel's food amen we certainly are praise the Lord he's a rock and a weary land and he says as we March Lord we know the smitten rock is Right alongside us that rock is just within your Rich today oh yeah oh yes it is hallelujah for that rock is Jesus Christ he is the one amen and uh we're in a journey with him and that rock is with us he says praise the Lord amen it goes right along by us ever present water from the rock goes with the church so you don't need to be thirsty spiritually today right amen you can be well filled and you can be you know dehydration I I'm sure if you've suffer that you know it's not nice amen but thank God when you can take a good long thirsty drink and be satisfied and he does satisfy a wonderful Savior and you know as I said earlier on he'll never leave us here's what brother Bram said he said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee no matter how hard the times get how old we get what kind of death we die Remember The Rock will be there in Jordan right Hallelujah now what is it a faithful witness praise God if it were not so I would have told you Hallelujah and he's saying here that when if you do get to the Jordan amen that rock will be there praise God and I'm expecting him to be there when we ever get to that place of the Lord Parise amen praise the Lord it will never leave us nor forsake us amen I thank God and it's the same water you know never think folks that the day of Pentecost was something different amen that it was a different Holy Ghost than what they got praise the Lord they came down Hallelujah they were they were filled with it thr with it amen and they came onto the street and the people thought they were drunk praise the Lord that was wonderful Hallelujah and Peter said No it's it's only what 12:00 or 9:00 in the morning said no but this is that which was Pro by the prophet Joel Hallelujah God keeping his promise amen and he wants to do it today and I I'll tell you one thing and I mean it praise the Lord uh we were watching a little movie on brother Bram and he went into mosam Beek and he had a wonderful little time he didn't preach there they did a bit of hunting but he did stop the van at one place and there was a Bo bunch of boys he said to brother Sydney Jackson the boy that has this kind of thing on he said you tell him that his father's up there and we would call it to balois but he they would call it the the coffin or whatever not and he says he's sitting up there in that house and God is going to heal him amen and and you know wow Sydney Jackson didn't know where he was and there's more to it than not but again the clock's be you know the clock's beating us here you know but uh it's wonderful Hallelujah and in mosam Beek and we were there we crossed the Great zambesi River and uh we we had the services and there was about 500 people there and after the I remember preaching on the spiritual mind just L but we read back there and that night after the service I I just said Lord Jesus I don't know what to do amen and I said so I'm just handing it back to you and almost to the second the Holy Spirit fell right on that Congregation of 500 people hallelujah and anybody that would tell me well that was different on the day of Pentecost and what happened that night I'll tell you what I don't believe it for a second man and they were rejoicing for about 30 minutes it was wonderful Hallelujah and when it all settled down when it all settled down and I remember the the pastor he said well we want that Hallelujah that's what we want that spiritual mind and the Holy Ghost and uh and he and he said about if anybody wants to be baptized just put your uh hand up and brother Samuel all over the building the hands were going to people coming to the Lord I just think it's wonderful praise God and it's so real Hallelujah that that water the same today it's not a different water it's the same and it still satisfies amen praise the Lord it still satisfi we got that water today because the rock was Christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise the Lord I love that cuz as you find him yesterday and you find him today you'll find him tomorrow he'll right be there amen and you know I told you I come back to it for a moment but uh God took the judgments of the people and placed him on Christ and smoked him did you notice there was a CFT in the Rock from there on there was a Clift in the Rock from an on that c rock had a cleft in it where Moses m and Christ had a Clift where he was smitten amen praise the Lord and he brought in a little bride amen and he was wounded praise God and he says we can so enjoy life today because of that amen just hide me in that Cliff praise the Lord today amen n okay he said you know what a rock represents in the Bible a rock in the Bible represents the revelation of God see and God is my Revelation amen when he reveals it and you know when you're seing for such a thing he'll reveal what you're to do what what the way you have to go amen it may be a little bit different than the way somebody else went but it'll be all the same cuz brother Bram and and I can testify to this all over the world if you get lost in Vietnam you never come out you never come out because how they talk is something like the Chinese and it's it's a kind of a maybe even a bit harsher than the Chinese you hav a notion what they're talking about amen when they're talking like that and if you were lost there boy you'd be really lost amen I'm glad there's interpreters but you watch you watch who give them boys the revelation of Christ to start off with who's G them the revelation of this message come on Amen it has to be the holy spirit amen because that's what he said to Peter you didn't go there to the temple Peter and somebody give you a book and say read it and tell you all about what should happen amen he said My Father which is in heaven and I've seen that in these lives and when the Holy Ghost comes on them you all like to see them praise God you know who you are and everybody all over wildness in Africa and Vietnam or whatever Nation it is put some's been in in Brazil and the Philippines you'll see them acting just like here when the Holy Spirit comes down amen so it is it's a revelation it's a rock hallelujah amen and The Rock Amen that revelation of God showing you that's what it means Hallelujah just showing you that you can say oh I see it now Lord I see it praise God water amen the water is the life praise God you've known the stories about brother talking about the old cowboy and they came to the the trail boy they were going down fast didn't think they were going to make it if I don't get the water we're dead it's the same as the winded deer amen and and he said to the old horse imagine talking to a horse like that saying I've trusted you all my life you've never failed me and I've got to go one way or the other and I don't know what way to go he said but I'm going to trust you amen and he trusted the old horse I tell you that's a wonderful story isn't it Hallelujah wonderful story and it l him right to the water come on well this will lead you right to the water every time amen hallelujah praise the Lord there' be no dehydration amen and uh later on I I I I I I'll touch and not on that there but just along that line just right in there just bear that for this afternoon amen there'll be no dehydration then and we'll see uh what it really does and water does refresh you does it not may have you're really thirsty boy you're you're you're really dry mine comes in there and there's ice in it what a lovely drink it is to drink it and it really so satisfying quenching because it's lifegiving uh that's where we get the revelation of this message amen from the revelation amen the message of the hour is our Revelation it's our water today it's our life today praise God okay let me go on down here from me praise the Lord and you know Honey in the Rock imagine that brother B says a lot about that there you see but there's Honey in the Rock today because that rock was Jesus there's Sweetness in him I love to take the honey back home and there's Honey in the Rock and he said I got a whole script of it here full of Honey to put on that rock cuz that's what they did for the they put it on the Limestone that the Sheep would lick it amen and just lick you know something folks today because we've all got a different capacity you know what I mean I would imagine that say some young person in here this morning and they've only known the Lord a short time you know well I wouldn't expect you to have the same capacity as your pastor with God Amen right but the fact is if you're filled your pastor's no more filled the capacity is greater but fill is filled amen whe it's a small cup big cup doesn't matter what it is but God wants to fill your cup this morning he wants to fill your cup Hallelujah and he wants you to lick the honey and it's true up in Carolina they always say you operate the gift you can pull it out you know do you know something I'm absolutely convinced of it praise God if you wanted a word from the Lord and you pull hard enough he would give it to you that's right amen right through these lips you say well do you really think God yes I do yes I do I believe it with all my heart can come right down and talk to you right in your P right where you're sitting Hallelujah and tell you maybe something that you're asking or seeking for amen well it's wonderful praise the Lord hallelujah the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is a is a mighty high tower and we've run into that name and we are safe and we look for new other name that's a name now could I just say this as we go on because there just a few little things I would like to say and then we'll we'll quck for the morning but uh you know I said earlier on you know in the most unusual places Charles Wesley was like all ministers you might think well brother Samuel he just brings the word every week and you know it's wonderful you don't realize how hard it is sometimes amen maybe with things coming on him from outside influences then he got to turn himself and turn his mind to seek the Lord for a message for the people maybe went away or something got to do it right and it's not easy and Charles Wesley was there one day in the shore and you know he was seeking inspiration from God that's what it was and well and I notice here uh there's little places over there you walk along this strip of sand and it was a Bluey day the white we call the white horses on the on the water you can see all the white waves blowing hard and the wind was blown hard so he had a cloak on and he ate it over him like that and he was walking along just praying for inspiration and all of a sudden just out of the blue this little thing went Z like that and he looked down and whatever way his coat had been blown this little bird had been literally blown in to his coat and there it was so the minute it get in there it settled itself down you know it just you know and he's looking in there and this the wind's blowing on him but it wasn't blown in the little bird anymore and he's looking in there do little bird fix his feathers and he can't just nice and comfortable and he looked at that little bird and it struck him Hallelujah right why should I fear right why should I worry Hallelujah that little bird he find safety here right and I can find safety there and he he paned that lovely song H Jesus Lover of My Soul let me to thy bosom fly while I breathe the storms of life hide me savior or I die amen hidden in the CFT of the rock praise God I don't know what happened to the little word but it certainly give a message to Charles Wesley amen and thank God for it okay now let me just come down here as best I can amen uh bless the Lord just to bring it down to a close amen praise the Lord amen well we're on a solid rock why cry just speak amen right and uh on that rock he just he said to Moses Moses selected a certain Rock Amen and went and called a conference with God what to do and he said don't cry just speak the word it's coming more and more and more folks I tell you what it is I I I see it even the witness of the Holy Ghost amen uh the other the other day up in North Carolina and brother Joe came in the evening he said I want you to speak amen tomorrow morning and I tell you what God had told me before before that amen God had told me before the witness of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord even when I was getting the car on Saturday night the car that I got outside here uh I hope I'm driving it all right amen and uh you know we were coming coming along past Enterprise and they had a big fleet of cars and there was one at the bottom and I was saying to the brother that one there that's the one that will be okay amen right at the bottom of the whole lot and when the guy had the key said Mr qu I'll take you out I and he walked right across to that car so much so that I told him what had happened and he said well God surely does work amen and he was a Catholic boy praise the Lord God will give you that witness amen he he always has does it amen and so praise God that uh why Christ speak amen just speak and I'll just bring that right in a second and then we'll we'll try and get up amen have a conference with God and and tell him all about your troubles talk to him about it amen and see what's going to happen amen uh what must I do Lord hallelujah that's that's it right there amen and that third pull is moving because you know we can talk about the the economics and the d uh section like I mean what we've all went through every nation's went through it amen and and and the downturn but you know something praise the Lord that as we just trust in God Amen that we have our when it was dark in Egypt it was light and go amen that's always the way with the people of God there's a light shining on you that's not shining on anybody else today and it wouldn't matter I don't we'll never go into the Great Tribulation we know that there may be tribulation there may be heart ships they may close the church down that not that's not going to change one true sin that's sitting here today one true person is sing here today that is all I trust right that that has our FEI in the word of God wouldn't matter if the if the decree went night your church is closed you cannot worship God anymore oh my well I'll tell you what they'll have to cut your tongue out before and that wouldn't even be enough amen they will feel the devil will feel the devil is defeated and the sister was right when she said that if you let the devil parales your fith he will do it Hallelujah but if you resist them you're a liar you're not going to tell me the truth come on I tell you he'll flee from you come on brother don't you be afraid of him amen praise the Lord so that's what it is amen and he's a sure anchor you know on Christ the solid rock I stand all other grind and S inside I'd rather stand in that word praise the Lord amen and I'm anchored in Jesus Glory the storms of life I'll bread amen praise God I'm Anchored In Jesus I'll fear no wind or wave I'm Anchored In Jesus for he power to save I'm anchored in the rock of eges this morning amen the rock of Revelation you know when when job talked to God God didn't quote to him Genesis chapter 1 because Genesis chapter 1 hadn't been written but what God did quote to him was the Bible that he had written on the sky praise God Amen and the Bible that he knew whether it was job or Enoch wrote the the the the 12 signs I do not know but whoever it was amen they put the Virgin at the beginning praise God they put her with a branch and with the seed Hallelujah Jesus Christ amen and they put her lion flat like that because in our own self Mother of God my you can say that's you know that's like everything brother Samuel it's partially true Mother of God but not not the spirit of God she wasn't no mother is the spirit of God he had been from all eternity and had no end or no beginning no sir she was the mother of Christ the word made flesh amen that that she brought him into the world Amen well praise God now listen I just want to wind down with this here amen now speaking to the Rock brother Bram says we Mo mostly miss this truth to speak to the Rock and so we do now if the prophet said that how much more would my little voice come in behind this morning and bring it to your attention amen because God spoke to Enoch and and uh to job with the Bible that they had amen and here we have the word of God revealed in our our amen all the things that we went through on it praise God it's wonderful revealed in our heart amen and brother Bram says we mostly miss this truth Amen to speak to the Rock amen amen praise the Lord because you cannot Smite it twist come on we know that it was only SM but you know the Catholic Church will amen the Catholic Church will Smite it and smite it every time they have a mass and of course because there's no blood and it's not a bloody altar they say ah but a it's a bloodless sacrifice you see yeah well I like what one of the popes I forget what his name was doesn't really matter anyway but he asked one of the Cardinals he was a great Theologian to go and uh study the Latin Jerome's Latin Vulgate study the Bible and come back and tell me what you find and he came back and he said to the pope your Holiness he said either this book is wrong and we are Christians or this book is right and we are not Christians hallelujah amen speak to listen he can't SM it in Ireland there's I forget how many millions of people a lot of young people don't go to the church any anymore because of the uh it's a shame they're turning to everything but God right but it's a shame because of all the sexual things about the priests and the horrible things have' done and it's been highlighted today as never before and people are coming on the the radio and giving their testimonies and the papers and you know and uh it's caused a real Scandal you know and uh really and truly it's but they deserve it because they have per perpetrated it amen so praise the Lord who' ever heard of anything like that my goodness when the Bible says that's what I'm saiding the Bible say they're right and we're wrong who ever heard of a bishop not being the husband of one wife come on right see but they'll tell you well no when the church speaks that overrules us oh my never I'll tell you never in a million years praise God hallelujah because God is the word so how could that how could the church overrule the word of God God himself anyway way speak to the Rock praise the praise the Lord and uh amen uh that's that's what we got to do it's been smitten you can't Smit it anymore praise the Lord you know Moses God was angry with Moses because of that sure and you know uh Moses he said it was the people amen but he was he had a temper you know that was the Old Testament come on you know I'll tell you what we shouldn't have tempers oh my prise God if you're going to get angry just don't sin amen just don't let let don't sin that's all praise God but tber no I I don't believe in that praise God I don't have to throw you know tum amen and something upset me because I didn't like it or whatever not it wasn't to my taste you know really and truly praise God my temper is fairly well in control amen I'm sure I'm sure the Lord will test that now you know but amen you know yourself amen praise the Lord and I think of it and this is the closing you know the closing moments of the of the message bless him praise the Lord and he said you didn't keep the original word he told to Moses amen and Moses he Moses just tells it the way it is he said I besought the Lord twice that he would let me go into the promised land amen right and I tell you God turned him down twice right but not only did he turn turn him down twice and listen to this he turned around and he said to Moses now speak no more to me about that h I'll tell you you that brother Brandon that black cloth it's all over that's the way it's going to go that's the way it's going to be man I'll tell you what just a dark cloud it's already been decided well folks thank God thank almighty God for Grace this morning and mercy right and I'll tell you what thank God that it what I don't know how many thousand years later he's standing there with Christ on the Mount of transfiguration amen as the brother said amen the prophets the uh preaching the word to the word amen about what's going to happen when he goes into Jerusalem amen and they're discussing it together and the prophets preaching the word sharing the word with the word of God himself it's wonderful now listen this is it just wrapping it right up here in a second amen praise God Amen um bless you brother Bram says think of it n are you in a desert do you know where to go have you been got off the Beaten Track and that's easy to do I mean King David well maybe mention it today he had an anointing but he just didn't chn on it the right way you see praise God like I can go further into that than I did I mean Moses knew he was a prophet of God Moses knew if he hit that rock twice I would bring forth water right you see but he didn't channel the anointing right and that that that that's has to be correct and and it's the same with David E the anointing bring back the Ark of God you see he had the anointing but he just didn't Channel it that's why you got to watch you got to watch folks uh that that you don't be off a little side road amen see off the Beaten Track exactly you find yourself you know in the Pilgrim's Progress uh he was walking along and and this this is why sometimes we do it because in Pilgrim's Progress Pilgrim was walking along he was quite happy he had been to some place the house beautiful and they had looked after him well and I've been so looked after a while here and you know the thing is uh he thought that was great and he's refreshed again and he's marching along the road going to the celestial City then all of a sudden he well my Feet's hurting a little bit here you know and uh he thinking a fairly Rocky Old Road distance starting to cut his feet up a little bit you know and he's walking along and he looks over he said well I don't think I think I'll just take off I'll get off the road a little bit here you know so anyway what happened ameny the battery died okay God bless you amen okay thank you I should be dying with it here amen but but I will blow but you know there he he he he looked at that uh and he and he said that would be you know that would be easier on the feet amen so he got thank you very very much and so he got uh off the road he said that's an e oh this is far easier on the feet you know sometimes you you remember what what the holy spirit said to brother Bram and through the through the message and tongues and interpretation because thou chosen the hard way right amen this this is not an easy way we're going to heaven but it's the correct way it's the correct way that's the whole thing and so praise God that uh amen here he was there in this nice easier oh this is an easier walk oh yeah and then of course as he walked along it was easier and he got sleepy oh yes this is a nice comfortable Road got sleepy and I think I'll take a little nap and so he did and the next thing he felt was this on grabing him got you who are you who are you and it was the giant of doubting Castle I don't know if you know the story it was the Giant of dirty Castle so keep on the heart it don't it says if you maybe are feel that you're off on a little this is the prophet talking amen the beaten path amen just you pray God will keep you on the right path always but he said maybe you have maybe you felt like God he says why not speak to the Rock why not speak to the Rock he will bring forth his Waters amen and a a rock and a cliff in it and out of the same Rock they found honey one day and he will bring that honey out of it and that water out of it he says why not speak to the Rock so if you do feel you're in a bit of a desert today amen things haven't been working out well praise God just speak to the Rock I could develop that a lot more but you know just let me finish with that little woman amen well Jesus said go and get your husband amen she said I've had five you know said you've told the truth there and he said and you've the one you're living with not even your husband you've had six men wow but there was something in there that was
