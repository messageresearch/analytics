========================================

good morning thank the lord again be able to come together to worship amen we're going to read from psalms 103 verses 1 through 17. you know i would listen to brother brown he was then talking about people being healing he said the first thing is to call jesus on the scene right because jesus and sickness won't stay in the same place right now so let's just remember every day we pray that's what we do cause jesus on the scene first before we start asking for what we need let's let's pray if you will heavenly father again today we are thankful lord for having the knowledge and understanding of your word lord let it be a revelation to be manifest in our hearts father for these words that we read are your words lord and we pray that they will help us to grow learn to be strong lord to love one another always god as you have loved us and still do father we thank you we actually remember those that in the sun and school class this morning father they're young and finding a start into understanding your word lord and just be with them lord we ask you to be with the pastor brother dale this morning or then bless him in a special way that he may deliver unto us things that we have need to understand in jesus christ and we pray amen psalm 103 bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name who forgiveth our thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who satisfy that mouth with good thing so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles righteousness he made known all his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of lord is israel in gracious soul and anger and punishment he will not always say neither will he keep his anger forever for as the heavens is high above the earth so great is his mercies toward them that fear him like as the father pitteth his church so the lord pitteth them that fear him as for a man his eyes are as grass his days is as of grass as a flower of the field so he flourishes but the mercies of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto the children's church god bless receive it amen yes your holy holy amen and amen and amen i want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord we had a real good time yesterday at the fellowship meeting and all a little hard driving and going but it was worth it also that's great for all of us so just remember that we appreciate all of it and all the announcements remember that they're downstairs being run continually so remember the brothers for the uh uh fishing time and the sisters for your uh painting i think they're gonna learn how to paint well we're going fishing so maybe they can paint us some fish where we can eat some you know that's who probably needs something but anyhow but that's good uh announcement too now the playground will not be open this afternoon okay stays closed all day because richard was up cleaning up yesterday and found about four little snakes so we're going to have to search the whole thing to make sure that there's nothing out there but you know no problem we'll just go through and and you may smell some uh stuff on the playground for a little bit put in some places to try to drive them out but which we'll make sure because it you know this is you you're cleaning leaves up you're going to find little snakes it's not something no problem but we don't want you out there running screaming across the parking lot and get hurt caught us on the low snake that crawls up you know that's uh this makes you're okay all right we'll do that so remember any other announcement let's see we got i guess that's all of them what i was going to do is you you just go ahead and be seated because we got something a little bit different this morning that's going to be and uh now number one uh i've noticed that sometimes we i want to move something all right and i know everybody's got all their stuff so what i want to move this all right y'all put it where you want it well see what's ministered we're going to lay ours down here and then you start trying to find your notes and you're finding everybody else's songs and everybody else laying over here so if you would please just leave that thing laying somewhere or do something with it i don't know if you need it put it up here i don't care as long as it ain't here because you get your notes mixed up you watch a preacher a lot of times we are preaching he'd be and he's hunting because he he doesn't got mixed up with all your singing so you know do that if you would but um two it's really something i thought about this the other night and uh i thought we'd do it this morning and what i want to do is just give you a few scriptures and then brother joe is going to come out and do a little presentation that we do every once in a while that you know we're we try to do the best we can and i know that we everybody's always talking about you're hunting for the life seed for life's person the life one to come in etc and uh you know we all are and a lot of times we can't go but it's like brother i think brother henry greene made the statement if you can't go send somebody you know so we've had an opportunity here to be able to travel some and all and wades are done real good and some of these other brothers but aaron and them they've traveled some you know out of the country and and all and uh we thank god for that we appreciate it because it's getting the gospel out but i just thought well we need to just really show you know that there is uh and he'll show it in a minute there's 196 countries according to the paper they have in the world and do you know from lula's website we have touched 191 countries i mean just one of those and if people look at our thing day to day and they shine well we put a little of our money into doing the best we could and i'm sorry out there on the internet system a lot of times that you know you don't get to get the pretty big pretty pictures and the pretty things that you see in all these other churches but uh we are doing the best we can to try to get the message out and if it skips and jumps and everything well that's i'm sorry uh it ain't always our fault it's a lot of times it's the servers and the things that's doing that and uh you know but we're not trying to put on a beautiful thing we're trying to just go ahead and preach the gospel at the world whatever wants to listen listen but see in mark jesus said one day he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature all right then he goes back in matthew 24 and he says and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come coming on down right all right in colossians 1 23 paul is talking about the hope of the gospel which you have heard which was preached now watch to every creature that is under heaven brother branham i remember him saying it seeing it said here in the scripture which was preached to every creature which is under heaven now brother brown said paul touched the known world of his day all right the gospel went out that was the beginning and we're here in the end toward it says in and the end of all things has come upon us you know the end here and the gospel is going out to the world of these the believers of the message that are doing the best they can to try to to get the message out and all and knowing that like i said we can't go but we the money you put in is what sends these out to minister and what sins on a monthly basis to help these people and all and we just recently sent to a large chunk of money to the philippines to type into a lot of the doings and from a little church like this it was a large track of money all right but uh you know we appreciate it appreciate all the work that's done as a matter of fact i was against years ago of the internet system that's what's going on the internet i was against that and and i wouldn't have it well the brothers one day they kept on and some of them just kept talking and they said well just let us put it on what we can do and uh okay that's y'all i'll pay for everything whatever you need but you know no problem but that's up to you because i'm not trying to to be a worldwide preacher uh i refuse to be pastor of anybody other than this group of people we have here and some that do count us their pastor that sends their tithe to us these you know that that cannot be here you know but only a couple of those because i won't do it you get on the internet and you get into a lot of problems and all and i knew that from the beginning but god has been so gracious to us we have had over uh the years that we've been on the internet we've had one comment a question or a thought back because of something i said about an individual minister one time and uh you know i thought quick as we opened it up and and allowed that to happen that we'd be flooded with all kinds of things you know but it's god has been good to us but i'd like for jophie wood just to come and just let you see what you think that you're not doing much but your money and your half helping and your offense and the thing and and going is really doing a great thing and i want him to come ahead and brother joe and give it to him good morning everyone we love the lord amen amen um i like what brother richard douglas always says jesus loves you and i love you too i wanted to give uh just a quick little overview of um some things that um are going out from here you know it's it's their motive and desire to establish the word of god in the hearts of the people and i can't do it myself as far as using our tools and technology and those kind of things but i have a great team of of brothers that band together to have one heart and one mind and our objective and what we do is to glorify jesus christ and so um but you know a lot of times in all of our lives we have things behind the scenes that we do that other people don't see and until you sit down and you talk to people and you kind of lay out you know what you do you don't really realize what is going on behind the scenes so i wanted to share a couple of things with you um of course we we have a website but we try to focus more on the sermons that are published the quotes the the audio those kind of things um you know you can make a website pretty and and however you want to design it but your objective should be to get the message of jesus christ to other people and we live in an age where that's possible uh through you know technology and other things like that we were listening to the book of acts on the way to church and in acts chapter 6 it was talking about philip and you know the spirit caught him away over to the ethiopian and he preached the gospel that was the first teleportation person that ever happened and the holy spirit did it because there was a need for it right there and there was a question that the the ethiopian he had a question on his heart and and when he received the holy ghost god used him to take that message to his people so god will make a way whether technology is this is or not and but we try to utilize these things and and to help other people currently we have since 2012 to current date we have 1026 videos online for people to archive and watch and and view the services and the sermons um since then there's 300 772 minutes which equals 5 000 hours have been watched of the sermons that have been going on here that is 5 000 continuous hours that others have watched uh that's 28 000 views and that's just for the videos alone okay so 28 000 plus people have viewed the sermons and the services that have been going on here and you know i encourage even my own children i say do something for the lord if it's to sing a song if it's to clap your hands give a testimony because the people here are not the only ones that are watching you it is around the world now and people benefit from that they edify from that it's an encouragement from that from the website um just just uh of course brother dale he said and i haven't pulled these numbers for a while usually around december or the uh watch not service i'll give you like an overview but last year i didn't um when i pulled up some of the the statistics and things from 2011 to current now we've had 191 countries have accessed the website and been able to you know read something and maybe the lord spoke to him what i like here is is things like this email here you know because you you want to know that what you're doing is not in vain that the lord is is helping somebody else um and periodically we get emails back from people and i'm just this is one of many this is a brother in the philippines he said since i personally found your sight i studied prayerfully and that's the god to reveal to us the truth i encountered personal teachings of ministers in the message that declared jesus is not god but a son of god but the truth opened to us when we heard the sermons of brother dale especially on the godhead and also how you emphasize so much on the son of man ministry in the godhead we were enlightened to hear we were enlightened so much that god opened our understanding from that time we handled the message here in this country in the philippines actually but we failed to find a church that strictly taught what the message was teaching see they received a revelation you know they received something they can put their faith in saying i understand this now and god can use anyone that's why you know i believe as the book of acts the holy spirit is a witness in your life never think that you should just let somebody else do something for the lord if he speaks to you go talk to a person plant a seed in their life it can be quick in one day and you don't know where um that can come to fruit fruition so he goes on to say that he appreciates that the work that we're doing over here and it takes your prayers it takes us as a body of believers to pray one for another because this wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for the prayers of the believer so those are some of the things that really makes my heart rejoice because you know we can we can do a lot of work but if the lord isn't in it you know uh he should be the builder he's the one that knows where his sheep are and what they need to take a body change so i appreciate your prayers and you know anytime anybody wants to come back there i'll be glad to just walk anybody through our whole operation we have an open door and to share with you you know if you want to come back there and run the cameras i'm trying to teach jonas right now how to run the cameras feel free you know but you know it's it's through your prayers but it's through what the lord is doing through the ministry here the fifo ministry and we just give god the honor and praise we really really appreciate i can't even turn i get static zelda setting gold on the radio man i i can't do any of that though better get some sound on it see there i can't even keep the sound running correctly but uh we appreciate these brothers and i want to give them a good hand appreciate them and you know the ones that put it out there and do it because that's it's a wonderful thing and uh you know but i just you know i was thinking the other night that i know what brother around said paul's reached a known world of his day i agree there but now it's a whole lot bigger world a whole lot different thing and that's why i read the scripture where jesus said you know the gospel would be preached all the world and then the end would come well that's one of the things that you say well you know how can you reach all of the world you're not reaching every person paul never touched every person that was in the world it was the opportunity just given in the country and the things of places where he was at because everybody wasn't going to listen to him all right but see we don't expect to reach every person in the world but what about just from here alone now what if all the other ministry you know undoing and doing their job and and putting out the things and going and preaching and all and at least our contact has been at least with 191 countries and that's wonderful that's that's not bragging that's just truth it wouldn't set out to be bragged about and and everything else it was set out to just contact people that god would allow them to listen and i make it plain and blunt i do not answer questions i've even had ministers say i am a minister and i request for you to answer my question i say i will not answer your question because that would make me some form of a internet ministry and i'm not going to do it but i said i will tell you that on certain certain dates i preached a series on that question that you have if you want to go to that that's your choice but other than that you know and who's going to go listen to you know you tell somebody that i've done preach 35 this is 35 the 35th sermon on the glory of his person most people are not going to listen to 35 sermons i got enough sense to know that and all but that it is offered you know they can do what they want to let's stand let's read our scripture get into our point and for the day and we appreciate all the things okay heavenly father we thank you for your loving your grace thank you for these brothers and sisters here lord that have a burden in their heart for others that they'd give their time their money their their talents their things and lord to see how that you would put them into these places you'd give them jobs way down the road there then bring them together until we have just a wonderful group of people and people are so amazed at the little website things that are put together from this little old hundred people here in the little city of lula georgia and father we're not trying to be anything but what you want us to be but if that's your way of reaching someone then all right then that's it maybe they're in a country that can't be somebody couldn't go to and talk to him but that they they got an opportunity to hear the gospel and we thank you we love you and we just committed all to you in jesus name amen revelations 1 i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gert about to pouch with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow in his eyes where's the flame of fire and his feet like undefined bryce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters now let's go to acts 10 now this you'll notice immediately is at the house of canadians in the opening of the door to the gentiles all right and bringing it forward so we just pick apart and start with it and saying showing then verse 38 how how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power we went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised now he's laying it down right peter is the the thing of what had happened what he had personally witnessed all right and he's telling this to the gentiles him god raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and he testified it it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead to him gave all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost philip on all of them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now to get quickly into our point and you know to get our understanding of what we're trying to do and we've been talking now for quite a while about the new birth and last sunday we covered you know uh what do you call the new birth and uh then we went on in the afternoon to bring the message of how that we are sealed by the holy spirit of promise all right then in seeing that we know that new birth is not what we've all done and we all you ask somebody you walk up to somebody something and you mention the new birth i shouted i spoke in tongues i cried i'd like i've done this they automatically will tell you the things they've done but that is not the birth that's the after effects right the baby gets here and then cries right that's the after effects and you say well but you asked me about my new birth well why did i ask you about your new birth have you been born again all right i didn't ask if you shouted spoke in tongues cried or whatever you done that doesn't have anything to do with the new birth that's what happens after you receive the new birth you understand me all right see they believed for three and a half years and followed the lord jesus but there come a day that in the upper room that the holy ghost came then they had a new birth yet there were great believers they had seen the dead rays the sick healed as a matter of fact they had a part of the ministry they'd done a lot of those things you know you know but yet still they were not born again all right see that's the point i've been driving at for a long time how do you know you're born well i cried i should have spoken to i didn't ask you that how do you know when satan can impersonate everything you can name and that's why you have the people that are so up and down because one time they're shouting and feeling good and the next week everything's going the other way well they don't know what to hold on to all right see the new birth then is the birth we know is what one thing right every natural baby now i said natural normal child that is born in the natural is born the same way right water blood life all right wasn't that what jesus says we've tried to emphasize so much when he said to nicodemus you must be born again look at him say you mean i've got to go back to my mother's womb and come again he said if i talk to you of those things like that and you don't understand there's really no need he said to me to talk to you about heavenly things huh and see he said in other words you're a teacher you're to know these things well surely nicodemus knew the messiah was to come some of the things the messiah was to do why because he was the teacher of israel the greatest of all all right but yet he couldn't understand so we say well poor nicodemus jesus said you must be well all i do is believe well like i emphasize nicodemus put his job on the line because there wasn't very few people in that day jesus wasn't a popular guy to be hung around with right and so he put everything on he went to jesus and he recognized him and he said we know that thou art a man come from god because you couldn't do these things that you're doing but when he spoke to him about the new birth he said i don't understand you why because nobody had spoke of that but every natural baby is born the same way all right so then every person now i want to emphasize it i got it wrote down mark good explain this you know every person that has ever received the new birth received it identically the same now that does away with your shout and you're crying you're doing these things right now you tell me it's some other way i'm open sisters kids come on get up tell us some other way to receive the holy ghost other than the way that every person has always received the holy ghost so you go back to the natural then you're saying well some babies are born this way and somebody now you know better now now we're old enough forget it you're supposed to have a little common sense you know the babies are all born to sign water blood life maybe circumcisions that's not a normal verb i didn't explain that but even in the circumcision you're going to get water blood and life right a big mess all right but see think about it then every person that has ever received the new birth received it the same way all right now here's the statement from the prophet he said like this he said if you say i receive the new birth speaking in tongues he says you are out of the scripture now what about that statement you know why because they received the new birth right come on read the book of acts and then it was a time lapse that they went downstairs and everybody heard them speaking in tongues which was languages right not just blabbering tighter i see see to my tie you know i'm not making no light i'm making light of the people that use that thing as a light you know it's just mockery but listen everybody received the new birth well like can you say your new birth is the same identical new birth that paul received he had a pretty good experience didn't he knocked down on the road to damascus great bright shining light right a whole lot of things but was that his new birth have you ever had an experience of the new birth all right now if we believe it to be correct that everybody that ever received the new birth received the same new birth then everybody would have the same evidence i didn't say experiences of sensations you go through no because everybody's different it's according to your nature your makeup you're doing some christ some shout some just sit there some rejoice some all kind of just different things all right that's that's human nature we all have different human natures about us some are emotional some are not emotional well see are you going to tell the person that's not that's where you troubled that see you ain't never spoke in tongues well you don't have it well the other guy on the other side said you ever did you cry when you spoke in tough no i didn't cry i spoke well you ain't got it because you got to cry huh i had an amazing thing to happen one time when i was preaching i won't call the name of the place or nowhere but i was just preaching away and all at once everybody in the church started crying what's going on you know anyway everybody in the church was just weeping and i'm thought i got over it and finished the message so afterward i asked the pastor i said what did i do wrong you know did i crack a joke did i do something that made everybody start crying he said no brother dale we believe that when the anointing comes it comes with a crying effect upon you and said you touched everybody and we was crying okay but see that was an emotional situation triggered by what you think all right but what is your evidence now remember if the new birth is the new birth of the word that you have heard because the natural baby is born what by the implanting of the seed right and then that triggers the egg and the things happens all right so then all new births would be the word planted into the heart of the individual and then because that would be the scripture faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word all right then the holy ghost would quicken that word that you've heard and there's your new birth now you explain it to me how it would be something different in every other age or every other time or whatever right you say yeah but so-and-so taught us this way so-and-so taught it come on is the word right you're not arguing with what everybody that's their their doings there was a day and a time that we believed that you know there was three gods until we heard the truth well god didn't hold that against us because until we heard the truth we used to think hell was eternal cold man that old preacher you're going to burn in hell eternally well he's trying his best to scare me today right and you know yourself most of us come to the altar over the fact that we didn't want to go to hell was that right you wanted to be saved but what is what are you going to put the new birth as being all right so we established it as the new birth as being the birth of the word show me in the bible anybody that ever received the holy ghost without hearing the word first show me any word didn't anybody ever receive the holy ghost without hearing the word first even anointed ones hear the word right see then what are we going to do so then all right then everybody that would have the new everybody would have the same evidence now come on that's hard for you to think about would you tell me any other way you you got the opportunity explain to me any other way that if everybody's got the same new birth then everybody's got to have the same evidence all right now what is your evidence i spoke in tongues i cried now we done got away from that part i hope in our thinking that those are attributes you know those are the things the baby does when the baby comes forth from the womb to the mother it cries all right we see it's not the birth all right see evidence then of every age has to be the same or what have you got yeah well brother dale i always thought luther believed he believed just she'll live by faith that's what he blamed which we believe sanctification that's what he believed but it was all the birth of the word there's never been a baby born in the spiritual realm that wasn't born by the birth of the word brother dale you just take away everything that i got that i've held on to all my life well what if what you held on to all your life was wrong i held on until i heard this message that there was three gods what did you hold on to i taught it cured a baptist bible what did you do come on wake up see because i'm talking about a personal experience that's the title of the message now a personal experience how many of you are here today old enough to drive and old enough to be here by your own do it but you're here because mom and daddy came or mom and brother and sister came let's read i chose to read that there in the book of acts they see the holy ghost that fell on the death of pentecost was wonderful but this was bringing it over to the gentile dispensation all right now would you like the scripture where that one of them says can you forbid water these be baptized sin they receive the holy ghost like we did at the beginning because everybody that ever got the new birth it was the same new birth yeah but you don't understand brother dale my baby was different i get in trouble with that i know all the time that's all right i tell the truth you're the one's got to deal with it i love them babies and you know that i love these kids here and you know that so you know i'm not throwing off when i say that you look down at that little baby and you look at him and try to find a halo that's being held up by the horns on his head because all babies are the same but my baby won't do that you are the worst deceived person that's ever been in the world that's why brother dale don't he don't get along with too many people i guess but is it the truth but my baby don't lie but they've got you deceived got cookie all over them the cookie in the hand hiding behind them you know what brother hansel's used to say and there they stand in there you know you ate that quick nope ain't no clue because according to the bible we're all born in sin shape of an iniquity spouse from mother's womb go forth a liar that's according to the bible all right you know what i'm going to believe that i mean you can tell me all about your kids my kids was lying and everything in the book i've always told you that i don't pick on nobody i just tell it like it is you know that little kid look at you boy them little crocodile tears wade one time was giving him a little spanking and with a hickory and boy yeah i wonder i'll ever give him yeah he's about 12 13 years old maybe 12 and i was spanking him a little bit about something he done and i seen immediately what happened and i tapped him and he just voiced i tapped him again here okay time we get something solved either lay the hickory down and forget it or do something else so i applied just a little bit more pressure well that third liquid a little more pressure went from a to it okay we're getting it going now and i'll give him one more and it went man i quit i'm not with him no more ah come on that's what i tell you folks we're so bad on picking on these four kids in this last days about their ways of doing and we came up with our ducktale haircuts and our bell-bottom pants and little bitty belts that we had the little white ones you remember that mine and i was so little i had to put both hooks in the same hole you know you wouldn't believe that now 155 pounds but think about it now listen if all births are the same all evidences would have to be the same all right so we're not talking about who cried who spoke in tongues who shouted who done what and then that way we can't condemn the other person and say well you've never come the way i come now don't tell me you hadn't never looked at anybody else and judged them according to your birth now don't tell me that i'm too old i don't care how old you are my brother dale i don't i don't look at nobody are you still alive yeah were you still looking and problems but see all evidences would have to be the same right so whatever was the evidence for peter paul james john all would be the same evidence that everybody in the times would have and that brother branham would have to have and that you and i have to have and what is that evidence well i cried and see now remember that's what you do afterwards that's what you do after the baby gets here it cries that's not the birth of the baby that's why i wrote around and said there's not too many new births because why because people will go in and they become religious they go to church they want to do good and all that's wonderful but yet they've always got that little up and down right when the service is going good and you know preaching real good you just said happy and then when i get there you you know and you just lock her down and you know but i thought the truth was supposed to set us free i didn't know it was the clapping of the hands and emotions and nobody in this building agrees with emotion as much as this man does i said as much i don't care what you think i've seen god i've smelt god i don't have no arguments with you about anything i'm not going to argue because it can't be done you're not upset on my experience that's in my life that was not my birth and i saw god when i was 11 years old in a church that was not my new birth 99.99 people would say that was their new birth but this is one man that says no when i came in this message and heard brother branham you know what i've told you 40 000 times i immediately seen i didn't have what he's talking about yet i've had all of the other things and great experiences it happened but yet i never had to do birth why because this man is the one that taught me what i'm talking about the new birth is the birth of the word how can you have the birth if you've never heard the word how can you have a birth we're part word you know god had to overlook our ignorances right when we were trinitarians and things that would come through it and give the new birth he had to overlook those things but he comes to a time he said all men must repent it's settled all right so that's why i don't have any trouble with it all right look what the prophet has to say let's go ahead and pick up number one here's something i want to read to you though while you're looking at that i remember about 1970 somewhere right in there some people told me one day said brother branham said we're gonna have to overcome riches and soft living you know i've looked for that quote since 1970 because you know what 1970 as i told them last night at the fellowship meeting about 1970 you get 100 people together and you go out in the parking lot and you tallied up how many cars was out there and how much that's worth and you might have had a 30 000 parking lot sitting there right because nobody knows nothing worth nothing tied together with hay bale and wire and all kind of things well they said brother branham said that i said well i just don't see how they were going to have to overcome riches and soft living you know but last night i told him i said you tattly up cause wade had brought it up we were talking about it the you tally up what was that in that parking lot of those new cars that was sitting there i said there's probably close to a million dollars in new cars sitting right out there so brother ram was right we're going to have to overcome soft living in riches but i'm not rich you're a whole lot richer than 90 of the world i don't care how poor you think you are you've never been to some of these countries and looked at people that didn't have no food to eat and the first time i went i had three pieces of luggage when i left i came back with three empty luggages i gave away everything i had well i said you mean you gave away your underclothes i said somebody can wear them they can wash them i give them everything away why because i'd seen poverty when my mind when i reached the jamaica in 1991 93 my mind rolled back to 1950 when we were poor and the things but look what he says because this is taking off at 239 of the titan church age i don't know where they've got yeah okay no they ain't got that that's the other quote leave it up there cause we'll get to it watch what he said each age had its pressures for example a great burden of this last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in he said well i'm not rich brother dale you're rich according to a lot of the world's standards and you ought to thank god for it you ought to thank him every day for what he give you i thank him every day for my home i thank him every day for my the jobs that i had the living i made i thank him every day for everything i got because he gave it to me what about you all right well listen what is the evidence brother branham of the baptism of the holy ghost if it's not going to be you know gifts signs wonders or whatever crying speaking in tongues then what is those things and what can we use as an evidence so watch what he says all right in the smyrnan church age book he says in every age and every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer now then don't get into lutheran them and say as some say they didn't have the holy ghost now that is a lie they had the holy ghost or their age and their time they had the new birth or they're not in the body of christ all right so you're leaving them out of the body of christ right no no no no don't do that so watch watch what he says and every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer i say in every age the evidence was the same maybe you don't believe me to say the evidence is the same in each age but maybe you'll believe him if you ain't going to believe me in him you sure ain't going to believe nothing else those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and the spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and loved it what is the evidence of the holy ghost look at the next one what is the evidence of the holy ghost which is taken for the pergamon church age just wrote it on up to save time reading and he talks about why did you understand my speech because you cannot hear me words did you notice jesus said that the world could not receive the holy ghost well in this verse 1 this verse i just read neither could they receive the word why because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the holy spirit as the prophets which emphasizing what there's only one holy spirit the word would come to you and you'd receive it so he goes on down and what what is the evidence of receiving it is what i want to note very carefully that jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying shouting dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of god for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word now what about a prophet what about a prophet that wouldn't understand the true evidence of the holy ghost that slaps your face don't it because you don't like think like that what about a day when a man would be a prophet on god but yet not understand the true evidence well they just clicked off a lot of the internet just now because that's all those that we go in all those countries doesn't mean everybody's listening that just mean they connected on all right what did he say about it let's see if i can find it what does it have to do with it okay they don't have this one but i'll give you the this is taken from the broken sister and priest in jeffersonville in 1964 7 26 evening today i was talking with a great friend dr lee vale who is present now and he's quite a theologian and so we usually have some have some pretty good discussions on the scripture verse first mark and he asked me one time what i thought about the initial evidence of the holy ghost was it speaking in tongues he said he'd been many years ago i said no can't see that he said neither do i said though i've been taught that he said what would you think would be an evidence i said the most perfect evidence i can think of is love and so we got to talking on that and then i thought so they got it up here now where you can read it then i thought that sounded pretty good so i just held that if a man has got love now watch him right here but one day the lord in a vision straightened me okay now something straightened out means you had a little bit of a slant or something right it was off this tire straightened me out and he said that the evidence of the spirit was those who would receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word receiving the word all right so then every evidence is the same we said we read that on 142 or submarine in church age every evidence is the sign so let's get down to the truth of it if you think you've got a different evidence then whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word now what are you going to put it on well i saw a vision i saw this one what can i what good is that see the evidence has to do with receiving the word now you tell me you're born again but don't agree with the message of the hour now there's something wrong and now listen these notes was last night and yesterday so don't think i'm picking on you if you think well i come here today and brother dale's picking on me so i don't pick on people i pick on spirits yeah but not people all right so then if everybody has the same experience why is there 969 different denominations and each one of them would tell you a different way of saying that they have the new birth now why is about 2 000 in the message of the hour around it would tell you some of those things you know there's a lot of people say well if you don't believe the way i preach then you don't have the holy ghost right that sounds like that same old spirit just moved up into the message doesn't it so we're not picking on nobody out there we're talking about here what is your evidence what do you think about see then how could like the the way they're doing it today when this people follow this message for 50 years and quoting brother branham and then all at once they're just turning against him and then still all claim the hell of the holy ghost you know there can't be a thousand different ways of seeing the new birth well brother dale you think you're the only one that's got it i'm the only one that i know for sure knows about what i'm talking about now you want to argue that that's your business i didn't denounce anybody as being wrong i ain't even never said the pope wasn't born again that's his business all right but have you ever had a personal experience with jesus christ like i said at 11 years old i saw god in the church that's a pretty good experience all right even my buddy next to me he said you better go to the altar he said god dealing with you now i hung onto that seat and i wish i hadn't but from that day on i tried to find somebody that could carry me to that god that i saw what did you see brother daley that's what everybody wants to know i saw something in my mind's eye view whether it came into reality in our dimension that's none of my business i just saw something that was real and you know what i wanted to find that and was real well when i went on i become a deacon at 23 years of age i've done all the things and moved on in the lord and come into this message well i heard a man talking about the god that i had seen but i still didn't see it right and i knew i wasn't seeing what he was talking about if you say you believe what he's talking about why do you have some other idea about a new birth why would you do that why would you have some other idea about a new birth if you believe the prophet taught against those times right now what was really he teaching what's the damage of saying tongues is the evidence the damage is is when you're going to tell that you're going to tell the other people they've got to speak in tongues well what if they don't never speak in tongues like as i told you my wife's speaking to my brother-in-law about it and he believes that and she said what if you don't have a tongue what if you can't talk will you cut that person out of the holy ghost that's just a natural point but it solves the problem me well brother dale you want us to believe you i've never asked nobody to believe me that's beside the point i've always asked people to just believe the word that's why that i stand as i do with the prophet's message because i believe he brought us the word well you don't know i read a lot of other things too i'll be i'm glad to read other things i love to hear people talk of their experiences and things and i read other things about people's experiences because see i'm one that believes in a personal experience when i ask you have you ever had an experience of justification have you ever had an experience of sanctification have you ever had an experience of the baptism of the holy ghost well i got it all at one time uh there's a quote i've got it laid on my desk i should have brought it where brother branham says very it's in the church age books where very few people will believe all the way unto receiving the holy ghost now if he puts it on a long scale there's very few that would be that long but if he puts it down on a scale of right then then your amount that would be dropped from there would drop greater here as to somebody saying i got it at one time now he never said you didn't and i won't say you didn't that's between you and god don't ask me whether you think i brother dale i want to know no do you think i'm born again i'm not going to answer you first off if you've got to have my opinion of it then you're lost that's the best way to say it if you've got to have my opinion of whether or not you're saved or not then i'll tell you you're lost right because you're trying to put it on something i say but what about a personal experience i didn't know we had to have one well what's what's wrong with the ministers of the message today how many of you how many of you have you heard them talk about a personal experience something that satan cannot take away from you and something that you won't change meeting houses because of the way somebody says son and brother i all said one time he said won't you go up and let brother dale talk you out or what you think you got because you like talking out of it it means you don't have it right all right i've never tried to destroy anybody's experience because everybody has different experiences in their life but there's never if you're going to have one evidence of the holy ghost and you're going to have one new birth of the word and everybody's going to have the same then you're going to have to have the same experience so you see where the trouble would be try to make everybody have your experience it's all right if you got one biblical you know what i mean if it's lined up in the scripture i would like for you to really show me where brother branham tells you about his experience now i can give you all the quotes he said in the woodshed and running down the railroad track and a lot of other things but you know i believe you had one don't you but i mean you get it down to where he said i was right here at one certain place and then you'll hear him explaining i was right here at one certain place well i still ain't got the whole message preached and lord willing maybe next sunday we'll get on to being born again or maybe wednesday whatever i get to the point because i see i believe that this new birth that we receive right here that when that headstone comes it's going to be a birth of the word you know and you you can't start off bad you've got to start off right and then whatever's coming will come to that word because if it's not it's not going to come that word but now there's shoutings in the things i've always told you i've always taught this because i'll believe it when it comes to the anointing being poured out it's promised in the bible that the prophet said that they'd become an anointing that would fill every fiber you're being and take in the rapture all right you know what i believe that's going to fall on the whole basic religious systems i've always taught that because i've always believed it so that means the two soul people is going to say look what we're having is proof that we're right now what are you going to do but you open another door and the seventh universe is going to say we told you this was coming now where are you going all right remember according to the bible everything in the in the world was going to be deceived except the bride right and may i quote brother branham he said frankly get her messed up and he'd have to cut the work short now you need that quote oh no brother dale we can't be deceived he didn't say you could be deceived and lost he just said he'd get it all messed up i just got through reading a quote here that says we were going to have to overcome soft living and nervous conditions to overcome this world all right now what do we believe have you ever had a personal experience i like to hear your experience i wish you'd write it down let me read it i enjoy reading your experiences and i'm not going to say well you didn't do that you didn't do that you didn't do like i done you didn't do like this and done you're going to tell me if you tell me your experience you're going to tell me of some emotional situations the different things that is in you of crying or discipline you're going to tell me that and i'm not going to argue with you about it i'm just going to ask you about the birth what about a new birth from according to malachi 4. you see we've got a lot of things that we need to understand but what about your personal experience what about all of the quotes that i've got laying here from the prophet of what he said about the personal experience what kind of experience have you ever had moses had a personal experience with god he met god in a burning bush face to face he had a great experience a personal experience those in the upper room were wonderful believers but one day they had a personal experience the only way you can know god i'm just scanning down reading some of these things the only way you can know god is to know him by personal experience if not you're saying what somebody else says you say what the bible says and that's fine but is that a personal experience what about that one day it's going to be required of you what you did about the understanding of god's word your education is fine but the word of god is life to know the alive word or the quicken of the word makes you alive you can only know him by the word for he is the word outside of knowing christ by personal experience with him not joining a church or reciting a creed then we only bring it to the shallow condition did you listen outside in other words of knowing christ by a personal experience you're going to bring it to a shallow condition and then you're going to put it on some thing that you believe that makes you be saved and what is that but what about believing 99 of the word and rejecting one word can you say that that is the holy ghost if it rejects one word now we're not folks we're not dumb okay i'm not talking about knowing all the word because that's not according to everybody everybody don't know all of the word and i don't know all the word and you don't know all the word we don't worry about it right well what's your experience have you had a personal experience with jesus christ now let me get a hold of this you don't think i'm wrong that's all right i'll say it like i mean it you go to these take these kids to these youth camps and things and i'm not against that folks now you better get it right because you say anything different that's between you and god because i'm warning you i believe in doing all you can to try to help anybody kids or whatever but why is the same kids and altar the same time the next year trying to seek after god now may i quote brother branham do you mind that he said that's why you don't go down in the aisles and try to talk to them kids and people or anybody to try to get them to come to altar why i'm letting the lord too lord told me go talk that person if it was god but what if it's you but why are you crying out for god for the same thing a year later why don't you reach a place somewhere to settle it well i think you ought to get them there to where they can cry well that's good but may i quote the prophet he said if you do those things to try to get those people to the altar he said you'll make it harder for them to come the next time we don't want to hear what the prophet has to say right because we got our own ideas well just remember if our ideas is contrary to the word of god then it doesn't make no difference who we are it ain't going to be changed because you or me right god's going to honor his word he'll keep his word that's why i've always just tried to be stable in everything and just go right on down the road i was talking to brothers i want to go about something one of these days i'm going to get around to preach on healing relation to medicine i've told you that and i'll get to it one of these days because what's the difference in you and your great super-duper faith are going to the doctor and he gives you something and it takes away that problem your prophet said it i didn't god healed through medicine got healed by laughter got healed by singing god healed by many things all right but the worst thing is of fear fear hath torment you go to the doctor and the doctor says you got cancer you just draw up why why are you going to take the devil's interpretation let's cure you to death he's only dealing with medical science that's all he can do that's right right now the reason i can say this do you know that i don't have to back up from what i say because you've been with me when they told me i had leukemia i looked at the doctor i said so what i didn't know that the leukemia that i had until some weeks or maybe might have been a month but i know it was weeks from going to one doctor that they didn't know what kind it was to send me to a cancer doctor and he came in and said sam i got good news you got leukemia yeah but said it's not the kind you die of it's the kind you die with we'll just keep it under control me and him have us a good time talking every time i go see him he said i love for you to come in because he said how you doing the first thing i say i said how are you doing you're trying that with your doctor sometimes right you go into the doctor and he says how you doing look back and said how you doing you see an expression on his face that you ain't never seen because he don't think about that but i had no fear of whether it was what kind of leukemia they still can't prove it because it just goes up and down they just laugh at me brother there was you're scared when you laid on that table and they hooked you up to that machine and shocked your heart when there is a chance that you could never come back from that situation you do sign all that paperwork to let them know that it's okay if your ticker don't start back ticking right that's right well you're scared no was laughing and no fear i stood and seen trees bend over and just lay down with the wind and stand there with no fear then i've heard a trickle on the house be scared to death so i'm not one of these super dupers okay i'm just plain human i've had fear to come on me and i know what it is but when anything they tell you don't take what they say it's what the bible says if you've had a personal experience why are you worried about dying oh they said to brother branham said you are not say these things to these kids talking about and people talking about the coming of the lord something to that degree i may miss it to her he said why would you be worried about your lord coming you know you mean you're afraid your lord's coming you know what you're afraid of because you ain't lined up you're afraid he's going to bring the sin out ain't you afraid of that yeah but but brother dale why not if you've had a personal experience with god is there any way to take away can they deprogram you you know can they take you in and deprogram you and make you a trinitarian with him dirty thoughts is coming okay how come there's so many people jumping around in the message from one doctrine to another i'm sorry dirty but that's the way i think brother would be had a good point he said you get them in with a hot dog you can get them out with a hamburger that was a point you take one doctor and convince somebody they're right and take another doctor and convince them they're right then you don't know where you're standing yes but brother dale i'm not a preacher i didn't know that the bible only said the preacher i didn't know brother branham put the preacher was to have the evidences i believe he's supposed to but i thought he said every individual that's right i thought he said every person was to have a personal experience with god but brother dale i've never i've never went through what you're talking about justification case the baptism went over why not and the prophet explained it in simple terminology justification is when you repented of your sins and you ask god to forgive you or what was in your life but that didn't change you'd make you did any different that just wiped away that sin here's your home come on read it sanctification what driving out that unclean spirit out of you washing you by the washing of the water of the word you want to go to church you want to be right you want to live right you want to do right but see there's the danger one because you'll stop right there saying i must be a christian because i don't want to act like i used to all right but why is it that after a while you fall you slip and you slide because see if there's something real within there i've told you before and i mean it with the deafness of my heart i was born to dale and according to my record child i won but you know what i might not be a day of by natural birth but that's what i've been told all of my life and that's settled it you mean that somebody could come along today and give me 10 million dollars to get me to change my name there's something wrong with you well i'd sure change my name for 10 million you understand what i mean when you change your name you're doing away with the existence of that person that you lived all of your life and that family that raised you if i found out i was adopted i would shout glory hallelujah i was adopted by the dale family and i'm going to stay one come on what are you talking about i'm a christian by birth i've had many experiences too unmatched by most people that could ever tell about it but i don't have to worry about it i'll face you at judgment by me telling it to you it's not something to build me up it's something to let you know brother brown said some people go through certain things to let other people know i've seen an angel in my home three times would you ever talk to him no don't be stupid first time i seen it i grabbed a pistol and took off after it that's how real it was that don't make nothing out of me because i don't count none of that it's my experience that day in that altar it was settled the pro when brother mo said what the prophet had told us the new birth is the birth of the word brother dale the words you've heard i said that's it well no great shining lights with no great things took place but i had an experience and i honestly i believe your experience a lot of times is an ongoing thing amen if you're going to believe in being born again being born again by the end corrupted word then you're going to believe that you've got a new birth and then you're going to believe that you're being born again as you heard the word come on did we just finish up the other day in just a second what did the prophet say you can only be saved by revelation i didn't say that the new birth is a personal experience it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you you know what i was sitting there one day and i always had to mark it down but listening to the prophet and he said you know how this gift works he said it's revelation how did he know that that lady was white-headed and she lived at certain certain streets something happened within him that was a revelation the same way moses said what happened in the garden was by revelation you ever had a revelation that you're born again have you ever had a revelation what about it come on brothers what about it have you ever had a personal experience with jesus christ let me go ahead this happened yesterday and you know being a song that you hear when we go to fellowship may not have even been asked if if they didn't let me sing would you go like that it don't make any difference whether i sing or not if there's nobody else there then i know i'm the one and we got up there yesterday and uh yeah i'm making i'm not making nothing out of myself i'm i'm trying to show the people the lord jesus christ and anyhow i and we pulled in and the van was nowhere and and gail and and with tim wade there to sleep and brother raising that their sleep and kathy's there and like that you know i said i said to brother richard i said well brother richard i guess it's you're going to have sonny so anyhow lo and behold here come another car up in there well it was a bob black family see and i thought well you know i said richard would you mind if we asked them them to sing and he said no that's all right and then i i thought well brother sam i called you over there and i said but if we i have two groups saying today like that you know and uh so afterwards and all this was over and was eating we sat down eating and i believe was sister monica said well bob said we're going to sing today you see what i'm talking about they practiced all the way up there and practiced the song and he told he told he she told me she said he said we're going to sing today now was the lord jesus christ in that yeah give him credit for all the time let's stand together give god credit for everything what we got brother 388 388 just just sing a verse or something what's life salvation is a personal experience living for jesus christ is a personal experience our sister now in jesus name jesus shall turn me around but daily i'm working glory to god he me free i am climbing higher each day darkness glory to god
