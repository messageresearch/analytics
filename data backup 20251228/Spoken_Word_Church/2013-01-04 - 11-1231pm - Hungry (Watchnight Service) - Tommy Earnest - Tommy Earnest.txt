you don't know how I preach and I don't know how y'all listen and so it'll take us a little while to get used to that but amen but he said four hours now I didn't bring enough notes for 4 hours but there's a pile of notes right here I'll just run down and grab them and and just just fill up the time if we need to so it's good to be with you we we'll greet you here in a few minutes from our brother Jim but let's read our scripture while you're standing Matthew 5 and verse 6 we're going to read half of the verse our whole text tonight is coming out of the first half of Matthew 5 and verse 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness everybody read it with me now blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness the second half of that verse is the answer to the first half they shall be filled but we're going to work on the first half because we know we're going to be filled but there's a blessing that comes out of the first half of that verse it's it's one of those Beatitudes you know I know yall heard the Beatitudes preached on a lot let's just have a word of prayer Heavenly Father tonight as we come into the the sanctuary of of your your people Lord not just this building but into the hallowed hearts of the the Church of the Living God that stands here and we pray tonight Lord the things that we look at that will will be a blessing to them that they it'll Inspire them that we we often pray many times Lord that our service would be blessed but we would ask you tonight that the word would be blessed because at midnight this service will be Drawing Near to an end but that your word will go on forever and ever and it will it will keep us Lord we thank you for that bless each one that's they're faithfulness to come out to to the house of the Lord tonight rest their bodies as we go into the the the later hours of the day and and if they're tired from their work they're weary from their week of activity we pray Lord you'll just give them rest t night in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen God bless you you may be seated this evening I know you won't care if I take my coat off because it may as well just just get that out of the way because I only bring it along just so you know I got one you that's the only reason coats you know I've often said many times that if I had my own church I would just put my coats on a rack over there number them 1 2 3 4 5 and just come on out in a shirt and a tie and just say I'm wearing number seven over here today y'all just look at that and and then and then you don't have to have to go through that that ritual but that's it amen wow it's it's just it's just different I mean I preached a lot in my life but and a lot of different places but the this far down and meeting y'all for the first time and we we met these two guys when they came out to Kansas brother pingston is our pastor there in witch talk Kansas we uh have just moved out there back in February of this year so so 2011 has been a big change for us as a family we spent the last 21 years years down in Fort Walton Beach Florida prior to that and I found out over the last five or six years that I spent more time in Witchita preaching than I did in Florida so so it just seemed like because of the need that was there and the help that I could be that we went ahead and just relocated our our our dog and our furniture and just took it all out there and now we're Kansas residents for the first time um but it's uh brother Pinkston wanted to got a text from him just 10 minutes ago he wanted to send his greetings all of y'all got to meet him earlier in the year um if I can just be half the preacher he is tonight then then the Lord will be pleased with that I'm sure we enjoy his ministry and amen and we've gotten acquainted with the way you you your guys preach we get a little sample we get a we get bigger doses of brother Wade than we do Brother Sam when he comes out so so we know twice as well how he preaches as much as his dad does because he takes twice as long I may as well just go on and say that I me say Amen to that you know oh is that the way it is here well that's the way it was in Kansas I'm just I'm just surmising that it we got a shoe thrower on the front row here but uh you know Brother Sam come out and he was just done so quickly and then brother Wade was following him up the next week and I just sent word that you don't get to roll over minutes you know the next guy in if you forfeit your Menace the next guy don't get them this ain't AT&T this this is the Church of the Lord so but uh but anyway that it's uh I guess I'll tell you something about me since you don't know me I I came in the message in 1969 I know you're all looking saying wow you don't look that old so go on and get that out of the way you know I well that guy's looking been around a long time but 1969 in Tennessee I'm a Tennessee boy uh our church was in nut Bush Tennessee Brother Ray Miles was the pastor that that got the message started there back in in the late 60s coming through Pentecost a few years prior to that we had a man ministering there his name was um a brother gray Freddy gray he had sat under WV grants Ministry and and through the middle 60s of course I was six and seven and 8 years old and you don't remember a lot of things that went on but but he was he we recognized later after he was gone and and the Lord had took him off the scene that that even in those Pentecostal years that he was preaching a lot of things not letting us know that it came from Brother Bram you know y'all ever been around folks like that I mean he was a fine man he had a b gift of his own I remember just just one little instance to to relate to that I remember as a kid he was preaching we were going to have a two we Revival how many remember two week long Revival them them don't happen much anymore but but we were going to have this two week long Revival and all the way leading up to that here I am 7 8 years old all the way up to that he keeps telling us that twins are born in every Revival and I kept hearing he preached that and preached that leading up to this two- we Revival that we were going to have and I I'm looking around as a child as a kid I'm looking for the some pregnant lady that was going to fulfill that you know later on when we came into the message we realized where he got that and as an adult I understood what he was talking about but we had him there he was a fine man of God I remember you know going through the Pentecostal years and sitting under that Ministry and then I was sharing with brother Dale today one day I remember very well he prophesied there was going to be a death in the church and it would shake the church up and great things were coming down the way and it was him 2 weeks later he was killed in a car crash and on his way into town to get the mail one morning and so shortly after that the message came and then we understood maybe the Lord was just Paving the way to get us down but right right but that was 42 going on 43 years ago that we came into this word and and I just want to report that the hope of of of what the word came to do is not diminished years later right I have no um that ain't nothing I don't feel like there's anything lacking that that we missed anything that we we've been short changed along the way for us to still be here right Glory because brother random let us know that God's clock is exactly on it doesn't matter how long it may be we a lot of folks spent way too much time figuring out how long it was going to be right we had this fell this past year figuring out you know who was the guy out there in California Mr camping he had it what was the first day sometime back in the in the early summer and then that didn't work out and he moved it up to October and finally after that one failed he said I'm just going to quit trying I'm not going to give you anymore he ought to quit before the first one and then he wouldn't have had all that trouble but but that that's our our history we were born and raised there in the church um the church again starting around around I'm actually a year older than than than brother Wade here just to give you an idea of I know I look way younger than that I mean you know met his brother today and I said did you say it's your brother or your son you know I just just couldn't figure out it's the gray it's the gray but he's putting us up I may find sand in my sheets tonight when I get home I don't know but uh but we we've enjoyed the day of Fellowship we got in this morning uh you like I said you met our pastor and through that and through meeting these brothers here we are to to just share some things in the word with you tonight I trust the Lord helpap yeah we were just having some fellowship today and and I was about probably 1970 I was 10 9 10 years old and we had a man coming from up in East Tennessee named brother Woodby was preaching a Revival right and and he preached this revival and the whole gang of us went out and got water baptized in a cow pasture P that day and he baptized me when I was about 10 years old we never saw him a whole lot after that I never really knew what come of him or where he went but it was brother Woodby that that baptized me at about 10 years old later on in life after you know I came to more recollection our pastor there we were at a camp meeting up in Michigan and he baptized me again as seems to be the case so many times when your conscience wants to be clear but but I still remember very well at about 10 that that he came and I think my mom and some of the elders there the older people in the church and all of us kids we were all just getting baptized that day and and so I still remember that very well it was our brother would be and like I said years went by we never knew what even come of him but it ain't really the man that puts you under the water it's the conscience that's cleared by going under that water right I know you get a you know water B baptism very well but but that was that was about 1970 somewhere in there and I've been privileged in in my short life to to live through all the cycles that this message has had to offer right I mean I know looking at some of y'all you know the message is getting older let me just say that when I first started preaching and I and I did start preaching when I was about 19 years old so 32 years ago that were somewhere in there I started preaching and I've gotten to preach to a lot of churches been in a lot of different meetings and I've lived through all the cycles that we've all went through we went through and we went through all of them we had the dates we had the 77 and then we had the 84 and and we stored up canned goods sometime along the way there I don't know why we were doing that still I can't remember but but it was one of those Cycles we were in you know one of those transitions that the message was going through and and again I just share with you brother R said God's clock is exactly on time right I'm just glad to have lived through those cycles and still be looking for what God is doing and what he's going to do in our lives that's right I've been married 27 years to my wife Sandy and got her out of Canada moved up to Canada to work with a brother out there in Edmonton so she is a Canadian I I toil seven years in Canada and we decided to move back to the state so I just stood up and let him know I said you know lest it be the Jacob scenario I don't I don't want to work seven more for another one that that didn't win me much favor up there you know I I just you know being from tennessy I just like to say things like they are you know I just let them know I'm Southern born and Southern bread when I'm die I'll be Southern dead you know and so the Canadian folks didn't appreciate that very much but here we are back in the south for the last got three children two two grand children and a third one on the way and um they are why we are traveling through at this time we went back down to Florida for Thanksgiving and Christmas and and um my of course it's hard to leave the grandkids behind that's one of the hardest struggles I have to go daily just about and read that scripture where Jesus says unless you leave father mother just to keep me encouraged because it is hard to be away from him that's right the folks in Kansas aren't sure my wife has moved yet or not because she's back down there so much they they think she took up some kind of F residency cuz she gets to go back more than I do but uh but that's our history we we've spent 21 years in Florida we spent about seven years in Canada working with different churches there and and learned to trade I learned to sell cars for a dealership while I was up there I know that hits close to home around here right and so we that's been part of our life I sell life insurance for a living not not asking for any applications to be handed out this weekend or anything a lot of preachers will get up and they'll want to mix their business with their preaching you know and um I'm sure you lived through that cycle too somewhere along the way but uh I trust the Lord will help us tonight I I'm not usually longwinded at all when he said watch night and four hours and all that kind of stuff I was just kind of bewildered by that but I'll do my best when just say you know 4 hours I'm just thinking how in the world can you you you know especially because you know a lot of folks really love them quotes where brother R said the preacher ought to get up and preach about 45 minutes how many you know he said that you know yeah oh we love them don't we especially after the guys went a couple hours that's the only quote you can remember when you get home prr said preacher ought to go about 45 minutes but I you know I I learned a lesson I was several years ago I was up in Baltimore Maryland and I was sitting in a meeting and there was a brother there from Trinidad that was preaching I didn't know this man but he he made one and I don't remember a whole lot of what he said except for one observation and he said this he said I know everybody is going to tell you that brother brandom said you a preacher should preach about 45 minutes and his observation was this he says but if I'm preaching and you're receiving and we're all having a good time for about 3 hours and when we get done it seemed like 45 minutes he said have we done disservice to what brother brother Bram said you right well he took his whole three hours but his point was good you know brother brandham said about John over there for that 30 minutes of silence you remember what he said in the seals about that he said it seemed like a millennium he says now 30 minutes not be might not be very long if you're having a good time but he said in that suspense between life and death right he said it seemed like a millennium it wasn't a millennium but it seemed like a millennium right so if we go 3 hours and it seems like 45 minutes then we're right on the message you are you good with that now now I'll have to admit I've sat through a lot of 45 minute sermons that seem like 3 hours I I've had my share of those in the last 42 years so so if my if my 2 hours seems like 4 hours then just don't don't let me know that because because that that that wouldn't work out very good but but I just wanted to share that with you I get to think of that often that if if the Lord will help us amen right like I said you're going to spend the first half hour figuring me out and I'm going to spend the first half hour figuring y'all out and and by the time we get ready to have a good time it'll be time to go home and take communion and go down and have some fellowship but but with the few we've got to meet so far we've we've appreciated the the the warm handshakes and the greetings and and and I trust the Lord will just let us have some fellowship down the way together so but we did choose a very small text I wanted to start with this and and you know because this is just half a verse here you got here I'm challenged to to fill up four hours with a half a verse right isn't that amazing you know you think a man going to preach 4 hours he ought to read a few chapters out of the Bible at least just to fill up space but out of a half a verse right amen I I found this quote and you I know you're going to know all these quotes the brother's going to try to find them on the screen and and it's good if they do that at home this is just what happens in Kansas we got a couple of pretty good computer guys and as I begin to read a quote they'll search it find it and make sure it's the right one or hopefully it's the right one and they'll put it up on the screen now sometimes we get crosswise and and I'm on one and they're on another one and that's going to happen and they do it for brother Jim who talks a lot faster than I do did y'all have trouble keeping up with him I mean was pretty fast but brother random said this about he had read a text in the in the message to the leosan church behold I stand at the door and knock he read just that one verse and and and he he's obviously to me when he he says this he's picking up something from the audience he says and some might say why brother brandham isn't this rather a small text for a group of people this size and for a Convention of this caliber if you just read just a few words and one little verse of scripture yeah I I I think he was picking that up somewhere out there he read one verse and he says some might say I think somebody probably was out there saying that right and he says and some might say why brother brandom isn't this a small text for a group of people this size a Convention of this caliber if you just read just a few words in one little verse of scripture that's not enough verse yeah that's not enough scripture brother brandom for us are are you following the context what I'm seeing in this quote there's somebody out there saying man this is a big convention this is a big we we beat a convention that's going on here in town this week and you're going to come out here and read one little verse of scripture and that's all you got yeah yeah and brother R says but you see it isn't the size of the Scripture it isn't the size of the reading it's what it is that counts that's right oh man is that right it's what it is that counts it ain't the size everybody's hung up on size you looking at me you're thinking that's a big preacher for a little verse of scripture I we grow big in Tennessee it's just what happens you know in another place he said this he went out and a trumpet gives an uncertain sound and he read Corinthians 14:8 if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for battle one verse he says now this would be enough text that we could be preaching two weeks from now on it and yet never touch the edges of it there's something about the word that's inspired you're constantly on that one text you can tie the entire Bible with it that's correct he goes on to say one day a fellow asked me he says how can you take the same text yeah I said oh my you take a context of anything from it I picked up a little three-leaf Clover laying on the ground and I held it up the man sitting here tonight from Tucson we was over in Pasadena California and I said I could take this three leaf clover and preach 25 years on it how it is a life that's in it how the three blades being the trinity in one oh there's just so many things that we could say about it right amen you talk about a man that can find some inspiration right right that's a gift that I don't have I could not preach 25 years on a little three leaf clover that I pick up out of the ground right but he got a few hours out of a cigarette carton in the woods come on that's inspiration it's when God inspires the word it ain't the size it ain't the size it ain't the size it's just that word will go out and it'll grow this is what brother Brandon is talking about sure amen he says how about a scripture it's God's word it's Eternal it has no end it just keeps going on and on and on it's a refuge to us and now tonight I want to speak on a trumpet gives an uncertain sound so one little verse right I could take this three leaf clover preach 25 years on it you guys figure that one out and meet me outside after and let me know right that's quite a man that believes that the word can Quicken to you and you know brother Brandon's whole message it quickened out of a lot of different areas didn't it I mean come on yeah come on he took his daily living he took his daily life the things that happened around him the events that surrounded in life whether it was a gun blowing up in his face or or or the little things that happened in his life and he said things about those that we just can't say right right you know it's it's just a wonderful thing just a wonderful thing so tonight we are going going to look I got a very short title for this sermon tonight we're just going to call it hungry am with a big question mark hungry blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness now I want you to notice how this is the best explanation from the message it's out of the Revelation chapter 4 Series 1961 it was actually preached on New Year's Day in 1961 and brother brandom is going to explain this verse in a way that I'd never heard it explained before i' heard this over the 40 something years preached a lot of ways but when I seen this I could see see what the word was written for Jesus said blessed are they for they sh shall be filled now listen to what brother brand said blessed are they to even thirst exactly whether you've got it or not amen is the blessing in the filling or is the blessing in the Thirsty all right cuz we always run past that first half and we go to they shall be f they shall be filled they shall be filled you get a man preaching on a Holy Ghost and that's all he wants to talk about they shall be filled we get people in this message standing up in the pull pit calling out people's names telling them they're filled well I don't know how he knows that right there is a blessing to being filled but there's no man that can stand here and say you got it and you got it and you got it amen the Holy Ghost is a is a tremendous entity in our lives and you know what the only person that's going to know you got it is you there ain't no man can tell you you got it right because if that's the way you know you got it another man's going to come along and tell you you don't have it and you might just believe him as well that's right but we always go past the first part and they shall be filled and we just rejoice and we're happy and that is the answer to the first part but the first part is blessed are they to even thirst whether you've got it or not amen how many wants more of God brother random ask all right well the reason that you want more of God you're blessed just to be that right just a wanted if you haven't got it you're still blessed absolutely yes may I say that again if you haven't got it you're still blessed blessed are they that do hunger and thirst you're blessed just to hunger and thirst because you want it you're blessed cuz there's many people don't want it right exactly doesn't that re-clarify that whole scripture to you doesn't that mean something out of the word that I had never seen before because we always run past to the filling they shall be filled we're only and when we get filled it is a blessing right amen but the real blessing was even wanting to be filled a desire to be filled oh my I love the way this this word opens up to us and you can see those things that's right blessed are they that even thirst whether you've got it or not amen exactly whether you've got it or not oh man now let's break it on down we got to just stop now and think about church we got to think about Services we got to think about coming to church well man I just went out to church and it was so dry and it was long and and it was boring I just didn't seem to get anything but there was something in you that Drew you here so though you went home in your own mind and in your own thoughts thinking maybe you didn't get anything or it wasn't inspirational enough you know us preachers we're a funny Bunch oh yeah some of us are loud some of us are quiet some are long some are short some are humorous some are very dry right I don't know which way you like it yeah and and sometimes the way the the the ministry puts the word together it's just not to your liking right it's not the way you like it and we're going to get into this in a little while the way the word is coming it's just I like it more I wish he was more like brother so and so over here well if I tried to be that man I would be such a a mockery of what he is and such a failure but the thing about the word is it's the word isn't inspired it's not the way it's brought you might go home thinking you got nothing and you'll find out in a few days when a need arises in your life that that word will come right back around to you again and it'll minister to you in a way that you never imagined it could be possible so let's just remember as we get into this text tonight that the blessing is to thirst and to look for it the blessed are they that hunger and thirst they shall be filled that's the wonderful part right but the true blessing is to have a hunger am and a thirst for the word blessed are they that hunger and thirst that's our text which they shall be filled amen I believe it with all my heart amen there's a little text a quote I want them to bring up for us if they will it's out of the message let your light so shine before men in 1961 and this is where we're going to actually draw our text out of you may remember this very well and if you just if you know it by heart you just just bear with me because I just I just rejoicing looking at this stuff right like I saying about brother brandom there's there's just some things that that that that he says that we just can't say as well right just some of his ways of look you know there's some things you say that we know already I mean you know yall ever run into those you're reading along or you're listening to a tape and and here's one for you you want one you want one of those you know how many believe there are things that brother brandom says I don't want to get all into the infallibility and every word being the being thus sayith the Lord I'm not you know this is like our first date I'm not going to bring a whole lot of Doctrine out on you just make you wonder what I'm you know you you remember those first dates you girls ever go out with a guy on the first date and you g just gave you way more information than you wanted you know my Paul he just got out of prison the other day well that's more than you want to know on the first day you know yeah I mean you know yeah hold on here well my grandpa when he Clos that still down well that's a lot of information for the first dat so this is our first date if I if I don't just jump into a whole lot of Doctrine if yall just bear with us but but here's one of those things that brother brandom says and and when he says it it just it it clicks in your heart it's the truth but when you set stop and step back and think well I knew that already you know I mean here's the quote it's out of the communion message 1962 brother Brandon says now our bodies need food and drink each day to survive right M everybody saying praise the Lord thank you brother BR well you know that before you ever heard about brother but it's just nice the way he says it isn't it right because he's going to tell us something about that craving of the Natural Body now our bodies need food and drink each day to survive our physical body if we don't take food each day and drink then our body weakens right how many he says praise the Lord I needed Malachi 4 to tell me that right you know that growing up exactly that's why you showed up at the supper table every night and said man I'm feeling weak need some food right there's something in me I am built to eat right right and brother brandom says if we don't take in that food and drink every day then our bodies weakens there's something in us that we must have food right somebody say praise the Lord that's a deep Revelation that ain't no deep Revelation at all you grow up you you got to came into this world crime want something to eat first thing out of you're thinking of when you get here W what's wrong he wants something to eat he don't know how to say it yeah but it's built in you there's a desire there's a hunger that comes and we're built to eat right some of us do a better job of it than others isn't that right brother way I didn't get like this eating bad groceries I want you to know that this is this is from good food I want you to know my wife is a tremendous cook and look what happened amen honestly I was this way before she found me but she didn't help the program any once I did get married but the these are you know I love the message brother man is just a preacher he's just telling us things we already know there's something in us that we must have food one day's food will not last for the next day you've got to have food each day to strengthen your mortal being he says you can live over but you're weaker and the second day you're still weaker and the third day you're getting tremendous weak well that's I mean are you with me we know that go three days without it don't take me 3 days I'm tremendous week between breakfast and lunch sometimes you know that's the only thing I faulted brother brandom on that Doctrine with right there man come in just had a big old breakfast honey I'm just tremendous week you know she'll come back and read me this quote no brother said it takes three days to get like that not the first day there you go but you know what he's saying you don't eat you're going to get weak he said well that's what many times that we do in the spiritual realm right you see each day we've got to commune with Christ we've got to talk to him each day we've got to settle it with him each day Paul said I die each day see each day I die yet I live not me but Christ lives in me so if your physical body needs food each day and drink each day to survive your spiritual body needs spiritual food and communion with the Lord each day to survive Jesus said man will not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so each day we've got to study the Bible it's a good New Year's message ain't it let's think about 2012 what if we remember this quote every day of 2012 amen here it is again each day we've got to study the Bible why don't you say that with me each day we've got to study the Bible brother brand says some people doesn't study at all some picks it up every two or three times a year but I want you to notice the next part of this quote but a real real believer not a Believer but a real real believer right that's really spiritually built up he reads his Bible every day and talks to the Lord amen that's right amen glory what kind of a Believer reads it every day and talks to the Lord every day a real real believer amen how many know there are believers amen and there's real Believers and then there's a real real believer amen and what does that real real believer do he reads his Bible every day and he talks to the Lord every day brother brandom said he has to right right why does he have to because if you go without it you'll become weak and if you go two days without it you're weaker still and if you go three days without it you are tremendously weak right right that's why oh man we we can get in trouble about talking about people listening to tapes at home yeah but that's why you ain't going to get everything you need between Sunday and Wednesday right Sunday and Wednesday ain't enough to change these bodies my dear brothers and sisters exactly I appreciate the ministry you have here I know you have some tremendous Services I know you have the two on Sunday we only have one you got two times on Sunday one on Wednesday but so many people have gotten to where church is like a gas station it's like a up stuff we we just we just barely get in on the opening bell yeah you know I mean you know brother R said get there 30 minutes early how many remember that quote that's right we read it too fast a lot of people said he thought he said 3 minutes early but he said 30 minutes early but we'll slide right in W to get refilled recharged charge our batteries on Wednesday so we can make it through till Sunday yeah you know what brother Brown said about your Perfection he said our Perfection comes between us and God Alone that church is just for Fellowship don't you see brothers and sisters as we get closer to him there ought to be such a hunger coming out of us to where we need that word constantly after 3 days you will be tremendous weak if you ain't picked up your Bible or or heard a tape or read a quote or done something to feed your spiritual Soul you will be tremendously weak on that third day maybe that's why all them folks just fall down in the benches on Wednesday and sleep I don't know yeah maybe because they've gotten tremendous weak because they can't remember where they laid down their Bible when they brought it home on Sunday come on I I'm sorry I I see it everywhere I go I see it in my own children I watch it the the what did Brother Rand us word he said we're getting dilatory remember that word dilatory what what's happening to us which it is common anymore sure the message is common you can't be in it 40 years and it not become somewhat common but there's something in that hungry in and thirsting that you're coming back looking for God to feed you it draws you here don't put in the effort to get dressed up put together cleaned up and then come and sleep through service if you're going to sleep sleep at home is that what Paul said if you're going to eat eat at home sleep sleep at home don't come to the house of God you never made all the effort to get here wake up man there's nothing worse than sleeping you know if you if you ever get over there under that juniper tree with Elijah he's he's sitting there sleeping you know what an angel came along and woke him up sure we might preach on that a little bit tomorrow amen an angel came along and woke him up you know what Elijah's reaction was he went back to sleep again you know I'm not unch christianizing it happened to Elijah for and angel had to come kick him in the ribs again wake up Elijah you got a big journey ahead of you it's more you need these biddles again so ate some more and probably went on back to sleep again but let's not do like Elijah rise above that if you're going to get up and put your church clothes on to come to church be at church don't be out on the job don't be out doing your occupation be at church do your best whatever you can do to to rise up and and take hold of what God is doing at the moment I believe what our brother said I believe the the the the word is here whatever vessel that's coming through whatever form it's coming through it is to encourage us it's to to build us up it's to lift us up and have a home life have a home life that is in love with this word have a home life that is in love with this message that you know I ask people sometimes can you remember the last time you put on a tape right and and you know you begin to see them then they're ducking you know and then they're hiding out and then why be ask me that well I should ask you that you need to be asked on a regular basis when is the last time you read a quote when's the last time you picked up your Bible and read it this is what brother random is telling us if you don't continually feed then you are going to be tremendous week tremendous we Lord help us to fall in love with this word no matter how long the journey gets right just help us fall in love with this word more than we ever have been before Lord all right back to back to our text now this is where I drew our thought from tonight brother br's going to relate a little story I have to use these reading glasses cuz of being in the message so long and having a few birthdays behind me now that's right amen at least I bring mine with me your guys leave them at home all the time both of them had glasses troubles out in Kansas I he did I think the other time he did I couldn't get my contacts in couldn't get his contacts in so probably from staying up fellowshipping too late with brother Scher there you know and then eyes was all swelled up all right this follow this quote with me this isn't let your light so shine before men and I know the brothers will find this easy enough he brother brand begins this little narrative he said some time ago I was going down a road I'll give him time to find that and then you can follow the quote with me on the screen because it it just blessed me to look at this uh I just want you to follow some time ago I was going down a road I was driving along at a pretty rapid speed and watching as I usually do by myself driving he said it's a lonesome drive when you're driving by yourself I can say Amen to that amen right of course now we got GPS there always a woman on there screaming at you ain't it and us men will go out and pay $80 or $100 for a GPS just to have another woman in our life Naggy what's wrong with us aren't we glutton for a punishment enough already to have one woman in the car telling you how to drive we'll go out and buy a GPS just so another woman can tell us how to drive yeah I wish sure mine the other day said turn left dummy I went back and double checked it I didn't know why she got so personal like that but but we'll do that us guys we we'll just complain my I wish my wife would quit helping me drive I wish she'd quit telling me where to go begging me to stop and ask directions we just ain't going to do that are we no right come on we can't because because we're the president of the He Man Woman hater club we ain't about we ain't about to stop ask no directions just cuz our wife wants us to we might be 100 miles off course before we before we give up but even after all of that we'll still go out and spend $100 for a GPS right I get so tired of mine sometimes I'll just make her Chinese so I just hear talking in the background ching chong ching chong and then I can just do what I want to do anyway you know just that's the beautiful thing about those machines but brother man I said it's a lonesome drive when you're driving by yourself he he says you can't turn the radio on unless there's some of these family networks where you can get religious music because it's all things that would take the very Spirit out of you I know you agree with that because you sure can't turn the radio he says wherever I go I've gotten a little old I I carry a little pad of paper now now here's a man that wants to remember what God's saying to him wherever I go I got a little old carry a little W of paper when the Lord reveals something to me I just jot it down I've even wrote on my gun stock in the woods with a bullet and things like that just to get a thought that is presented to me right take a piece of tag out of my clothes or something and write on it something another to keep the message in my mind see that's not a man that just lays his Bible down on Sunday and picks it up again to go to church on Wednesday this is a man that when God tells me something I'm going to write it down I want to remember it exen you know that was what was the whole problem with this Pentecostal movement with all the tongues and the interpretation and that went on in the time yeah we had service last night and God just spoke to us so wonderfully and and you never got to the preaching but but the Lord came down we had tongues and interpretation and prophecy and they're just talking about what a wonderful time they had and then he ask well what did the Lord say right yeah I just can't right remember but it was good yeah oh yeah well if the Lord tells you something you want to remember it you want to write it down brother said I've carved my my thought in the stock of my gun now I don't know how he went and repr preached that I don't know if he brought the gun up there with him so he can see it's carving that's just wanting to remember it ain't it right I ain't never done that that's that's getting on far down the way there tear a tag out of my clothes now I've done a few McDonald's napkins I don't know if that's spiritual to y'all or not but I've been riding in the car many times you grab out a McDonald's napkin and write something down but all right sure just something here's the point something another to keep the message message in my mind right Lord let your word ever be before me GL when God speaks remember what he said but he he's just relating this this little as I drove down along this road I noticed a great big beautiful signboard and usually you know they have a lot of things plastered on these signboards but I never noticed such things on this certain signboard usually they have pictures of hash dressed women or something or another advertising a certain brand of cigarettes or whiskey or beer or something on the great shining signboards but to my surprise at my first glance it attracted my attention because it wasn't all smutted up with something another the smut wasn't on it and I gazed back to see it was a beautiful board and sitting in a correct place just where when you turn this corner you can't help from seeing the sign and to my surprise it had one word it had one word wrote across it right hungry y hungry now we're about to get a message off of a billboard now right all right he might he might have stopped and wrote this on some I don't know but he said that's all it said hungry just hungry that's all there was and then I noticed little bitty letters down at the bottom of the board said 3 miles ahead yeah hungry 3 miles ahead yeah MH now we're about to get a message about this hungry y 3 mil ahead well are in the study about that he said usually and I know y'all will believe this usually if they got a restaurant ahead they're trying to out sell the other fell the picture of big old sizzling steaks and so forth and when you go in you usually don't find anything like they advertised it's just an advertisement how many ever run into that you go in a restaurant and you're looking at the menu you tell you where I want that hamburger right there that's the one I want big old man the the juice is gushing out of it and it's this thick and he brings you back a little old dried up piece of beef you can't hardly find under the bun right I actually called a guy back one time and said what happened between this picture in your cook in the kitchen yeah did you miscommunicate what I wanted because this is not this is not what I saw right and this is what's brother B saying they usually you don't find anything like they advertise because it's just an advertisement but this seemed to have a different approach and we know that the day that we're living in it pays to advertise we found find out that these people who are making big progress in business are great men of advertisement they put it on television they smear it on boards everywhere they can to advertise their products smoke this one not a coughin a carload guess that must have been a slogan how many know that to be alive from your years of smoking yeah smoke this one not a cough and a carload the the thinking man's filter some other man's tip he's I think he's looking back to that package he found something like that Li Lively longer with their beers and all this stuff like that it's advertisement they write off a lot of their income tax just for advertisement and it certainly pays off and he says so if it pays off for that I begin to think then why won't Christianity pay off if it's advertised right oh what a simple thought huh right amen what a simple thought right if that works for them what if God begins to advertise the real true message right right on a billboard what is advertising you got to have something that's a little different from what the rest of them's got y or if it's just so common like the things of the world it'll never attract the attention of the people now a man if a man would have been looking for an automobile he would have went on past that sign but if he had have been hungry he' have been looking for that sign so I believe that the Christian is God's billboard I believe that each one of us is God's billboard and we don't have to do so much of carrying on about what we do just simply live such a life that will make the people hungry to be like you oh what a message what a New Year's Eve message let 202 be the kind of a year that I can live such a life not a bunch of carrying on right brother I said we don't need to do a lot of carrying on to get the message across he says just live such a life that it'll make people hungry amen you are the salt of the earth what does salt do it makes you thirsty it makes you longing for that I noticed on this Builder board it didn't claim anything it just ask a question if you're hungry right and you cannot sell anybody anything to eat unless they are hungry right right blessed are they that hunger and thirst here's our message from brother brandom are you hungry right going into the new year that's what you have to ask yourself now you know being being hungry is a paradox let me let me show you the Paradox in the scripture Jesus said If any man shall come to me he shall never thirst again oh man how you going to put them two together blessed is you that hunger and thirst after righteous for they shall be filled but if you the man that drinks from this well he'll never thirst again so you got to decide which way is it are you thirsty or not thirsty there's a paradox in that you understand a paradox we got a lot of messages on a paradox it appears to be one thing but it's not exactly that right because that verse about never hunger again a man that eats the of My Flesh and drinks my blood they'll never thirst they'll never be hungry again but yet Jesus said there's a blessing to be hungry and thirsty could it be that in your hunger the satisfaction is automatically going to follow up because of the require of that hunger and because of the Chet that thirst think on that Paradox I don't have all the answers for that one but I'll let brother Wade explain that to you one of these others days would you do that the Paradox the Paradox where are those verses at let's read those two verses it won't hurt us John 6:35 I want you to see that it's something to think on it's something to to ponder you look at what Jesus said in John chapter 6 John 6:35 verse 34 then they said Lord Evermore give us this bread Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that come to me shall never hunger mhm yeah there it is you come to me and you'll never hunger y right he that believeth on me shall never thirst how that's what we want right right sure that's what we want right and we also want the blessing of being hungry and thirsty right yeah there's another verse John 4:14 go to that one John 6 is the hungry part John 4 is the the Thirsty part John 4:14 but whosoever drink the water that I shall give him exactly shall never thirst right amen but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life right can you see the Paradox the Paradox is this there is a hunger and a thirst but God seeing that hunger and thirst that's within you he provides and sees you as if you are already filled right right amen Jesus stood there in a midst of a green field one day and he said look around you behold the fields are white Under Harvest and the laborers are few right he was standing there in the middle of a green Wheat Field telling him that the Harvest was already right the fields are white Under The Harvest because he wasn't looking at the current condition he was looking at the end result of that that's right and that's the Paradox of this you will never thirst you will never be hungry because I see you as a filled and satisfied and you I promise you brothers and sisters you cannot come to the any Services you cannot come to your Sunday and your Wednesdays with a desire to be fed that God will let you walk away this that's right in spite of the man that's bringing the word in spite of our failures in spite of our human Tendencies if you have a hungering and a thirsting God will see you is already because that's the Paradox of the word oh I love that I love it that's what this word came to do what did Brother R say as she nears him when he picked up his pen wrot what did he say as she nears him she becomes so much like him she is in his very image amen he sees her from a far off he sees her as she is approaching but as she nears him she becomes in his likeness and in his oh what is it's just the drawing power of the word that's all it is brothers and sisters that's right brother amen hungry hungry that's all we're talking about tonight hungry are you hungry and thirsty for the things of God you don't have to go home short Chang that guy said we we need to always be searching for something oh my goodness I may as well be a real Evangelistic and just stop and talk about those that are always searching for something always wanting they're the give me more people yeah you ever have those around in your church you got to give me more yeah well well brother I'm giving you all the words that the Lord's showing me but you got to give me more because I was on the internet the other day and I was looking at what that guy was preaching he seemed to have more than you did oh my have you been there yeah with that old mind let me know y'all been there yes I want you to give me more I want you I want you to do it like he does it yeah I want you to I want you to say things like he says them and they're always striving and searching that's not a hunger that's a lust yeah you know there's a difference in a hunger and a lust that's right if you're hungry you can be filled right but you know what a lust is Jesus said lust not after the things of this world what is a lust it's no matter how much of it you get you cannot be satisfied that's what lust is it's just always striving and that and we find that inside of this message so many times there's always those give me more you ain't got enough at your church we got to go out and find a perfect Church yeah yeah amen how many how many found one of those along the way a perfect church I want a perfect Church yeah it would be perfect for a few days yeah sure till something said that crosses you and all ain't perfect no more right Perfection you know Perfection is a paradox as well we can show up here in all of our our our failures and all of our our our disappointments and all the things that are wrong with us and God can look at us and say be therefore perfect the Perfection is in the Commandment to be perfect it's not in us going out and getting perfect you want a perfect church just show up right exactly because the Perfection comes from the word man we done been trying to be perfect a long time what brother brand statue of a perfect man don't be putting the peacock feathers and a crow it ain't going to work right it's not going to work right amen exactly oh my goodness but the the filling is in the hungering the the answer to the hunger it's found in that word right you cannot come before this word you can't open your Bible at home saying Lord I'm just going through a struggle today I just need something and I know we we play you know the Ouija board game sometime we just flip and that's that's okay I'm not going to you know if that helps you right I don't mind going on the screen and getting the quote of the day out of Jeffersonville I enjoy that right it's better than getting the recap of last night soap hoer I want you to know that well I wake up every morning I see what happened on on One Life to Live yesterday well get the quote of the day instead you will come out farther I you know that how many you can do that you can open up your browser click on the voice of God Recordings and there's a quote there every morning for you am even if it's a random draw you don't know how many times I'll hear Brother Rand just in those few minutes and it can change your whole day right yeah right you can wake up on the wrong side of the bed and you can turn around which just it's better on a quote of the day than a football score of yesterday right even though I like football scores now you know okay just go confession supposed to be good for the soul I live close to Denver I can't help it I lived in Florida all those years TBO he's right he's in every every thought of every person in America right now the politicians are wanting to be like T are y'all tired of it I'm not if y'all are I won't say no more about even my little grandson he's 2 years old he'll go around the house saying tboo T indoctrinated the world is saturated and you know I'm I'm not going to weigh in on whether you know the man's he's just you know ain't many folks will stand up and say anything about God in so if he wants to take a few minutes and do that and of course the blasphemers come out in force and they try to oh my but if Denver makes it to the Super Bowl y'all can just count on me being happy over there in wi talk cuz that would be all right too the hopes better low that would be certainly a miracle in the making but you know I don't know I've been in church so long I know you even mention stuff like that and people just run home man guy talked about football tonight guy guy was up there talking about TBO and you know I just don't know how legalistic y'all are y'all don't know how legalistic I am you know right I mean I was glad I got here and there was no Christmas tree in the house so I was glad for that he was talking about Christmas when he came out our place you know that oh you got it down before I got here see how many more got confession we got four hours we all right all right you got me on the football you got him on the Christmas tree see I'm just not much of a legalist I'm not one of those guys that can't go visit my relatives because a Christmas tree might get me you know yeah well I'd go see my family at Christmas they got a tree and that tree just might get come on if you don't want to have one praise the Lord for that if you do want to read the quote where brother Randon went and cut one down with his kitties praise the Lord for that right just read them all right you know what I didn't wiah back at the first few days of December I printed out all of brother bram's Christmas messages all the titles it was like 17 18 of them through his ministry that we have on tape of the Christmas message and I just handed them out to the people I said here are all of brother Brandon's what he considered to be Christmas messages if you want to know whether you should have a tree whether you should give a present whether you want to believe in Santa Claus or not don't ask me yeah there's 17 or 18 messages here that he declared to be subjects about Christmas you hear them all and whatever God leads you to believe about that and do about that I said I hope you all you hear them all and you decide you all want to give me gift I said that's fine because when I read them that's all I could get out of it is everybody ought to bring me a present but they didn't do that either so so either they didn't go home and listen or something or or they didn't send it through the same filter I did but man we've lived through legalism right we've lived through too much grace too much legalism too much grace you ain't going to make everybody happy you know the thing about a legalist is he can't take much grace you know you know that you ever get around a real true legalist see any Grace shows up I don't know why I said that why I said that a man under grace he can stand a little bit of legal as usual not much but a little bit right because then he'll find out how much grace he's really under that's right brother oh Lord help us right let's get back to our text hungry that's all brother Bram said hungry are you are you hungry three miles ahead hungry three miles ahead that's that's that's the billboard that's all it says it's just drawing attention to the fact that the hunger the hunger is there he talks about Steven and Paul as he went on down through this message let your light so shine before men he he talks about Steven very much in this in this text he was God's advertisement board right this is what I was thinking about going into the New Year let us be an advertisement board let when they stoned him to death they throw him outside the city this is paragraph 50 in that same message or e50 is the little paragraph number when they stoned him to death throw him outside the city beat him to death with stones when he was dying he raised his head to Heaven asked forgiveness for those who are Stone the same as Jesus did at the cross then God seen his little advertisement board being taken down Steven looked up to heaven he said behold I see Heavens open see Jesus standing at the right hand of go he fell asleep in the arms of God he was a advertisement board for a hungry world Amen you say well how many was there you said there was maybe 5,000 how many of them got saved see brother R's playing the part of the critic now he says you say well how many was there you said there was maybe 5,000 how many of them got saved there was [Applause] one 5,000 people watching the advertisement of God's word adverti right 5,000 people saw the billboard and there was one that got saved oh we ought to Rejoice about that aren't you that's why I know Lula ain't very big but I live in the middle of Witchita 450,000 people we got a group of 60 or 80 Believers there yeah but there was one he never accepted it right then but years later amen if you went away from that meeting you'd ask how many got saved in that meeting we'd say none right but brother said there was one he didn't know it yet cuz he went on out there destroying some more Christians he says see now no matter how much I could reflect it here unless it reflects on you too will never understand the gospel would be of none effect unless somebody was there to take it there'll be many who won't take it but the ones who will take it it'll reflect in them there's maybe 5,000 that morning at the execution of Steven but there was one one it reflected in even at the end of his life he says I'm not even worthy to be called one of the Saints because I've persecuted the Church of God to death give consent to the stoning of that martyr it never did get away from Paul he said I persecuted the church even to death see it never got away from him right because he seen Christ reflected I asked brother brother Wade when he was showing me in the church here today these pictures on the platform here they've seen that reflection he he was explaining to me y'all pray for these people the word goes across these it's across these people's lives somewhere it'll never get away from them there is truth to train up a child in the way he's going and when he when he's old he won't depart this is what he's saying about Paul it never got away from him when he seen that how did Steven do it he never performed any Miracles although he know that Christ was a miracle performer he knowed all these powers and things but what did he do he just presented his life in such a way that they seemed that it was the power of Christ Glory he just lived he didn't do a lot of Miracles didn't do a lot of supernal a lot of signs and wonders right and oh brother br's going to let a lot of us off the hook right here you ready for this next quote you may never see a vision right oh man we all want to see Visions don't we right you may never see a vision you may never put your hands on the sick person and feel the charge of almighty God make a skeleton of a man turned back to life again y brother R letting us down easy ain't he you may never see him standing over Yonder in three or four rainbows you may never see his image you may never hear his voice but still you can be a signboard and manifest Jesus Christ by A Life That's so pure unadulterated from the world not worrying about the dirty things around your life but a pure thing because God is in your heart to hunger and thir thirst to be like him you may never do any of those things you know there is one quote where brother says God may never answer another prayer for you for the rest of your days and you can still be a child of God hard to imagine that isn't it right we look back at how many he's answered for us through all the years and brother no he may never answer another one and it does not have any bearing on your election and your salvation and your walk with him how many of you want to go through 2012 knowing that God may never answer another prayer for me how many still going to believe him then how many still going to hold on to this word now we've got the word of a prophet it has nothing to do with your election you may never hear his voice you may never see the rainbows you may never pray for a man and he'll get well again but you are still his I am his and he is mine and His Banner Over In Me Is Love why was it always that what God is doing for us was some kind of an indication of who we are right what if God does nothing for you the rest of your day what if you have prayers and needs and things that you want right and it never happens you still going to be coming to church well it might be a little harder but we're going to try am sure we're all going to be honest and admit that we believe the Lord will help us am but it's not a bearing on our Rel amen that's right I like the way brother you may never do any of these things right down in paragraph 56 Paul was successfully in having Steven Stone but all through his life until he surrendered to Christ he he was never able to get away from that message something got a hold of him it wasn't the messenger it was the message he had righten if there is a prayer in your heart brothers and sisters about this end time message I know we print them off on the computer now and we used to bring up all the books but if there is something that you need to be sure of in your heart it is that it wasn't the messenger it was the message that's right there's a lot of people that are hung up on the messenger they follow the message because of the messenger right it wasn't the messenger that Paul saw it was the message that he had amen that's right in another message called that was in the message the oncoming storm the one I just read in a message called I know brother random said this that how that talking about Paul the Apostle that that great Apostle who had been through his time of trouble when he witnessed the death of Steven he seen his little face look up towards heaven the Rocks was beating him in the face and he looked up and he said I see the heavens open I see Jesus standing on the right hand Glory he said Lord lay not this send to their charge and Paul holding the coats that had put him for weeks and weeks on the ash he walking back and forth till his mind had been polluted until he was down on his road to Damascus to try to fight a way out like a man going to a whiskey bottle to try to drown his sorrow that's the shape it put Paul in right I never knew that's what was happening on his road down to Damascus brother BR said he was on his road down to Damascus to try to find a way out of that pressure that was in his mind like a man go into a whiskey bottle to try to drown out his sorrow that's what Paul was going to do down there in Damascus trying to get away from what he had done but he couldn't get away from it because it wasn't the messenger right Steven's corpse was dead and rot by then and Paul was still carrying the way of that because why there was an advertisement there was an advertisement that he put forth thank you I have asked the Lord daily as I've looked at this text and thought about bringing it to you I want 2012 yeah I want it to be different for me I don't want to go out and make it different I just want him to make it different because if I go out and make it different I'm going to mess it up right amen oh man I I can try to be as spiritual as I want I mean I can hold my Bible just right more often come on y'all been there y'all been in church you church folks know what I'm talking about you message folks know I can say good evening friends just as nicely as I can I can wear bigger Bell buckles and bolo TI all I want right that's trying to make it different right I want 2012 my life to be different I want it to be an advertisement board just like Stevens was that it'll make that hunger it'll drive a man back to that word it'll it'll Quicken something in him that just by seeing that life thank the Lord in a message called godhead explained you know this message well in Chicago brother br's there talking to those preachers he said I've always thought about the death of Steven it must have got on to Paul because when he seen the Glorious look on Steven's face and the clouds was beating him to death he said I see see Jesus stand at the right hand of God he says you know you can kill a messenger but you can never kill his messenger if it's real right I like read that quote again you can kill a messenger but you can never kill his message if it's real there's some messages that are going to die and why because they're not real but if it's real amen it'll live and the message though Steven was gone on to stand with Jesus yet his message lingered on because Paul kept talking about it right that's what it's stuck to him that's what brother is trying to say in Abraham's Covenant in Middletown Ohio some he said what's the matter with me anyhow I'm only telling you the truth someday you'll catch it someday you'll know that I've told you the truth my voice may be silent you might be able to silence the body that's speaking but you'll never silence that voice that's right it comes from God they Stone Steven but they couldn't stop his message it'll move on right them tapes will be played after I'm gone for years them tapes will be played After I'm Gone oh Lord let it be so amen here's a couple of more quotes for you do you mind quotes I love I love the quotes I like the way brother Rand says things yes sir we this isn't let your light so shine back to that other message paragraph 45 we should be in such a condition that would cause all the world to want to be like us right because men would go down the street and say there's a man I might disagree with him on his religious Doctrine but I tell you one that is a genuine Christian we don't like those quotes because why doctrine's everything anymore doctr well he don't believe the doctrine like I do brother R say I would rather be even if I don't agree in Doctrine let him at least know I'm a Christian let him at least believe in me enough to say I don't agree with what that man is looking at but at least I believe he is a genu one Christian ought to be women going down the streets say she may look oldfashioned she may not be like the rest of the women you see but there's one Christian in this town and there she goes because we are sponsored by Jesus Christen oh what kind of a person should we be if we are his Billboards and we're sponsored by him then in Christ is the one where we get our life we get our strength we get all that we have comes from Christ he is our sponsor he is the one wrote on this billboard right the brother said in paragraph 47 the thing that we want to do is to preach a gospel that appe appeals to a hungry World y he said how can you appeal to a hungry world that won't even see where they' come from or who they are or where they're going unless you preach a gospel that raises Christ up in a living atmosphere right here around us now amen we cannot do it there's no way which we could join the Masons or the Oddfellows or any other Lodge joining some Lodge would be just as well but we're to preach a gospel that's appealing to Hungry people that'll catch those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness be a billboard that's what brother randam is telling us that's right and let your light so shine before men paragraph 51 he said we don't have to have big audiences that's a hard one isn't it we don't have to have big audiences our church can be small right we don't have to preach the 10,000 we don't even have to preach yeah right that's what he said it's right there we don't have to even preach we can be God's advertisement board Y how do you know look at this question how do you know that your life might not start some young man on the gospel some of you older men you old women start them young men on the field out there to win 10,000 souls to Christ how do you know how do you know we don't know it was because that he saw Christ in you it's you presented Christ to him in the simple power of the Gospel right the only way we see Christ is when he reflects in each other I see Christ in you you see him in me that's how we watch Christ amen I come to the meeting oh now he's going to get out to personal now I come to the meeting I start I start preaching I watch the people you can see whether they're interested or not in just a few minutes right now it wasn't no no prophetic gift that was able that's right amen I have to say I'm not a real spiritual person yeah but I can tell in a few minutes whether you're interested or not you ain't got to be a prophet for that no you're back there fou in your nails then I know you're just not very interested you right come on you know again brother R tells us some things that we already know I can tell right you can see whether they're interested or not in just a few minutes you look all over the audience you can tell who you're boring y'all didn't know I could tell that could you all right all of you that know that I can tell that you're bored that you think I'm boring go on and raise your hand yeah one guy back there he you thank you for that brother your honesty is appreciated I don't want to be boring but it happens sometimes you can tell who you're boring or whether you're not see and the first thing you know you see them standing there hanging on to every word under expectation right see there's the boring crowd and there's those who want I'm seeing Christ reflected in that person because he's hungering and thirsting for God and then me preaching the gospel he sees Christ reflecting in me I see Christ reflecting in him that means Christ is in our midst hungering and thirsting I watch the audience how they take it say something another watch what effect it takes on them watch their face light up full of joy they're ready right then to receive something that's Christ amen I see Christ reflecting in that person because the gospel the simple gospel of Christ is taking a hold in that heart because they're hungering and thirsty because they're hungering and thirsty it's my 4 Hour hours up yet man I don't know where I'm [Music] at I prepared a lot I I I know I didn't I don't run around a lot I will if y'all all get to looking boring then I know I got to run I can tell I already read that quote for you I can tell if one or two of you is boring then I just know I'm just boring but if all of you are bored then I know I'm really boring I want to get to something I hope you'll enjoy this little thought here brother R still working on this same text hungering sign board this is in paragraph 56 of that same message reflecting he says now also we don't want to do this he's already told us we need to be reflecting the word we need to be reflecting Christ in our life but he says also we don't want to do this we don't want to make a quick sale out of it right right now see he's already given us the plus side now he's going to drop over here and this you got it up there on the screen said we want to make a quick sale out of it just say well I got converted last night Hallelujah the whole world you can't do that how many you been in church long enough to see that happen God barely gets his feet wet gets s and he wants to be the pastor you ever been there and done that that's what brother R's calling a quick sale right he says we don't want to have a quick sale right just say well I got converted you know why is it people who get converted and want to be playing the piano next week yeah yeah they just came in yeah but we see that a lot in the message they get inspired they get worked up and I got converted last night Hallelujah the whole world you can't do that that's a quick sale if we do that the product's not much good right if he just lives good say now I know one time I lived good for two weeks after I was converted I live two weeks such a perfect life yeah that's a quick sale right yeah amen I actually worked for a man one time that was part of our church church and I believe he counted the Wednesday nights that he come in a row oh my because he would say sometimes you know I've been three Wednesday nights in a row oh my so I'm like big whoopy dooo I've been four Sundays in a row now who's counting yeah you need to be there for all of them right the number needs to be so large you would be counting the few times you have to miss not the times you get there this is what brother brand is saying that's right not a quick sale he said I've lived two weeks such a perfect life yeah that's a quick sale and look at what he says next this hat a call we just had yeah not a strange thing how many knows what that is right I'm going to talk about hadac call for a minute it's a strange thing brother brandham says this had a call that we just had nothing but a bunch of vitamins wrapped up together right and it didn't last but a little while it finally went up you ought to be an everyday Christian every hour Christian every year Christian not a quick quick sale but let your light so shine if you walk to up to a man and ask him to receive Christ he laugh in your face don't go off and say well there's nothing to it or he would have accepted it he said that's a haac call sale yeah we're not selling haac call we're selling the gospel the power of the Living God Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's a haac call sale right the brother raised his hand who does anybody else remember what haac call was I found out I was too young to know what haac call was amen so I did my research you want to know what for those of you who aren't old amen if you don't know what haac call was you're considered young those who rais their hands are old right because hat a call happened a long time ago but yet in brother Brandon's day he is bringing up this reference to haac call we don't want to have a haac call sale yeah let me tell you what hadac call was those of you listen up who who don't remember this and this is it's got to be right cuz it's straight off the internet okay so it's pretty good research so if you if you want to go check it out just you got to do like I did you got to go on the internet and find but here's what brother Brand's talking about we don't want it to be a haac call sale hadac call was a patent medicine marketed as a vitamin supplement all right this is any of yall did anybody ever buy hat a call you guys remember prob did probably did it was a big thing and you'll see in a minute he says it's principle attraction however was that it contained 12% alcohol right yeah now you figuring out what hadol is it was it was a marketed as a vitamin supplement but it mostly contained 12% alcohol listed on the tonic bottles label as a preservative which made it quite popular in the dry counties of the Southern United States this is I hope this ain't too humorous but it was pretty good yeah which made it quite popular in the dry counties of the Southern United States it was the product of four-term Louisiana state senator Dudley J LeBlanc that's his name Dudley K oh you got it there you go good job back there in the boo but here's the story it I never did by that I it was gone when I came along Amen brother R in that's 1961 he's talking about it I'll give you the history on it it was done by this Senator Dudley J LeBlanc he was not a medical doctor he was not a registered pharmacist but he had a strong talent for self-promotion Time Magazine once described him as a stem winding salesman who KN knows every razzled Dazzle switch in the pitch man's trade he was a Senator and he was marketing this stuff called hadacol the label on the tonics bottle clearly stated that the recommended dosage one tablespoon taken four times a day was to be taken in a half a glass of water after meals and before retiring however some pharmacies in dry counties were known to sell it by the shot glass and at least one bar in New Orleans French B was known to sell a tassel cocktail with pacol as its main ingredient yeah in north book Illinois a suburb Chicago sales of hadacol were limited to liquor stores but leblan flooded the airwaves this is hadacol he flooded the Airways with testimonials to the powers of the seemingly miraculous yet foul tasting brown liquid and he he had a jingle called a hadac call Boogie he turned it into a popular recording yes promotional items including various Flyers signs and clocks there was a Captain hadacol Comic Book t-shirts lipstick an almanac plastic Thimbles printed with a hadacol logo water pistols and cowboy style holsters glasses used for taking the diluted mist and a stamped metal token redeemable for 25 cents towards the purchase of any bottle of hadacol in 19 50 1950 LeBlanc offered a handsome Financial incentive to anyone who could provide him with a parrot that was trained to say poly Le wants had AOL not this guy's a promoter a't the parot was to be exhibited at promotions the offer included the following words the owner of such a bird if selected will be given a reasonable compensation on a contract basis the owner and the parrot will travel in a limousine with the parrot's name engraved in gold on the door and they will stay only at the best hotels the parrot will be furnished a gold cage and its life will be insured the parent will visit large drug stores perform at conventions and may be presented on radio and television now this is 1950 listen at this Statistics in a n in a 15-month period ending in March 1951 leblan sold more than $3,600,000 worth of this tonic that's a lot of money back in 1951 he sold more than $3,600,000 worth of the tonic in another 6 months leblan sold his interest of the leblan corporation which was hadac Call's parent company to investors for 8.2 million we don't want no hadacol sale what were they selling alcohol right and calling it supplements and calling it some kind of an Elixir that was going to fix everything yeah and it was drink it was liquor right and and he sold his his his part of the company for $8.2 million in 1951 but the Enterprise collapsed under the weight of its debtors right it was discovered all too late that LeBlanc was spending more for advertising than he was taking in in receipts and turning his $3.6 million profit into a one .8 million second quarter loss yeah he was advertising right and he was selling it yep but he he he had concealed almost $2 million in unpaid bills $656,000 in ta tax debts and another two million was listed on the ledgers as accounts receivable which was simply cases of tonic out and Consignment I guess the best there's a lot of this but the best testimony came from from Groucho marks you all know who Groucho marks was in 1952 there was an interview that leblan gave to grouo Marx's radio program when Groucho asked him what hadac call was good for you ready for this what was hadac call good for he had Groucho marks ask him what hadac call was good for leblan gave an answer of startling honesty it was good the senator said for 55 million last [Music] year well this product good for about 52 million last year that's what it was good for the name of hadacol has become synonymous with a cure all of any dubious origin right right we don't want know how to call sale we don't want something that's just pumped up and advertised up and singing and dancing and parrots and gold limousines and television ads brother random didn't want it for his message he didn't want the $6 million churches right I know y'all remodeled a lot but I know you hadn't reached 6 million on this place yet so you're still in the message right he talked about building those $6 million Cathedrals right he wasn't interested in the money he wanted his gospel to be presented he wanted to be a signboard for us to follow not with blitz and Glamour and advertising you know what's startling I've got a quote right here in my notes this kind shot me can I read you something you know I'm not going to pick on or robers because he's he's dead and gone now did it bother brother brandom that he didn't have the following or Roberts did no he knew his message was different from that but but yeah here's a very honest confession this is in Saskatoon in a message called Stand still he said I was in a meeting not long ago at the cad Tabernacle I preached for five nights now Cale Tabernacle is in Indianapolis y'all know where e Howard Cale talked about him a lot I preached for Five Nights with the place packed out and my love offering was about $1,000 now this is 1957 he's telling this okay follow me along I believe brother Roberts the night that he come he said I want from the middle of this this side 60 men to stand and say tonight they'll pledge me $1,000 60,000 just on half a side of the same crowd that I had right that's all right he needs it he must have it to carry on exactly what's brother R saying we don't want to know how to call sale we're not I preached five nights and my offering was $11,000 right right he said another man came in and the same crowd yeah the same crowd that I had he on the first night asked 60 men to pledge him $60,000 well don't you reckon the other half got under the inspiration of that probably gave him another 60 right right but brother R him didn't he said he said I know he said the Lord just know that I didn't have that much sense I'm not intelligent enough for that my mean I don't I don't have to have very much my expenses run me I think I counted about G what was it $100 a day from my office in my hke yeah he says well that's quite a different well I guess that's quite a different right $100 a day versus 60,000 on the first night from the same crowd in the same par exactly come on brothers and sisters his gospel was not out there to sell like that that's why those women could hand him those million dooll checks and he could walk away from it the vineyard man out there in California could hand him those $1.5 million checks and he could say I don't want it right he wasn't selling the gospel he was he was a sideboard for the gospel that's why when we hear these messages we we we look at these charlott on TV and we look at all these the Jimmy swaggers of the world we have a we have a full old time radio station in witch nothing but Jimmy Swagger all day long oh my it's a I passed by because I like the hecko every once in a while and so I do I stop by they he I heard him the other day on the radio telling the people three days a month now of every month they have to dedicate it to what they call um the the the the Gathering in selling the Bibles and getting the money out and he was speaking to his own shame he said it 3 days a month to put this thing to make this machine run I have to have these sherons or whatever they call them and they're selling Bibles and and and they got Donnie the son on there he's reading $300 on a credit card from from somewhere in Oklahoma and and oh man they give a big whoop if you get up to a thousand oh yeah $1,000 on credit card they always want you to know you can put it on your credit card yeah y y'all don't have those machines here do you for TI off just I didn't want to get on a bad so that's the way Jimmy Swagger does it on credit card they'll let you know every time on credit card cuz they know they're talking to people that are hurting right right I know you're hurting but if you got $27 left on available balance on your credit card call in and give it to me we don't want that kind of a sale I appreciate a church that wants to run on what God provides and take care of its Ministry and take care of the needs of the church and you ain't got to be on money every week right you ain't got to remind people if you don't know by now you ought to be paying your TI and offering there's something wrong with this picture you're robbing God if you're not paying your TI and offering we don't need to rehearse that that's right I mean if you're brand new and we got to run it by you that's okay but but brothers and sisters it's it's gone to that but this is what brother Brandon is saying we don't want that kind of a gospel we don't want it right right he said I I I guess God just couldn't trust me with that much money right I just didn't have enough sense to use it you you're not going to tell me he didn't hurt his feelings a little bit to think that the same crowd that heard the true gospel thought it was worth about a grand over five nights and or Roberts that had really not a whole lot to say compared to what brother brandham had to offer right could raise 60,000 one I you know what the difference was he asked for it he asked 60 people 60 men on this side and they do it Jimmy Swagger will get on the radio God has shown me there's going to be a th000 men give $1,000 well if that's true you don't need to tell nobody you know what you know exactly and they'll tell you on day two of the shareon we've only got 217 of those thousand but I know they're coming because God said they were going to do it well then you don't even need to advertise it right if God told you it was going to happen then just let it happen right exactly had to call sales that this this you know I read something Billy Graham said in his magazine that's sitting in the doctor's office here a little while back and I picked up one of Billy Graham's magazines and he was talking about the state of Christianity in America he said you know Christianity is 3,000 miles wide meaning that it's covered the whole whole nation of of America but he said it's only 3 in deep and I thought a never a truer statement that he made 3,000 Mi wide and 3 Ines deep it hasn't permeated the crust right of humanity yet it's spread out they bought it they've sold it they've promoted it they've advertised it they put it on the radio they put it on the TV they they propagated it and it's 3,000 Mi wide but it ain't breaking the crust it's hardly getting down to where the real nutrients flow The Roots aren't going very deep right right what did Brother Brandon say I I I got the quotes here he was talking about about about the the need of the believer he says the whole purpose is just to S suck in more more water than you really need to live on let me read you that you got a second we got a lot of time I know else y'all going to be singing a long time let me read you this me read you this I got it here hang on bear with me why you know when I try to prepare for this much of a meeting I just I just do too many quotes you doing too many quotes bear with me just bear with me I know you know this quote anyway he said you take a little tree this is an expectations in Jon B Arkansas right you take a little tree you stick it in the ground and you plant it it's got to grow it has to draw the moisture from the ground right it has to draw more than what its allotted portion is y you have to give it plenty of water you just have to give it water it drinks and drinks and drinks till it can't hardly drink no more and then it just starts pushing out and it pushes out limbs it pushes out leaves it pushes out blossoms pushes out apples the apples was on the inside of it at the beginning and it just has to drink and every man that's born again in Christ everything you have need of your healing Satan will afflict you sure he will but everything you have need of in the whole life's journey is in you right then right right and we are planted in Christ Jesus when you're born again the baptism of the Holy Spirit has come into your heart you have everything that have need of for the journey the only thing you have to do is start drinking drinking pushing out drinking and pushing out I believe he hears my analysis of Christ Jesus he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and every man that's planted in him can drink and drink and push out and to every Redemptive blessing that God has promised belongs to you and it's your personal property the devil hasn't got any tatto it at all he hasn't got any legal rights his legal rights was spoiled calary amen right in Denim Springs Louisiana talking about the same thing sir we would see Jesus just like your trees out here if was an apple tree you ever think of that it's not one inch high but every Apple that'll ever be in the tree is in it right there that's right 1000 bushels if there's that many say 500 bushels of Apple come off a tree all 500 bushels of apples was in it when it's planted if it isn't where did they come from see you just planted it just has to draw in water draw it in from the earth it just has to draw till it gets so much more than its portion and then it pushes out limbs pushes out leaves pushes out blossoms pushes out apples pushes them out don't bring them in push them out right so then I think Christ is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life Glory oh my we are planted in him all we do is drink from the fountain push out everything that we have need of in this amen all the things that we have need of is in him we are planted in him and draw from him and he is the inexhaustable Fountain of Life that's right ain't that wonderful same thing in God in his word Oakland California you take a little tree you plant it there's only one thing you have to do to that tree and that's water it it's got to drink it's got to drink more than its portion right it's got to drink till it swells out it pushes out leaves pushes out branches pushes out oranges it's just got to drink drink drink drink and push out right what have we got to do drink and push drink and push drink and push I believe that's what the church the Christians got to do is just sit down by Jesus Christ and his word I believe that he is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life that man can be planted in him and drink and push and drink and push till every Divine promise in the Bible will be made manifest oh don't you believe that do you believe that tonight that's all you got to do is drink and push it's too easy if it was harder we would enjoy it more but it's too easy feed and Grow Feed and grow what does a lamb have to to do eat he eats and he grows the calves of the stall what does the Cal in the stall do he eats and he grows right that's what brother R's whole message is telling us it's presented out there to let you know all you have to do is draw from it right amen but oh we're just we're just we're just so tonked up and choked up with things of the world sometimes that we don't want to feed on the good things of the world we'd rather go home and try to find our satisfaction out of some kind of a soap oper or some kind of a an entertainment of the world right the truth of it is all God wants us to do is sit down by the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and drink and feed and let it push out and drink and push and drink and push and amen I found this little quote just yesterday or or this morning looking at my notes the very first message brother man preach faith is a substance he says the day that we're living in is such a day of unsettled peace and unsettled rest everywhere this is 1947 first first recorded message we got people are running to and fr seeking whatever they may see most anybody can get a following yeah and that the truth today you think it was true in 1947 exactly most anybody can get a following right you look around at the people that have a following yeah I watch them I I listen to what they have to say and I just rehearse brother Bron's quote in my mind most anybody can get a following right right if it was true in 1947 it's really true today I watch churches I I on the internet I watch pastors up there what they call preaching to their people and I'm just sitting there thinking what brother R said most anybody can get a following people that true seed of God deserve better than that and they will come to the world yes sir but most anybody can get a following no matter what they teach or thinks somebody will listen to them right right amen if it was true in 1947 it's really true today I heard I read a little thing the other day guy was saying that if a if a memo blows off of the 27th floor of of a high-rise building in California it's got 15 converts by the time it hits the ground they have statistically proven that after 27 floors of freef fall it'll have 15 convers before it gets the area that's what brother brandom is saying most anybody can get a following and it's the day that the prophet spoke of people when they're hungry they'll eat from anywhere if children and people are starving they'll eat from a garbage can they once eat from a nice table but if they are hungry they'll eat somewhere so I think real true minister of the Gospel ought to be up and going ought to be giving the people the right things meet in due season amen that's what the that's what the real true Ministers of the Gospel ought to be up and going giving the people what right spiritual food and you see right spiritual food and SE I see so much in this message that is just just just a history like and just a a rehearsing of of brother Brand's lifestyle and what he did and all of those things are good but you must remember brothers and sisters we are following the message not the mess there are people that that you know what as it's been know you've heard it said so many times what if Rebecca had fallen in fallen in love with the messenger instead of the one she was going to meet yeah right she didn't fall in love with elazer he was just the one bringing the message right right it was the messenger he was the messenger he he came declaring the news that Isaac is on his way right Amen brother Bram never wanted those things to happen that's right hungry in Luke 11 quickly if you want to turn there a couple of verses of scripture that you can think on in the in the days ahead as you look back on this service and think of some of the things we were looking at in Luke 11 Jesus asked the question verse 11 if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is the father will he give him a stone if he ask for a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent if he asks for an egg will he offer him a scorpion if you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him hungering and thirsting if you know how to ask if you ask for these things amen and you being carnal if you ask for bread your father's not going to give you a stone if you for fish you won't get a Ser if you want an egg before you ask before you even ask Matthew 68 your father knoweth what things you have need of exactly before you ask right brother random had to work on us a little bit about our prayer lives about how we should pray right about the vain repetitions that we go through and and brothers and sisters I don't I don't even have time to begin to approach it but all of us preachers like to preach about prayer life and you know why because us included we don't do enough of it right amen it's not to preach about your prayer life so that we can make you feel miserable because it's so miserable but it's because ours is all so so miserable right it's because we want to pray more but the busyness of Life sits in the things of Life the time that's right but brothers and sisters he knows what we you know I I've tried to alter the way I approach the word here in the end time if I can believe that scripture that says he already knows what we have need of before we ask right then what's all the asking about right I hear people pray and they rehearse the whole week before the Lord well Lord do you know that that that that sister Sally said that about me well he knew that already don't need to tell the Lord about that and you know that brother brother Carl you know what he said about me this week and and and you know lord well yes he knows all of that and he knows your need before you even ask that's right and he will provide the Brothers the the the the the days of that's what I say about Jimmy Swagger and all of his fundraising and whoever it may be I'm not picking on him you may be a Jimmy Swagger fan I hope not but you may be right if you are I'd like to speak with you after the meeting downstairs amen while we share a hot dog I would like to talk to you about that I hope you're not but all the fundraising all the asking all the begging right all the Bible selling all the Expositor Study Bible that he can pump out is to build a false Kingdom right right on a false word the Lord knows what we need if if if if the need of a true son and isn't it wonderful in our lives as we look back through 2011 and all the things that God did for us can't you remember the Most Blessed times was when God did things for us to take care of a need before we KN knew even the need was there is that amazing have you had those experiences where all of a sudden something happens and then you realize tomorrow why that happened it was because I was going to need this the answer was already provided and then the need showed up amen your jobs brothers and sisters it's not to just make you go out and toil and labor right it's to provide for a need that'll be out there ahead you get a little windfall something good happen in your business in your job somebody gives you an extra 20 bucks just out of the blue you may need that tomorrow right I like something brother Perry green said one time you know brother Bram tried to give him a piece of money brother green said I I heard him tell this story he said I don't want it brother Bram and no I want you to have this brother green was like no brother brand he drove him somewhere or something and he said no I don't want this money and again he tried to give it to him brother green finally gave up and he said brother brand if you're telling me that I'm going to need this money tomorrow then I'm going to take it but he said I don't want to just take it for the sake of taking it but if you're telling me that I need to take this money right and sure enough it turned out that way there was a need that showed up and it was provided right I believe that's the kind of Lord that we're serving we'll be like trees planted by the rivers of the Water of Life Jesus knows how to feed us brothers and sisters whatever whatever struggles this church will go through in 2012 I don't I don't guess y'all have any we have a couple at home you know they show up every once in a while Church struggles y sure well you don't mean our church I mean every church I mean every Church what happens why do you think brother Bram need to warn us about a man will come in among you and he'll sit among you for a long time he'll be real nice and love and everything's going good and all of a sudden y he'll begin to move around things go bad and we throw up our hands and say it must not be a good church no it's we've already been told that's going to happen right but God will take care of that right amen he's kept you this far the work that has been started in you he will perform it right until the end and that's the consolation we have in going into 2012 he will take care of God knows how to feed his children we sing a little song There Lord feed your children as we stand here willing to Feast from the table of life right don't you feel that way tonight Lord we are willing to feed just let that hunger stay there don't let me ever get S I know we sing I am satisfied satisfied with Jesus and that and that's also a paradox being satisfied with Jesus doesn't leave you sitting at home on Sunday on your couch I don't need to go down to church because I am satisfied I'm satisfied with Jesus yeah well you're miserably satisfied if that be the case because you're not following what the word says it will be your cond the word brother brand said if you're a real Christian you can't wait for the doors to open there's something in you that draws you down there exactly I'm afraid too many people are satisfied they're just they're just happy with what they got right amen Lord let that hungry there's so much word about this so many scriptures we could look at Jesus knows how to feed his own right right let's let's close I I won't take much longer I do want to go to one more area because I won't have time to do this tomorrow but in John chapter 6 if you'll turn over there I know you got a little time still to feel I'd like to go over this just quickly with you few more quotes few more vers vers and we this is real familiar I want to just talk a couple of minutes about the feeding of the 5,000 people you know I believe the Lord knows how to feed us and believe knows believe he knows how to take care of the need after these things Jesus Went Over the Sea of Galilee which is the Sea of tab a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased he went up into the mountain sat with his disciples the Passover a feast of the Jews was n when Jesus lifted up his eyes he saw great company he said unto them Phillip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do Philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient that every one of them may take a little one of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother said there's a lad here which got five barley loaves two small fishes but what they among so many and Jesus said make the men sit down there was much grass in the place the men sat down in number about 5,000 Jesus Took the Loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples the Disciples of them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would and when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain and nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained above over and above unto them that had eaten those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the world and we know later on Jesus said you follow me just simply because I fed you your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and they're dead right but what a miracle it was 5,000 men sitting on the grass by companies one one of those gospels call you know you you you Pentecostal people know that if there was 5,000 men how many women and children were there exactly thousands thousand fed them all with Five Loaves and two fishes and and I just love some of I just want to read you a couple of quotes what brother R said about that and I hope it gives you some courage amen he was talking about a paradox here's your Paradox it was a it was a paradox when a carpenter Son by the name of Jesus Took up five biscuits two fish and he fed 5,000 people if it isn't I want to see somebody do it today I want you to EXP explain to me right what kind of an adom he let loose you know how often he said that that's a common expression yes sir that's brother BR what did he do not only the fish but the fish was growed the fish was scaled the fish was clean the fish was cooked the fish was whatever it was the bread was planted and grow Y and notice this part and all of it bypassed God turned it from cook fish to cook fish he just growed it out and broke it off and he growed it out and he broke it off and he growed it out until he fed 5,000 amen what does that routine mean break it off grow it out break it off grow it out feed grow it out that means he is the same yesterday today that's right he is the same God that was he is still the bread of life to any man that's hungering and thirsting you can't exhaust his goodness what does that routine mean break it off grow it out he's the same yesterday forever amen in a message call calling Jesus on the scene he said it might have been young John that said you know what I'll tell you what made it real to me was that day when he broke the bread we was all hungry we had went out into the Wilderness we couldn't find him and there we met him all the multitudes come around the first thing you know we find him saying send them into the city to get some food and then he told us to feed him and he got five biscuits and two little fish and he broke that bread and I noticed his hand when he would reach back for another piece of bread that that biscuit was growed out again and then when he reached back and put it out in the plate and then he reached back that fish was growed out again right not only a regular fish but a cook fish already growed back again what kind of an adom did he turn loose BR cook fish cook bread and bypass the growing right I'd like another place I'd like to ask a scientist or whatever school what kind of an atom did he turn loose not wheat but wheat was growed and milled and shortened and baked and ready to eat what did he do and when he broke those fishes they were SED and born and raised and scaled and cleaned and fried and there was a second when he reached for it he took them five biscuits hey man oh brothers and sisters I want to ask this this is in Grand Prairie Alberta it is I want to ask this congregation what kind of anatom did he turn loose right he took those little biscuits and he broke five of those bed 5,000 people not growed wheat sure he bypassed this is what brother Rand keeps talking about he bypassed right bypassed bypassed all the regular routines of nature y was bypassed right he bypassed everything that he talked about turning the water into the wine in one place he says that water would have eventually become wine if it had went down into the ground and growed up into the grape and it came through the grape and it got mashed out it could have become wine but he bypassed it right he bypassed the regular routine he didn't he didn't need in this Resurrection brother you know what's going to happen he's going to bypass that regular routine right amen the trouble within this message we've got regular routines for everything right come on we got reg we're just people of sameness right you don't think that's true take somebody's seat that's been sitting there for 20 years come on you say I don't believe that brother Tom just go on a man has been in that chair for 20 years you go in and get his seat on Sunday you'll find out if we're not got regular routines or not right I've seen fist fights nearly broke out at least star Downs you know yeah right you ever see a man that his seat got took after sitting there for 20 years he'll stand around and Mill around he'll go sit in one place and he'll go sit in another one just letting the man that's in his seat know he ain't comfortable nowhere but there yeah come on regular routines I'm the worst I hate change I have wore the same color of socks for 30 something years since before I married my wife I wear the same kind of shoes I only have one kind of shoes I wear to church and I wore the same ones if floram ever quits making them I'm lost I don't know what I'm going to do but I'm still going by you want to see what I wear he's going to throw his at me for 30 something years this is all I wear any of yall do that y'all are real Christians if y'all wear this kind of go down to JC Pennies you can still get them here you go yeah see praise the Lord there a real man another one on the right that's all get on my hand now my wife will say why don't you go looking for some shoes why I like these I like these I just go get the same thing every time right I wear black fuzzy socks we'll just find out what else y'all wear black I won't take them off but black fuzzy sock it's a routine I'm in right I don't want blue and black in the drawer because you I got to stand there and examine come on man right you know what I'm talking about we we're people of routines it gets that way with church sometime but in 2012 maybe we need to bust out of the routine yes sir if church has gotten stale go find another seat maybe it'll sound better from the left instead of the right mix it up bypassing the regular routine right I I buy the the same everything I don't need to do a lot of shopping right I can tell my wife the size and she's seen the same shoes for 27 years so you don't have to say well these these Allan Edmonds over here look good no they don't look good at all because my foot won't fit in there yeah I don't need to look this is what brother BR is talking it's a routine the same old routine what if God would come along in 2012 getting ready to get us out of here and just break us out of those routines you know what's the trouble with the Baptist Church is everybody's got to get saved the same way oh oh yeah they got to go down the Romans road you know you got to stop here and you got to stop there and you got to stop there we kind of did that with the message we took the stature of a perfect message you got to have some Faith first then you got to have some virtue got to have some knowledge got to have some all of those things are good but how dare a man get a little Temperance before he gets Faith yes because he didn't do it in the right order did he yeah we had a routine this is how it had to be done yeah but brothers and sisters the train is about to leave the station I mean there may not be time that's gory there may not be time for people to go through the same routine that you and I went through right the Lord's took 42 years to get me where I am I can't expect the man to come in now and catch up unless God does something Supernatural for that's right man my 42 years don't give me some kind of seniority because when a man receives this word he's already caught up he bypasses the routine we don't have no Roman's Road for him to walk down righten you know we don't have to have him hear life story first yeah y'all live through that we used to do that a lot give him a t which one you give life story well that's going to make him cry that's going to break him down yeah that may be true why don't you going and just start up at the top give him marriage and divorce give him serpent seed I've seen people come in under that what was your first book serpent seed that's a good start isn't it that's breaking it in gently yeah that's that's taking him down the Romans road that's easing him right on up into it the regular routine the regular routine is not going to work in me and brother brand said this miracle bypassed the regular routine bypassed it it it it went it went beyond what we've known would work y but sometimes even in this message we get in our mind this will work and then this will work and we got to do this and brother you need to do that well how do you know I need well that's the way I did it so that's why I know you got to do it that way but it B pass the regular routine break it off feed it out right break it off feed it out there's one thing I want to point out to you I I promise I'm going to let yall sing I looked through all these quotes where brother Ram talked about that miracle I looked at all the descriptions that he gave of the bread and the fish and you know what I found out is that sometimes brother brandom said that it was talking about that fish he said you and you know before I say this read these to you quickly let me just say this you know on the day of Pentecost if you remember there was all those people there and every man was hearing it in his own language remember that we always said well that was the tongue but it wasn't the tongue it was the hearing and and all those nationalities there was 17 different nationalities sitting there that heard it in their own language and that was the miracle right right when when brother Brenham described this bread and this fish that was broke off from that loaf and from that original one he gave it a lot of different descriptions he called [Music] it he says the fish he took those fishes and he broke them they were not just raised up another fish out of the water but he broke a fish another piece growed on while he was breaking that one a fried fish a fried fish rolled in cornmeal and fried ready to eat yep and he talked about the bread it was baked he says not just wiggling fish cook fish what kind of an adom remember 5,000 people out of the two fish took those spell and broke it off every time he'd break it off another piece would be grow on cooked fish already cooked I like this description fried and crisco that's a that's a good one that my favorite of all he said ready to go what a person I'll break off wheat and go cook it but the not the regular procedure but he could bypass all of that right just break off cooked bread and hand it out with brown crust on it it every time he broke a piece of bread off no sooner than his hand left there was another piece of bread there on and on he he he talks about the fish he said I watched his hands talking about John giving that testimony I was standing near each time I come to the basket I seen him take up a piece of biscuit and break off a chunk of it reach back and break out another piece he was young he says I just can't understand how there was more baked bread if he if if he would have had an oven and baked it he had wheat I might have understood it but he didn't he bypassed procession the regular natural run of raising the wheat and grinding it and milling and sifting it and shortenings and salt and seasoning and he put it in the oven and breaking it don't you see his brother ROM described this fish he said one place it was fried in Crisco in another place he says not only wheat and milk that goes into the bread but it was already growed and baked and ready to serve every time he reached his hand for it there it was it was a new loaf he just broke a part of it off and handed out reach back and there was another Herring already cooked he growed that Herring fattened him up and boiled him right wait a minute just a few minutes ago it was fried fish fried in Crisco rolled in cornmeal and fried and now he's saying he's reached back grabbed that hair and fatten him up and boiled him and baked him and had him ready every time he get a biscuit he'd just say here biscuit grow back at Grand and here you are amen all I'm trying to say to you is brother Rand described that Miracle sometimes the fish was boiled right sometimes it was baked amen sometimes it was fried in Crisco right and my only point to you is this if on the day of Pentecost every man could hear in his own language as those disciples was handing out that fish couldn't a man have fish to his own liking let's make the miracle a little bigger if we can I can hear Andrew walking along bfish got bfish I don't know who would want that but I got B here comes Peter with his basket fried and crisco and every man in the eating it tasted to his own life can you believe because brother brand took so much time describing all these different ways it was fixed in different messages gold baked fried and crisco I believe the miracle was this brothers and sisters if God is going to feed you he's going to feed you with what you like he's going to give you something that is palatable to your taste if you like it boiled you're going to get it boiled if you like it fried you're going to get it fried if you like it baked you're going to get it baked if you like it blacken he didn't use blacken but I'm sure it was blacken right however those people were feeding they were feeding to their own satisfaction amen glory and that's all I've got to say to you about this message this message comes and it feeds you sir amen oh I know I know what you're going to I know you're all thinking with me you're going to the Book of Revelation and John says I ate the book and it was bitter in my belly but it tasted pretty good going on it was sweet in my mouth like honey but it was bitter in my belly why because he brother said he had to go out and live the word now but when God feeds his children he brings you a word that you can go home and you don't have to spit it out the car window on the way home because it tasted good what does the scripture tell us tast and see that the Lord is because why it's a taste it's an acquired taste that's tailor made to you tailor made right if you like it boiled it's going to come across boiled if you like it fried it's going to come fried if you like it baked it's going to come across bre because why God feeds his children right and when he's done he had 12 baskets left exactly you know why there was 12 because there was 12 people going to walk away with those baskets which provided tomorrow's food for him all day long exactly oh brothers and sisters that's our God that's our God that we're serving that's what he did for us in 2011 right oh but we just we just got our taste buds all messed up that's all we need to be praying for is Lord fix our taste buds we want it to be sweet in our mouth I know sometimes you got a little Limestone mixed in there with it yeah you know what brother brandom said he said them Shepherds and sheep would get sick and they needed to get limestone in them so what would they do they'd smear the honey on the rock right and as the Sheep licked the honey he licked off the Limestone too and he got well amen oh there's honey in the RO brother's Honey in the Rock for you God bless you tonight we're going to let our brother who's going to sing who who's going to sing next you going to come take it no I don't want to sing I don't know your songs I'll pick one that you don't know God bless

everywhere Go Tell It on the M that Jesus Christ is [Applause] Bor about 9 Minutes something like that we're going to try to take communion Terence you get another sink brother dick in favor of all of those that didn't get to make it tonight come on and scene I bought I forgot that song I think huh Lord have Mery y'all pray I guess I better get up here about see what Happ I cannot I cannot come to the wedding I me I I I just can't I forget maybe it's best I did to get that i' done it one time a bunch of couple of preachers hadn't been to a fellowship meeting in 3 or 4 months and it goes I a mar marri a wife bought me a cow got Ox to plow goes on like that you know I cannot come I canot come to the wedding we're going to pass on that they're turning it off over Y in India and Africa after that a good song long as you don't get it swapped up you could get it swapped around a little bit and start I bought a wife and Mar the C it would really mess everything up you know put you in the wrong we got about 5 minutes you know so you know I I've always been one of the kind I guess brother Tom wonder why I didn't get up behind him to say a lot I I don't I don't preach I have preachers preach that's that's always been my way I just don't do it uh I'll talk about what to say or something like that but and I've always wanted it to be what they say you know they brought the message and you always tell somebody get up behind you you know and you can say well well that fell didn't agree with me cuz what he said you know and there's ways of sliding your words in to make it all clear up you know and all this that and the other but I just never believed in it because it it doesn't work out to me it's just it's the the wrong approach and things musicians can go ahead and and but I really enjoyed the message and I appreciate it looking forward to tomorrow and and to hear you know because I I I do firmly believe that we do need to hunger and thirst and that thirst inside of us is is a great thing thirsting for this message to hear it you know as our brother was bringing it was a good way too that you know we try to make it around here brother Tom on one basis that uh we try to preach one thing and that's to live Christ let it be life amen let it be what you live the prophet said you can shout all you want to we said when you come down you be better be able to walk straight but if you don't then you Shou is not worth a whole lot we may not put a lot of emphasis into the emotional realm here and and all but we're not dry because we we just sit and listen and you know a loaded wagon doesn't make a lot of r bracket it's an empty wagon that clares and Bs a lot but I just I love the word of the Lord and I I just appreciate God over the years of what he's done for us here that we started here July the 4 1971 and we've been going ever since preaching the gospel and now it's going around the world by way of internet going out to people that can hear man today and Guyana called and he said I want takes all right we'll get them to you as quick as we can CU you know but we just appreciate God for what he's been able to do he's been able to put this message around the world into the hands you may not agree with what this group of people does or what that group of people does or what this group or whatever but if you're trying to get the gospel out Paul said one day he said no matter if Christ is preached by [Music] contention look words arguing he said I Glory you know why because somebody standing by my your Christ where they could have never heard him before or his name mentioned or didn't talk about like he was talking about Paul there he was with Sten that just burdened on Paul's heart and even after he got converted I believe it was a greater burden than it was before yes he wanted to die right he was warned even by the Holy Spirit not to go to Rome now you come you you study that one out that a man went to Rome and wrote the biggest portion of his writings come from Rome and we have them in our Bible but even the Holy Spirit warned him that you're going to it's going to happen to you if you go PA said I don't want to go I'm willing I'm I'm going ain't nowhere to stop me cuz he was a Roman citizen he had his his nationality as a Roman citizen and he could have refused to to let them crucify yet he wanted to die yes why because he'd seen what he'd done the life that he had been and the things against the gospel and he so wanted to give his life for the gospel well I think that's all it needs for any of us right but around stated how many times he said God died that we might live he said now let us die that he might live am right to carry this message to your neighbors to you you don't have to go down to the neighbors and knock on the door I want to tell you about the prophet just live it before you know what eventually they'll come around want to know a little bit about it then you can start talking to them about the things and telling them the truth but mainly just tell them how you your fire got lit you know you just tell them a little about about your life what it's done for you you know and then doing that then like I heard a person tell one time said that it was such a change in the person's life said I wanted to be like it well that's right right you know in Fox's book of Martyrs that a lot of those Roman soldiers when they were taking them down to feed them to the lines and thing you know what they just throw their stuff down walked right in with them they seen something real and they wanted to be part of it they just walked right in there with it a live life is the greatest thing that could ever be new year's resolution you're going to break them but make a resolution in your heart as we end this year up that we'd wind up in a New Year have a wonderful time I always look forward I I I'm glad this has lasted and gone 40 something years since the prophet has gone because just let all as her brother was saying all of them things is run all over you know and let everything astray is supposed to be yes but you know the little bride she comes right down through the middle of all of it she gets it she's thirsting and you know it's not far the others then it's only for those that are hungering and thirsty in their heart for the word of the Lord and now after there are celebrating let's just stand we read our scripture go into the communion we be in the new year now some watches may be a little different but we're close to it that's why always let it roll over a minute or something but we're in the new year you know they say according to what is it the uh asex one other of them one of them Maya say that this is the last calendar year they wrote well so what and ain't going to put us in the Rapture that's right knowing all about those things what good is it that's right rapturing Faith lays in this Bible yes and brought out of this Bible through a prophet's message so then it lays in the prophet's message where on a five-fold Ministry to pick that up out of the message and take it to the Ley and then the Ley to make it manifest and let them take it to the world right sheep is what beget sheep Shepherds don't beget sheep sheep beget sheep so take the message to the world take it to your neighbors I want to say you don't have to go I wanton to talk to you about brother R was prophet no they don't need to being foolish but if they give you a little chance just start talking am brother random says just talk about the weather he said if there a car salesman or something just talk about selling cars said in a little bit you said the Lord's good you know now I'm paraphrasing it but he said you know if they pick it up said then you can carry it on yes and talk to them about the Lord just be led be s and you know what I like to remember I like to talk to somebody else trying to help them the way I remember the way it was brought to me if it was delivered to me in the right manner let me deliver it in the right manner is delivered to me right here from the word the man said what does the word say I said well that's right I can't argue the word right but I want it revealed don't you let's read our scripture we're in the New Year great time looking forward to the wonderful works of God in the change of this body to walk off of this Earth without having to die you know somebody's going to be that so why can't we contend with that everybody in the Bible ever amounted to anything it was when the word was revealed personally to them and then they just walked out Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same man also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup he didn't say now examine yourself and then just go eat you examine yourself you straighten it up right amen examine yourself you find something you straighten it up then you go to the table then you go with it say it's not you well I I've examined myself no for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would would judge ourselves we should not be judged I love this scripture but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him meat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest will I sit in order when I come yes what about a man as I say in the other day out of all of the things why was not Peter chosen to write to tell us about the communion why wasn't John chosen we call John The Eagle right why was not he chosen to tell us about the communion one born out of due season come to tell us about it right the Apostle Paul then one born out of due season in the last days come to explain it more into deep detail of what Paul was talking about so he said when you do this see in the Corinthians they coming together having communion but they was eating supper they was having you know drunk and everything probably cuz they drank wine and things and he said don't do it that way it's not supposed just to be eating a meal or something it's a Sol and then to come to find out you know I used to when I bad and thing we talked about the the marriage supper you know going to eatting and all we wondered what that would be that Prophet one day when he said it he said it's going to be the communion I thought beans and ters and all tomatoes and Cal down the drink we're going to take communion that's going to be a wonderful communion we've seen people healed take communion heal see because it really means something he said well it's just a just an example but it's a wonderful example right amen so let's just take a few moments of Silent prayer praying one for another and the prophet said you pray for your pastor your pastor prays for you let's do this and then we'll go into the communion our precious Lord and our savior we thank you for an opportunity to come to this day in time thank you for the message we've heard tonight thank you for our brother pour out his heart unto us and may we apply it to our lives that we may walk in you become hungry and thirsty and Lord to just be the word that we just spiritually eat all the time that we don't want nothing else we thank you and we love you we ask you to just be with each and every one here Lord as we all gather together as one in you to end the year out and to start this New Year as doing what our Lord and savior would say for us to do forgive our sins lead us by thine understanding keep us in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread that's been made for this purpose tonight we ask you that you would just bless it Lord sanctify the bread sanctify the partakers in Lord that we may all be one together in you we know this is an example but in the examples we see you made manifest we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen hallu Hallelujah never take communion that I don't think about the children of Israel and their Journeys and the last thing they done eaten the Passover and then in that Passover there were certain things that way brought out one time unto us that represented this communion right there in that do it we we think well now that was instituted by Paul know that was done by this one or the Lord Jesus that was it was right there in the word just waiting on us to pick it up and bring it out but always think about them in their Journey think about the Lord and and all of his him saying he was the bread that come down out of Heaven thank the Lord for the truth you said said it would set us free Lord and we thank you I like what it says there in one of the Scriptures it eat it all not just part of the word let's eat it all amen father we thank you for this wine has went through the process and now Lord it gets better every day we thank you because that represents your blood that was shed for each and every one of us we ask you now that you would just be with us sanctify each one sanctify the wine and Lord as we may take this P little piece of bread and then drink this small amount of wine that father it will be blood cells in our body tomorrow and helping us to stay alive we just pray that you would open our understanding of the real spiritual understanding of what it means to each and every one of us and we will that day when we sit down and we take the communion aresh with you Lord we love you and we thank you sanctify the wine and the partakers in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river our rest bring I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning for [Music] me sometimes I desp and rejected and I question father how then I take one more at M calary and it gives me the strength to go you ever do that you ever get to a problem a test a trial like I said the other day though what about it when the devil he he ask for permission because he can't do anything with you and until he asked permission from God is that true now there's natural sicknesses because of the world out here this is there just natural sickness we're talking about things and he can't do anything the prophet said till he asked God you know what then that means your name sister Gil had to be there yes cuz he had to be talking about about you the devil says yeah yeah let let me have her let me have him let me have them let me let me get them well you know what my name was there well it's wonderful to think about that my name was called in heaven at least I was being talked about you that's a wonderful thing that just to see Jesus Christ living in people revealing itself to people cuz that's the day in the hour We're leing come morning I by the our prob said one morning between 6 and 9:00 I'll carry my cross through the mid morning glory amen let's all protect together amen Happy New Year we have plenty of food down ours it's already been Sanctified
