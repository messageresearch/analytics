========================================

now we got it marked that's way we'll know that's where we start next time yeah right I got that marked I figured that out last night in Bible study all right let's read well I tell you what we're going to do we don't have to read scripture everybody knows in the beginning was word with God Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him not anything made that was made okay that all right is that okay okay that thing on yes so we know what that comes from we we ought to be getting kind of a double dose with brother Dale upstairs and and then here to me showing all of you can see that I think but we started we're talking about the Son of God we haven't got the son of man we're on the Son of God and the Son of God is what the logos are the logo or the poster child or the somebody asked me the other day what a poster child was well you look at marchad diam you look at all they have a person on their ad or on their logo and that poster child now and don't get me wrong I'm not belittling anybody but you wouldn't want to have a poster child for muscular distrophy and have Arnold Schwarzenegger standing there you see what I'm saying cuz it would give you a false reason of what the march of diamonds or whatever would be but most of the time the poster child for the March of diamonds is a real small child sitting in a wheelchair that's all okay so that what does that do that brings to your mind as a human being that brings to your mind what the march of di is about and what it does it draws you to make a commitment or whatever okay that's what a logo does a logo gets you into the place all right or an advertisement gets you into into the place well the logos is is the only thing and I was thinking about this the other day you said well this is a hard way to understand god listen if there was any other easy way to do it God would have given it to okay so so what's our problem we are our problem that's right okay God has laid it out so simple that a person that can't even read he can just hear what's going on and he can understand what God is so if say I can't understand then it's not that God made it so hard because remember he knew what you'd be thinking right right right but still you're a premoral agent you can you can block it off or you can take what God's already said so these words that people get all you know say well this person's so deep listen if a man's preaching the word of God if it comes out of the word of God if it comes out of the prophet's message and it's not something weird that they come up with then what is that that's the mind of God that's made so simple but the problem is is we blocked our mind with all these other things everything else we're thinking about well my idea or I thought no if you believe the preacher's preaching the word to you then that's God speaking to you and you know what God knew that'd be the only way you could get it yes or he's not God right he would have brought it some other way to make it simple you say that's so hard it's not hard right it's not hard it's hard if you don't have the new birth that's the problem with a lot of people they sit in a congregation and they hear a preacher preach and they say well he just preached so deep that was over my head you know what they're saying I don't have the mind of Christ cuz the mind of Christ ought to be able to understand the mind of Christ right and a and a true minister is supposed to be there that and surely they are some people that are preaching that are not called and they make it so dark and and mysterious that you can't understand it well that's not God remember all Israel is not Israel all preachers in this message there are some preachers that are preaching this message that don't have the Holy Ghost a lot of them okay and you have to decide am cuz they can't I mean they think they got it like brother said about that woman she's so anointed you can't tell her not to put on a pair of pants or a pair of shorts right she's anointed she's Anointed with what a false anointing so if they're Anointed with a false anointing anointed ones at the end time is not the Baptist and the Methodist against the message people no it's the Believers in this message that set under a false Shepherd or or somebody that doesn't bring the whole word of God and I know there's degrees there are born again preachers in the message sure that preach simple but that's you know what they've done they've limited their self to that and God knew that God knew that that's all they' know and that's all they could preach but there's no way they can further the people any higher so if you have a desire to go higher that's why people move to different churches right so and that's okay that's all right as long as you're moving higher as long as you're moving up not back right you say well I'm going to go over here to this brother cuz he's simple what does that telling me you're simple or you don't have the new birth one of the two because to me I thinking about this other day and if you get a revelation of this you'll really understand this is the only way God could explain it to us or he would have been explained in another way he knows somebody's going to get this he knows somebody is going to get a revelation of who God is and it Quicken their heart and they'll take a Rapture or take a body chains and then a Rapture okay so this is but they also God knew you know some people can only brother Bron priest some can only come to here some can only come to here some can only come to here and here and here but whose fault is it it's your fault our brother brand said a false teacher that won't bring you to that now how can somebody that's that's not even a born again preach the statue of a perfect man and help you up the statute of perfect man there's no way that somebody it's like Peter Peter had to be right here before he could say add to your faith virtue knowledge Tempest and then he preached it and people came to that place right it's a draw it's it's what's drawing us if you're only if your pastor's only at knowledge or or whatever then he can't preach to you about brotherly kindness cuz you ain't got it yet okay so but now somebody that's up here and and preaching the true what everybody calls the third pull or the message of the hour cuz really the message of the hour is the headstone this is not the message of the hour this was preached by Peter Peter Paul James John uh irenius Martin they preached this they had this working in their life right so brother R didn't come to bring this message he come to restore us to where this could come on top of this remember a message of preparation it was restoration then preparation cuz this is not going to sit down on this if you're only to here it won't fit see that it goes down to about right there it won't fit you got to be up here for that to fit on all right so and that's a little bit further down the road cuz that's back into the son of man what we're talking about the son of man dispensation but the Son of God dispensation is the one that carries you from what the beginning of before the Eternal right before the Eternal all the way through to the to the Future home that Holy Spirit or that theophany always was there that logos always was there that word always was there right that's why the Bible says Heaven and Earth will pass away because it was created that part of it will pass away what the part that's the sin the sin part God's not going to destroy this Earth remember brother brandom to me he he brought it so plain speaking to the the denominational world that thought that this world was going to blow up and we were going to go up to heaven somewhere and live on a cloud or or go up there you know it ain't up there Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away why because the word's Eternal all right so we we found out by a prophet that all he done was is went right back into the Greek and saw where that word uh pass away does not mean Anni it means to reshape or burn just like you you got the same body you got that you were sinning in but now you got the new birth in the same body right okay God just burnt the sin out and he came in to live same way with the Earth God can't put his feet on this Earth because there's so much sin he cursed the Earth right so God can't come down on a cursed Earth but when the curse is lifted then God can come down and stand on the earth just like he did in the Garden of Eden because remember God came down the Garden of Eden and walked with Adam and Eve in the garden that's exactly what's going to happen we're going to have a Garden of Eden condition read the future home brother brand to me that's why I said if I if they gave me one book and sent me to prison it'd be the future home CU it gives you the new birth talks about the Earth your Earth if you get a revelation your Earth it talks about Redemption talks about us going all the way into the future home and explaining all those things because remember the Millennium and and the new Heaven and new earth is two different things the he new Heaven and new earth and the Millennium is two different things right the Millennium is time the new Heaven and new earth is eternal that's back to the Eden condition the Millennium is not going to be sure it's going to be Eden condition for us cuz we're already changed we're already but there's still going to be the devil here there's still going to be that little spot somewhere that Satan is going to be but now when that new city comes down and everything's finished everything's annihilated all right so the millennium Still Still In Time right right Millennium still time so the Millennium is not the new Heaven and new earth but the Bible can call it a new Heaven and new earth cuz you know what it'll be new to us atomic fire is going to burn this thing off we're going to step down here Jesus is going to step down here and we're going to live and that's where we're going to talk about the son of David so we're not too far we're not getting off the subject we're just getting a little ahead of time cuz the son of David is where that Millennium is going to take place right okay and he's not the son of David to us right we're not Jews EXA he's not the son of David he's what he's the son of God we are the son of man amen we're the son of man on the Earth but the son of David is a promise that God made to his children Israel somebody was talking last night about um Ryan was talking about how could how could Adam take Eve back knowing what she did and knowing it would do well because and then he made the point of the law says that if you marry a woman and she commits adultery you're supposed to do away with her right not marry or B right right or if she's caught in the act of adultery the adulterer and adulteress are both stoned yeah you can't get away from that but remember Christ is the end of the law because there's Grace R is first so Adam took Eve back showing that God was going to take me and you back because you know what we done when we were born on this Earth we were not God's wife right we were the I mean we were actually running around on him if my point here's my point Israel he was married to Israel and Israel went whing you know what he should have done he should have watched him my face the Earth according to his law he should have divorced him and never called him back well there going to be called back but not back to being a son and daughter of God but he said I can't forget Israel remember Israel was the first that was who he come that's even who Jesus came to the son of man the first people he came to was the Jews CU he said I'm coming to my people right coming out of that Old Testament he was still looking back so that's the same way with Adam and Eve Adam there's no way Adam could destroy Eve because the agoy love you'll understand that one day cuz I didn't understand it until just you know several months ago that wasn't filo love that Adam had for Eve when he took her back cuz mine and your filo love would have killed her I'd never take a woman back if she'd been with a beast right but the agape love the Holy Ghost Inside of that of Adam being a Son of God he said the only way that she's going to survive is that I take her back and he couldn't see her killed same way with us God couldn't see us killed he couldn't just cast us off and say well y'all were a bunch of Sinners yeah we were Sinners but he called us and we come back remember he called us and we come back to him right so so let's not go so far as to that Adam and you would see see in your fio love you would look at that and go how could he take that woman back yeah Hey listen folks she was literally him right right exactly she was literally and you know when we understand understand that we're literally God made manifest in another form she was literally Adam there's no way we can die that's the Death part that we have to do away with where here cuz your new birth will never die the Holy Ghost will never die Adam didn't die he just moved over into another dimension right right same thing with with you and I with Christ in the church we have to be the Bible says bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh now if Adam said said that to Eve Christ says that to us we must become yes that's why the Bible says we'll have a body like into his body we'll be changed in the atoms our atams will be so changed to we'll go right back to what God saw his children look like before the foundation of the world right he's not done away with us listen if you go to hell you reject God God didn't reject you you reject God all right so same thing with with uh with Adam and and Eve you see Christ you see that agape love take over cuz remember hey when Jesus was hanging on the cross if he had filio love he would have probably called 10,000 angels to get him off he said they don't nobody love me that's us in our Humanity Ain nobody loves me I'm just going to do away with this whole thing no agape love took over knowing that the bride was inside of him and there's no way for her to come out and for him to have fellowship with his bride then for him to die to release that life there a lot of things went on on that cross that that of course the common World sees I say the common world but most people see that Jesus died for our sins but man when you start breaking it down and seeing that I was literally inside of that man yes I was inside of Jesus Christ by what exactly yes I was in Jesus cuz the L God was what walked on the face of the earth now that's in the son of man we got got to get back to the Son of God we're still talking on son of man son of David now but the Son of God everybody understands the logos is the word so there's only one way to understand God and that's right here 66 books of this Bible there's no other book being written you just got to get the mysterious part that's in there and it is mysterious to the known world right but it's not mysterious if you have the one that wrote it inside of you right okay which is what the Loos the word the actual word I I wish people would see that that that the word you needed to be born again with God knew that he looked down through time and saw it and then he what he spoke to Isaiah or he spoke to in my case he spoke to Moses and Moses wrote and God said let us make man in our own image for way Dale sake I'm writing this because to me that come that was the Striking realization of where I was now see your scripture may be something else you may be e John 3:16 or you may be this or you may be that whatever your scripture is you know what God put that in there just for you just for you you say well 100 people may so what you're the only one in the matter I was birthed by the word I wasn't Birth by something else I wasn't bth bir by a good feeling or a book or or you know reading in something else I was birthed by the word of God because I'm a word child and a word child has to come through the word everybody got that everybody got that there every one of us you say well I don't have a favorite scripture that's okay you have a favorite series of scriptures I'm sure right you may not just have one but you have a series that you can put together in the Bible you know what that was put there for you right just for you just for you to where you look down there and you see it that's why that that Peter on the day of Pentecost when he stepped out there and that Son of God came down into that group of people what he do he preached them a word sermon this Jesus who you've crucified I mean he went right straight to the person but what was the first thing he done though he went back to Joel he went back in the Old Testament he said this is that what he went back he had to go back into the word he went back into the word he said this is that that was spoken by the prophet Joel there's nothing else he could have done Paul the only way Paul could write 80% of the New Testament is go back into the Old Testament get the Revelation that they did not have during that time of the Old Testament get that Revelation and do what bring it over run it through the filter of the holy ghost in a man cuz we're going to read it right here in a minute it goes right into the man and then what same thing that happened when God said let there be life yeah thought voice same thing God speaking through a man he can't speak through nothing else that's right col IU prove it to you right here in just a minute all right he's talking about now what we're going to do is we're going to drop down we're going to we're going to look remember this is brother say King theophany all of us by the new birth have the same the because we have the same if you and if you and and and your spouse are one you don't have the same DNA but now in God's eyes we all do if we're born again all God's children have the same DNA because my DNA and and Terence and and Anna they can all be traced back to that right so the same way with all of us if we're born again we have the same DNA makeup the same thing it makes us up goes right back to our father right right all right and then the father comes and shows us where we come from remember brother Brown said the seal shows what that which was which is and is to come what he opened up that mind of God to go back so far to tell that that we come from logos we come from the word theophany and remember he also called it the holy spirit so if the holy spirit's in you today then what do you have you have all this inside of you that's why that's why that the the Bible and God wanted it to be pronounced the Son of God cuz the Son of God is the spirit right there's no flesh body in here at all right now right that we know flesh body that's right got it this is Spirit right but not Spirit like Ghost spirit right has a form it has substance right yes how did God kill those animals in the old in the in the Garden of Eden if he didn't have some substance about it right but that substance could if he needed to go through a wall when he was in a glorified condition he went right on through a wall and it never bothered him the Holy Ghost same thing with me and you if we fell dead right here you wouldn't have to open the door to let the spirit out that's right no it just steps over into another dimension Right This falls and it's dead all right same way with God course he don't die he just steps in another form so he comes from logos speech so whatever is written down that's what we need to understand I've always said uh and you get sometimes you get preachers it's like brother Brown said sometimes you get around a bunch of preachers he said that's where he makes his mistake get around a bunch of preachers but a b bunch of preachers were talking this has been 10 15 years ago when I first come back to the Lord and they were you know it says some of these writing and then it says um Blank Spot on tape right says Blank Spot on tape or or or they couldn't understand it or they'll put a little parentheses and then brother keep I wonder what he said I said don't matter they like well it might be well if it was for anybody it was for somebody sitting there in that congregation that heard it because brother Brown said Rapture in faith does not lie in the Gap right right that's good brother brother R said Rapture and faith lies in these books and Tes not in that see because see when man's mind begins to think that that's the devil that's right that's another Spirit trying to form a see you can form any Doctrine you want to in that black space right that's right you can form any Doctrine you want to I wonder what he said well I believe he said something about believe he did believe he said polygamy was all right but he just the Lord hid that from everybody but me you better run away from them kind of people so rapturing faith lies in this word right here that's right all right what you can read and comprehend that's where lack Rapture and Faith now brother BR didn't say Rapture and faith lies on these books and table he said in so you got to look in between the lines sure there's a mysterious part that's not written but it's got a coincide with the word here and here both plac all places all right can't have polygamy in a gap and then you know brother R say polyam is wrong you can't have that so it's just the lust devil that gets in there gives you more than one life bless their heart but look Moses did nothing it was the angel of God what did it look like that led Israel a pillar of Fire by night and A Cloud by day I believe he's still leading on right so God didn't do it CU what brother Brown's doing is is he is getting these people ready for a prayer line where that angel of the Covenant Jesus Christ himself the the what the theophany the Lo he'll call it in a minute I'll show it to right there it is it was the Loos or the Christ what' he say I believe he still we know that that was the angel of the Covenant so we can add one more the angel of the Covenant cuz the Holy Ghost was leading them on the outside remember brother R said God come three times above us Old Testament with us in the New Testament and now in us okay above us with us and in us so he was above pill Fire by night and the cloud by day now I've always said Moses saw a burning bush but if he would have had a deeper Revelation he would have seen Jesus standing there the theophany of Christ standing in that but remember the only way and you say well why didn't it happen that we a minute let's go back the only way Moses could understand it was the way he came yeah or he would have come another way that's why when we s here we go why in the world did he well that's the only way Moses could have saw God was that pillar of fire the burning bush or he would have come another way God don't go this way and go well I don't know if Moses will understand that so I'll no this is the only way Moses is going to come but remember but remember watch Moses's Revelation he accepted all this for a while and then he said God I want to see you he knew God was a man yeah he had he had enough Revelation so close to God till he knew he was the angel of the Covenant he knew he was a pill of Fire he knew God spoke to him all the time lip to ear it wasn't God somebody else and Moses no it was God and Moses cuz he used Moses as a special man didn't have the Holy Ghost but he had that anointing on him cuz remember when he had the anointing on him they had to cover his face it Shin so bright why the anointing of the Holy Ghost was on him but it never went in Moses or he would have not murdered that Egyptian or he wanted not have done the things that he did all right remember he smoked the water and the speaking to the water all right that was Moses brother said Moses gotten away cuz God said speak Moses you know he got what he got a little temperamental must I fetch you rebels water and instead of speaking to it he hit it well you know what but remember brother R said that set up a denomination that set up another what something that God allowed the water came but it was not it was under a permissive will of God not the perfect will of God cuz remember what we've come back to now is a spoken word not the smiting of this and the smiting of that we've come right back to what the word the spoken word is the Original Seed that's what God's always wanted was was Adam to speak and and and now you and me right but Moses but God knew this okay God knew this this the only way we can get this Moses was an example it was the angel of the Covenant is that right it was the logos or the Christ he's still the same Leading the People day today as he was then all right now let's go to gifts and callings now look people this is 1950 brother brandham had this Revelation not 1963 1950 cuz you know why he had a new birth and he was a prophet for the reading of the word found in Exodus he said behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him so who was it there's only one name of God that was Jesus Christ in spirit form not in flesh yet but if thou will indeed obey his voice do all that I speak then will I be an enemy to thy enemies and adversary to thy adversary for my Angel shall go before thee all right now that's one we read I missed the first one I'm sorry now let's go back to this one this was the first one I was going to read I'm actually wrong one God doesn't fall upon denominations God doesn't fall upon Mechanical Devices right he uses man God the Holy Spirit fell upon men man is God's agent this is one I wanted to read I'm sorry I'm pressed the wrong one first man is God's agent and the hardest thing that God has ever had to do was to get one mortal to believe another and that's true yes it do you believe that they couldn't believe Moses and God gave him two signs to prove to the people that he was sent from God for their Deliverance you believe that well isn't he the same yesterday day and forever do you believe the angel that talked to him in the burning bush is the Angel of the Covenant so that was God's voice that was Christ that's why Jesus could say before Abraham was I am and then he says if you had have known Moses you would have known me cuz he was back there that's why what brother Dale's saying if you'll understand what brother Dale's saying Jesus come were word first he was back before he was right here not the flesh but that man Jesus what was inside of him doing the talking was the word of God that said let there be that said all these things that that's why that that's why that all your your writers in the Bible knew Jesus Christ was the creator that Creator was inside that flesh body he was the angel of the Covenant that's why Paul PA could look at that light and say Lord he knew that angel of the Covenant back in the Old Testament was Lord God Almighty Jehovah right do you believe the angel that talked to him in the burning bush is the Angel of the Covenant was that right all right he's the same yesterday and then and forever and he's he does the same things today that he did then still perform signs and wonders now what's brother Bram doing he's getting the people to believe the signs that's coming cuz he's fixing to do a prayer line he's fixing to go through a prayer line all right now what here we go on this one and then we'll stop this word that we have just read was God sending Moses Moses was born an odd peculiar birth it was just time for the prophetic will of God to cause then it to move up and to have something to come to pass that he had promised Abraham to take his people out and he did God always moved just in time you believe that now we're at the day we're in the last day just how close to the end I do not know no one knows not even the angels are the Son of God the Father only knows but we're in the last days and he promised that these signs and wonders will be done in the last days all right now look so if God raised up a man by the name of Moses had him born into this world for that specific Pur to purpose to deliver the people that were in bondage that couldn't help them brought them out through his not Moses Moses never performed one Miracle Moses can't perform Miracle what brother brand was telling him he's separating himself from that angel the Cen he said I can't perform Miracle right Jesus never performed a miracle he'll he'll be here in just a little while he said if Jesus was standing here tonight he could not heal you that's what he said if Jesus was standing here he said if Jesus was standing here in a suit he said there's no way he can heal you he said he healed you before the foundation of the world you just got to believe it right all right Moses never performed one Miracle it was the angel of God that went before Moses right but now remember the angel of God didn't speak to the people the angel of God spoke to Moses Moses spoke right so it had to be man that it went through it was the angel of God that went before Moses it was a pillar of fire at night the cloud by day and when you see the picture that we're going to show you short shortly which one is he going to show them the one in 1950 this was right after the Sam Houston Coliseum when the when the the amber light appeared over brother bram's head all right that's the angel of the Covenant that's Jesus Christ it was the angel of God that went before Moses that would pill a fire at night Cloud by day and when you see the picture that we're going to show you shortly if we haven't I believe your feel that it's the same Pillar of Fire that's Leading the People today the angel of God which we know the angel that led Moses was the angel of the Covenant which was Christ the son of God or the low God that came out of God was the son of God actually you put all that and look today God's people are not in bonded spiritually for they're they're delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit brings him from the bond of sin all right so what brother brandham is saying is what he brings the angel of the Covenant now what is that angel of the Covenant many times you see him appear in the Old Testament and we'll talk about that next Sunday what form he appears in in the Old Testament cuz remember he appeared what in MDC he appeared as the U captain of the host Joshua right right he appeared in a in a in fire at the um three Hebrew children remember the Bible says it was the son of God right he appeared in a another fire to a group of some people there's all these different things that he appeared but it was the same cuz I see when Paul when Paul saw that light he said Lord he knew that was that angel of the C he was so versed in the Old Testament scriptures he knew that if it was that kind kind of a light that struck him down spoke to him and nobody else heard it but him right all they heard was a noise right right they just heard a noise that's what people are doing now you come to church you're hearing a noise if you're not born again you're just hearing a noise but the people that are born again God's speaking to them right that's right that's just the way it is I'm sorry that's the way it is it it's uh brother Brown preach an uncertain sound and that's what it is you get an uncertain sound now if you get a preacher up there it's got an uncertain sound something's going to ding something's going to ding in here that that's not right you know what that's the holy ghost telling you to beware right that's the holy ghost telling and you ought to thank God yeah that's right when that comes in here and that little you think well you know you think well I could be wrong there's 600 people in this congregation and I'm the only one that's not amening I'm a no you give it the word test you take it right back to the word right and if it ain't the word spit it out that's right well what the Lord just revealed to me is that in the beginning was the word and from from that word everything else has come to this day to this very minute that's right that word BL it all Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word that's what we're going to live in in the future home now that's about 6 or eight months down the road but that word is building I go to prepare a place for you what they don't up there with hammer and nail the word built it for us every bit of this I've always said your future home the place you're going to live in the future home is in you right now that's right even before he said in the beginning was the word the word was the word sure that was his even before that cuz remember it's going to be it's got to be spoken yeah yeah to come to pass because remember like we said before watch God move Jesus was in God's mind he was slain brother Brown said that did it that did it for Adam and everybody else but there's one day it literally had to happen right on Earth to what I've always said the reason we're doing what we're doing and the Reason God done what he done was witness to the devil yeah cuz remember the devil is the right hand he's the next person to God God to me and forgive me if I'm wrong God is obligated to show the devil where he's wrong and he's proven he's wrong by me and you because remember all he got to say is to the Devil he's just going to all he's got to do is say go back to where you come from I created you I can do away with you but what is he doing he's bringing Sons and Daughters of God to a place to prove to that next guy in command that number one he's in control but number two he can
