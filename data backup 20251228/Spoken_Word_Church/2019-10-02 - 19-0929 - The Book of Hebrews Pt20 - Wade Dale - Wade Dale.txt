========================================

[Applause] okay fine good morning again good to have the Trent singing the girls will go all the way from Jamaica to get here so much here it's good to have them with us they'll be here with a little wild yeah amen to that anyway all right there we go so now firstly in Chapter 12 we were looking after the great chapter in Hebrews 11 the faith chapter then we go to equal to 12 last Sunday were talking about Hebrews 12 and there were yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken and the things that are made that those things cannot be shaken may remain and remember what we're talking about here and I was listening to the tape coming home to the other day of Illinois and brother ground was talking about this he said God's not only helpful in the future home he says I shaved out in the earth only but also the heaven so he's going to show you both them and enter in this end time right he's going to shake it off but if the things which cannot be shaken may remain but the old thing can't be shaking the gun the baptism the Holy Ghost a new birth we'd be afraid of many things but listen we got to come to a place to where it's settled in our salt and they might you know the world makes shaken tumble and rattle and roll but you still gotta have an anchor and you gotta know that God's in control but you won't even control here first Hebrews 11 that great faith chapter but remember we were talking about when we come look things that are shaken of what have no foundation things that are shaken the most of zero foundation to it all right but the thing to have foundation cannot be shaken because the faith like they'll come back faith does that foundation look down wide it is you've got to have a lot of faith that have cost as much space as we do growth economist but you don't have faith you forget about the kindness so where for we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved right well we know where's the kingdom of God it's not up in heaven it's in you you are the kingdom of heaven you're the kingdom of God let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire and then also we know that Paul continues his writing is just a complete letter it's not a chapter 2 Paul man put these chapters in here so he's continued this thought let brotherly love continue we've told you many times they asked Jesus what was the greatest commandment he said love the Lord God with all your heart and love your neighbor as you love yourself those are the two greatest Commandments for a while you gotta love your brother just as much your brother not you not your brother I don't know about you got to let your neighbor Jesus says okay you love your brother but can you love your neighbor that may persecute you that like I said my two neighbors or dead guys and you know maybe that's part of what you gotta do you got to love them as much as you love you stop that hurts but still you you got to do that that's why I'm growing all the time this is way up there you got to get all these birches working in a lot before you come brother kindness because I'll guarantee you I can tell you who you like and who you don't like this food everybody in this congregation I can tell you who you like it knew you don't like but remember what Billy Paul said about brother around he said I did not know who the enemies were and I did not are its friends and enemies he treated exactly the same all right so that's what we got to come to and brother day left cover some of that you know about check your hands and and greeting people and being coordinate friendly because you gotta remember that let's stay on brother without for just a minute because brotherly love is not well I just love to be around that person know that ain't I'm gonna find that quote we're brother Brown said that you can have the baptism the Holy Ghost two brothers and can't stand to be in the same room together that's just personality that's humanity but when he comes to the Word of God you should be able to sitting all that time all day even if you barely disagreed you're supposed to love you brother alright that's a problem we come to a bitter disagreement and then we go glam up anything to do with em come on that well you're wrong according to that right there brotherly love is you love the person as you love yourself hard to do that's why says right they are knocked down here right but that brotherly love continue you know when I was doing the statute was perfect man when I got into brotherly love I read all the quotes for brother Brown was talking about what was brotherly love easy you go back to the Bible were you looking to book of Acts when they had all things coming they brought all their possessions they brought all their property but they brought all their money into a central location and Peter James and all them distributed the funds to everybody the Bible says they had all things common well remember I told you when I was standing upstairs I said y'all ready to do that you ready to bring me a brother nail all your money and get I'll tell you cars you talk to your house the tower that you landed all your money and they let us distribute it out so yet some people some people submit under the seat some people do you know so we're not going to do that though that was the time that they were distributing if you'll keep reading the quote brother Brown said that's what they were distributing the gospel and they needed to do that so it's really all bad idea but you'd like to I mean that's social reform and that just don't work that's socialism and that's I don't believe in that but if you do it with a cheerful heart if you do it out of love that makes a big difference all right be not forgetful to entertain strangers remember we were touched on this last Sunday for a minute for thereby some have entertained angels unawares we just don't know what's going on in this faster dimension this other dimension that's out here that we believe there's other dimensions brother Brown said God give you an angel at birth all believers have angels all right and the Bible says the angel of the lord encamps about those that believe or in other words the ones that are that are warning him because you know what the devil's got his eye on you any guys I won't cross you I already got her she's not born again with the one through the horn again it's that power that he felt when he touched talk to Jesus back in 2000 years ago that same power is inside of you if it is you've got a demo gun so when Satan comes up against you they ought to be able to feel something different now remember brother rod said if they can get you you went out to him he didn't get to come in your house cuz as we were reading the other day and brother Tim Tims the unclean spirit goes out of a man walks in dark places the unclean goes out but then he says I'm gonna come back to my house you read about saying says I will come back to my house in other words he came back to his house and found his weapon garnished and it was empty well if you fill it with the Holy Ghost he surely is not gonna come back in he's gonna try but he's not gonna come back in but if you don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you could all that jump run out of you it's gonna come back it's gonna come backwards it's gonna make you think you got something that you don't know but those who endure the end well my little baby into this thing if when we'll see we'll see the end or the culmination of this thing is who's going to stand into one because something's gonna you gonna be shoved don't worry to read that you're gonna be shook if Heaven consists of the word then the words going to be sure in you somebody's going to come with a false doctrine somebody's gonna come with an angle with this with an angle with that whatever it is whatever it might be and [Music] yes and then say you got that's not the worst deception worst deception is what's going on up north so I'm not gonna say more about that well people telling you that you've got to go press play and you don't have a middle pasture that's a billion DM I mean nothing in the end of somewhere see that's more deceiving there because churches are being shut down families are being broke apart I don't understand well I do understand because heaven on earth is gonna be sure but the Word of God like I've told you many many times before we're gonna read again today base base final resting places in the word God the Word of God tells us it takes a powerful ministry to perfect the Saints not one person and like I said last Sunday there were the two witnesses to Israel are not going to take tape recorders over there and play dates it's gonna be two live people with skin on them they're gonna go over there and they're going to preach Jesus Christ to those people okay so same way here and I only believe that in this church I just don't want people to get caught up in the I'm glad that brother Brown told us that every church was sovereign so I'll just take that close and I say okay whatever you've got to say to me your dad or brother Graham said every Church this topic will leave me alone don't leave me alone hey man it's not gonna bother me if you've got the baptism the Holy Ghost that's the problem you got the baptism of the holy go you'll know but if you don't if you've just got some kind of emotion or a feeling or a or even a dictates of sanctification you don't have enough token you learner people to run after signs and wonders in the end time we are we're hearing it now from preachers that we don't need teaching no more we need demonstration that's why I did what I did Sunday member I'm told to ask y'all to raise your hand the one in our since we're so glad I have teaching people that don't have no math let's say I don't know what they want well I do know what they want they want a prayer line coming across some people later and everybody the whole building gets healed it's not gonna happen not gonna happen it's not publish oh it's not gonna happen it's gonna and that's what's gonna be shook Satan is gonna say this in this message folks he's not out there he's in this message some ask me other day that I believe there was Jesuits in the message I said absolutely this preacher their rejection of a priest in this message so but listen it will not deceive the UA it's gonna try it just says it will almost deceive the very elect so if what's going on around the message continues as it is it's wrong but if it's just going through the phase then you know what God will bring his children back I promise you they will but if you don't children to start with it's not gonna it's not gonna be the same and and I was listening to Christ's mystery of God revealed brother Claude brought to my attention when that when people say what they do but they do say but we don't need a teaching we need manifestation they're talking about prayer lines again they're talking about you know taxers falling off people and and you know what that's happened that's happened in our congregation last Sunday almost 95% of the people held her hand up they go ahead and heal them while they've been going to church here oh I've seen cancer I've seen dead right I've seen blinded eyes brought the left what absolutely more family and what I'm gonna ask that person if I haven't seen my laughter what do you mean by weed manifestation so they will God will manifest himself I promise you be with you just hang in there you just hang in there those who endure to the end shall be safe well the whole church is going to be said so you're not going to say no whole church doing what they were thinking it might be a feeling I really don't care you know yeah and let me I'm gonna put this on record it's going to I love them you know man but we brother Dale the kind of guy that doesn't he doesn't raise babies he does a baby is there's a lot of people in this message that gets into everybody's business that makes sure you know oh you know and you know what I was thinking yesterday we not how to split in this church since it started we have made split we we've had people come to church here brother Richard Wilson then daddy said go start your church somewhere right go start your church somewhere there's been splits that way which is wonderful but just to say that well we don't agree with this and we don't agree with that so we're just gonna start our own church it's never happening why could brother Dale he may be harder than two and sometimes that sometimes you know I I get beat up too but but you know what you're not baby every 15 minutes ain't got call them one nowhere you pass with that one canning factory before you play he is the shepherd but you know what he's responsible to give you the work what you do with it a lot of stay babies they still desire Paul said he come to pulse it desiring the sincere milk of the word sincere yes very sincere but he said but strong meat is for those of them at or those who don't have to whine all the time and cry I know how the group that was in Ephesus 212 they were they were right up here they were right here those 12 men and women that were in the Church of Ephesus a very powerful church why they were on a tour they didn't have to cry to Paul it kind of mean they need to someday and have to cry to Peter every time they need something there's some brother Dale loves you more than buying this world everyone loved you I promise you one thing you gonna have to search out your own salvation we have come to a place in this message where we went right back to Catholicism preachers saved my kids preacher then the creatures lay your hands on me like what brought Klaus dead he suit he said be careful when you lay hands on the state because if that person gets healed God doesn't get all the credit he's right because you stayed brother somebody's name and that brother Dale prayed for me and I got healed so I don't share his glory with nobody but what am i if you're set in your seat and Roselle is preaching there's no contact then God healed you because you believe the Word of God you believe what God said and how many times does that happen in our service several pounds clean up only the other days you the other day but when we were preaching and brother I mean it sister Gayle has done the same thing Regina a lot of people have been sitting in our congregation not to me that's the greatest manifestations because you come up and be prayed for well I get part of the credit cuz I laid my hand how many times have you heard face I laid my hands on when we interface I read you all that quote if we can't you pay them tons of no I don't guess I'm not looking to get a bride ready we help people in our church that can get bride ready because they can get people say I want to get a wife ready hey the Bible says his wife has made herself right now Jim and I've been married 40 years she's my wife she understands things about me that nobody does thank God and nobody understands for her thank God because she's my wife we know every inch of our person I don't mean physically but everything that she can lead to what mom and David same way you've been going down the road you'd be saying something and you go that's thinking the same thing you know I mean you become so one was that's the way God wants us to be that he wants to be our husband and there's a time when he's our when he's our wonderful groom and when we first walked up the aisle and we first get saved and God gives us all these things but you know wife is like man Jim man Jim this coming up tomorrow I mean I'm leaving for four days to go hunting she's not gonna be home cleanie-cleanie calling me over five minutes to you me no thank you I don't want that that's a baby that's an immature bride now at first when we were first together maybe 40 years ago I cannot remember but we might have kept up with each other there was no cell phones back then snow Wow but you understand what I mean so what God's trying to do he's not going to wrap your baby babies are gonna go by the grave and have to die and be resurrected five mature Christians good when we stand one day and death comes to to bother us are to come to us in the anyway for the branch that you'll rub it off with your show plan because you're mature you won't have even no that's why I mean you look at Israel and when you looked at the whole of Israel you saw more mixed multitude than you saw the real godly Israel because you saw the hair in the pants you don't want to bring it up to now there's a mixed multitude in the congregation if that woman sent there with paint on her face and she's got bobbed hair she's number one she's not a believer or either she's a real early believer like we were talking the other day about Cindy Cindy came up here years ago or passed several times several times you don't want way to thin the back door and go hey don't you come to church again without a dress I'll not make dynamap talk about believe in but when you come to a revelation you don't have to worry about it yeah you don't have to worry about these things to me see that's the baby and we got in there and don't get me wrong like it was standing last Sunday there are teachers I'm stopped there are teachers of kindergarteners there teacher there's teachers of high school and there's teachers of college all right so you got a graduation times all the way up through there so what brother Dale I'm leaving myself to this is we've come to a place to where we're trying to we tried to get the people ready for a rapture not ready to be born again now he has brought back though and what's he preaching on now salvation Sampo salvation but in simple salvation if you'll start right if you start right yield yourself to God you'll come up to here but if you don't start right that's why they first Brown said he said it up born you woman won't will prepare plans for you won't correct well this is easier to walk around in our church with our hair tight trim or will make the bumper whatever more you want to say all that list of laundry list of things and she continued that she's been sitting in the church for 10 years Morrigan he's not listening it's going in one ear out the other and you know what you can't tell them people anything they're not ready to receive the truth because they want to walk but you know what I asked daddy one time I said how do you pull up with these people they felt long come back he said they'd pay the bill God can put you in this church and you be as dead as a hammer yet he wants you to fund part of what's going on in this church don't you think I'd do that yeah you'll do that he wants you to be born again but you know what God knows that you won't so he's gonna use you anyway it's gonna take he's going to help you he's gonna help us by putting that person in the scene don't tell me listen we got a hundred from some people in our church they're not all born again I wish I wish and there are like I said before we're not trying to leave them but there comes a time when thoughts in leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ of laying on of hands and all these other things baptism you said well God do it baptism no it's that you don't have to be baptized again your baptism was right forget it sister Guinea was baptized the other day again but she she met she had she went to get a stable join he get settled in a line and that's fine ain't no problems they have to be do i I was supposed to be in Boca you know why I don't know you know here a bride is so long you know why it's a killing here without a wife Brooke I was a bride for a few days run that right back but you know you remember it's just like that it's like mom said you somebody hadn't been made don't know this but even with with Francine we met them how long you been a 31 years well we met you when she was a baby so she's 28 any born-again young man with like moving to Canada but that's okay but 31 years you know when I met Keith and Francine I mean they were just oh they were just little birds and they still are but you know what you don't have to you don't have to do that clinging on that it's like brother Brown said I can take the letter and open it up now if you've been born if you've been born again you've been yeah you've been born again but if you've been husband and wife for a long time I could be setting up in Illinois and Jim send me an email and I know exactly what you're doing at that time about what she's writing and exactly what she's thinking that's that love letter to him between the lines that God has wrote to this bride to his bride that we in any moment we can read this thing here that we call a love letter and we can read what God wants to me that them told you that that's the essence of the Bible and the essence of the message because Paul says the letter of killing this Bible in letter form is going to kill a lot of people literally kill a lot of people but if you take the essence of what God's talking about and you bring it into your heart and then you know what he say you know he said the my flesh and drink my blood what's going on we got a revelation we know because what we become life but I love that in revelation 19 where it says his wife is later now she wasn't we were always gonna be a bride but she's a wife brother Brown said the bride and the end of time want to know what he wants to do with the worst so if you don't know what to do with the words and go back down here I said you can't get right here without having this and that no that's right so you've got a really your three processes of grace continues on to the change of the money because your true day that you're truly baptized with the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the day when your body's change back to a young man and a woman and we step over in another dimension that's when it will culminate for us but it's not over remember he's got to go turn to the Jews and then he's got a plan 144,000 a nice guy v till June he's got the Millennium there thanks a lot of things goes on but you're not arresting as Paul said we're resting knowing that that we pass from death unto life okay but maturity we the problem with people they they caught the message of the hour I believe some people caught the message in the hour as do's and don'ts and that's coming out of Pentecost because I was thinking this yesterday and I've read his quote the other day we're brother Brown said when the bride begins to say and I am my father a1c you can take a message to people and preach it to them and they just they're like whoa what do you mean I am the I am what do you mean I am the resurrection what do you like I've preached here well I win preaches somewhere else and you can feel a little bit may enjoy the sermon but is like how you don't be far now we go for that when right begins to say I and my father and I read John 17d all the other day no I didn't read him him he said that we I pray that as you and I are one Jesus was praying to the father as the as the father and I are one so they should be one like we're one now house Jesus and father one too he's the very essence of the father so we must be the very essence of the father God we're going heirs with Christ we read that in Roman Roman day we're doing it that's right when hebrews hebrews hebrews 10 5 says the bodies now has prepared me embody you know that jesus not you in the beginning was work worth with God where was God well were you separate we just separate person and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us Jesus yes first bridge yes but you know what being first fruit there's fruit behind that Oh feel free so see we leave but when you start staying on my father one brother after the show which is what Pentecostal people which is what shouting speaking in tongues dancing prayer lines they have to all come through that and you know what I don't know against it I'm just saying we don't need it I'm not against it I'm not against weighing don't bother to us they lay hands on the state but it doesn't say scream shouts laughs woman on the floor hey put them in a prayer line it says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I've seen my daddy man time somebody say well I got a backache he'll work his way around the congregation or he'll be outside and he'll welcome to that brother and shake his hand he'll put his hand around on the back never say a word shake his hand please hammer-ons back then walk off you know what he's done he's prayed for that first so that's the way it should be and that's the way I like it for this church everybody you say we're drivin for debate I really don't care I'm getting something we're go somewhere somebody is going somewhere all right and maybe there's five of us or ten of us I wish it was all 100 but it's not going to be it's right now I'm sorry I'm sorry it's just not but for those that catch it then you're going to be a Christian life like I would let me finish my point I was listening to cross the mystery of God reveal coming back from Illinois that's a good thing because you know you can witness eight hours so you listen to two three our sermons gained and got home yet I listen to the future home Christ the mystery God revealed so but brother Brown says he stopped and he said he keeps saying he keeps quoting he keeps saying he keeps quoting and then he says look at the clock he said is exactly two o'clock the end of the second poll now what was the second poll first poll was taking the people by the hand second poll was the determinant thoughts and intents of the heart see that's what everybody wants now they want to go back to that he says that the poll is indeed and I'm like brother Claude said he said I don't know what they don't get about end but if he says the second poll has ended the third Apple is at hand which is the opening of the word speaking of the word speaking the word and let it manifest itself because remember remember remember all Israel is not Israel all bride is not bride there will be a bride there's no doubt but there is going to be a mature wife that you don't have to tell them to come to church you know I tell them pay their time you can see people you can stand and see people that struggle because of these simple things now paying your tithes not coming to church every Sunday you can see those people they struggle all the time all the time all the time I mean so obvious it's not obvious to them I guess but but just doing the simple things to ABC's foundation member is really wide a lot of things to work them down here as soon as you get a little bit further up here you're growing up to a point where Christ is the head that's Christ but you know what that's not only Christ this is his body and the body is what does the what the moving exercise the work yes that's the body that does the work well that's us that the body doesn't work and we've got to what verse to be not forgotten to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares remember the story about the guy wanting something God want something God he sends him this guy behind extensions a baker and it sends him up another guy behind he sends he miss guy behind and he said Lord that you haven't appeared to me and he said I sent you three people to hell to you it didn't you didn't take him so entertain angels unaware remember them that are in bonds as bound with them now that's nothing we tell my people they're in and and don't get me wrong we're not throwing babies you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater you try to nurture that baby but you only do so much because it's the two minutes if you're free of all agencies it doesn't you stop anytime you want to remember in balance and we do we try to break that bond brother man brother they all said just like Bill Graham chill we just try to break the spell over your eyes so you can see Christ not us that's the whole problem we go well I go to church I go to the work there's no glue no you go to church to see Christ remember Barry Bonds has bound with them and then which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body in other words brother brown stated brotherly kindness what do you say put yourself in that person's place all right marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers he's talking about spiritual - marriage is honorable just talking about being in the body of Christ a bit to get nobody to cry to be a bride you gotta have a bridegroom I've never seen a bride going to the to the altar by herself we're saying this the world you got several different things going on in this world you got telling the same thanks going up there you know wet jump but marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge let your conversation be without covetousness in other words everybody sit and it is a good example but let me finish my conversation I want to be like brother Dale I don't be like brother Dale won't be like Christ right and if Christ the den brother Dale then I'll see that in him and I don't want to because there's a lot of things dad does it I don't like there's a lot of things I do he don't like a lot less each of us do in the human part that we don't like but it's spiritually you got headship and brother Dale if the headship of the church but Christ is the head of mmm Christ is the head okay but thank God did he give us positions that you can depend on because you do need to put your faith in something if we put our faith in things that are not saying but then when God send us a message and send us a good pastor and a good teacher they didn't think when he sends us to good people here then you don't want to reap that benefit all reap that benefit remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word garbage faith follow considering the end of their conversation to hunter hunter when I woke up this meant wanna cut it don't covet thy neighbor no cut it means I won't watch these girls have rights what I was just saying that was my whole point that was my whole point I don't covet this is not greedy of filthy lucre I'm not loaning money narc okay whenever is just what's mean I don't want I don't want to be you know and that's what happens in the world people go I want to have what this person has to they're rich and famous and they got a big car and they got to be how's me that's a Christian you should never want that you should be what your conversation what's Paul saying he's running up against people he's run up against people that says well Paul I want this you remember only people hung around Paul yes they will miss the sign of the sorcerer and all hymns that woman and all day always what following Paul said follow me as I follow Christ they weren't looking at Christ they were looking at also their conversation was coveting what Paul had okay I want what brother Dale's got but in Christianity not in all the other thing you connect someone else we're actually you're actually degrading what God's give you you know I when I first started preaching I thought well man if I had an airlock home-along Lord find the breach let Donny Reagan I'd be fine but you know what doc comon should shut up I made you the way you are you do what you need to do and they can do what they want to do so anyway all right we gotta go I'm leaving for five minutes fast now so but lor bless you we'll start this right here work smile next Sunday and list it they may not put the quotes up on the screen we don't have no money here John it's going to trial but he's got to deal with this money Johnny huh no yeah I'm with it
