house of the Lord you like turning your scriptures it'll be kind of a jump through reading but uh if you will turn to Revelations 20 and then we'll go to Revelations 2 and then to 2 Corinthians 3 so if you will you go do that way remember the announcements that we've made uh June's father asked me if I would thank everybody you know for praying for Kathy in the time of her trouble and all that she's been having and she L like she was doing mighty good so we just keep praying and so remember now the Lord willing the Bible study will be this coming Saturday 6:00 and then brother Keith Reed will be here with us for the weekend preaching for us and just keep those in mind uh yeah remember now there's a sister Angie Brown that calls us all the time and she wants us to pray she called one time or called a couple of times and the Lord just answered her prayers right off well so now every time she needs anything she calls which is good you know I'm glad of it and I'm just saying she has the confidence in that but she wants us to pray now that her husband can get a job to move to somewhere closer which she named the the the place but get closer to where that she be able to to go to church and maybe can get him in church so just remember that sister Angie Brown and uh the Lord will will take care of that for her off also remember now the shower will be after the service this afternoon so please fathers and whoever keep your children out from downstairs you know cuz you can have to wait until everything over and let the women have the shower for sister uh here and just that way then you can maybe if they're real good maybe Mary and them might leave us enough cake to be able to sneak in after the shower's over you know and get a bite of cake if we're real good and keep everything out of the the way so just remember that amen any other announcements I generally forget I know Wade will be traveling back this afternoon June will be having to go pick him up and everything to to bring him back in so pray that the Lord would would give him a safe journey amen so let's go to Revelations 20 and we'll read verse 11 and 12 then we'll go to Revelations 2 and then we'll go to 2 Corinthians cuz this is just kind of a something I'm wanting to tie in with the morning's message a little and move on verse 11 and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whom face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books the notice books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead was judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works now we'll go to Revelations verse chapter three I think I wrote down two but three he's got it right up there I gave it to them but I had it on my notes chapter 2 but we'll go to that verse 5 he that overcometh the thing same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life and I will confess his name before my father and before his angels all right let's go to the last one which is in second Corinthians I hope we get this far verse or chapter 3 Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of off Commendation from you ye are written Epistles in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I didn't finish up the message this morning and all but uh I just pray that you will go back and study it a little bit because the psalmist or the the writer job he was asking the question what is man and I hope that you know that maybe we brought out a few things to be able to understand because you'll find a lot if you go back in the Old Testament and study it you'll find a lot talking about the soul you know an individual a person and a being and like I said David would cry out you know my soul thirsteth after thee CU it was it's you know the soul of man is the part that God made us to where that we would long after him wouldn't be like the animals because they're in the the natural realm of a flesh and things and they're in kind of a spiritual realm as you'd want to maybe say a life real that they live in but they don't have a soul and he made that soul to where it would thirst after him and and that's the thing that I wanted us to see because that's what he's dealing with he's dealing with your soul right all right then we we look at Christians as to try to work upon the flesh well that's fine for the Christian to work upon the flesh but it's not right for us to uh look at a person and judge them by flesh we need to judge them by the desire of their heart all right now if the flesh doesn't line up with the desire of the heart then we know for sure that there's no wrong desire I mean that's sensible that doesn't need interpretation but I just want you to to see that that the Bible spoke of the soul of man and how important that is you know for doing you'll find in Exodus 30 there about 12-16 let's just read that I I wanted to get to that scripture but I didn't get that far we'll get back to our message let's go to Exodus and I just like to read this one because you you find a lot is said about the soul all right look at Exodus I didn't give this to the brothers so if they don't get it up in time that's fine Exodus 30:2 says when thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number then shall they give Every Man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord now payment for each person that's how important the soul of man is it didn't even list and we know Soul means being a person all right but it didn't just say the body it was speaking of the Soul he gave it to to ransom for his soul unto the Lord when thouest them that there be no plague among them when thouest them this they shall give everyone that passes among them that are numbered half a shickle after the shle of the sanctuary a shle is 20 gas and high shle shall be the offering of the Lord everyone that passes among them that are numbered from 20 years old and up and above shall give an offering unto the Lord now watch this this is what I wanted to get to the rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than a high shle when they give an offering unto the Lord to make an atonement for their souls rich don't give no different than the poor that's what I was wanting to get to this morning but you know didn't have the time time run out on me but just think about it that a soul is so important until it was actually commanded of them to give a certain amount of money was given and that was for each person and if it wasn't given it said then the plagues and the things would come you know and all like that so they wanted everybody to do it it was 20 years of age upward but the rich don't give no more than the poor now that's uh you know that's kind of contrary to today's language cuz today the poor is one paying and the rich is not having much to do you know but that don't have anything to do with salvation all right but see I just wanted to get you to think about how important your soul is that God would actually give his own life rich or poor then make no difference doesn't matter whether we have money or don't have money whatever CU it's come by of me and we don't have to have no price that's right the price has already been paid see I wanted to get down to that but now see what we've done we've we've come down out of Heaven coming down to earth and we just picked up a couple of messages and what I'm trying to do do is get up to the time of of the Life of Christ and all in the doing and when he paid the price and all and maybe we'll get to that the Lord willing Wednesday but what I want you to think about this afternoon is The Book of Life now we read there in Revelations and you also find the same thing in Daniel that when you come to the Judgment there the white Throne judgment that there's books books not just one book it's books all right now but to make sure we keep it correctly we'll get to that in a minute and you'll see that it's all one book but it's many sections all right and if you want to study something on it you get a chance to read something if you would just turn in the church age book sometime and start reading at about page somewhere around 264 4 265 right in there and read on over through 286 I think as the light work comes down and just read that and you'll see a lot about names and how the names are are written and how they're removed and and the things that the prophet has covered it but I want you to think about this afternoon the book of life now I'm talking about the section of the book of life that is really just a natural things the brother Ram in I didn't bring this one but in that one where he calls it books he said now life is important to God and said he he records it said not that he has to he because he's omnicient on all of that he doesn't have to record but yet he does he records things now the Bible is the record of man Now list list is what I'm saying because you will say no it's the record of Christ all right that's right now that's the Eternal section but the Bible is a record of life you can take the Bible and you can read it you can find out so and so we got so and so and so and so but got so and so and it just goes on and on and it tells all of the things now brother randam said it like this he said Arman Neville may not be written in the Bible you know the name he said but it's written in there on what was taking place upon the Earth during the time of Arman Neville he said thereby then Arman Neville's name is in the Bible so now I want you to think about the writing of the Bible now I know I know the scriptures and go over Revelations you can get it pick it up the the Bible as far as the the writing of it it was written before the foundation of the world all right right cuz that was the lamb slain and all like that but I also want you to think about that for God to be able to be just and and uh where that nobody can't argue with you with him about anything and and it's not the fact that we do it but we're we're dumb enough as humans to try because even it says that when they come to Earth they'll say have not I done this have not I done that and he says depart from me I never knew you see there'll be people that'll be excuse me dumb enough to argue with God about life so he just records it then see he's this way and you read in the Bible and you find out how it started you find out all all of the things and the the prophet would call the Believers in the book all right but you know there's a lot in the Bible that's just natural writing like I said you go in there and you can find a genealogy so and so we got so and so so and so got so and so it's just a natural writing you can find a lot of things that it'll speak about Pharaoh it'll speak about Egypt it'll speak about uh those kings and the different things you know because it's a record written down that's contained within this one book that we call the Bible CU to me now this is The Book of Life right all right but it's also the Eternal book right it's the book of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world which is a record of eternal life amen all in one book no way in the world could a theologian of any kind and that's why I ask you because I don't want to get into that to preach on it we've done it before but brother random being what he was a prophet read that in the church age book he could tell you what each thing was and there's four different groups there to be covered in it and as he's covering it he said this is all one wheat plant well see we would try to make it a false Vine you know false looking outfit over here and a true seed over here but he said it's all one Vine it's all one thing and he can cover the whole plan of life and doings of speaking and talking about one wheat plant cuz you see when that wheat is planted and it comes up and you can't do away with that stalk you got to wait and that stalk stays but one day that stock could be burned right it's destroyed so then it's the record of it so if you will read that and you'll get more about what I'm trying to talk about but I want to talk to you about the writing of the Bible all right and see in that then you'll see that as it's written that it's a record your life is recorded in the book your name is may not be there but we're living in the age when we can read about lady OA we can read about the things that take place you know that puts our name right in the book but see God then he he does everything so perfectly until what he does he just lets mankind write a book called a Bible and in that Bible is the record of everything that we need but it's a record of the soul of man that was what I was getting at this morning then you'll find that there's a ratom as we read for that soul of that individual if that individual pays the price all right you said but now wait a minute you said a minute ago we have to pay no price all right we don't have to but there was a time you had to right that's the connection between the two Services all right there was a time you had to pay the price cuz that was in the Old Testament that was before the blood of Jesus Christ you had to pay the price right you had to make the sacrifice you had to do the things what was in the Bible written you had to do it amen you understand me see when you come to the New Testament now he done it but just keep the difference because the Old and New Testament is the Bible right it's the two wings of the eagle because if you don't eat away with either one of them you mess up right so then in the writing of the book now just keep that in mind as we're we're trying to go along we want to see how the book of life now remember I'm saying Book of Life God I want you to stay with me not in this going up into a spiritual realm I want you to stay with me in the natural writing see later then we can pick up the spiritual part and we can see the Christ as it comes down through there and it's there in the Old Testament but I want you to just look at the writing and watch how perfect how perfect God keeps a record as I said one ago he don't have to because it to White thr judgment as we read for using as a thought all he's got to do is just click and he can bring back the whole scene of our entire life right but yet he doesn't have to do that CU remember it gets down to a point that the man that came up you know he said well is your name written and if it wasn't written then you get cast out see and come find out his name wasn't written that's right all right so let's find ourselves yes now get my get my whole this is the whole point all right this is the whole point of the sermon if we can see how perfectly in order that God keeps everything and does everything and then we can see our El right there well brother I want to be in the New Testament all right but I I want us to look at our lives and think about your life and how you've been and what you've been as we go through the Old Testament part and compare some of the lives in a minute and see ourselves and see and look at ourselves as the writing of The Book of Life are you following me my point yes I want you to stay with me and not run up so spiritual you know and I don't mean that wrong now but see a lot of times when you preach in natural people believe they'll get over on the spiritual well natural spiritual don't always run totally together so you you you fall off of the point so let's get to Natural then we get to spiritual when we decide to change to the spiritual then we'll announce the spiritual cuz surely second Corinthians is getting over to the written Epistles all right but let's get this this natural and you look at it you can see the individual the soul of mankind and what was happening down through the Old Testament time to come out to see the writing of the Bible all right now so as I said we know for certain now that we can look at the lounge Book of Life and know when it was written but let's look at when it was actually written as far as natural concerned so Brothers go ahead and pull up number number one and just listen to your Prophet as he says these things this is taken from the invisible Union of the bride of Christ preached 1965 11 25 paragraph 308 there is your name on The Book of Life all right The Book of Life is the word of God because the word is God and God is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible became on word all right now so what is what are we looking at the book of life it's the word of God what is the word of God the Bible right this is the word of God all right now watch their names and what the names is is coming down and you'll get my point to see that we've got to look at the natural part so I can read here's what everybody wants to do now and I I like it too I like to read about David killing Goliath I like to be related to that don't you right all right but you know I I've also got to be related to his Natural Life Y and that's why I know for a certainty this is The Book of Life this is the Bible that we're talking about because like brother Rand said about when he would talk about Abraham lying and giv his wife away and all these things he said do you think that as strict and straight as those Jews are that they would write that down you know make a record of Abraham and the things he done of David and the things he done and all the things it proves that the Bible was written by God alone right you're listening cuz how would they admit about the thing things Abraham done when he's the father of the faith even their father the Abraham of the Jews they wouldn't admit that they kind of slide it around like cover up today you know well he wasn't quite as guilty as you think you he was this way or well all of us is kind of little guilty so who can condemn who for what you know see we try to change things but no God just wrote it down amen look father of our faith as we call him God wrote down that he lied and give his wife away right amen he made a record all right when it comes to judgment Abraham won't have to be judged that's right but you know what God can take what Abraham was as he was doing that and all those people have to be judged that's that's what I want you to get see then I want us to relate ourselves back there because we're no different right the Bible said Elijah was a man of what like passion as we are the great Prophet Elijah but yet he was just a human being that's right he's a mortal being just like me and you he wasn't know Supernatural great thing even Samson I was looking at Josiah had a thing down her today and I think it had Samson on it but had great big muscles and that but you know what he was just a little bitty Ruddy guy that was the amazing part he wouldn't no big Arnold Scher ever how you say his name you know I can't never get all that right but he was just little Ruddy guy little small f but when God came on him made a lot of difference he done a lot of natural things that was bad cuz that was his life but yet there was some good things wrote about him too right right so that's the way I want me and you to be go ahead and get to the next one let's get a little reading done and then we'll get back to her thought this is from the invisible Union the same message but it's paragraph 214 it says watch your name of your first nature was born and put in a Book of Life all your Deeds was wrote in it everything you done under that nature was put in a book called The Book of Life now think about it you notice in Daniel when he come to the ancient of the days whose hair was white as as wool 10,000 time 10,000s came with him to minister to him the the the bride then the books were open and another book was open which was The Book of Life see there is Saints already there the church to bride another book was open which was the book of life now the bride is sitting there she's the lamb Book of Life right you see what I'm getting at she's a Lamb's Book of Life she's the Eternal section she's sitting on the throne with him all right but there's books is going to appear this book this book right here has enough in it to condemn or to justify every person that is in the world or ever has been or ever will be all right so that's the point I want you to to what you're looking at cuz watch what the prophet comes down to go ahead in number three which is not communion 19651 1212 paragraph 44 like in the book here and the spot there we was talking about the two books being one The Book of Life The First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth see but then one time way back down in DIY he goes on down to that grain all right but I want you to get this other one look at CU this is where I'm talking about it comes from look at number 3A which is Page 283 of the church age books sard in church age Church age book and then the record cuz this is what he's saying here he says the two books being one we just read he said the two books being one now what is it is it two books or what is it so then then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce The Original Seed is in multiplied form is The Book of Life I repeat the history or record of this wheat plant is in the Book of Life of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life I remember a brother years ago me and he we were talking about this and he said he he I talking about the book and he was talking about he said brother it's two sections cuz he was a scholar on reading the church age book I won't call his name but I I don't I'm saying that in honor that he really knew that book and he said brother Dale it's two sections I said well I know the prophet said it's two books he said yeah but it's two sections if you go read the church a book you'll find it out well I went and read the church a book you know and I found out there's two sections that's what I'm trying to get you to see this Bible has two sections it is the natural life of mankind right it is a record of mankind it will be at the white Throne judgment to be there as a record all right but'll also be sitting on the throne that's the Eternal section but get the two section now get then what I want you to get is the writing of the book see then to look down through there and you'll see why God done the way he done he would take even like Abraham and he would lay a background and show the things you know that took place all right let's just go get in your get your Bible and let's go cuz I didn't give these to the brother to pull up but let's just read a little bit in the Bible but what I want you to see is the writing of the book and find ourselves in the natural writing we won't get to it this afternoon but if you'll read invisible Union of the bride of Christ I give you a quote in a minute where one leads out to the other but brother random actually covers it in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he covers it how that your name can be transferred right I doubt if we get that far okay but if we don't we'll get back to it later but look what it said in Genesis 5 you've got in Genesis 5 a lineage all right now this is in the Bible a lineage and that lineage begins as what this is the book of the generation of Adam all right Genesis 5 in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him in male and female then he goes on down eight days of Adam after he had begotten Seth so and so many years all right Seth lived 105 years and be get enus Seth lived after enus and we got Sons and Daughters all right then Seth was so long then enus was so long then it got Canaan all right get the point of what I'm saying it's a natural book The Bible has a lot of natural history that if mankind would just read the Bible they found the day missing in space of their calculation by reading the Bible right they find a lot of things because they got the genealogies is there all right then if you back up look at ver chapter 4 about verse 16 you'll find that it covers the the lineage of Cain and Cain went out in the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of n on East Cain knew his wife and and got a son and he named him enus and then it comes from enith to uh irad and I can't pronounce all them names but yet still it's a lineage all right if you got a scofi Bible if you'll look in the bottom notes of it a lot of time he'll tell you where these people went and what country was formed because they they know where they went to all right but I'm just trying to get you to look at something the natural life that we live is written right there in the book we can't argue it you said but my name's not there Paul said and such wor some of you he doesn't mind getting blunt about it does he we our natural life is written in the book our natural lineage you can take a lineage and you can trace that lineage of Mankind through the writing of the Bible are you following me as as man went along this was recorded and as these things took place it was recorded and we know before the foundation World God knew how to write and that was all fine but get the point also he wrote down the things you can follow that lineage until you could find what lineage or what is and what people came from what what country was formed from what lineage because it's a riding it shows the the the descendants of Cain which would cover The Descendants from the beast but it shows the descendants of Adam through Seth and those descendants all right it shows those things is coming down and and see people in this message that're they're quick to talk about a lot of lot of preachers are about lineages but what good today would it be to find out your lineage all these lineages is wrong whether it be of can from coming from the Beast or where it be a Seth coming from Adam the whole thing's wrong because it's no good then you come over to the flood and you got such a mixture until you're only have Noah and his three sons and each one of his wife coming across all like brother around and said then see people have thought that that uh being black was a curse that was put on Cain he said if that be right it would have ended at the flood right he knew how to put things together because he read the book all right he had read the natural book he could tell you the lineage of these things so we come over to the flood and we cross over and it's become so mingled together until you know it said that the sons of God saw the daughters of man and there were GS in the land and things like that and the flood took place it had so mingled to together until you can no longer follow a lineage right right now you jump over on the other side of the flood and you find Noah plant a Vineyard which me it took a year or so to you know a while cuz it said he planted a Vineyard Man live quite a while there but then you find in the scripture there that believe it's Genesis 9 that you'll find that ham saw his father's nakedness and of course everybody's got their own philosophy about that some of them call him a homosexual in this message people cuz you know that's where they think everything leads to but go ahead and put up number five brother Miss for but we don't worry about it go put up number five which would be paragraph 157 questions and answers number two and look what brother Ram said now ham he did he did not try to hide his father's nakedness but laughed and made fun of him and God put our curse on ham for looking at his father's nakedness and not trying to cover up his shame I first sermons to try to prove what took place there what did it matter is that the Revelation or is it like the prophet said he laughed at him well no no that's just too simple to think life well that's Bible all right he laughed at it okay you know what done God put a curse on H read your Bible there in in Genesis 9 he put a curse on ham that ham would be the servant cuz his two brothers took him walk backward and let covering over their father all right now what are you saying brother day I'm saying that was written naturally to where at least the prophet could come and give us the right understand understanding because from the natural we could see the spiritual all right see the natural Bible was written about Ham and The Descendants and whatever because it would come over and not show as we would look at it the seed of the serpent in the natural it would show what had already happened to humanity of the seed of the serpent right it would show not that's my ham was made a servant to bring over to show you the sin that started what about you and I how much have we like to make fun of people how much have we done in our lives you see why we could stop on each point cuz of what I want you to do I want you to see yourself back there cuz if we can't see ourselves back there in the writing of the natural we sure can't find out what we are in the spiritual so then what are we looking at God would make a servant out of a person that just Li it why because it would bring over not the seed of the serpent but the nature of the serpent come on we everyone have the nature of the serpent we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity SP my mothers w a liar we ever won but remember brother ROM did not say that we were born between Eve and the Beast that would have been a natural line that's right that would have been Cain in his Le but once it goes so far it becomes so mingled together you can't follow neither one of the DNA the lineage all right so then it becomes from that over to a spiritual condition or an existence that would show the nature of the serpent could run around didn't say we was born from the eve and the Beast he said we was born from Eve and the the serpent now I don't care how holy you think you are and how good your mother was and how good your daddy was and I'm not throwing off on nobody's lineage but if you could prove all the way back that your lineage is perfect and follow it all the way back which is impossible but if you could to go all the way back and find yourself in Adam remember in Adam all die right right so it wouldn't do any good but to find ourselves in the writing of the book The Old Testament even in the writing of of what they were doing God was making a record of these things because it would come over then is they saying you can't you can't say that ham was a descendant of the Beast come on if You' done that then you'd have to have at least least Noah's wife would have had to been a descendant of the Beast come on you see that's where it would mess up that's why brother R could be so blunt he said you think the curse made you black he said then that ended at the flood because you only had Noah in his descendants so everybody tries to make well this this you know it was this and this that brother R said that the seed of the serpent came over in the women you need that quote came over and the women what's he saying well now brother that what he saying one of them Ham's wife probably she sneaked around and run around a little bit and got pregnant before he got on up no no no no no I see you're theorizing something why why theorize it why not just take the straight TR truth of it the wound of the woman was polluted when the act with the Beast took place it was polluted anything she brought from there was death right you and I come we're death we're born dead amen right don't care how long you live you're born dead that's right cuz in the writing of the Bible it shows our lineage not of the natural doesn't matter about which lineage we come from that's what everybody said I've heard people say oh they preach too lineages so much they say oh if I was just just that one lineage even heard people say you know will me and my wife we'd have another child but said it might not be a true seed now what kind of a mentality is that let alone spiritual Revelation but it come from somebody planting a seed of a lineage if you happen to be a certain one boy us Americans that's what they're saying now that you can't argue about so many people coming over here because we everyone come over here will be black white red or green we all came over here from somewhere right right we wasn't original the indan is original so they what good would any of our lineages be right like I told you the the black people can at least run their back they can f figure they come from one of those Nations over there but show me where you come from what do you mean we come from England you think that when they sent that ships over here to discover America that they took all of the doctors and the lawyers and the the uh the rich people and the and put them on the ship and they sail to America no I'm sorry I don't talk I don't think that way they took the scum and then we wind up and that's what I tell you the America we're Caucasian now we're a concoction the best way to say it we're just a concoction we're a mixture of all kind of things what good lineage could come out of anything that's what I'm telling you the Bible's showing you you may think I make a joke out of that point it's not a joke it's a truth that's what the Bible's showing you the Bible's showing you the writing of the book is showing you that our lineages is not worth anything right right the writing of the Bible as it was written down through there with man coming forth is showing us that we're not worth anything I don't like you throwing off on my Mom and Daddy I ain't throwing off on your mom and daddy I'm just telling it like like it is your mama and daddy was they born without sin well no you admit that well then they're Sinners that's why we all need salvation amen but we look at something like ham and try to theorize a point to bring it across instead of just looking at it like it is everybody on that Ark was perverted right I don't like it throwing off on Noah I'm not thr off on Noah Noah could hear that he said amen the guy that brought us over died a drunk right right see we get into all of the things to try to theorize some some but why not just look at the Bible and see how it was written and see ourselves that's the point I'm trying to get us to look at see see ourselves in the writing of the book that's me no that wasn't me that that was that was that was Cain and and and that was no that was me cuz that's the way I got my start in natural life so the Book of Life is covering me as to what I am all right then the Bible is a record of mankind on earth right it's the record of mankind on earth now are you witht me to that then we'll move on to what I'm trying to get it's our record it's looking back there and seeing where we started and all those things had to be written as I said about the Kings and what they done and the lineages and you get over there to where you just got chapter after chapter after chapter of so and so we got so and so so and so we got so and so so and so we got so and so I told you first time I read the Bible you know you're supposed to in the Baptist to get you a little star you know just read the Bible give you a little star well I read all that you know I got tired of reading so and so we got so and so and so and so we got so and so and so and so we got so and so and so and so we got so and so but you know I couldn't turn over a page cuz I couldn't say I read the whole book right right that's why I read every one of them all right I'm not joking I'm I'm telling it like it is but it's a lineage it's a lineage of mankind it shows where we come from and where our origin where we're at and they they can people that can take that and show you exactly where that those moabites come from they can show you where that Syria where it come from they can show you where the EG Egyptians and where they come from right out of the book to show their lineage you can show Israel and where they came from right out of the book but that ain't all of the book cuz I said that's two section but that's the writing of the natural see our lives in the natural then we can begin to relate but that's where everybody wants to go but R you know I was in Abraham when he done this I was in David when he killed the bar I was in that's all that's all the point we want to read but the natural story is our life see because if you ain't careful you can spiritualize the things on the other side and it looks like they don't even need a new birth but remember we all do remember your Prophet is one that said he said it doesn't matter whether it's priest king or who it is he said I was born to hybrid people don't like them quotes that's not degrading to anybody that's telling it like it is we were all in that situation amen and as the the things were taking place but like I said now you you check what I'm talking about the this is what I found out after coming to message so brother Randon would read scriptures and he'd read a scripture about something you know and say that's right in the middle of so and so we got so and so and maybe the next verse is so and so we got so and so and I thought you know if there was no other reason for WR in all of those genealogies right there is one verse in the middle is that all there is to the Bible is the one verse that's the point I'm trying to get you to see or is the whole if the Bible the whole thing showing the natural life and then showing the the part that we lead out to be a spiritual life showing us to be what would be the true thing could now back up to where we were this morning about the soul why is it then you find that a man named Abram ordinary human being right a man named Elijah man after like passion anything special about it oh but brother Dale you just don't see that that was that seed that was that seed what seed they can't even prove where Elijah come from right come on you're a prophet you said well he's got to be a gentile but he said there's no lineage but you see then we look at Abraham and we like to look at stuff like that because we call them the True Believers brother said the Believers in the book see then Abram being a man ordinary man how many people did God deal with in the days of Abraham we say oh he only dealt with one where where's your thought of that why would you have that thought when God would that all men be saved but you see there was something about the man Abram that was different and you know what it was a longing in his heart are you back with me this morning David said my soul thirst after thee amen what's the difference in David and anybody else what's the difference in David and any other Jew as we'd call them Israelite what was the difference in Abram than anybody else that was around the Bible said he believe God it didn't say his lineage was right come on it didn't say that he was a good man said he believe God see then now you can start picking up the Believers that's in the book yeah but how high are you going to pick them up because remember none of those Believers back there had the new birth right they were just normal human beings they were not as set aside certain type of people now as I said can we associate with the writing of the natural book to see our lives and how what we are just a bunch of garbage cans but can you pick up now and begin to see that because of that soul in that man because that man for some unknown reason he could believe God well you know what let me quote brother random you know that God expects you to believe the impossible is it right he expects you to believe the impossible we are the children of God he expects you to believe that we are his offspring he expects you to believe that you don't have to try to explain it right right Abraham or Abram as we started when he started out he couldn't explain nothing I'm sure everybody back there had a worship of God or something and really the story behind Abram was that his daddy was a a maker of Idols to sell the people to become their gods and the Jewish story goes behind it to show that Abram got all upset one day and he said well ain't none of these worth anything he begins to bust up the whole place and he had one that evidently he didn't bust up or whatever now this is the Jewish story and when his daddy come back you know what happened he said well all these Gods got in battle with each other and they just fought it out and this one guy won well whether it be a true story or not it gets the point something about a man named Abram from way down with inside of him he began to think and he began to wonder what is man why was we made like this you remember this morning that job said I'm not a I'm not a sea you know I'm not just water and then he said I'm not an animal in other words what is man see the real part of man is that soul that you are that part of your being that longs after God that's what God looks at like I said how many people did he talked to in the days of Abram but they didn't long after but here's a man that he just hears a voice he doesn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's not something Supernatural some kind of he's just a man he hears a voice so get out of here leave this place and go to a place you ain't never been well even if he's helping his daddy make H you had to live it right so the guy gets up takes his family and just moves out where we going I don't know he didn't tell me where to go who's he the one that spoke to me his wife probably looked at him and said he ain't spoke to me maybe his daddy said that some went with him you remember there was lot and things like that but you know what they finally believed him and I guess it come down to the bases really it was almost I'm just natural just tell it like it is story it probably come down to the bases they said we can't stay here and if he's going I guess we might as well get up and go with him oh yeah he even though we don't know where we're going we see he didn't know where he's going either I used to read that I used to love to read the Old Testament I used to preach from it you know and and I preach kind of seriesly like I do now the travels of the children of Israel and how they'd get in the place that was called the way and how they would go over here and and then theyd come back and they cross that pth again and they' get on and they'd run as straight a while and then they'd go off and then then they come back and you just you just follow yourself down through life you know and that's what I'm trying to do today is get this me and you to look at it was anything special about you oh I was so good until God come to then the other side says I was so bad did he come down now what was that we certainly don't believe as the preachers of the message a lot of them try to preach is I come here with eternal life I don't believe that I believe you come here with representation of predes from predestination by predestination I believe that that God knew how to cross your path the prophet would say it but what made you any different I mean it was anything special or heard did one day something just spoke to you right something just spoke to you you listen Maybe to a tap or you heard somebody preach and something just spoke to you something said get up and move time for you to go you played around long enough get up and go well you know he don't always argue with us either does he I mean did he come down about 15 times and tell you get up and go or maybe told you one time get up and go and the next time he might tell you if you don't get up and go you have problem he might do the second part but he don't come back three or four times times you see there was something about that man if you want to make anything about Abram there was something about that man in his soul the inner part of his being that he was did he believe God why did you come in this message was it because somebody could out argue other people why did you choose to come in this message why did you choose to come to Lula well a know where's else to go that's a good point hang around act while you leave and somebody else will come in cuz this thing ain't built off of mankind right it's like I told Richard when he was dating Anna I said I don't want you in Georgia because that you're marrying my daughter that's a good point but I I want you to hear in Georgia because God speaks to Your Heart by the word what about it we talk about the writing of the Bible of of the things like Abraham or David or someone like that or the prophets but what's so different about them men something spoke down inside of them in their soul right what about Moses great man with his natural ability he would have been able to went back down and took over Egypt now remember he was the ruler of the army at one time he could have caused an Insurrection he could have caused all kind of things could have took over and then just give Israel the whole land of Egypt but the Bible said he suffered the things of Christ would have been a very easy thing to have done it that's why I've always believed and maybe you don't agree with it that's all right why didn't that Pharaoh set the a what his name is the boy that was raised up with Moses he knew who that guy was standing out there he one that rote him off why didn't he just wind up and say cut that man's throat I mean he was King who was going to argue with him why did he let Moses get by what he was doing I've always told you my opinion whether it's any good or not that man was afraid of him he wasn't afraid of his God he may have wound up to end up being afraid of his God because of all he done but he wasn't afraid of his God he was quick to say throw them sticks down and let them become snakes just like you bring it I don't bring it you wasn't afraid of that but he was scared of one thing he thought I run this guy off is supposed to be dead for some reason he's appeared back here instead of appearing back here then there's something about this thing I need to think it over but he mainly was afraid of him because he knew that all he had to do was cause an Insurrection he could take over if he had killed Moses it would have been the biggest Slaughter had ever been cuz there was a lot of people would have believed Moses he wouldn't have been fighting just the Jews he would have been fighting his own armies yep that Moses had led right but what was the difference in Moses he heard God speak one day right just like Abraham heard God speak something down inside of the man he heard God speak what's it difference in you and all the other people in the world now they're going to church they're claiming Christianity so don't don't let on that realm of just you know but how come was it you just kept coming higher and higher and higher you may have started out maybe we all started out in a realm like churches or anything but what made it different to where that we just never was satisfied that true I never come in this message because it could somebody could out argue I used to lay the books down I'd lay him down every morning when I get in from work and brother Mo would be talking to me and he gave me some books and things I used to lay the book and the Bible down together I used to say now God this Bible said there'll be false prophets this man that they claim to be a prophet says they will be false prophets what if he's one of them you didn't never pray that way he didn't spend hours trying to explain it to me something spoke I believe in my soul and I wasn't even born again at the time okay something spoke I believed I was I thought I was I was a good Baptist Deacon and teaching all of the classes and adults and everything like that but I come find out I wasn't born again but something said with inside of me he said what does the Bible say that's the only answer I got I've heard people talk about how they argued with God God said this they said that God said this it's all right that just ain't my case he always just drops down and he says a word or two and then he's gone told you how I studied out something that I thought was right in the message one time and I had notes written down and I would have challenged anybody about it cuz I had the Bible in the prophet's quotes and I sitting there looking at them and a voice inside of me said if you do that you make your type greater than your antitype I immediately destroyed those notes and burn every shred of them but I didn't want nobody to ever think or see anything about what it was how about that little Ste small voice andite Elijah in the cave Thunders and the Lightnings all of the things the other prophets went by and he went by them at times where winds with joob did he talk about where winds the prophets talk about those things but none of that contacted Elijah but a still small voice spoke with inside of him we're talking about the writing of the Bible we're picking up now to the spiritual form of what you want to call it the children of God coming forth as to looking more like the children of God but still not able to come forth with a new birth cuz it was not time but to show that mankind that's where I've always believed it What Makes You Different cuz you can believe God what makes you believe in one God when the world can prove a trinity maybe and we used to talk about our own Trinity right A lot of people in the message still in the trinities what makes it different why can't you follow these two Souls Two Lords River Jordans why can't you follow those forms when they're big names and very popular a lot better preacher than I that's not a joke people that can keep you Spellbound by their anointings and their words the wi that you don't believe can you relate back there in your own life today can you relate back there with Abram that a voice is get up and leave the country he just gets up and leaves Sarah says where are we going he I don't know my mother came out when I left the Baptist Church after I made my farewell speech I'm sure they really thought a lot about it but I got up and told him I had something to say and I got up and told him and I said I can't stay here I got to move on my mother came out and you think I don't love my mother she come out she said where are you going my oldest brother came out my father figure because my dad died when I was four my oldest brother said where are you going I said I don't know I said I know where I'm going to for a while listen I don't know where I'm going well are you a preacher I don't know my brother was he would have done it he said we'll build your church if that's what you want said that ain't what I want I don't know whether I'm called to preach or not I just know that God's called me to move away I don't know where I'm going what I'm going to do I know where I'm going to church for a while say there something about a Christian and listen folks that was before I was born again but something was still speaking you say you mean to tell me that that God will speak to a person that's not a Christian sure done a lot of talk in the the Old Testament that's the point I'm trying to get you to see amen he sure spoke to a lot of people back there and directed them in a lot of ways don't you think he could could direct us just a little bit amen well how did you find out brother Dale that you wern't born again because everybody else you know com to the message they say well the Holy Ghost what led me in the message so I'm must have the Holy Ghost I believe the Holy Ghost led me into the message but the Holy Ghost is one that told me I wasn't born again you say well how did that happen the little still Small Voice that told me to leave the Baptist told me I wasn't at the place I thought I was right that I needed a new birth I listened to him I wasn't like most of the people of this message well what do you mean I come into the message what else you want Lord you know that's the way I still think I still wait for that little still Small Voice I didn't have one note written for this message but on Brother Richard Wilson's tape last night cuz I thought about going some way which way to go and brother richer started talking about the book of life and the things or something in the form in the message and the little voice said you speak about the writing of the book that's what I'm doing so I don't come here and preach to you until I got a thought I can just that's easy of me to come here and tell you don't have nothing we just that somebody else can preach or or we'll sing songs and PR tape and we'll go home or whatever that's no problem with me but he's never failed I've been sitting in the office and get a message now I don't agree with getting too many of them from Walmart you get a lot of messages there you'd like to preach but you know the people that's there is not hearing them and the people that are here you know but listen Abraham get up I don't understand it I just get up and go David you can bring out a lot about David in many different ways but you know he had a little closer point because he was anointed to be king and he knew if he made it to a line and a bar that God must have a reason in his life he's anointed to be king well he knew one thing for certain whether it be Goliath or anybody wouldn't going to stop him from being King right right cuz he believed that Prophet right what about it do we believe this Prophet do we believe this Prophet that said as I've given you the quote the other night this bride is going to prove to Satan that she won't believe his lie amen right she's going to prove it to him she won't believe his lie same lie he told in heaven the same lie that he told Eve tell we going to believe that he said things look so bad look at a sick and and all kind of things what's that got to do with it right but you see I still believe one thing the prophet of God said there's going to be a bride's Revival not for the world no but a bride's Revival I still believe where he said the sick would be healed the dead would be raised limbs would be restored I still believe that why cuz something spoke to me one day by way of a prophet how about ever talk to you now brother D God don't talk to nobody but a prophet well I know what camp you're in you know I know where you're from you want me to bring out your point you're the guy that was standing back there talking to Moses one day and said you think you're spiritual you think the word don't come to us also and God said okay line up let's see speaking through the prophet Moses right line up and let's see who sides on what but it's like I've always told you you ain't going to convert nobody because even in that natural Story one time there that the ground of believe opened up what wasn't that the one and the next day is that the same one the next day they come to Moses and said you kill the people of God that's right now how carnal dumb whatever would be the word for it could be in a human mortal that one day could see the ground open up at the voice of a man and then come back and tell him he killed the people of God goes for certain they didn't hear that voice right why can't we believe that God talks to mankind didn't he tell you this message was right th must have spoke to you but are you following me I'm running late now cuz I got off my notes and started preaching see the records of the prophets Elijah so forth and all they just took and that Soul the words that come into their being and the Bible said that that God spoke in times past Hebrews one in the prophets so came into that soul of that individual until that man would stand and speak back out until even it would look like that he was God and he was in the first person at those times Isaiah would write they pierce my hands and my feet or p is WR what about it but then here is what people see they see John the Baptist arising a man that never done a miracle right right wound up with a handful of converts is that true right but he was told what would happen and he'd see the Holy Ghost descending he believed it that's right right he went out there and he introduced the Lord Jesus Christ to the world right in the book all right then that Lord Jesus Christ came I'll have to bypass all this and get it later the Lord Jesus Christ came on the scene which was the book you agree but you know that didn't stop the writing of the book because it produced what was there that it said it would produce that didn't stop the writing you got the book of Acts written true of the Holy Ghost coming in the church speaking through the people all right it's where was at over in Revelations 2 there so you say well the writing of the book stopped no it didn't stop because you've got Peter James John Jude all of them as they begin to write what God Said it was about their own lives and things the writing of the book and it got into a spiritual condition by then through the baptism of the Holy Ghost how much more sure would we believe that to be the book as we would to compare to those who were back there that didn't have the new birth how much more would we believe that Paul was speaking God's word over the fact of believing Moses spoke God's word cuz Moses was a man but without the baptism of the Holy Ghost Paul was a man but by the new birth could speak the very words of God all right that didn't end the writing of the book CU John goes to patas and he writes Revelations 2 and 3 and he tells about the church ages and what each Church age would be and what they were doing we could spend all afternoon preaching about how we would be related to those things well brother Dale that come in over in the Book of Revelation and it finished no sorry you didn't listen to the scripture that read cuz it said ye are written Epistles know and read of all mankind God is still writing his book you are the final Pages now the Book of Revelations I no that carries on down through the natural and the things we are the last words written in this book because I thought we believed that the prophet of God said let be be a book of Acts written about the bride of Christ he said it just won't be nobody to read it that's his words right won't be nobody here to read it because is a finishing up amen God's still writing God's still talking God's still leading how do you get where you're at that's right well I just decided to go H it wasn't you decided why you wind up driving so far to get here like Rick saying you hitch maybe didn't hit here you know you can't explain it can you you can't explain the soul of an individual and how that soul of that individual can believe God you know that you're expected to believe that somebody will be changed in a moment at twink of an eye but that's what God Said would take place you're expected to believe that God will descend from heaven with a shout the voice of an archangel or the trumpet calling you're expected to believe that the bride will be the final voice to the final age under her messenger you expected to believe a lot of things expected to believe that God speaks to you yes still in that same soul that he started talking to Abram that same soul that he spoke to Abel and said give an offering of a lamb you know but what there's many voices so Cain heard one so spoke inside of the soul of Cain and said make a beautiful altar which one's right Abel's voice that he heard and the things that happen will compare with every scripture in the Bible canes will not so we know which one's right there's many voices the scripture says in this last days they got many doctrines flying in the message how we going to know the truth brother Dale how do you check out things come on musicians how do you check out things brother Dale you've heard me how many times I check a Doctrine by my new birth what else can I check it with you say quotes they can quote you quotes like quotes right I check it by my new birth now who you to check anything well I'm me who are you I check it by my new birth because if they speak anything contrary to what happened to me in the new birth I know one thing for sure if what I've got is right they're wrong but if they're right then I'm wrong and I've been hearing some wrong voices what about you no it's a voice of God because it always speaks so nice and sweet God don't always speak nice and sweet right sometimes he says sit down shut up do what I said oh but no brother Dale you've never heard the voice of God it is just so sweet and lovely amen I've heard it but I've also heard him when he had to tell me get straightened up amen that's right let's stand together I told you about the time that I was there home and boy I was just having me a pity party and I was really just you know things was going wrong here and I was praying about it and doing everything in the book and trying to help and everything and oh about having me a pity party and I started out the road just driving I was just going I didn't know what to do and I started driving out the road and I met one of the kids I remember way ter one said where you going Daddy I said I'm just going down the road I'll be back after a while I went down the road and I got nearly to maaz well about 5 miles and I was really crying and sincere I thought about that time something began to talk inside of me said who you think you are did you think you're going through troubles he said is any of the troubles you're going through in any comparison to what I went through and said besides you know in other words I could be causing what's going on to find out what you would do I turned around and I cried all the way back I'm still crying now about it because he said who do you think you are you think you're going through more troubles than I've ever been through it's me that they're speaking against it's not you makes a lot of difference same crying but a lot of difference what is man oh and can we see ourselves in the writing of the book as being a people that all the way down through there could hear the voice of God and believe it that's the only difference between us and anybody else we could hear that voice and believe it go ahead 612 in this spiral book anybody have a need the altar is open as the dear man the my

more on record than it's ever before and that year in Gainsville he gave the record of it most it had ever rained in the month of August cuz see he said you say it but you see sometimes we got to get down before we can look up right my wife's been so sick with that hurting in her side and everything and just you know you pray you do everything you have everybody to pray some of you are sick sickness is among us we need healing we need Deliverance this is what I said I said Lord I give everything I got walk out of this house with my clothes on my back and not have a thing in the world and be head over heels in debt and get me two three jobs to go to work to pay if you just come down do something see maybe he's waiting on us maybe he's waiting on us to say it he knows I meant that that wouldn't matter to me it wouldn't change me money don't mean nothing to me but you see I can't bargain with him neither can you there's no need to try don't try to bargain with God about nothing stand on his word and say I take your word I'm Healed and I'll speak it from my own mouth I'm Healed why can't we believe it that way and stand on can you say it from your heart all of us that are sick we
