Open the Eyes Open the Eyes my heart I want to see I want to see you see you high and lifted up running when the light of your glory oh you are in love we sing Glory Glory Glory lifted up huning in the lot of your glory your power and love we sing GL Glory holy oh holy holy holy holy holy Ho Holy hly yes Lord Jesus how many wants to see him amen look around you're looking at him the brides right here we're here amen amen it's a great honor and privilege to be here brother D spoke with my wife a few years ago in total that's two or three places and I knew my father-in-law and my my grandpa thought of you and brother Homer and brother JT and so well and I thought you know God I don't I don't never desire to be anything big he said just be in your place amen and do what you asked me to do but that was a heart's desire of mine and to be at a meeting like this it's it's touching to me I I really appreciate it and yall pray that some of my nerves are slide out the way my wife's had to put up with me for two weeks scared to death so y'all be with me uh and pray with me you want to turn to 1 Corinthians 12 and 2 I read two or three scriptures here and then we'll let you be seated I thought brother JT was going to just go ahead and preach what I had laid on my heart I titled this a living God Amen and our brother Homer hit a couple of things over the last couple weeks it's just kind of really brought this together and really in inspired it on my heart and I believe I believe we all need to see a living God I look around and I was talking to a friend at work and we just talking and he don't claim to be a Christian at all and even he makes the comment I just want to see something real I I can look at the Baptist I can look at the Methodist I can look but show me something real show me something that God's moving today like he was then and then I just heard I think last yesterday evening on the way home from work or out in the yard I had the iPod on and I heard brother Brandon make a statement on the message thirst and he makes a statement and he he he says that statement he says you know if you you you say that you would do something if you lived in Jesus's day right he said you do live in Jesus's day his word is being fulfilled today the same as it was in the body then is the same as it is today and if you won't do it today you wouldn't did it then you would have crucified him then just like you would today so I think First Corinthians here chap 12: 2 and it says you know you were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as you were LED and I thought that was us you turn over to 1 Thessalonians 1:9 I thought us being Gentiles we look for something to fill we look for something to touch the Gentile Nation always looked for something they could feel something they could touch a image of gold or something 1 Thessalonians 1:9 says for they themselves show us of what manner of entering in we had unto you and know that you turned to God from Idols to serve the living and true God what caused them to turn they saw something real right they would didn't see another put on they didn't see another example that could they saw something real and a living God amongst them and turn over to Matthew 16-16 very familiar they sitting there is they sitting there and Jesus asked his what does men say the son of man am and Peter's answer he says and Simon Peter answered and said there art the Christ the son of the Living God what caused him to see that by Revelation he saw it but what made him see is because he saw God glory living in flesh right and if we can't see God living in flesh today what Have We Done Right we've turned the whole word of God into another example or into another story and brother brandham says says neither can we be saved by historical God we cannot add to we cannot add the joy of the Pentecostal fire unless it's the same fire today we cannot serve a historical God and what God is what good is it to you the God that was in Christ he isn't the same God today that he promised to be then these scriptures friends now Shake Yourself a little bit don't be Emer just wake up right yourself are second it's the truth right and I thought of that and what good would this message the are be if he wasn't a living God right exactly if he wasn't amongst us if he wouldn't do the same for me and you right that he did for our Prophet what good would it be right because then it would make his own word void and a lie just say a word of prayer Lord Jesus we asked you Lord to Lord to come Lord somehow Lord Jesus and use a a vessel Lord speak something in your word Lord Jesus that you may encourage us Lord to let us see that you're living amongst us Lord Jesus bless these words Lord bless the thoughts you laid on My Heart Lord be with us in your name we pray amen you be seated but I thought of that and I thought as I talked a couple weeks ago I S that talking with my friend and he says just give me something real yeah just give me something alive yeah and I looked you know and and and I looked up I'm not a smart person but living there means alive it means fresh right it means active it means right now it don't mean tell stories we we've talked about it we we talk about all the stories that brother Brenham did in his meetings we talk about all the things that brother Brenham did and we tell them but what good is that to my children what good is that to my generation we wasn't alive in the 60s we don't know what it was to live in the 60s we don't know them circumstances what is God today doing what is he doing amongst us today I I look at different ones and and going to Camp you know and having the talk with Sarah them about Amy look at a living God stand before us look at a living God look at your life talk of your life and I think of that I think what what must we do to have the Living God living in us what must we do and it's the same as it always but God's word never changes he said to Matthew 7 he says You must be born again it's very simple you can't go on half-heartedly you can't go on half serious you got to be sincere with God you got to come before him in Acts 238 and you got to repent and that's not just come to an altar and say oh God I need to be better right that's not just come to an altar and say oh God I wish I could be like so and so yeah no we want to be like Christ we want to see that Living God that lived through him live through us we want to see it to a point that our brothers Peter stood there and say you are the son of the Living God there's no question we want that amongst ourselves that we see each other look and say brother Dale you have to be a child of the Living God your life vindicates who you are God is living because of you God is living because of me and you God is alive today but he's alive in our hearts and I think of that it says acts 238 says be baptized and you shall receive the Holy Ghost that's his Spirit that's not one another spirit I look around and I see so many people says well I just want to be like this brother or I just want to be like I want to be like Christ I don't want to be like nobody but Christ I want him to live through me so much G that that that you can see it when I enter a room you can see my God enter the room with me each one of us has got to get to that and I look at that and I think what does it take takes a complete surrender it takes a complete surrender away from everything this person wants why is it that we can look at the other denominations and we can look at other churches and we don't see a real God because Saturday it's all about football then Sunday it's all about God and then Monday it's all about getting promoted and then Tuesday it's all about how much money I can make and then Wednesday they all we back to church no God lives seven days a week he's with us every day of the week he's with us in everything that we do that's the live God the God is that when you're at your most inconvenient time God nudges your heart and you answer to him you answer to him no matter what circumstances is going on the job's falling apart around you but you feel God and I was talking to a brother this morning and I jotted it down and he he he was listening to a message and he he texted to me he said brother bham says may you get so lost in Christ that he can simply knot his head and you're ready to go he don't have to and you know brother Brenham goes on down when he says that he says not have to be pushed around like me and I thought what about this this is our Prophet this is the one that we claim has brought the angel the message and he has but even he said don't be like me and have to be pushed around by God be so in tune with God let God live through your everyday life that in the worst situation all he has to do is knot his head right and you're ready for battle and you're ready for battle but you got to be in tune with God for that you can't get caught away with all of the life and the carage you can't get caught away with everything going on around you you got to give it to God and you got to say you know they say well well you know we got yeah but how many of us is really wanting find things here and to lose heaven what's our struggle what do we want you know I I I saw a little demonstration one time and and the guy had a rope and this rope wrapped around the church building and on the end of it was about an inch with tape on it and he says all of us are more concerned about this inch of our life than we are the eternity in heaven we get so caught up we in includes me we get so caught up with the daily carries we get so caught up with trying to better oursel that we lose focus on God that's why God can't live through us that's why God's asking us be born again that's why Jesus said you must be born again there's no other way lose who you are and gain Christ once born again we are manifested Sons and Daughters of God we are fulfilling his scripture you know I think of that and I think you know look look down Through the Ages I think of uh coming up I was speaking to my wife about the Book of Daniel and I was looking at Daniel and how the king chose Daniel Shadrach mesach and abendigo he picked them out to be in their position he lifted them up into appointments he laid the people look up to him because of their God but it just wasn't just a few days and now all of a sudden he's wanting to kill him again all of a sudden Daniel prays and he prayed to another God and he wants to kill Daniel or this and don't do this or or this and don't bow but it always turns back the king never got born again he got blessed from being around Daniel and the people when he saw it he couldn't deny it he says you're you are you serve the god of the Living God you serve the only true God but what was it he never got born again right he got touched he got blessed he got a miracle happened before his eyes he got turned towards God but he never went out the way and I look and I think and I look around and I talk to different and I I I just I love young people and I talk to kids and I and I look and I say God that's that's what we're lacking today we're raised in the message we know the scripture we know the quotes we know all of this we know we know that brother Brenham did this we know that Jesus did this we know we know that you're supposed to come to the altar so we come to the altar out of obligation We Lay It an altar that's what our parents told us that we had to do we get baptized because the Pastor said you needed to be baptized but it's never sunk into our heart we've not been born again come on and I look you know I think once you born again you can't wait to be baptized you can't wait to be filled with the Holy Ghost and you'll do whatever it takes I look at amen I I look at I look at a football player and a football player would take an NFL football player he plays 7even months eight months what whatever it is but it's a 365 day of fire with him every day he gets up on a strict diet every day he's got a strict workout plan because he wants to be the best what about Christians do we live every day of our life wanting to be the best Christian what about Christians what do we do what do we do do we do we struggle along and woe is me and excuse after excuse or do we wake up every morning and say God I'm a child of a king and God you know you live through me and I know you're going to live through me today now what can I do for you today I'm at your service I'm reporting for Duty what what can you do for me today and I think you know Paul says but uh greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world brother Homer preached a message the other night that just touched me so much because you read with brother Brenham says we're not getting this so I don't think we understand this we in catching revelation of that we've read it and it's become common to us we know what it says we all can quote greater is he that's in than me than gr than him that's in the world but you know what that means that means there's a living God living in your soul that means there's nothing that can turn you down that means that you can stand on his word and and you take back to Shadrach mesek and ab bandigo and he says we not we not careful to question to answer you King we're not careful to answer you because we know our God is the Living God and we know if he wants to keep us out of the fire he'll keep us but if not he wants us to go home so here I am persecute me here I am put me through a trial but no we don't want to do that no no we don't we don't want fights but to be victorious you must fight to be victorious you must fight and I think of Shadrach M and bendy go there and I think of their life and I I think of the position they're in there and I think how often we we refer back to that that story we we refer back to that story and what it means to us but you know if they wasn't willing to do it that' never been a story that's right that's right if they wasn't so caught up with God they could have never had a win a victory like that that's right if they wasn't so caught up in in what God was doing in that day they would have probably bowed down and asked for forgiveness later and would have never got that story but that story was given for you and I that we might know that in this day right we can stand up that's right that we can stand up and we can say on your word I Stand Alone God on your word you said this is right though the world's against me though everything here is is forsaken me I'm going to stand on your word and you said you would be here with me you said you'd be here but he can't come until you do that that's right he can't live amongst us until we take a stand for him that's right he can't come into your heart until you take a stand for him that's right what it says acts 238 says you you shall receive it but he didn't say when you'd receive it brother Brenham said he'd put you to the test he'd say if you serious how many of us we don't get it immediately and next thing you know we're right back in the world oh well maybe they're not right back in the world but maybe we just go back to that bitter Spirit or maybe we go back to that jealousy maybe we go back to the little things that hunt us oh my but look at us we must first make that step God needs you and I to take that step he needs you and I to step on that Faith even when we don't know what we're doing right he needs you and I to step out there and say God you you said I'm here now what would you have me do and depend on him to give it I says what's what stops us from doing that unbelief because we really don't believe what we're saying we believe I look and I think you know it's so easy to repeat the words God I love you but do I mean it right do I do I really mean it because to love somebody you want to give you all for them when me and my wife got married I you know you know I didn't even care about me for a while I just wanted her happy I just wanted her happy I wanted to to do something because I had to win her away from her daddy and that wasn't easy so I had to do something to make her love me I didn't realize the whole time that that love went the other way that she was doing the same for me but God loves you am and God desires to give everything he has unto you than but do you love him that much look at our examine ourselves and look at our own daily lives do we really give to him we don't oh my I got down on the bed last night and prayed and I got through and my wife says God forgive us for our slowful cuz do we really pray that sincer sinly every night or there's so many nights it's to lay you down and say oh God help us let us deep good we'll see you in Tom morning Lord I'm human do we really love him with everything in us right do we really desire to give him our all come on or just what we want to give him that's right because if you're only wanting to give him what you want to give him he can't live through you that's right he's got to have your full being that's right he's got to have everything about you he's got to have your thoughts he's got to have your desires he's got to have your wishes he's got to have your difficulties he even wants them but we got to give them to him he says he's laying there just dying to heal you but you won't ask right and then you might ask but you don't believe right he's waiting on you to get in line with him so that he can give it to you right he desires to be a living God amongst his flesh he says I'll never be without a witness his bride is his witness today his bride is been is a spoken word before the foundation of the world it was spoken that'd be a bride in this day that would not that would not sin that would not fall away from God that would hold true would not be deceived and would Rapture out of here that's his word and his word has to be manifested that's right he cannot lie I think unbelief or doubt we doubt him why do we doubt him we doubt him because of our our own reasons and intellect sure we get cancer the doctor says you're going to die in 6 months we go okay I'm going to die and we've doubted God now because God said cancer is nothing it's just another Affliction put your confidence in me and let me live through you let me make you a living example that all your family you know they may they they may think you're crazy for believing that cult they may think you're crazy for following that man but when it comes to God healed you of that cancer they going well something's up there God did something for you there there's a living God manifested to us there's a living God manifested amongst us if we'll let him and I thought the other thing is as our own intellect we become so smart that we use our intellect to reason out of the blessings of God we've become so smart that we can't even take him at his word anymore somebody comes up and says you know the Bible says that by my stripes you was healed and our own intellect says yeah but he also said that no no no no he didn't say he said by my stripes you heal stand on it and see if God don't heal you brother Brenham said in 62 hear you himm he said if you notice before Israel was caught out of Egypt Moses had tried to do that believing he was the person and and that was G that was to give the message see there's there's Moses Here Comes Moses and Moses knew he had a revelation that he was him he was the man to give the message but he tried to do it with his own will by an intellectual standpoint but before the time was right and I think you know I've did the same thing I've seen God move I've seen God tell me stuff and I've rushed into it that's right and I waited on his time and it falls apart like it did in Moses here and I think that and I think you know 1957 I come across brother Bram said he says there's two fraction of this message one's going to get stiff starchy and inct stiff starchy and intellect and I look around and I think yeah that's you know all this craziness that's coming against the bride that's that's what they are that's right every time you try to say the prophet said this they said yeah but the the prophet said this yeah but I've read this yeah yeah but the prophet said this against that and they try to conict his words with their own intellect on he says the other side of what Plum over the deep end Lord and I think look at our time this was 1957 he made that statement he was a prophet he was a Seer he saw where this message was headed to he saw that there was a true message there was a true bride but he also saw that and you look at it today and it don't take a genius to look around and see what they've done with this message they've tried to take it brother Brenham said many times other than that he said if if the devil can't get you to come out he'll push you overboard right and what have they done with it theyve pushed it overboard he goes on down he says but when the time got right and and and there was a visitor came from heaven and it was God himself and he came in the burning bush and he spoke to Moses and he sent him out I believe that every man before he goes on the field to preach the gospel ought to First have that experience with God it goes on down he says and he he quotes the scripture that be high-m minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God and I've read that scripture so many times and just recently it's really started Dawning on me where are we at look around not in the denominations look around in the message what have we done we become so spiritual we become so highminded in our own knowledge we become so big that we forgot God that we've left him out of it it goes on there he says and they've got intellectual Giants in the world today they can almost explain away everything that God said to be true they can take it from a theological standpoint intellectually and if you just take your own mind of thinking reasoning like Eve did from the beginning they can explain everything of the Bible away from you that's right it's like a conversation I had with a friend fellow Minister friend of mine and I was telling him I says without a revelation all of our intellect is nothing that's right I say me and you as friends could take one off the street and we could set him in an office with you and you could with your the elect with your intellect you could convince him that baptism in Jesus name is correct and I said but then give me 30 minutes and with my intellect I could convince him his father Son and Holy Ghost but it takes a revelation from God and to give that Revelation you've got to give him all you're you got to give everything and he goes on down and he says but if a man or a woman has ever been on the backside of the desert in those sacred sins will no intellectual can stand and they'll come in contact with the Living God no devil or scientist or anything else can ever explain that away you were there it happened you know it's the truth nothing can take that away from you anymore if you ever have that experience and I look around and I think that's what's wrong with us we're not getting that true experience we're getting a good pat on the back and God loves you but we're not really falling back into a prayer and asking God to take us to the backside of the desert take us to the depths of nothing and start over take giv I had Paul said I counted all of it as D that's right to start over in Christ and I was talking to a brother the day and I think that's where I was that's where I was I was raised in this message under brother Carol could not ask for a better Pastor for my whole life but until God got a hold of me it meant nothing and before God got a hold of me there wasn't a living God in Me all there was was a walking figurehead that I could quote the message that I could quote the scripture that I could tell you brother Brenham said this that I could tell you that the Bible said this but there was nothing real about me I was no more than a Baptist a Methodist a Pentecostal a Catholic whatever it might be I just read it a little different but I was the same thing as they was but then when God got a hold of me I found out that as Paul did I had to count all of that yes as dung it didn't mean nothing no more because you know what it's hard to receive a revelation when you know something already oh yeah and I look around and I think here we are we've been bred on this message and we've been told since we was a year old the baptism in Jesus name is correct but do you have a revelation of that right come on is it really sealed in your soul what you just been told we look around and we look at the things and says why I believe in in predestination why come on brother do you believe in predestination because there's a God that lives today revealed that to you or do you believe in predestination because that's what your pastor preached about all these years come on it's so hard for somebody to reveal something to you when you already know it exactly and I look in our own lives and I look in the business world and I look in our jobs it's the same way you take a carpenter that in his mind he knows how to turn a corner it's hard to teach him how to turn that corner because he's not listening in his head he's going yeah I know how to do that what you showing me for but let him get down desperate let him get on his knees somewhere and let him realize that he really don't know and let him realize that you know God didn't make him the greatest Carpenter that's right and there's out there there's out there ones that are better then you can teach him something and I look at our everyday lives and I think that's where we're at it's hard to teach intellectual Giants how to love God because they sit back there and they go well yep yep he's preaching about that one yep hey are you listening over there he's preaching about you hey you know you know he's preach no he's preaching to you right he's who he's preaching to exactly he's preaching to you that has said on message fuse for 30 40 years right but you've never moved any closer to God right he's preaching to you that's been on the message fuse for 40 years but yet nobody sees a living God in you I was talking to another brother and he went to work for this place and it was with another brother there was a good brother it didn't take three weeks before the manager caught him in the office and he said something to him he says I thought y'all went to the same church well we do oh Lord so well he's been he said he's been going there for 40 years years and he never acted like this one of them had a living God in them right one of them had a true Revelation that he was a child of God and he couldn't help it when you really get that Revelation that God died on that cross for you that God's stripes on his back was for your healing that God suffered through all vanity through all Temptations for you won you really believe that it'll change you you won't be the same person that walked into the office the day before you don't have to say nothing I work with guys all the time and they look and you know it didn't take um my we had a new boss come down out of Michigan big boss and you know when they have these office meetings all the big boss first thing they want to do is buy a toast for everybody it took two meetings and he cut that out I didn't ask him to that's right I didn't even say I was against it but now half the workforce is upset at me because they said he's doing it because I I said I we appreciate that respect but what did he see he saw something different yeah he said in my office and one of the other guy sat in my office and made the statement there's something different about you he said I work I work I work with Christians all over I've got guys that work for me that's Christians but even in the rough times you don't let it get to you sir even when times get rough and your month is falling apart you come to work with a smile on your face you come to work with the Bible and put it on your desk right you come to work and you say a prayer before and you're not doing it for show because I've watched you from afar without you you know him and I think you know that's where Daniel was the king looked at Daniel and he knew it was real because he knew when nobody was looking he was still praying right he knew shed mhach and abedo he he knew that that that was just one instance that he got mad but he knew they're alive because he watched them and how many of them are watching us brother Brenham says we're written a pistol to this world brother BR made another comment and he says we are the only Bible that some would ever see right what kind of Bible are you showing him what kind of Bible are you showing the world well are you showing him a living God a living breathing God one that can take the world's worst sinner or the worst prostitute and make him a child of God glory yeah you know when God forgives he forgets and I ain't been able to do that yet but he can when he takes you and you come up here and you ask him to live through you he sees nothing from the past all he sees is your footsteps as you're walking forward in him and that's what the world wants to see they're not asking for another ideal my goodness how many denominations are out there I mean you can go you you know you you know City the size of Atlanta down here you know give me give me a few months and I can find the church that believes what I believe anywhere they don't want another ideal they want something real they want something to hold them they want something that when times get rough they got something to lean on they've got an anchor that they can go back and they can say but God you said amen you wouldn't put nothing on me I couldn't couldn't have you said you'd be with me even in me to the ends of the world you said I shall not perish that I shall win this Victory amen but first we got our desire him to do it brother brenon preached the message and listened to this week he preached the message on thirst first you got to be thirsty you got to really want it am you got to you got to desire it with everything in you you got to push toward WS that Mark with everything in you even before you get the Holy Ghost you got to try with everything in you and if you don't he can't live through you right that's right as bad as he wants to live through you as much as he's Desiring to live through you he can't do it and I looked and I thought oh God help us yes he said in 62 in the pre perseverance he says you've got the Living Word in you to have the Living God in you because the word here is God when it made flesh in you made spirit and life in you when it goes into your flesh your faith it becomes life then you are a living example right then you become a living God to the people then you become that God that that that thing that he's asking us to be in Revelations is a bride to come to a place that he can live through that's when you do it when you give everything you have up your ideals your thoughts your opinions your intellect your studies and you say you know what as brother Brenham said I may not know this Bible well but I know the author I may not know this message well but I know the author cuz the author wasn't William Brenham the author was God Amen God used that vest sort of blank it to us don't take nothing away from that man he had he had a gift he had a calling that he had to ordain but the author was God and God put it together and he tied it and he dovetailed it with every scripture that we have written and he Vindicated it time and time again and he says here I am living in a bride today here I am living in a bride today and I says brother brandham says now do you see where I'm trying to get you to I spoke with you pretty plain this morning don't you see the authority of the Living God in the Living Church or the bride the sick are healed and the dead are raised the cripples walk the blind to see the gospel Goes Forth in his power for the message and the messenger are the same the word is in the church in the person and God deals with each one of us individually you want to revive reval in your church start one in your own life right what brother Brenham say Revival was he said it wasn't a bringing in it was a Reviving what you already had how many of us look back and I think of David in the scripture and David said I had to go back and revive my St or I had to go back and encourage myself with the words in the Bible I said one time I said you what what did he do he went back and he thought about what God had did for him before you get down on yourself go to prayer to God yeah yeah and start bringing back speaking remembrance God you brought me from this God you took me from this God you brought me out of this situation God you born me again you you you you gave me in your life so that you could live through me right and I think of these things and I thank God here we are in this end time the world's falling apart Chaos on every corner everything's turning against the very word of God that we know it to be but if we really read and study we find out that God told us it'd be so yes and I look around and I see well why does people act so surprised why does people act so surprised that there's going to be people come against the message cuz I can read in Red Letters where Jesus says they persecuting me they persecute you they come against me they come against you unless you don't have that same God in you so I looked down and I I told my daughter the other day I says I says you go through trials count it a blessing what did job do job says I count it as an honor as a blessing that you'd have this confidence in me and I look at that and I think the world is longing for it the world is asking it to be so the world strives and desires to see the true manifestation of a living God amongst us and we're the only ones can show them and I look around the message and I see myself slowful I think God get me back in line God pull me back up to your prisom give me a fresh anointing of your Holy Ghost give me that love that I used to have for you give me that desire not not out of obligation to go to church but give me that desire that I can't wait to see what the minister can say to me give me that longing to hear from you give me give me that give me give me such an unction and such a desire that when I hear you going down the road it don't matter where I'm at it don't matter where I'm going I can just stop for a while and listen to you because you know if God's in it he'll take care of you you say well they they going you if I don't do this they going how are they going to fire you if God's not going to let them if God's in it he'll take care of you and maybe he don't want you working there oh my maybe he's got something else lined up for you now I'm not saying be slowful I'm not I'm not saying not do do do you do diligence but if God's speaking to you listen because he may be knocking at your heart wanting to live through you and there may be one amongst you and and and and I've come to find out that it's usually the worst one that you know in your work group or in your family it's usually the one e the black sheep I don't even want talk to him I don't even want to go near him but he's the one usually looking at you more than any of them he's the one in his heart he's Desiring to be like you that's right he don't want to live that life since when is it fun to get drunk every night and pass out and don't even know what happened I mean since when is that fun I mean for me to have fun I like to remember what I did right but yet we look at them think well you know God ain't going to deal with him God no live that life before every one of them right don't ever let you guard down because he may be asking you just to live in front of him so that he can do something for him there's with a couple of Psalms in Psalms 42 and was a fellowship meeting and I don't know what time I started I don't want to go too far but I thought Psalms 421 and2 said as the heart panth after the water Brooks so paintthe oh God my soul thirsteth for God and for the Living God Amen When shall I come and appear before my God I thought of that and brother Bram took that scripture when he preached the the message on thirst and I thought of that and I thought does my thirst still run strong for God look at myself each one of you look at yourself do I really have that desire do I really have that thirst for him that amongst everything going on I want full concentration on God amongst all the distraction that the devil is putting around me I want to fully obligate myself to him I want to fully align myself with him that he might do something for me thank you Lord then over Psalms chapter 63 verse 1 and two as well it said oh god there art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee and my flesh longth for thee in the dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory so as I to seen th and so as so as I have seen thee in thary I thought not only my soul but my flesh right thirst is for you my flesh thirst is for you and what verse two say it says that I want to see your power and Glory as I have seen it in the sanctuary I want a living God not just at church when I come to church but I want a living God every day of my life do I really long for that do we really long for that or are we just content with coming to church on Sunday or we just content with coming to church on Wednesday and living the way we want to live the rest of the way amen and then over in Psalms 84 Psalms 84 verse1 and2 as well it says how admire me are the Tabernacles of the Lord of host my soul longth yay even fth for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh crith out for the Living God right is that our desire right does our heart our soul and our flesh truly cry out for our living God because he's there if he wants us if you want musicians you want to come want to stand try to keep you much longer and Skip too much maybe but maybe something was saiden a living true God somebody that you know it don't matter what the world says around you it doesn't matter what they they might say this or they might say that but you just want to be caught up with him yeah right you just you know the world can look at you and say well you know that that you know that didn't make a spit of sense in the world to take that job over that job but you can say yeah but I prayed am and God said he'd blessed me here give it time God will bless you there yes amen he says why I don't know why you go to church there but God told me to go to church there God told me if he really wanted me if I really wanted to be in his will to listen and he'd give me guidance Jesus says I shall not be with you much longer but I'll give you my spirit right that'll be your comforter be your God right and I thought and I thought oh God so much could be said on a living God but does our flesh and our soul and our heart desire a living God amongst us and do we desire it to be in us or we just want to be a bystander because that bride of Christ she wants it to be in her she's not ashamed of who she is she's not ashamed that she believes a Prophet come in the 60s she's not ashamed of this she's not a she just wants God to live through her if you're not sure find you an altar right your altar is in your heart GL reach out and if you need rekindle touch back to God and be touched with his holy spirit thank you Lord right but first you got to ask for it you got to ask for it sing only believe only only all things are possible be only be all things are possible think about him only be only be all things are possible heard a great message now anybody want to come and reap some benefits from it you don't have to come to the altar but if you need help praying with you come and we pray together and believe you believe it all we got to do is just believe accept it and he'll take care of the rest of it so what we need is just to believe it believe it he's made the way we can give the quotes as our brother said we can show all the scriptures of where he's made the way but has it been revealed to you he said I'm the way the truth and the life so what do we have any need of anything else right anybody just like to come and be prayed for only all things are possible only need is coming let's believe be only be all things are only do you believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are Lord I anybody else would just like to come do you know that love that our brother was talking about love that can be a comfort to you no matter how bad everything's going no matter how much trouble and heartaches has coming our way we can rejoice and say I love you Lord not have no problem you say but you never had the trouble I have no see then you're making the excuse you're making the problem worse so there's no difference in God what a problem is or a trouble he can solve the whole thing whether it be Litt or whether it be big think about it to love him no matter what he does no matter how bad it gets or what Trouble Comes our way to still say I love you Lord say thank you Lord cuz I could be a whole lot worse anybody else I could be a whole lot worse I could be a I could be laying in in the bed tonight flat on my back prophet of God we read him but do we listen he said Satan's got a punch at you said but just keep that place covered so you know what that place is just keep it covered by the blood trials and afflictions that's part of a normal Christian Life we don't glory in them we just know they're coming we know it's going to be 73 years old a few more years I'll be an old man I'm not looking forward to it that way I'm just saying it's going to come if time lies but you see I'm glorying in what he's given me do you ever ever thank him your for your health oh yes Lord do you ever thank him for your wealth you ever thank him for loving you you ever thank him for just all things it's a great thing to be able to serve a living God yes Lord to know and realize that we can go to him and believe and he can take care of all of our problems but see the prophet of God said it like this one he said sight and time is God's worst enemy see we ask for something it doesn't come immediately that's time we ask for it and we don't get any better at sight but what's that got to do with it I mean I don't have to call my kids up every day and say kids you're my kids I want you to know you're my kids no no they know they're my kids they know they're welcome to anything in the world I've got cuz they're my kids see they don't have to worry about it they don't worry about it and I don't worry about it we see if we're the children of God oh shouldn't it be we should be as our brother was talking about serving our living God not a dead one sir a living God that's right and if you want to see things serve a living God you want to see healings believe in healings you want to see salvation for people you got to believe in it how else are you going to get it to come what a day that we're living in what a time go ahead brother let's sing do give us so

praise him a little more today P our tomorrow amen you enjoy the message tonight amen let's give our brother a good hand I believe he delivered what was on his heart by doing that then he's free right that's late in our lives to take what's been said and believe it believe that God is speaking to us how much greater thing would we want I believe in healings and signs and wonders we've seen those things but I believe in the reality of a living God that in the middle of the night when all is going wrong and things something can just say peace be still no problem amen because that's what he is he is our peace he is our joy he is everything that's right because he's Goden but just make sure you tell brother brother Jonathan how much you appreciate the message he'll be preaching fars Lord
