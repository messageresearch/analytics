what we're talking about amen I also want to thank all of the people who um fixed and done and everything you know to makeing every the preparations where we can had the bqu last night we certainly

you Lord for everything and thank you for the day and the grace and the hour that we have thank you for you and I just pray that you would teach each one of us to wait because in that we learn patience and Lord that's what we need more than anything else we need you to teach us these things just have your way lead us in thine understanding forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and just let your love be made manifest in each one of our hearts and lives we need you so much we just commit everything now to you as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and give us understanding ears lead us and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 we've been on that one for quite a while but it is the revelation of Jesus Christ right amen the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to sh un his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signify it by his Angel and his John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy keep those things which are written therein for that time is at hand Revelations 13 verse 11 and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first Beast before him and causeth the Earth and them which DW dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying unto them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound which had the wound by a sword and did live now remember what we were saying this morning that it's not great Miracles that he was able to perform or this image of the Beast is able to perform you know it's not dealing like that it's the atomic and the things like that but now also remember that the anointing mhm is poured out in this last days right so then who is all of these people that are that are are going out in healings and signs and wonders and miracles taking place and certainly not the devil and it's God permitting that to happen right all right so then it goes from the natural in this day into the supernatural amen that we're not saying that those people out there that that they pray for the sick I remember stating at one time about it you know that and it really DED on me that brother brand said that God wouldn't hear a shorthaired woman but yet you see them out here on the internets and things praying for people and miracles are happening and everything that's a gift right the person if it took away the gift it'd be nothing right so he's not hearing the short- haired woman he's hearing the gift that's right you see that's what he's doing here what we're talking and and deceive them cuz he had power to do what God permits that now why did he permit it to try you and I right right yep is that scripture we preached on that before it's to try you and I that's right God allows these things to come among us to see whether we're going to stay with the truth or not amen cuz we're down here in the time of the image of the Beast right you say well would God do that you come and explain to me that he hadn't done it right now you know I mean you you tell me so well I know this person over here that they're they're all kind of different things you know and they're all demon possessed seem like but they can pray and and healings will take place well you tell me who does the healing God permits that to try you and I to see what we'll do all right and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and calls that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed that's pretty powerful isn't it and he calls us all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand hand are in their fourheads and that no man might buy or sell say he that had to Mark or the name of the Beast are the number of his name here is wisdom that him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast where is the number of a man and his number is 666 you may be seated Lord has blessing now let me say this part in case I don't get back to it I'm glad the scripture States it the way it does it says he that hath wisdom right right now if you remember Solomon one of the wisest of all men he didn't pray for knowledge understanding he wanted wisdom right you said well that's the same word well why would the Bible use it in the same sentence right if it's the same word right you see wisdom is really to know how to use your understanding right amen it's to know how to use it know what it is Solomon was a great wise man he knew that but he knew that was not what he wanted he knew now I'm just stating what I believe I believe he knew that he could lead to people he had followed David he had seen what would transpire he knew all of the things in life but he knew that wasn't what he needed right he knew now listen to what I'm saying he knew that was the thing that David didn't have right David had a great understanding he was a great ruler he was a great king but he just didn't have wisdom right he let it get eat up in the bases of things around and you know if David had just prayed for wisdom look what it would have been so do you and I want understanding and understanding you know we try to be right we've got to have understanding before it can turn into wisdom it's got to be something that would tell us you know and lead us right in other words we we're reading it right out of the the book that's understanding but I want wisdom yes the prayer that I've always prayed here is as long as I've been pastors Lord give me wisdom right understanding is fine but give me wisdom amen and then a lot of times you might not agree and a lot of times I don't agree with the way that I do things but I pray and I try to seek God and I try to have wisdom and you know sometimes it's all right and sometimes it's my understanding I'm pretty sure but still that's what I want is wisdom so I want to get that part in case we don't get back to it because this is not just dealing with the Antichrist and seeing what all of these things are it's dealing with the basis of knowing what God wants right I see it doing what God wants brother Aon I think you need to Clicker so we on the AC we've got the new part and we got too much of a gap between the heater and the AC everybody's standing so come up and take care of the the doings get a little AC running he knows how to bypass all of this stuff and do whatever we have need of but now listen what did we talk about this morning we talk about the more I was trying to get into it but more of the image unto the Beast all right an exact likeness made in the people but now I I want to try to explain it this way cuz I got a question and I want to cover the question and uh I want you to think about it this way we can have great understanding in our forehead all right and we can call that wisdom but the real wisdom I want is from the heart amen do you understand me that's what I think we need more than anything we we we've got the message we've got the ability to study it we've got the computers to run and search the quotes that we didn't have in the early years but we need wisdom see coming from that inward part of us all right and that's where I made the statement and then a question was asked about it I made the statement and I believe it that Martin Luther he was a born again Christian he had the new birth I believe that sure Amen in his soul his soul was perfectly pure right but yet he was a trinitarian Wesley was a great man of God great truth but yet he was a trinitarian right right ausa Street Pentecost was a great opportunity for the Holy Ghost to come back working in the people but yet they were trinitarian that's right amen see your W this didn't start till about somewhere around 1912 or 14 or something that's right and then it even took the people into the wrong Avenue yep well I believe those people down through there not everybody because I don't believe everybody in the days of Martin Luther had the new birth but I don't believe everybody today has the new birth righten but I believe that some had a new birth in the days of Martin Luther but yet they were caught in that doctrinal thing and the question was how could you have a the Holy Ghost inside of you and yet you could have a denominational idea or thought or well the best way I guess to express that to me is just because you got the new birth doesn't mean you know everything that's right all right many of you may be claimed a new birth for a long time I believe I received a new birth in 1969 so that would put me a a long ways end to that point but you know what I admit to you that I don't have all the answers right see because I still have my carnality of my mind that I must deal with and only the opening of the word that's right the revealing of the word can take away our carnality right amen now understanding wise we may have it but that's out in your intellectual realm of memory reason conscience affections through your brain I said through your brain because your brain is not just your spirit right it is your brain it's a storage mechanism it's a place to that has to be dealt with but yet still even right now you'd say well brother Dale I have questions about one God all right but you claim a new birth mhm right right you say you're born again but see just because you're born again that only puts the new birth in the soul right you say well I'm just a unit well all right go ahead with your unit but just remember there was a day you didn't know a lot of answers that you know right right amen but yet you claimed the new birth right that's right you say you're born born again but you don't have a lot of answers well how come you don't have all the answers right because that there's a separation between the soul of an individual and I know that I've said this and people don't understand me Brother Gary he back there he he he talked with me a little bit about it but I wish that that inward man of me would do all of the thinking and all of the talking right man in all of the doings don't you amen I wish that everything inside of me was coming outwardly to wor that it could make it manifest but a lot of times it's not and I'm still just trapped in that basis of being Body Spirit and soul now you'd agree brother brandom was Bor a born again Christian and a prophet right but yet he said one day like this he said I used to think that Jesus loved me and God hated me right now where was that at it was not in his soul right because it could not have been something that God came up with so it was the human element right of a man in his memories reasonings and things developing through his intellectual part of him called the brain and you're not born again in your brain right I wish we could I heard a man one time say that we need a baptism of the Holy Ghost in our brain and I amen I I believe it we need a cleansing of our brain right amen the day you got born again did it stop your brain from working did it change the gear you know and it shift over and and all at once you started thinking good and right no right no that didn't happen might happened for a little while right in the beginning but then after a while here com that old devil mhm and Martin Luther he was a trinitarian yet I believe he was a born again Christian I believe he had all of God for the day that could be had you know what I mean but yet he didn't have all the answers I believe you can be a born again Christian I believe you can be up the stature of a perfect man back to where the disciples were and still have problems in our memory reason conscience things through our brain through the mechanism of us right I'll even go further I believe you can be a c off Born Again adopted individual and still have trouble M right now if you don't believe that then you better listen to brother Brandon right y because I believe he was that form of an IND individual don't you I believe he was adoped off capped off manifested headstone filled Holy Ghost person yep right but yet seemingly in his latter days he was having more struggles right and problems and you say well he learned everything well according to him that's not true because he would say I I just got this yesterday right so that meant the day before he didn't have the answer the day before he was confused in his thoughts all right so I believe you can be a born again Christian and still have ideas and things that are contrary to God Amen because that means of lack of understanding now let me say it this way and without offense to people outside of the this church if you didn't have very much understanding right you better consider the fact of where you're at right amen because if you're still toying over whether there's one God two Gods three Gods River Jordan Gods Two Souls seven under vir perusia y if you're still toying over those things to wonder if they're true or not yeah come on I definitely will tell you that I do not believe it's in your soul that's born again right it might be in your soul but that's where I check it out cu you see it's not my God don't approach me it has to come through this thing right he comes through my ears it's like yours he comes through our thinking right all of that but yet you can be born again and still have problems right you can be born again and still think wrong but now your soul can't right cuz it's sealed in that's what I want us to think about the see the mark of the beast as I've said this morning and we'll try to read some coming down is if you're not born again you're already marked with the mark of the be people are scared about it and wondering about the mark of the beast well I'm afraid I might take I you know they would even tell us I I you know if you're talking to somebody and say well well I'm afraid that might be a mark of the beast because it's something contrary to them there's a lot of people comes to your door knocks on your door right and they'll give you material but you try to give them some they tell you we're not allowed to read that that's right well I'm not allowed to read yours right if you're not allowed to read mine anything else we sit down together and we'll read yours and then we'll read mine they're not going to do that but what about the world today that was what I was trying to get across this morning what about a world that is already marked by the mark of the beast right now there's things to come that will transpire we're not in this position or situation to where that uh you know you can't buy or sale without the mark of the beast we're not in that situation as of yet but how how much would it take to change it that's right right like a man told way he heard him telling it he said I can delete your name in any time what about somebody with that capability through the computer system that could remove your name from records Y how about going in and try to buy something and they say uh what is your telephone number you try to give out your number and they said that number doesn't exist right according to our records the person who owned that number is no longer alive right you said that can't be done go down to the bank and withdraw your money from the bank when they have deleted your material from it you your name your your uh deing you said but but that's that's and I know what that I'm thinking that'll be on down F and I'm thinking that the big mark of the beast and where you can't buy or sale I've always believe that we will never go through the tribulation I do not believe that but I believe we can get so close until it's very close right to be at that situation I do not believe and and I'm praying in hoping that we won't be here when you can't buy or sell without the mark of the beast but I say that is very very close to that now all I have to do is a stroke of the pen and it can take place so it's not something to worry about that cuz I'm not concerned about that I'm concerned about us getting ready to be able to withstand the hour that comes and to me that can only be done by the review feeling of the word it's not how good we are although that's wonderful and that's supposed to be but it's whether or not you're born again right cuz I never finished that Revelations uh 138 where it talks about you know that everybody would be deceived right whose names were not written in the L Book of Life the foundation of the world well let me put that on over in the language if my name was written there before the foundation of the world then I'm going to come in this life right to a condition or existence to where that I will accept Jesus Christ as my savior will you agree with that right it won't be that he makes us but we will come come to that place if our names were written written there all right then the Bible said everything will be deceived but see that's the easy takeover that's the easy uh doings how easily it can be done because could you no not throwing off from nobody walk across the street over here and could you preach to them what the mark of the beast is is right that it's a trinitarian Doctrine can you do it with your friends and loved ones that surround you no they don't want to hear it right you know why because they know if they hear so much they're going to have to make a choice right they don't want to make a choice right I'm just talking they don't want to make a choice you know leave me in the way I am mama was a Baptist and I'll be a Baptist too you know well that's all right for mama your mama might have been a born again baptist you MH but what about me and you how easy is it to be marked and I'm trying to establish that in your mind that it's not a tattoo on your forehead it's not a a number wise because as we read it can be either his name or his number y right it's it's not always that stamp thing that's my point MH it can be his name or his number or a doctrinal idea is what it is right right when we still have in our mind and say I'll read to you in a minute Lord the Prophet would say something similar to this and we say bless God it's what I believe you know that's okay if you're right right but if you're right you're not going to have to bless God that's what I Believe come on you're if you're right you're not going to argue with nobody about it you're not going to try to prop it up with bless God this is what I believe well why is the righteous indignation getting stirred up you know see somebody that knows where they're at and what they're doing they not no problem right right I mean you can tell me every day of my life brother Dale you're trinitarian as anybody okay but I'm doing my best to get rid out of it right you know but when you rant and square you know swear and everything it's kind of like when they say that you go down to the insane institution you know and and they ask you if you're crazy and you say no I'm not crazy they put them over here but to the other one you know they say well you crazy so I probably am I act like it a lot of times they said we put them over here to help for them you know well that's about the way we are in our Christian realm a lot of people don't want to talk about what they believe right cuz they're afraid of what they believe right amen we were riding down the road one day talking with some people and this certain sisters she said looked at her husband and said is that what we believe he said that's what we believe but it ain't evidently right right riding up the highway but but now listen how easy it is to have the mark of the beast see what you're looking at when you say mark of the beast what you're looking looking at is the point that's been established in your mind of the mark of the beast as some form of um what a character or a point or a thought in your mind that you know it's going to be a great horrible thing and some kind of number-wise systems and pull out your social security card and and see what's going on you don't get a job without one now we're talking about Workforce we ain't talking about where you smuggle some kind of in right we're talking about the workforce legalized system you can't work without a social security number well see that's even people thought the social security numbers you mark of the beast now that's just a record right what is it now when you go they don't ask you social security number because they're not allowed to only certain officials like Law Officers Banks Etc can ask you for that social security number you don't have to give it when somebody calls you and wants your number out way you ain't going to give it to them but they want to know your telephone number why cuz that's a tracking ability right you go down now to get your driver's license y renewed in the state ofor geia what you got to have four things or you're not going to get your driver's license social security number birth certificate bank statement and two records of stating who you are you know bank statements telephone bills anything many many years ago the uh Records begin to be so perverted until even for you to to deal with I remember this it was better to have a baptismal baptismal record you know most churches have a a record if you baptize them that's greater than your birth certificate CU your birth certificate can be falsified right you see we're looking for something to happen when the prophet of God was telling us it was already there right M you said well what can we do well I'll remind you that one time he said it like this he said if you knew what you had in your pocket you'd take it out and burn it but you know he never did take his out and burn it right so evidently he knew something but he didn't go do it he said keep your homes and take the mark of the beast well he give his home away no he had a place to live in somewhere because it's either rented or owned and there's only two difference in that rented somebody else owned and you pay to live there you know or owned you pay to live there right no you got the same end you just pay a live back you said I own my home you drop down on your payments about 3 months you'll find out right somebody else on you home right see Church we're looking for something to happen when the whole world is set up under the Antichrist system amen mhm thank God for what Freedom we have in America amen right but the very words we use sometimes can be a destructive force to be used against us m M training their military now y to fight on their own grounds right why because it's coming to that amen right now what can you do about these things the one thing you can do is get born again amen and be prepared against today cuz that's the only thing you can right amen you remember years ago when everybody stopped paying taxes I ain't going to pay no more taxes I got my god-given right and I'm not going to pay no more well a lot of them W up paying dearly yeah cuz you'll find out they can get it one way or the other but you see that would be some force of something that was a Martin Luther Day when when they went out because of Luther teaching into the churches and how wrong they were they went out and burned the churches he said brother Dale if you could go to Washington DC and protest these things would you go no why brother r one day is going to march on the White House what he got to go the White House for yeah right I I want him at my house if he's coming right I don't want him at amen right well I'm start this something yeah you going to go up you can't go up there and do that there'll be two witnesses that we're reading out in this tribulation that they're going to protest the Catholic church and the world systems and they're going to get killed and there going to be 144,000 placed right in there with them and you know what they're going to be killed for what they believe right Y and it's a sweet granddaddy old fell that's going to give the orders to do it right mhm but see then that way we're not looking for the mark of the beast we're realizing that hey if we're not born again we already have it right that's the word we're born at we're born in Satan's domain and in doing that then we're giving up everything gradually that's right that's it gradually you can't take over America real quick you've got to do some things you got to make them think they're doing it that's right right see there's too many movies made and you know it always what it tickle me was and I remembered it you know it's kind of funny cuz I was laughing at what happened and you know we got this totally demolished in the Korean War I mean in the Vietnam done pretty bad in Korea killed off at least there it was a fight but in Vietnam we really just got wiped out you know just wouldn't nothing but you know it wasn't long after then of John Wayne he started making movies and the war was done over and it was done defeated and John Wayne almost defeated the Viet Kong by itself or what's the other guy's name Rambo was he in Vietnam I get my place is messed up okay you know but get what I mean right we build it up and make it look beautiful we really won you no we didn't win but you see it's the mind right of mankind that people are dealing with right you notice in your movies today that they're more fist action and I may get this wrong now I always do but there so many seconds of your mind is all that your mind will keep constant control and like ever so many minutes in a movie now you notice they change scenes they'll totally change scenes make something fights make something move why the mind is losing it you're not getting your point across so you have to do something to click the mind to make it keep working in the realm you want it right that's just natural Church you think of people that could do that with the whole movie system you think there's not a smarter devil devil that knows how to manipulate all of our minds right you know we want to talk about God knowing all that you know what Satan knows every thought you're having right now sure right just did well right you're playing pity patter in the backyard with the devil sitting in the church I'm just as guilty as you are one brother sat here one time figured out how to fix a tractor I think it was while I was preaching I said boy you really enjoyed that then you see Satan's trying to get control of our minds cuz he knows that's the part of us you remember the prophet greatest battle ever fought right God chose the heart of mankind Satan chose his head we're already marked it's just a time of coming down to the Judgment you say well no bless God I tell you what I don't have no Catholicism in me like a brother and I'm not throwing off on him I love old brother I remember harly made him went to Brother Whit years ago and they said he would sit I heard of him maybe I didn't see him but he'd sit up there in them caves for days weeks fasting and praying in sackcloth and Ashes his favorite thing was patting his hand and said there's not one ounce of tradition in this whole body fasted and prayed for weeks at a time brother would be told about two sisters one time that fasted 25 days out of every month not just one every month when you presented truth what happened they presented one God to the brother had no answer this he walked out of the church now what good is his fasting and his doings right do you understand what I'm trying to say yes what we believe is the damaging part of us if it's not truth it will destroy us but I got right to think where did you get it I'm an American citizen that's moving out pretty fast right they can say anything they want to but we can't say what we want to you think that's moving out pretty fast right right you go down here to one of these mosque and you're going to take your shoes off or you're not going in would you let one of them come here with a turban on his head and see what and that'll probably happen one day that we ask him to remove it because it's slanderous to us and then we'll be in jail because of her yeah hate crime y but that's all I want to ask the judge say your honor would you mean would you mind going with me down to a mosque let's walk in and let's see where you take your shoes off or not that's all that ask him but listen church just trying to get a point what is that Mark of the Beast that the world has called it everything in the book y you and yet we are the ones who have what is the word for it propagated it or brought it into being see we Americans has brought that thing into being cuz we're the image to the Beast right we have the same Doctrine you said no no no the the Baptist is not Catholic there's a lot of good Catholics right that probably pray not to Mary but pray to Jesus Christ probably more than we do well God respect a person's way you talking brother Dale no the choice is ours we can have the Seal of God or we already have the mark of the beast it's our choice amen and God will not have to spend hours at judgment explaining to us what made us what we are I hope we would be as the prophet said a Sinners that he walk across and won't even raise his head but according to my Bible there will be people there that will say I've Not I cast out Devils done Mighty marvelous things in thy name and all he said depart from I never knew you goes back to what I said when we were over here a while ago the great signs and wonders that are able to be done healings and miracles dead being raised all form of sicknesses proof of Records by people that don't believe this message are you going to argue with him but see that's God allowing that as I said to try you and I right to see if we're stay with the word are we going after their signs remember if a man give you a sign and it come to pass and you take you to another God don't believe him that's Bible right what are we going to do then let's just read a few and get a thought real quick cuz this is the main thing I want us to do so let's go with number 4 a brother we jumped over a bunch to to just try to get get the thoughts and just get in the quotes this afternoon on this mark of the beast from the message Mark of the Beast 54513 paragraph 233 now you see what the mark of the beast is it's a mark of apostasy now he tells you the definition or maybe not what Webster says you know of apostasy what he's saying it's a person who is just thinks that well I belong to church I'm just as good as the next fell I'm not I belonging to this church it's kind of hard he said that isn't it and you realize where your church organization that you're dependent on where it come from do you realize it's like a pretty good person belongs to church goes to this church so let's call that wronging to Lula Church see you get the idea of what it is the Bible said he that worships the Beast receives his Mark or the letter of his name now watch in forehead or hand that's knowledge or deed right that don't mean you got a big tattoo on your face it don't have to be that it's not talking of the outward right it's talking of spiritual mhm you watch him and see what he knows about the scripture listen to him and see where he goes too that's what we're that's what you're supposed to be a to do that's why you study where that when I preach you know where I'm going right if any man don't have this Doctrine there's no light in him the Bible said see watch where it goes to watch what he does he takes you to another God yet he can raise the dead what are we supposed to do look at the next one hearing receiving and acting 1960 607 it's heading up in two great things coming to the end time time the mark of the beast and the Seal of God the Seal of God any Minister knows that the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's exactly right Ephesians 4:30 says G not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto till the day of your red Redemption amen oh I know you think I'm I act funny but maybe I I feel good he said come towards end and remember what is the mark of the beast and the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is the mark of the beast is a carnal Esau to reject that Birthright now you realize I know the natural story Esau went on and lived his life through and and was good guy and the brothers got along fine you remember when they come back and Jacob you know he really thought he going to kill him and Esau winds up to be a converted we call it but now remember the rest of the story Esau saw repentance with tears never got it right y why because he rejected the birth right right did not Esau we bitterly trying to restore that birth right again but there was no place of repentance when you reject the Holy Spirit you seal yourself outside of God's mercy he said amen what about what is the seal then go ahead number six he taken from El sh preached 1960 802 paragraph e86 Ephesians 4:30 says G not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption how many knows that God's word says the Seal of God is the Holy Ghost now and then what is the mark of the beast is to reject the Holy Ghost a mark of apostasy now what was his definition of apostasy you remember that brother Brand's definition of apostasy that we just read back up above there where he's talking about apostasy if you saying well I go to church what does Brother D want I'm in church I'm there more than some are I do everything I can I believe what he tells me but you can be an apostle now that's what he calls it remember the old days when the trumpet the Jubilee year come and the trumpet sounded and every slave had a right to go free but if he didn't choose to go free he was taken to the temple and they took an awe and bored a hole in his ear and he was marked out for the rest of his days and what is it on the ear when God calls you to receive the Holy Ghost and you refuse it then God marks what your ear to where you'll never want to try it anymore see then that's the mark of apostasy and in the Bible it says that these last days that there' be two classes of people one with the mark of God the Seal of God what is the other you'll never want toosy one is the mark got the other one was the mark of the the Beast is that right now you're wearing one of those marks tonight if it's a question lay it up on the Platforms in other words if you don't know what I'm saying you got one or the other everybody sitting here today in this building that's over the age of accountability as one or the other right either the mark of the beast yep or the Seal of God you said when I what minut brother Dale I'm Justified and Sanctified you ain't born again don't make a gray area that you can try to float in brother brand didn't say they stre he said there's two either the mark of the beast or the Seal of God he didn't say there was people that were Justified and Sanctified that was good people that's all right he did say those things they were good but you're still not sealed of God right might have been in Luther's Wesley look at the next one the 10 virgins 144,000 1960 121 in the morning paragraph 3:19 oh I love him don't you yes sir oh what is what is the Seal of God Holy Ghost what is the mark of the beast rejected there you too one of the two is in us right now look at the next one this is the mark of the beast e75 61-1 17 why don't you come to it don't be sealed away don't be dead believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be sealed into the kingdom what is the mark of the beast to reject the Holy Ghost see the borderline what see after he once come to the knowledge of the truth now if you'll notice that scripture there bears a lot of meaning if you use it to what I did to start with it doesn't say he that come to wisdom right it says he that come to knowledge of the truth all right so what is he doing impossible those who were once enlightened they coming up to the knowledge of the truth and seeing that they see the truth and see the knowledge of it and see it's here and see it working see it's right and have a knowledge of the truth and it turn right turn away again there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin I told you about a man that I talked to at work one time and he said the Lord spoke to him and I believe him you Audible Voice I believe him and told him to water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was correct so I told him I it's your choice now it's up to you where to get it done or not I'm not going to argue with you God told you right you know if I said God didn't tell you he probably got upset with me w't tell me off would it because he believ God told him so he came in one day and he said call a man's name and said he baptized me over the weekend I said wonderful I had a little suspicion but he said baptized me both ways cuz it was a Baptist preacher that baptized him friend of mine I said before you say another word I'm going to tell you how you got baptized you've heard me right said he baptized you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then he baptize you in Father Son and Holy Ghost he said yes right but I knew he would never baptize in Father Son and Holy Ghost then the Lord Jesus Christ I said you never was baptized at all man wouldn't talk with me anymore see he that cometh to the knowledge of the truth he said are you condemning him no no he condemn his own s don't have anything to do with it just illustrating it what's the next one now because this is the thought thought I wanted to get us on which is inside man preaching 53 1212 8 the see that I was dealing with this this morning I believe it's Ezekiel the 9th chapter I'm pretty sure I may be wrong I know I'm quite sure it's Ezekiel 9 when the Holy Spirit went forth from first it was man went forth from behind the gates with slaughtering weapons to destroy that was of course in in the scriptural rightly applied but just before the destruction of jerus and there was a man came forth with a white robe and ink horn at his side and the commission was given to him by God to go through the city now just listen to this and set a mark upon the forehead the cealing of the Holy Spirit a mark upon the forehead of every man or woman that sighed and cried for the Abomination done in the city now that's what I was talking about this morning you say well then that looks like that we would be saying that the Seal of God is in your forehead remember this was in the Old Testament mhm before the Holy Spirit was given right so it could not have been the Holy Spirit as a new birth right are you listening it was an example right you following it an example was given go through and mark them in their forehead but you see the Holy Spirit had never been given to be able to seal them in their heart now it's not sealing in your forehead right and sealing in your heart but Satan is still after the same tactics right why because we just got to reading this go ahead with number nine we just got to reading what he called us all small great rich and poor Perce a mark in their right hand are in their foreheads not a tattoo this is Satan marking his right he marked his in their forehead their intelligence do you have a conscious of subconscious and an unconscious part of your brain that works through and their foreheads out here is where your your basic uh what do you call it contact with life your doings your your living is out in here that's why out in here you'll think wrong and do wrong and then when you drop back into more of the conscious part of your brain to the subconscious you want them say always had done that I mean that's even the centner cuz see out in the for that's why it says in the notice like I said now Ezekiel is speaking of people before the Holy Ghost come that could only seal them in their forehead you could not see them though that's only just a tight thing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that would come all right Satan seals them in the forehead it's OD it goes on in Revelation let's see if I can find that well there's two more times in the Book of Revelation that speaks in the forehead marked in your forehead got it written down somewhere but think about it and sum up a point then we'll get on to what we're trying to cover just for a moment so you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you're sealed into the kingdom of God with the new birth but yet your forehead is still part of your human reasoning Factor amen your intelligence your Consciousness and in that you can still think wrong and do wrong right see God then needs to work from the inside out right right see to be able to bring our conscious part of us back into being that's where that you get a lot of head knowledge you study the message somebody comes along and preaches and all at once is it just unfolds to you right right it it's very simple that's why I've always been accused of being so deep I say I'm the most simpleminded preacher there is in the world and you say brother Dale that's just being sarcastic no that's not being sarcastic that's the way I believe it because I believe that everything I get comes from God Amen I don't believe it comes from me studying the word of God yet if I don't study the word of God he can't speak to me from the word of God that's my part of making myself available that's my part of studying the show yourself approv of workman rightly dividing the word of Truth amen I believe the language we speak in heaven is going to be Revelation on the time won't be no carnality even when we're laughing and I believe we will I believe we'll life and talk about the things that happen on Earth amen I don't believe it's all going to be removed oh wait a minute so there you computer right and see Bible says the former things are gone well if all former things are gone yep you're never going to remember you was lost so I hope that one out the door if the former things everything is gone you won't never remember you was lost and according to my understanding the prophet emphasizes even in the Millennium and going up to the on the mountain and we get down and say papa God if you had to come right you know I thought we was going to remember amen all right so what does it bring us to it brings us down to the image of the Beast being formed in America the biggest controlling factor of the world is in America by the material things that we have in the military might so we're in Revelations 13 you know all right then in doing that then we can see that the mark of the beast what about I'm onest folks and I'm sorry I see things and then I cry to say I don't want to say that Lord but then I cried I got to say what would it be to be a preacher knowing that you control MH within your hands the so soul of the individuals you speak to that's right is that true do the Bible say they give watch over your soul amen isn't that true wouldn't brother brandham so great closer with these people he said I call you bride right he said it be on my hand say say what I said right but it'll be on my hands but I think what God has entrusted me here in Lula Georgia with just a a small group of people compared to the world but yet Souls within your hands do you think that I would in any way try to deceive you what I want to deceive you for you know I'm not rich but you know it ain't even no fun go to Walmart no more we go to Walmart and used to man Manny go buy groceries and she get to buying groceries and me and the boys would still be walking around looking at stuff and lusting after all that guns and equipment and this ain't no fun no more why because if I wanted I just pick it up later in F my point is this what good is riches right right sure we'd like to have a nice little church yes and God made a way we'd have one but why us go head over heels in debt to try to get some kind of a building that would cost us $2 or $3,000 a month light bill let alone anything else but bad enough like this one is yeah brother Dale wouldn't you want to be a millionaire not really I just give it all away no you wouldn't I would remind you that I've give away more than a lot of people made in their life I don't have to argue that point with nobody and not exalted about doing it it's just truthful sure I'd love to have a new home for my wife and everything but be sure of a headache for us to move into it have to pack up and move we got to have enough money to pay somebody to come and pack us up and move us we can't get out and do like we used to come on to my right some people sure but even in our deepest poverty we are the richest people in the I mean the deepest poty that's right that we could think of yep he said well brother D I sure like to have some money don't have a thing in my pocket well you know what you do with it you go out and buy something to eat or spend it on something that you don't need he said well why I don't know what I'm saying that I'm just saying the point that why do we have anything else right that's why I love that scripture and he that had wisdom Solomon wanted wisdom not knowledge right he saw his daddy and he had knowledge he wanted wisdom amen ding here is wisdom by the new birth and through my head is a great knowledge right I wish I had revealed what's in my head don't you amen all right right see then why would we wonder about it why not just take what the Bible says and why not be like what my whole point is this to hear is wisdom let him that have understanding count the number the Beast where there number of a man number one and his number is 666 huh and youd rather have a million dollars or to have that understanding amen but your respond amen which would be greater a million dollars or to have the understanding of the mark of the beast amen that's right are the image to the Beast are all of these things of the great Beast with that was Rome you know the red dragon the the things see I cherish that more than all riches I cherish the revelation of God's word about one God the truth and and the Bible of Amen the truth yep but you know everybody says they have truth and they do to a degree but I want the truth don't you what good is riches when I quit my job when you become a lazy bone I think that my retirement has proved one thing that I'm not lazy but I retired when I was 51 right I'm 72 will be 73 pretty quick and I do more work today than a lot of people that are 50 does in their day thank God I love to I love to work and do and just do something I can't stand it the wife will say why don't you just sit down said you done been in that that room three times and back out in the last 5 minutes y fourth time I'm going outside I yep I don't want to sit down and become lazy let the servants bring the food to me you know I rather have the understanding if you're getting at what I'm saying I think you'll follow this point Solomon knew a kingdom belonged in his hands that's right one of the greatest kingdoms that had ever existed on Earth and he had it in his hand Y and you might not agree with me on this but you know what I think he was praying he said Lord my daddy told me one time you remember David say God said to David said I took you from a sheep taking care of a few old sheep made you King over Israel that's what I thought of you David you know what Solomon I believe was willing to do go back to taking care of a handful of sheep cuz he didn't ask for riches he didn't ask for anything other than wisdom God told Solomon because you have asked for the correct thing I will give you riches and he made it the greatest Kingdom that's ever been on the earth through Solomon you know what that was that was his downfall y you think he could have been out there with all those women leading him away to in in the end time Solomon was building temples unto his wives goddess gods and you know things if he'd been back up taking care of a handful of old sheep running for his life he wouldn't had all them wise cuz they wouldn't have been out there with him for number one but number two he couldn't afford to build them nothing he said that's your rock and this is my rock right right are we willing to become poor to be rich are we are we willing to be put back to where that we were picking cotton crawling on our hands and knees reaching up in them old Cotton Birds CU we never did pull them off that was past our death we had to pick it and how can talk to you about it we had to pick it out that meant them sharp things are sticking out when you put your hand up in there it was going up under your fingernails cuz you didn't have time to no he was I do that all day to get 100 plan but I still work would you be willing to go back to be able to go forward you remember the old man that wanted to know how to get the Holy Ghost and his servant black man was telling him you know he said come on boss and I'll show you take him out to Old Pig pin the servant walked right out in the mud in the pig pin you know and this is where that boss and old man stood I looked at in a while at a while he just rolled it up in Brit's leg and pulling off his shoes the servant walked over and said boss you don't have to come out here you got to be willing to we don't have to go back to poverty and right nobody's never asked that but can we go back to where we started from in the joy of our Salvation amen amen when we rejoiced over what we were seeing yes I wanted to tell everybody about it now are we trying to hold it into a little Cult of our own say what about it CU you see very easily by riches and things we could become right in the middle of this cult system remember it's his name or the number of his name right we can spend time on the 666 showing the prophet said that you know viar Phil IDE and he stood right there in Rome he said and saw the tripple Ru and Crown and saw that written over that we could count it out and do it like vicarious fad V = 5 1 I = 1 C = 100 l = 50 D = 500 see then your R A and A R and the U and the S and the F and some of those do not count in Roman numeral form of counting so you come out to be 666 right but like I said your name or my name could equal to that one of the big raders if you'll run it into your computer you get home run in byar Phil ID I run it in and just look it'll tell you one head of one great organization his name was figured out to be 666 but you see he's not reallying in the world and he's not the one that's bothering us you see we're in the image to the Beast we're not we're not having to worry about the 666 cuz we don't believe there going to be no stamp but when we got his Doctrine and our forehead we're already sealed by the Antichrist you think about it Church seemingly the people of this message are the worst people to destroy the Bible and the right prophet's message that claim to believe right that true y now what's going to be next they're saying brother brand messed up this way and that way and he was wrong and you know now they're saying Jesus was wrong say Jesus done wrong people who claim this message would you mind doing me a favor Brother Gary would you do me a favor I believe if I ask him to do anything he'd try his best to do it for me if I ever twist this message up and get it off onto some idea or some thought would you please take me out of this pit why because I don't want to deceive nobody right of course there's not a preacher in the message that doesn't say that right those who believe in two Lords and all kind of things they they're so sweet and humble until you cross them CU it's church is down to wisdom versus knowledge brother Rand would even talk about wisdom versus Faith because he would talk about wisdom in that form as a knowledge or a form you'd rather have wisdom or you'd rather have some form of knowledge give me the revealed word give me the revealed word let stand let me see what the mark of the beast is in my own life get rid of it let me see my ideas and opinions go out to the door by the revealed word you don't have to worry about telling them my problems I know what a lot of those are but give me something to where I can stand on in the hour when it's all coming to a close all coming to a finish that I could be as Solomon would say put me back out in the desert taking care of a few sheep and give me wisdom let me know him in the power of his resurrection as Paul would say by being conformed to this world understanding and knowledge is a but being transformed by the renewing of his mind there's wisdom see all I've ever tried to preach is my Revelation not to show how intellect I can be but to see how much God can use me to speak to you to get you to see God get you to see the word that's all the desire I've ever had go ahead what we got appreciate these kids go ahead deeper of me anybody have a need you want wisdom you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost we get rid of the mark of the beast be sealed into the kingdom of God cuz you cannot have both of keep anding remember the other day brother boy and brother Joe came up about little baby and Amy and everything we stood here to pray and we S A Prayer CLA they said immediately with the prayer CLA enter the room things begin to change in the baby all right I believe that don't you somebody that was in the room them in the nursery or what you call it part of it baby had gone what 26 weeks the baby was only 26 weeks so you know small and a lot the person asked which we said them a prayer CL for that baby that's really Lord Jesus we s this pray for this we just ask you all will be well father we love you we thank you thank you for lovebody I and then you manifest yourself in Jesus there was some a lady in jail one time brother would knew about and brother Marner and all of them she wanted a prayer clo cuz she couldn't sleep at night being in prison they s a pray clo the girl would sleep every night the lady was in the room with her couldn't sleep because of the dangers and all the things that's in the jail so she begged that person to let me out of the pr CL the night where I can get some sleep she let her have the par cloth and the lady that P put the pr cloth on she went to sleep at night the when he gave it to her stayed awake so I imagine she got pray CL back but I'm just saying it can work pray is a great thing brother how Thomas standing back there had a kidney stone years ago doctor told him said it's too big it's impossible to pass it we're going to have to operate after the old days you

time he seen him but the doctor told him he told him what happened he went we pray for him he said don't you tell nobody about that I'll lose all my patience we've seen God do and it's not a hard prayer Brother Ray called me the other day he said brother de my arm's killing me if it been his left arm I would have been there to take you to the doctor because the way he was describing down through his arm and said well it sound like a heart attack is in the right arm and I said well brother Ray let's pray and you just get your heat bad and put it on there because that would help anything I think it'll be all right we didn't pray a great long prayer we just said a simple prayer for God to touch him and take away the pain and about an hour later he called me on the phone he said brother Dale you ain't going to believe it let it's gone right it's goone just simply believe in God just ask you sister did this for her sister Tootsie that's what we call her marer I think's

literally took a pen and pinned it to their skin and they belied it and it worked W Danny where his PR Claus at underneath his watch the ones we gave him when he was down there with the Dan isms and all of that I believe in it don't you see I tell you you can't wash the anointing off so don't worry about it if you take a bath and you have to think like wait a minute I'll wash that in my clothes don't worry about it you can't wash off this the anointing it's go I don't believe in it cuz it can't be done can't wash it all our brother's got a hurt in his leg father we just lay our hands upon our brother believe in you that by your stripes is heal father we know what the pain and the lags and the things mean that just believe me father in Jesus name you anybody else I love him for ring I can say with no no thoughts I have enjoyed the truth of God's word so much that if I die and go to hell I'd love to see take a Bible with me but I still agre we've seen that God of the word live We're Not Just Looking Back 40 something years ago to a prophet that was on the earth we've seen the dead raised we've seen the sick evil we've seen God do things the same God that was back there with the Propet is still here brother told me one time he said I believe that that brother random God was with him said I believe God is with you and said let's pray and we pray you know God delivers yeah come here um some people that I know is an really elderly Pentecostal lady uh I think from another dispensation and she was going to have surgery could see the mask through her clothes she was have surgery the uh surgeon told him it would take several hours for the surgery not be worried he come back he came back about 30 minutes and he said I tell y'all something if I've been I've been practicing medicine 34 years if I had not seen this with my own eyes I would not he said when he had her open and he went to put his hands on the tumor and it disappeared right amen I believe cuz he's a he remember nanny in the morning they're going to go down her throat trying to find out what's causing that hurting in one spot so bad you know there's a lot of other parts but we just remember that to be able to do that they've been down before they couldn't find anything I'm not saying we need to go down there and find something I say go down there and find out there ain't nothing but stop the pain that's right the pain go away is what we want the healing virtues of Calvary anybody else before we go I just want to thank God that dick went to the doctor and he had had some bleeding and I was concerned about it but he wasn't concerned about it at all and so the doctor said everything was fine and we think maybe he might have passed a small kidney stone or something but we just thank God that everything all right that's just my saying I don't know what it was but I thank God that the doctor said everything's okay amen talking with Brother Richard Wilson this morning and he said that you know he's got two kidney stones you know one in each kidney I think is way it is but they're fairly small but my understanding about it the grain of sand is pretty rough when it's inside the human body you know so it's not small it's but let's just pray that God will just take them away from him they went up into his bladder the other day and everything said everything was clear no problem but the test showed that they was still two kidney stones you know that so let's just pray that God will take care of that all right let's all pray Lord Jesus we thank you for today just talking to the people about where we at Lord maybe that's what we need in our hour and time is just to realize you and realization you're among us working great things to show yourself help us not to doubt those things but to walk therein and to see more and more until we see Jesus Christ Living Among Us CU We're Never Satisfied we want to walk in you bless each one remember these requests that we given remember the thoughts remember the the testimonies this be with Brother Richard our Lord Brother Wilson that those kidney stones will be totally gone all the hurt and taken away but we believe you we thank you for everything Lord bless the people on the highway give a safe journey we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you just missed Jesus Happ oh turn
