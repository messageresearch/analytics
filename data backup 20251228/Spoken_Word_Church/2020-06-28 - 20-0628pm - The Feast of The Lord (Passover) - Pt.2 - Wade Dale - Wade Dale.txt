Trevor Eamon's if you'll remember the the church aides book the little commentary church age book that you do the study in and you do tests and all that he's the one that compiled that he used to go to the tabernacle now he goes to brother Nathan Bryant's church there in Jeffersonville but he'll be here speaking the second service that day for us on July the 26th so everybody got that amen so good to be in the house of the Lord if you will turn your Bibles through the Book of Leviticus 23 we're gonna start on the feast days now they're gonna put this on the board and I've been trying to find this sister Barbara bless her sweetheart I never could run one of these off but she just brought me one this morning and then brother Joe and brother Anderson in the back they just piggybacked and made y'all one color if you made you a color one they made you one it's got some color to it so we'll be using that chart that will be the calendar of Israel and the feast so if everybody's got one then we're gonna put it on the screen so thank God for technology will use that layout of seeing technology for the glory of the Lord so Leviticus 23 verse 1 let's bow our heads family father thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that your sanctify us through this little journey that we're taking Lord showing in this in this feast of you that you had a group of people that were special to your heart and you were wanting to lead them and guide them through the world of Egypt and out of the land of Egypt and into the promised land and you gave them ordinances and things to to do and and Lord it was just a symbol of the things that we as Christians do ourselves that you are the you are the Passover lamb that died on the cross of Calvary for us Lord and you set us free from the land of Egypt that we all came from Father we pray that you just be with us today be with the service you be the active participant Lord you'd be the one that does the speaking you'd be the one that does hearing and without you Lord we're not anything probably give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our sins bless us in Jesus name Amen so the feast this is the Feast of the Lord this is not the feast of Israel the Lord never called them that he called them the Feast of the Lord all right so here we go this is the Passover and we're going to get into this today and hopefully we can do this in two or three hours so tell me we have we just takes a long time for us to talk you ought to know that Leviticus three one and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speaking to the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the Feast of the Lord which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feast all right they're not israel's feast they're God's feast all right six days shall work be done but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest an holy convocation you shall do no work therein it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings now that tells us about the seven day the seventh day being the Sabbath that is not a feast day he's just telling them that this is what's gonna happen you're gonna work six days and you're gonna be off the seventh day everybody got that say Amen okay but that has nothing to do that's not a feast day that's a set time that God set for them to not do anything these are the feasts of the Lord even holy convocations which ye shall proclaim in their season all right now here's the first one in the fourteenth day of the first month at evening all right all right even an evening is the Lord's Passover you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing for the reading of the word now I want to read you a quote I from the Prophet hearing who's this in 1959 and will explain to Tommy if she has any questions about who this person is so anyway the people were so crowded around the gates the streets were jammed and there was not even room for people to sleep they were laying outside the wall all over the grounds because this was to Passover and people came from all over the known world to worship at this time it was a time when the Pascal lamb was slain and it and the it represented their deliverance out of Egypt the bondage and they kept this annually every year this great Passover took place and it was one of the most outstanding times or events of the Jewish religion because it meant the time they were delivered now look all people love to think of that the time they were delivered that's the same way with you and I we are going to talk about what happened to natural Israel but there's a spiritual implication showing how that we had a Paschal Lamb and how you and I were caught in Egypt and then we one day God came and paid a price and got us out of Egypt and then we went through our journey into the Promised Land all right so this is I've said many times before and the Bible tells us in Corinthians that these were all given four examples to whom the ends of the world would come upon that's us the end of the world didn't come upon the first church age second church age thirty raids all the way up to number seven we're in the end of the seventh church age and God has give us grace to know where we're at where we came from what we're doing here where we're going like what brother Dale was talking about this morning giving us foreknowledge to know that we were in the mind of God and that we were going to come here and we were going to be a human but we know where we're going amen it's gonna be a sir for us it's a spiritual journey but we also have an actual journey just like the children of Israel did so alright let's get started let's show now the feast in Strong's Concordance the feast is a sacred season a set feast are an appointed season listen there was not and we talked about this morning this one in singular there there was not a Holy Ghost indwelling in the Old Testament to give these people a rudder or a moral way to do things so God set them up some feast all right you keep this feast you keep this feast you keep this feast alright but what it is though it's typing about you and what we're doing now so a feast is appointed season now convocation because they're holy convocations I got to slow down reading calling together a sacred assembly so what God told the Israelites to do their children of Israel now what happened is just to get started with this thing let's get a little history that children of Israel regards people everybody say a man if you say man you won't fall asleep that was kind of weak that sounds better if you were to ballgame it'd been a lot louder than that but the children of it thank you leaf thank you sister but that you y'all act up when company's here you can come again if you want then keep them away but here we got the children of Israel listen they're God's people you and I are God's people but they were God's people first amen so the children of Israel he told them all these different things he give them prophets he give them Joseph he give them Abraham he gave him all these different ones but what happened was they got caught in the wrong place they got caught in Egypt and they had to stay down there for 430 years under bondage to the Egyptians but God promised them that he was going to bring them out not with a noodle hand or some little limp son no a mighty hand he was going to show the world that his people that are living in this Egypt I'm gonna bring them out and there's nothing the United States Russia China there's nothing they can do about cuz this great Egypt was the greatest nation in the world and here's this little group of people down in Egypt couple million you know scattered around and here's this great mighty Egypt several hundred million people you know and here's just a little group of people and they made them slave so in their making them slaves in that we were slaves to sin in Egypt but you know I was telling them they had one promise you're coming out you're coming out you're not gonna be in bondage I'm gonna bring you out with a mighty hand I'm gonna send you a prophet I'm gonna send you an angel and I'm gonna send you a lamb that's that for me okay so anyway so here the children of Israel and I just I was thinking about this yesterday and Tommy knows how I think that's pretty off not awful but just a little off so here you got good you see where we're fixing to come to now the reason I want to set this stage this way is because look how there had already been like nine or so plagues we're coming to the last plague we're coming to the day of deliverance we're coming to where they're going to walk out and Egypt is gonna be glad to get rid of them hey man so I said this is and this is the way we should be I mean here comes here comes here comes our there's a lot riding on his brand-new donkey he pulls up in the Employee of the Month parking place hey they gotta make bricks and they're just as happy and they're clean and everything's fine they don't have no problem and they walk in I said ma'am I punch my time clock see my new donkey in the Egyptian Oh Earl the Egyptian he's over there ain't slept three or four days got lice all over him locust has done eat up all this grass his donkey died it blowed an engine I was gonna say this anyway where the time we come here or not but it's just comical though you got these people these chosen do you not work know where I'm going there these chosen people walking in this world and and you know early Egyptian he's like oh it's the dark let's not I couldn't see anything and you know IRA there's a lot he's like what do you mean we partied till three o'clock we ate matzah and we had oh sorry that's how God takes care of his people because we're in the darkest time we've ever been in we've got all these different things that we're going through you should be able to walk into work or walk into Walmart or anywhere with a big old smile on your face and not have to worry about the the virus or the lice are the locusts are the frogs all over the point you see what they went through and they're looking at a group of people going how are you not something yeah you know what God chose them God made them that way God promised them what he would do for them if they would just do what he said only time there's real got in trouble was he quit they quit doing what God said amen so here we are we coming to the Passover and you know what this is a serious time because this is going to mean death a lot of other things where you know that were bugs and they were this and they were that and they were frogs and all these different things but now we come down to a life there's gonna have to be a life given it's become a very serious time even in our life as of right now this day amen so let's go to Exodus excuse me chapter 12 and let's begin to read now I want you to realize and look at your if you want to look at your chart for just a second don't pull it up yet but just look down glance down at your chart when we get started with this Passover is a feast it is different from unleavened bread but all through the Bible it is included in the feast of unleavened bread everybody got that same am because you're gonna look at we're gonna read some scriptures in the New Testament if we ever get to them in the New Testament where it talks about the feast of unleavened but it started because remember that Passover they had to still eat unleavened bread okay so listen there's two groups in Israel today that keep seven days and another group that keeps eight days which is including that day of Passover everybody got that because the Bible tells us we'll read when we get done leavened bread that after the day of Passover which will be the 15th day of the month it's when you start seven days of feast but now you'll see in the in the New Testament as it come down through time they started celebrating Passover it would say the feast of unleavened bread beginning at Passover so I don't want you get confused okay okay all right and you look at your chart afraid of you already confused tell me that was my first girlfriend long time ago okay well let's go let's go to this real slow the Bible - I know brother right I know but there's always one Passover with no look really honestly I what everybody understand this don't anybody be lost so look let's read this and then I'll show you what's going on this month shall be unto you the beginning of months what's the first day of the Jewish listen to me religious calendar those have you been downstairs I ought to know this Nissen are a bib or you got to say March April because now listen I know lot of you shaking here we've been over this before but I want to break it down a little bit more they do not have physical calendars in Israel even today we're in like the fifty seven hundred and fiftieth day of the since the beginning of time that's the way they count it but the way they count it it is a lunar cycle I got that the priest walks out they see a sliver of moon they say okay we can start the next month if they walk out at the end of the first month and they look and they do not see that sliver or the full moon or whichever it is they say nope we gotta have another month because the because that's why we have Lee piers you know why we have leap years ok freedom the reason we don't have lead we have leap years oh I'll come over here the reason we have leap years it's what happened though now look we know one thing let's go back it's may take a while glad I got Wednesday no listen listen no I that's not funny I want you to understand I want everybody to understand I want everybody to be on the same level ok so what happened when the flood came you're sitting close to register witness when when the flood came what happened to the world it got kilt it off kids you know in school the earth is not setting on its axis it's so many degrees off so it wobbles that's why we have spring summer fall and winter because there are tilts the sun's up here the earth tilts away we have thank you so anyway so that's why that but now as we keep these times as it wobbles what happened was on into the middle light from BC to AD you have Julian calendar Gregorian calendar Aaron can fill you in on all that but this is this is just telling you why we do what we do what happened is if you keep everything solid by calendar these spring feasts were beginning to be in the middle of the summer then they begin to be in the winter so one either either Pope Gregory or one of the or Julius Caesar one added so many days to the calendar to bring it all the way back this is true to bring it all the way back to put everything in April in the spring they got that same n then you come up with a Gregorian calendar and that right to what Julian was numbers Gregorian calendar is our 31 30 29 now we know what prophets said about that remember when the earth was standing straight up before the flood it was 30 days to a month everything was running right on cater 30 days every month got it but now it wobbles so it started putting the day's over into the summertime well they reversed it back and Pope Gregory or Julian won one of the two added 365 and 1/4 days that's why every four years there's a leap year you have one extra day and free - let me tell you you know how to figure out that out and the election year is presidential election year is always on a leap year it gives the politicians one more day to lie to us it's kind of funny that it happens that way but so that so now the calendar states back we're it supposed to be everybody okay with that so that not really I mean it would it started with that sure enough the spring feasts were beginning to be in the summertime they're like we can't celebrate these feast Easter can't be in July so they set the calendar back and started doing 365 and the fourth day that we now live under now when we go back to the Millennium remember remember what we're going to do everything is going to come right back up the new city we're not going to have a wobbly earth in the new city that's going to be perfection we're gonna have 360 days we're going to what go back to the original and then so this month shall be in you the beginning of month so God told Moses your first month is going to be a bib Nissen are and and listen it's March April because remember what I said it wobbles back and forth it's determined on the moon even Israel now over there now their calendars are according to the moon it's called a lunar calendar alright so because they depend on that when it comes the priests come out and they see okay there's there's too much moon showing we need to have another month because it keeps everything right here you have spring feast they have to be in the spring okie-dokie they can't be in the fall they have to be in the spring so God set this up see when God sets it up it's perfect so this month shall be at the beginning of months but now remember also I don't know if it's on that or not but now the Jewish civil calendar starts in October so it's different you got to remember we're talking about the lunar or the religious calendar of Israel from now on we're gonna talk about the religious calendar of Israel which starts God told them to start it in March April are a bit so that will be the first month of their year so if you got you a little thing right here you got your little paper if you want to pull it pull it up now brother Joseph we can they're so good back there look at this boom that's your first month missing right here what happens is is each one of these come to a place now right here at the end of the year the priests come out and if there's a difference there's a sliver of the moon left I mean if there's a big part of the moon left when it's supposed to come to this day here they say nope they add another month some there some of the years have 13 months but it keeps all this from doing this keeps it from shifting because you know what God said these are right this is where I want these feasts and that's where I want those feast I don't want them here and here he wants them in the spring what where everything's growing and he wants them in the fall where everything is harvested there May got that same man now I don't know who in the world went in the pastor study it made every one of these things set sideways I'm gonna whip them you can't set them up nowhere so you just have to lay it down so right here look here's Passover we're gonna read on the 14th day of the month all right Fred you got that okay the next day is the 15th that's when you start on lemon bread but but taking Passover we're going to read it here you start eating unleavened bread here Passover is one day unleavened bread is seven or eight days ever how you want to you want if you want to include Passover that's eight days everybody got that if you don't it's seven days and we're gonna read here in the Bible then you have the feast of firstfruits which is right after that so we'll get into those a little bit later but we got to get it passover first all right here we go Exodus 12 verse 1 let's go let's get this done and the Lord speaking them Aaron in Moses and the land of Egypt saying this month excuse me shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you missing a bit it's too different but it's all the same march/april speak into all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month now I want to correct something that I said last week in haste and the youngest lady in this building corrected me she's 92 years old thank you sister clean in 93 years old I didn't want to add that one in there but I said you have to put up the lamb 14 days that's not true now brother Branham there is one quote where he says it but remember he's flying through all this trying to teach us these things but God told them in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb now they're very good with that so the tenth day of a bib or Nissen you're gonna find you a lamb it has to be it has different criteria but I want you to realize something as we're reading this remember every house had to have a lamb okay every house this is an individual affair with God it's not a group thing no it's an individual affair with God speaking to the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and if the household be too little for the lamb in other words you got to eat this thing this lambs got to be consumed you can't have any leftover so they gathered several together this is the natural story all right let him and his neighbor next into his house take it according to the number of souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb now look your lamb shall be without blemish here's where that just cleat or not we're talking about because you've got to keep it up until the fourteenth day so from the tenth day to the fourteenth day you've got to examine that lamb can't have a blemish can't have a broke leg can't have a sore it's gotta be a perfect lamb did we don't have one you're gonna see this man I mean you're gonna if you don't see this then lord help you get the baptism of the holy go because this will help you to see what God has done not for those people in the natural but what he's done for you spiritually and then your lamb shall be without blemish a male a firstborn you shall take it out from the Sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up unto the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening time they got that same AM and they shall take up the blood and strike it on the two side post what to side post and on the top to side posting on the upper door what are you making a cross a cross that's where you got to put the lamb on the cross and they shall take up the blood and strike it on the two side posting on the upper doorpost of the house wherein they shall eat it now I know if you've watched the Ten Commandments recently you'll remember this little guy has a little thing for this girl is always won in her story so he goes over runs over to her house and he slaps some blood on her that don't work that's not what happened you got to put the blood over your doorpost you can't put it over your neighbors in other words you can't give your Holy Ghost to somebody else you got to have it for yourself and you can't have it because brother nails got it and you can't have it goes hey man you shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side post it on the upper doorpost of the house wherein they shall eat and they shall eat the flesh in that night jesus said eat my and drink my okay they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread so that's where you begin to start eating unleavened bread what is unleavened bread unleavened bread is bread without a riser or without yeast in it we'll talk about that next time because there's a little there's a little key in there about unleavened bread and that's why we take unleavened bread and wine not grape juice and not corn bread our bread bread we take unleavened bread made by holy hands without leaven and that's what we take with our communion because it commemorates the body and blood of the Lord and Oh while I'm thinking about do you want to have communion next Sunday with brother Andrew here or do you want wait til the next Sunday well the next Sunday okay we'll have communion the second Sunday in July okay not the first Sunday we always have it the first Sunday of the month and you shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs this is not gonna be a real fancy meal because something's gonna die but you got to eat a night of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire is head with its legs and with the pertinence thereof another's words everything you shall let nothing of it a riot remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it that's why we burn the communion bread when we get finished with communion I take what's left over to my house and I burn it to a crisp all right because you don't want to hold anything over remember what happened the man in the in the in the Land of Israel when they held it over the next day what did it become had wiggle tails in it it became sour and would make you sick in other words like the Word of God you can't hold it over from a day passed you get a new revelation every day amen and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth evidence of the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded know how to dress your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand because we remember when you receive this lamb and you receive this Passover you're getting out of Egypt you're leaving whatever you were in if you linger around you didn't do the right thing in other words you got left behind let's show you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the capital L Ord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon your house is where you are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plates shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite this earth and this day shall be unto you for a memorial let me remember the day you got born again there's your Passover there's your Memorial and this day she'll be into you for a memorial and you shall keep it as a feast to the Lord throughout your generations and you shall keep a feast by an ordinance forever listen folks here sits a group of people that have been in bondage for 430 years there had been all kind of plagues and and you know the devil said I've done with you leave then about 15 minutes later the devil says no get back in here where you're supposed to be because that's what the devil does he lets you get or knock their little clothes and he says no come back but this day when something died for your sin when something died and the blood was put over the doorpost as a token that something happened all folks grace came on the scene grace brought Israel a prophet grace brought Israel an angel that was going to lead them through the journey that they had and grace provided a lamb when I see the Blood I will pass over you I can't die he died for me oh what a great thing and this was before law remember grace came before law because they didn't get the law to the wilderness in acts 19 this was grace before law ever came God give them grace provided them away out provided them a prophet for what a prophet for instruction an angel for a God and a lamb to take away your sin is that not what happened today is that no one happened today God did the same identical thing the Holy Ghost to God you gave us a prophet in the end time according to Malachi for just straighten up all the loose ends and get us all straightened back up and then he left the scene and what'd he do he left us the message he left us the Word of God so let's go through these little points right here real quick so this is some of the bullet points we've talked about but look the first month is a bitter Nissen which is March April you put the lamb up on the tenth day of the month if I got that say man night and as mince it's cleaner we're talking about I should have known it went in 14 days because four days before Jesus Christ was crucified he wrote into the temple he said Here I am I'm the perfect lamb and when he walked into the temple brother Luiz he didn't walk in and go hey how y'all doing he said you can't do this in my daddy's house you don't know the chronology of that this is when it happens right before he's crucified he walks in the temple to declare he is the Paschal Lamb and they're out there selling doves and selling pigeons and selling this and selling that for the Passover that was coming oh he was mad let's say he was angry let's say he planted a rope and drove him out of the temple and I'm always like Daddy I don't believe he hit one animal there because he hit the real animals and it was the people then priest it should have known different all right and you're supposed to kill this lamb win in the evening each home had to kill a lamb everybody got that they had to eat unleavened bread it had to be a Lamb of the firstborn they had to be ready to go and there had to be blood over the door now listen any of that done wrong meant death any of that done wrong meant death that's why you and I must do what the Word of God says it's written there it's for us to see and it's for us to understand and if they did that guess what they stayed alive the next day but if they didn't guess what they died it didn't matter it didn't you know what if when if you had a rebel kids or not a rebel kid but you had a rebel family it says I'm not doing anything my prophet says I'm not doing anything a preacher says I'm gonna live my own way my own life well according to that you died the next day maybe not naturally but spiritually dead hey man so now let's real quick I want to jump to the New Testament to the Book of Luke to show you that Passover is one of the feast days but it's also included in the feast of unleavened bread just to be real quick right here watch Luke 22 this was in the time of Jesus says now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the Passover everybody got that so it's included it's separate but it's included and the chief priests and scribes saw how they might kill him for they feared the people now what are they coming up to they're coming up to that Passover which was on what Friday also remember you got this listen Jewish days are not midnight to midnight everybody got that Jewish days started six o'clock in the afternoon or in the evening is six o'clock from 6 o'clock to 6 o'clock is their day and why is that I told you always Sunday thank you and the book of Genesis God said the evening and the morning is the first day so we got to stay in the Bible and we got to see that Jesus look at look at Luke 22 verse 8 then came the day of unleavened bread when the Passover must be killed so the Passover is included in unleavened bread but you can't put it in the seven days of unleavened bread you got to make it the eight days Passover is one day because they killing it they evening time then you start the feast of unleavened bread that's seven days and he sent Peter and John saying going prepares to Passover that we may eat let's go to Luke 22 verse 15 and when the hour was come he sat down and the Twelve Apostles with him and they said unto Him with desire have I desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer there's many times in the scripture that Jesus went to Passover because we'll get into a little bit later there was three great feast that every male child in Israel had to go to all right it was Passover unleavened bread Pentecost and Tabernacles in that strange Passover Pentecost anybody getting anything out of this and Tabernacles they had to come see that's why I see that we're brother branham tells us about Jesus when they caught him in the temple that was during the feast of Pentecost but they came in on the feast of Passover and they stayed the whole fifty days and remember they left because everybody listen don't get me wrong but you think about the world now well you know we you see the been especially out in the world you know you see a guy having a party at his house and everybody wants to come doesn't matter if you a family member well that's the same way with the Passover because during the Passover and all these different feasts everybody come Jews Greeks didn't matter either get free food and wine and let's just all go to the Passover that's what happened many many times but here Jesus is coming up to the hour that he's to be killed or the day before and he said with desire have I desired to eat this Passover he had celebrated Passover since he was a child and that I have told you many times before Jesus went to church what's your what's your problem Jesus went to church hey man for I'm saying to you I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God because he was fixing to be the Passover lamb but with desire I have desired he had long from the day that he knew that he was going to be killed he had desired to eat that Passover meal because he knew if he didn't eat that he wouldn't go to Calvary but he knew he was gonna have to go to Calvary now he's right there at the Lord's Supper not the Lord's dinner you eat supper and evening just for those of you that think the middle of the day is supper our dinner is in the evening it is not it's called the Lord's Supper not the lord's dinner John 18 now look what happened here they'd already took Jesus and you got to remember that you got to follow this with me here real quick it will we'll get more into it as we do the other feast but remember Jesus had to be killed on Passover as everybody got that all right and Passover start there Dave started at 6 o'clock in the afternoon all right so they ate the Lord's Supper Thursday evening then by the next morning it was already Passover time and that's where Jesus because watch this right here then led they led they Jesus from Caiaphas the conference was the high priest he was a Jew and remember you can't defile yourself sister Cleveland now we're talking a few minutes ago even in the Bible there was a group of people that had touched the dead man in the Bible and they come to Moses and Moses we can't do the Passover we're defiled God he went to God and God said ok I'm gonna give you some grace the next month on the fourteenth day of the month will be your Passover all right so like brother Dale said it's not just everything God just chopped no he gives grace to everybody all right amen then led they Jesus from Caiaphas into the Hall of judgment now where's the Hall of judgment that's pilot that's Gentile you don't defile yourself and it was early in other words it was the morning of Friday already started to Passover since the clock though but it was the morning of Friday they got that and they themselves went not into the judgment Hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the Passover so they couldn't they couldn't go to pilots Hall because that's the hall of Gentiles you don't go in there because you're defiled remember that they might eat the Passover and watch what happens is now Jesus they literally brothers and sisters listen to this they literally were killing a lamb in the temple while they hung the Lamb of God on the cross at the same time same day he fulfilled every scripture that's how blind Israel was and that's how bloodthirsty the world was is that they didn't care they just said hang him on a cross and they hung him on a cross while they were killing the Passover lamb the Lamb of God hey why did God render there was a big curtain over the over the Holy of Holies you couldn't see it nobody but one high priest could go back there now remember this will prove that man didn't do it God rent it from the top this thing was like 30 feet tall here in it from the top to the bottom you could say man to do it if you rent it from the bottom to the top but God rent the veil from the top to the bottom and as I like what brother Brown says he said surely they could look out the window of the temple and see the Lamb of God hanging at Calvary because God was going to show a witness that he sent the real lamb the real Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world listen what the prophet of God says about him in witness in 1956 many was witnesses of his day and it's crossed when he was dying the Pharisees they should have knowed what the word said the word gave witness that when he was killed on he was a Passover lamb killed at the Passover time he gave witness the word spoke of him when he healed the sick when he raised the dead when the lame leap like a heart it was the word oh my can you receive it it was the word giving witness that this is he who's been promised to the world the Savior the Messiah it gave witness to his deity that he was more than man the night that the seas hushed itself had rocked away like a crying baby hushed into mother's arm when he said peace be still it was giving way nature testify that he is deity none other than the creator himself not a mere man not a prophet but God manifested in flesh he was God that don't excite you Thank You Louise you and I have to come to the same place you have to though not take a lamb now you have to accept to the Lambs already by being crucified but you still got to do it in your house you can't do it in brother Donny's house or listen you got to do it in your house it is a private individual affair with God it's you and him no one else and listen if you ain't got the token applied what's gonna happen the death angel will come and carry you away amen so get into Christ that's brother Devils preaching this morning chosen in him listen there was a lot of people chosen of him Judas was chosen of Jesus but if you're chosen in him whatever he is that's what I am not too strong jesus said Lord I pray father I pray that they will be one as you and I are one how strong is that but here we come to the Passover and they killed this lamb and they ate it in haste and they got ready and when they walked that door out that door the next day they left Egypt and they didn't go back and I love what even poor Pharaoh he looks at Moses the day before and he said I won't see your face again and Moses turned around looked at him and said no you will not Amen because when they got across the sea and they look back and all those Egyptians were dead Moses looked at him he told him he said these Egyptians you've seen these sins these lies these things that you've done clap your hands somebody clap your hands good lord all these sins everything you see has been left in that seat let's see if God's forgetfulness never to be remembered again he will not bring up your past if somebody brings up your past it's the devil [Music] and he's alive yes the father of it so the feast of Passover has one meaning but it also has another meaning the feast of Passover is included in communion will read that real quick so let's turn to well let's read first Corinthians what's this right here now Paul picks this up in the New Testament now we don't have to we don't have to go to the feast of passover anymore the day right God said when Jesus came he said there's not a day in other words there's no more day he was the Lord of the Sabbath and he's standing there telling them say look it's not a day the rest I'm telling you about is me so you get in Christ and as I've always said before why do we have to celebrate a great big thing called Easter we celebrate the resurrection every Sunday every Sunday reminds us there's a resurrection doesn't take Easter to do that Easter were something man put together your glorying is not good and you know the history behind that too don't you we do it's not good I start and all that yeah all that junk your glorying is not good no you're not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump call yourself a lump I'm a new lump as you're 11 for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast no words not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness sin but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and that's why we're going to look in Exodus 12 verse 43 real quick and the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron this is the ordinance of the Passover now this is continuation if you go over to where we were this God brings it back up but what it watch what he tells them to do he's real specific because what happens is all the children of Israel are in Egypt now they're fixing the levees up and there's a big old mixed multitude coming behind them nobody got that believers make believers and unbelievers we're Bob where Bob at Bob in the back and the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron this is the ordinance of the Passover there shall no stranger eat thereof but every man's servant that is bought for money when thou has circumcised them what a circumcise the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen then shall he eat thereof according to Abraham according to Abraham's faith God giving the sign of circumcision give you the sign of circumcision of the heart when you give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost then shall he eat thereof a foreigner and a hired servant in other words people strange to your to your walk of life your the Holy Ghost that you're living in and one house shall it be eaten thou shalt know carry forth out of the flesh abroad out of the house need to show you break a bone there up now there's were you know Jesus they said Jesus's bones were not broken they were gonna break his leg but he was already dead why because he gave up the ghost listen man didn't kill God he said into thy hands I commend my spirit he hung there for three hours for me and you that's what stirs my pot when you hear people say well I only want about a 15 minute sermon I don't know one about a twenty minute sermon if God can hang on the cross for three hours I can sit and listen to somebody tell me about that God and if it takes all day let it be all day hey man I'll clap them now is it if you clap that means you ain't asleep in one house shall it be eaten is now shall not carry forth all of the flesh abroad in other words this is not this is sacred it's a sacred feasts just to say when we take communion it's sacred all the congregation of these Egypt Israel sorry shall keep it and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the Passover to the Lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof you're not supposed to take the communion without the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it's a commemoration that that man died on the cross and gave his body and his blood for me and you amen so that's how serious God is no uncircumcised person shall eat there what a wonderful wonderful thing that God's give us now I want to give you this one more point then we'll close during the time of Passover remember that was on a Friday you got to have him crucified on Passover he has to be killed and listen the Bible tells us and I didn't bring it that they were hurrying up the process that's why we're going to try to bro his legs because why at six o'clock the feast of unleavened bread start but remember it was a high Sabbath their Sabbath is on Saturday remember everybody got this so they had to get him off the cross before 6 o'clock because there's no servile work done the next day because it was a double no no to do anything number one it was a Sabbath number two it was unleavened bread so they call it a high Sabbath which means that a feast day fell on the same day if they would have left Jesus on the cross at 6:10 he'd have had to hung there until Monday and that would have broke ever scripture that was there because Monday they went back to work again but they still did unleavened bread but remember he had to represent all the feast so here's the feast of Passover they killed the lamb Christ died on the cross before 6 o'clock six o'clock started a feast of unleavened bread what is unleavened bread no leaven this thing Jesus wasn't in his body on Saturday he was in spirit form and went to the souls in prison preached to them Oh Lord no I anybody would yeah his body was laying there dead dead as a hammer yeah dead well I was just an old southern expression dead as a hammer somebody was laying there dead but his soul was still working so while they were eating unleavened bread with sorrowing and no leaven the leaven of the Lord was laying in the tomb and the unleavened bread went to hell you know you don't have to go to hell but one time and if you're in him I was in him on the cross right if you're born again that life the eternal life that was in that man on the cross I was in there so I have already been to hell I don't have to go again I've done been one time it has no hold on a Christian this great thing called death and this great thing called hell that everybody scared up been there done that got scars for it but when Jesus Christ came up out of that tomb on the eighth day or the first day of the week there's you feast the firstfruits he was the first one out of the ground the first one to resurrect but we gonna get into that cuz we got to break it down we're not we don't went way ahead of ourselves now mm-hmm but we got unleavened bread so Jesus fulfilled if you look on your on your chart there you'll see and just just take it home and study it look at it and let's look at it one more time both Joe pulls up and then we'll musicians come after we do this if you don't mind it's kind of interesting too have you ever thought about this you remember I know that Joseph and Mary had to go to Jerusalem to be tact to be counted or to be taxed but remember they couldn't find a place to sleep could it have been they were celebrating the feast of Passover and the place was crowded because remember he was born in April Jesus Christ was not born on Christmas night we know that lambs are not born in December they're born in April Sophie was born in April and crucified in April he was in that Passover the whole high but Passover which is call and that is pronounced peace suck like a thug P sock it's Passover it's on the 14th day that's when the lamb is killed the Lambs not killed on this day the Lambs killed on the 14th day but you do begin one more time you begin the feast of unleavened bread on the 14th because you eat unleavened bread it's part of it that's the eight days but we're gonna get an unleavened bread because God told them seven days Saturday or that that Sabbath that Saturday you do no servile work then you can work but you still gotta eat unleavened bread and then the last day is a holy convocation the seventh day and then Lord we're gonna get into something when we get into the feast of Pentecost so that's exactly the day that Christ came back into people digs a day and guess what now Jesus fulfilled all these feasts while he was on earth he will not be on earth when he falls when these are fulfilled the Feast of Trumpets the Feast of Atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles is from me and you to fulfill because now Christ has amorphic himself from the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world - now he has come inside of me in you and he has made us kings and priests he has made us eternal we're just as eternal as guardian oh I don't know about that brother wait Romans 8 says Romans 8 says that we're heirs and joint heirs with Jesus Christ now what does that mean whatever he gets we get musicians come let's stand to our feet whatever he is we are the feast of Passover with a solemn time folks it literally meant life or death literally to them it meant life or death literally meant you said why no it means life and death to you - it means life and death to you also you and I must partake of what that lamb did before the foundation of the world oh yeah oh yeah he was slain in God's mind he was slain before the foundation world that's what your Bible says but he had to come down here physically do it you know why to show the devil that he meant what he said he meant he wasn't gonna send another person down here to die he was gonna come down here south let's say your song oh you gotta be kidding me cries time yeah Christ our Redeemer died on the cross that's not for me God for the sinner paid all his due sprinkle all your soul in the blood of the Lamb and [Music] she the blood see the Blood I will pass over she said some sinners achievement stops and I get hurt Jesus will say oh he has promised 9 will he do well to lead each open for see how much time I'm gonna bring will pass over you any will you tell he'll pick you on the road see the blood wait see the blood Oh she loved I'll pass so really judgment is coming law will be there each woman I see be just listen hide in the savings and cleansing blood perfect setting [Music] now oh wait [Music] that better back better last better [Music] oh great compassion Oh boundless love Oh loving-kindness faithful and true find ease and shelter under the we'll pass everybody do a move Oh an have you experienced yeah Shana blocks oh when I Jesus I will pass over you amen we've been there we've said it to Passover table one night when you come to an altar you say Lord I've done all I can do I can't do no more I'm done I'm gonna be like that by like God brother I'm told he said he said Lord if you don't save me you're gonna find a bag of bones laying right here cuz I hate leave until you give me something now when you get that serious when you get that serious with God right night huh when you get that serious with God some happens there's something gonna visit you and gonna give you the desire of your heart don't walk in this world without God please don't do that please don't he died for you and me and by grace he sent us a prophet for instruction I like that he sent us a prophet for instruction he sent us an angel to lead us and he give us a perfect sacrifice to not just cover you when you come up to the altar and give you heart to God but every day every day I have to claim the blood you know we've seen that's all I claim the blood that was shed on Calvary I have to claim that brother Ron you do - everybody does we all just can't say no let's work you know I got saved when I was a kid now I'm gonna do what I want to do that's not the way it works you got to know because that death angels not gonna just come by one time he's gonna keep coming by when he sees that blood he's gonna turn but if you don't keep it up there he can go right in that door it didn't matter priest king Jew Gentile Egyptian if that door folks didn't have that blood over it you died few without God today you're already dead but if you're born again today you're dead too that's what brother Dale tries to do every Sunday is what we preachers try to do we try to kill that old man tonight get that old man dead because I want him to see the blood I don't wanted to see me I wanted to see my words I wanted to see the blood and that when I claim the blood then I can lay it all back on him why did Jesus stand there one day and he said come on you there labored and heavy laden and I'll give you rest put this thing on my shoulders I'll bear your burden how many of us would do that though no we want to go no I don't think I can do that have a little pity party no I'll just give it to God let him take care of it he said he would I'm not telling you anything you didn't say cast your cares on me why and like we were talking about I mean all this junk going on in the world yeah sure we need to be diligent we need to not tempt God but but Lord of mercy we're not I'm supposed to dig yourself a hole and get in it don't be an ostrich poor thing about an ostrich is is more of him sticking out of the hole in the end then the hole and the whole world can see that he's an ostrich doesn't matter how how much he hides his face he's still an ostrich but God bless you thank you for let's sing it one more time when I see the blood and will be dismissed you have a need if not then we'll go Oh Oh remember downstairs after service in my son's good class to figure out what we're gonna do for this weekend we need participation yes ma'am when I see the blood [Music] I see the blood we'll pass I will pass over you oh Christ our Redeemer died on the cross
