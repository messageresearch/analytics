big word if if you brought him here you just shook his hand that's right hey man you believe that we got to start believing that bless I uh God bless you bless you buddy love you appreciate everybody here thank you for your prayers I had a headache don't have one now so it was a sick one I mean I was sick in my stomach that usually doesn't happen but uh thank you for your prayer even though the ones of you that didn't know I did you prayed for me anyway so so we thank God for that if you have your Bibles turn to the book of First Corinthians just for one scripture and get started um this will be the Journey of a Christian part three uh part one and two was a couple of Sundays ago for those of you that missed it you'll just have to get the tape I can't background much cuz if you'll remember right at the end I kind of rushed through and I want to kind of back up a little bit right what I want to do tonight is I want to start at chapter 17 of Genesis but don't turn there now but where the new birth and type begins and then go through the latter part of Abraham's life and then you know you you want to uh uh you know you see what the Old Testament says about Abraham right he laughed at God he gave his wife away away gave her away twice tried to and how God preserved Abraham and his seed but now remember Galatians says the promise is not to the seed singular the seed one I mean the seed as of many which was the seeds of Abraham the natural seed the natural genetics of of Abraham we're going to read tonight in Romans 4 and in Galatians where Paul picks up the spiritual part of that that you and I need to look at if you and I were an observer of Abraham and Abram of course if you were an observer of of Abram you probably would not have understood his journey by just looking at Abram because you know Abram had lot with him and lot was always a thorn in the flesh for him a little bit but we're going to find out too that lot was a righteous man oh yeah we're going to find out too that even though ishma was the wrong son God blessed him right so see it's not all that that that uh uh doesn't seem on the surface a lot of things that that we look at but but we want to kind of broaden our scope a little bit of Abram and Abraham but let's read this first in First Corinthians because I believe if we'll if we'll see this excuse me then we will then we'll see what the pretense of Paul's writings in the New Testament will give us because you can't take everything and make it an example of Christianity that happened in the Old Testament right but in First Corinthians let's pray before we get started dear heavenly father we come to you tonight Lord with Humble Hearts and and open ears Lord that you may speak to us Lord what we need in this end time yes Father we pray that you would just consecrate us now Lord just take care of us bless us yes be with us Lord be with the con conation Lord may you not be Lord a bystander but be an active participant and Lord may you come down and and be Lord one that opens the eyes and one that opens the ears and the one that does the speaking Lord be the one that that looks Through The Eyes of Faith as Abraham did Lord looking at the promise looking at a city Lord who Builder maker was God but not being able to complete that Lord It's given to us in the end time to complete that mission Lord we pray that You' just be with the sick among us father you said you sent your word and healed us Lord and delivered us from our destruction Lord and as the word Goes Forth father we ask that many times we we see that you've just come down and healed us father and touched us and Lord what greater healing Lord would be than the healing of our soul that Lord some of them that are sin sick father that that don't have you Lord that that don't have that promise Lord we pray now that you would just fill them with the Holy Spirit Lord that we'll be able to understand you tonight Lord be able to understand what you're saying to his father you said Lord that you would be with us you said you'd leave us and never forsake us we depend on that Lord we depend on you today Lord in Jesus name amen amen First Corinthians chap 10: 11 now all these things wow all these things it's talking about Moses but all these things what the old things in the Old Testament happened unto them for example and they are written for would you like to say that for me they were written for our kind of makes it personal doesn't it right upon whom the ends of the world are come that's um you and I if you don't realize we're in the end time now let's go to Genesis oh you may be seated I want I want you to see that that even Paul was looking let's go back to for the sake of the ones that that are that haven't didn't come on Sunday or or was out or sick or or for whatever reason I want you to realize one thing that God is not a respector of person amen amen God did not pick Abram over anybody else he had to give everybody an opportunity Glory during that time of Abram I'm like brother Dale I believe God spoke to many people right now the only one that it did any good was the one that took it and held it like Mary did in her heart and held it and continued on what did the brother Rand say that the reason that God gave Abraham the promise was he knew that Abraham would take what he was told amen and give it to the future generation all right he wouldn't be a selfish person and keep all this for itself but now I don't believe Abram just comes up one day and Abram says I'm going to walk through justification Abram didn't know anything about justification Abram didn't know anything about sanctification Abraham didn't know anything about the new birth but there's one thing Abraham and Abram knew that they walked through life they walked a journey amen right through life not knowing maybe that you and I that he was going to be an example right I don't think he got up every morning and said well boy and when two 10,000 or 5,000 years from now when these people get on the earth no he just walked with God right all right now I want you to keep this in the back of your mind now this is kind of strange that I was going to use brother Chris for an example cuz he usually doesn't come on Wednesday nights and he's here he told me today he said I'm coming I said oh well okay but I didn't say anymore but you know look at Abram and I'm going to use brother Chris in this journey I may not use him all cuz cuz you know he may not be all the way through that Journey but you know there was this man named Elijah one time the Bible just said Elijah with a Tish bite there was no genealogy there was no great mom and daddy there was no great life before all of a sudden Elijah appears in the Bible right now Abram had a genealogy from sham but here Abram comes up one day and he disappears yeah God said get up and leave right and I was thinking about that after I finished the service Sunday that you know you see brother Chris and I told him when he got finished playing after that after that great um sermon that he preached for Sunday he said that's not right well it's a Ministry whether you like it or not he preached his first sermon last Sunday you know because it was Ministry all right and he told us this week he said he wondered all the to he told us outside afterwards he had wondered why that God had given or maybe not God or why he had this gift right right what what am I doing with this gift why am I why is this this way well he proved that Sunday but all but see now look 6 months ago I told Tyler he need to stay up here today Richard's back in the back this is okay listen he said sister Gail can do it I said she can't get up and down that many times to change the camera but one day a year ago this time a year ago Chris wasn't here right Chris was just who Abram right Chris right he wasn't a brother he was just Chris yeah one day God said Chris start talking to these two guys right here for those of you that don't know brother Chris works with us with brother uh whatever his name is brother Mark and brother Donnie so you know he wasn't in the mix are you catching what I'm tell what I'm saying here we may not even finish this this what my head was killing me before service and I kind of laid down for about 30 minutes didn't write a note today so I got a few notes now but they're they consist of one sticky note so but anyway so but brother Chris wasn't here he wasn't among the Brethren sisters right when they appear why he appear right many are called right but few were chosen many in Abram's time was called even lot I believe lot was called cuz the scripture the Eternal Word said lot was just sure so lot was justified right lived in a Justified condition but he didn't go on and so ish the same way ish was blessed of God sure and we talking about that today you can be blessed and not be a Christian right so don't think ishma was blessed of God but he was blessed of God but he wasn't blessed with the promise right that's the difference right see brother our our U John dou could be blessed but brother Chris was blessed with a promise amen he accepted what God said to him am I too loud what God said to him I thank God I didn't speak this loud my head was killing me a minute ago but here's this man that appears sorry buddy I was going to use you you weren't here but you're here so right maybe he need I got a living example exactly right I got a living example but no he wasn't here and then all of a sudden now he's here why he answered a call right right he answer God spoke and he answered Abram all right justification chapter 12 now the Lord had said unto Abram get out of the country right leave your people leave what what you're doing right and now this man Abram appears and he just starts on a journey right he goes to work about 9:00 which is banking hours but you understand what I'm saying I don't want you to to to think about Abram and Abraham and think oh this great man and this great journey he was so pck pick might sound good he was so picked of God no he was ABR right right because God can't be a respector a person exactly right right right but Abram accepted and therefore that put him in a journey amen amen Danny Fon wasn't here for a while right wait they wasn't even here for a while right am man some have been here brother collie's been here some of you's been here for a long time but all of a sudden we start appearing right and when we start appearing We Begin into a journey Abram Abram Chris begins into a journey right and that Journey takes him through life and God is maybe not audibly saying Chris do this Chris do that we all have them little things in our head every once in a while do this don't do this don't do this do but you know what I think what Abram realized whoever was talking to him it was consistent right yeah right it was consistent with now remember they were uh you know the Bible says men of old Renown they didn't have they weren't under the law right the law didn't come into effect till till Moses but we're going to read when when Paul brings this all together we he will talk about the law and he'll talk about Abram and Abraham according to the flesh then he's going to bring it to Abraham according to the word of God right and Daddy was almost getting ready to preach it Sunday he read some of the same scriptures I was going to finish with so if he would have finished I wouldn't had have done this so it's his fault but Abram Abraham according to the flesh was no better than you and I exactly right according to the flesh amen he was no better than the rest of us brother Chris was No Better In the Flesh better no better than the next guy that somebody you know that you know you can just call a name Fred Tom John right but what's wrong with what's what's Chris I'm not calling him brother yet hold on Chris cuz Abram was Abram then he became Abra became Abram right there not say not to call a brother brother before he's born again but you understand what I'm saying there's a there's a there's a development of a name here right Abram was Abram Abram had problem Abram heard God but he did a lot of things on his own God told him to separate he did but he took lot with him right right so he's got problems remember we already been through this I'm kind of get get everybody caught up cuz in justification you're you're you're you're just you're new um you you like a little baby you stumble and you fall and and and then God picks you up and here you go on your journey again and man you'll hit a brick wall and and and fall backwards and think where did that come from and it's going to happen don't worry yeah but brother Chris goes into a walk of God that nobody else can walk right that's right Glory there's not one ABR that's right there's only one Donnie fall Bush right there's only one Tommy FSH right right there's only one there was only one Abram right you know Danny I got to thinking the other day I think about the our walk in life mine and yours you know how we fished and did all the things before and how that we kind of kind of hung together there for a while but then we kind of got separated cuz we did you know we were doing other things but how this is more special to me now then when me and you fished for geez we caught 300 fish one year we we fish till we fish till we fish till we fish till we fish but you know this is more special now amen right and even then right and even in Abram's Journey Abram probably did a lot of things in life that he really enjoyed and really loved but when he started with this walk here's my point when he started that walk with God he was focused right now sure his Focus may be a little out of focus right right he took lot give his life away give his wife away give um uh didn't understand really what God was talking about have we all been that way didn't understand what God was talking about so he so he went into his bond woman and had a child thought that was the promised child yeah said all that is may walk before you kind of cloudy in his in his revelation we all that way right right we all got a little clouds in our Revelation I'm trying to hurry through but Genesis 12 1314 watch now that Abram God does one thing I want you to get this tonight God does one thing for Abram He blesses him amen right even in Abram's terrible condition which we say he he he did a lot of things wrong God everywhere Abram went God blessed him right even when you come to Abram in sanctification God everywhere he went you remember he went down to pharaoh and gave his wife away what did the Bible say I read it Sunday Pharaoh just gave him half the kingdom said here here horses cattle gold silver just said here this is yours yeah I mean Pharaoh's fixing the T I mean that this guy lied to Pharaoh said this is my sister and Pharaoh's a little bit confused but you know what in God always Christians are odd right amen all of our walking life has always been odd we've always been oddballs which is fine with me that but remember and I wrote this down God blessed Abram all the way through now remember in chapter 13: 6 the land was not able to Bear Abram and lot it was they were so blessed with cattle right you understand what I'm saying God is going to bless you if you continue on your journey amen that's right exactly see I like somebody like brother Chris that comes in and and he he sits there then all of a sudden light comes on right how many people have you seen come in now look watch AEL my point is Abram didn't jump up in Genesis 15 or 12 and go Glory Glory this is it I'm not no he didn't he just got up and walked and he got the D he went down to Egypt he went to Canaan he went back to bethl he went back to Canaan he was just but he was moving amen but he was moving right he was moving he had a goal he had an objective and he was moving he was continually at least he was trying even though through all the mistakes but remember one thing God still blessed him amen God still blessed him right he was not a son of God by birth you understand that but he was a Son of God that God was taking care of at the time he was not a son of God by birth all right he wasn't a born again Christian but God was so pleased with Abram Abram cuz remember mzc met Abram right in justification right go God I don't know where they did it for you but see God had to help me through a lot of these stages sure amen that's right cuz I couldn't help myself remember that's right amen I couldn't do this on my own that's right Abram was just fling around and all of a sudden God called him but God said okay I know you're going to make it Abram that's right cuz I'm all knowing right but you just don't know you're going to make it right but when you know that you're going to make it you you're going to be solid right same way with somebody like brother Chris same way a lot of us a lot of us come in kicking and screaming right amen that's right I mean sure you come under this gospel and it's the greatest thing since since sliced bread and you think man this is this is it but you stay there and you sit there right and you continue moving amen Abram continued he moved straight on and God met him and served in community right in justification right in other words God said hey this guy I'm putting my stamp on Amen now I'm using brother Chris for an example but it's this should be all of our examples right exactly reason I'm using him as he's kind of the newest guy on the Block the newest one in you know all of us were the same way right amen but he appears among the congregation and any begins to play it begins to play the instrument hey Abram's a pretty nice guy right amen let's let him play a little bit right let's let him enter into worship a little bit right okay you mind is that okay I don't beat me tomorrow okay but you watch you watch somebody moving and honest to goodness some of you hadn't moved in 20 years I've known you for 12 in this church you got to keep moving amen you got to have a Zeal and a fire yes that's right that's beyond all fire this beyond all Zeal this beyond all uh um job is not worth it football's not worth it hunting's not worth it uh friendship's not worth it right I Think Jesus looked at him one day and said can you forsake your father your mother your sister and your brother see that's what he was telling Abram in so many words Abram walk before me and be thou perfect remember one thing when God ever says anything about you and calls your name he's going to see it through Amen brother R he's going to see it through whether you think you're going to make it through or not if he said Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect Abraham he had a purpose for that boy right he had a purpose for that man and you know what he knew he was going to make it amen now let's turn to chapter 17 and just kind of flip through real quick and for those of you that weren't here a couple Sundays ago uh Genesis 12-4 types justification chapters 15 and 16 type sanctification and now we're going to go 17- 19 we'll type in in your journey as a baptism of the Holy Ghost you said well I maybe I didn't um maybe I didn't walk exactly like this that's okay that's right I just read that it was an example an example for you to walk by some of you could have went through justification sanctification in two days one day hey the ones in the upper room how long did it take them right brother D how long did it take them in the upper room boom boom boom right one night or whatever day it was third hour of the day so it was early right they went through justification why they had the word planted in their heart amen Abram's problem was he didn't have the word pre-planted in his heart right Abram was learning like most of us should day by day by day by day right all right they they had been tutored by God himself the Lord Jesus tuted those disciples excuse me for three and 1/2 years so they had all that word on already planted they had that fireball inside of them you know what though it was laying there dormant right right amen remember what somebody yesterday how many times have you ever took a field some of you Farmers or even some of us that plant food plots how you ever looked at the field and you take you spend $200 on Roundup you just kill the whole field right turn it under and leave it there till the spring yeah now where those seeds come from right where those seeds come from you didn't put them there all kind of weed seed why you stirred up the ground the seed was already laying there you just stirred up the environment that it was in right so it can get moisture and so it can get some a little bit of sunlight so the 120 in the upper room had been tutored by God himself that word was laying there dormant the word's not dormant right but it can lay inside of you dormant amen cuz you don't know how to use it that's right Abram didn't know how to use what God was given him glory Abram didn't know how to use it till he became Abraham right then when he met MDC he met MDC as a type of the new birth where God will meet you right right tell you Secrets he said can I withhold anything from my that's right servant Abraham anything from my servant Abraham same way with you and I Brother Martin and I were talking yesterday no today was today I guess it no it was yesterday or Monday evening Listen People you ought to be able to enter into every service right if you're a born un believer right amen you're you should be able you say well I don't know understand everything that's okay but just listen to what I'm trying to say right if Jesus if Jesus said Aaron before Abraham was I am where was he noic right look to Abram Abraham I Bal albone amen he met God face to face right what Jesus was telling those people Jesus was saying before Abraham was here your father was here I was already here amen the problem they couldn't I'm going to pinch you don't jump up the problem they couldn't get was this problem right here and I'm pinching F human flesh they couldn't get that part you be a man 50 years old you was before Abraham listen what was looking at Abraham that day when he changed his name from Abram to Abraham he sat down and fed God right Glory a calf amen now the eyeballs that that mzc were using fleshly was not the same eyeballs that Jesus had everybody okay with that that was not the Flesh of Jesus standing there in MDC but it was the person of Jesus Christ amen in the form of me H it right right in the theophany amen right and the theophany is no different than the flesh form right exactly right right amen no different same form right you're not going to look any different you did 20 years when you were 20 years old when we when we go over there why because God took a picture of you remember at 20 years old that's right and he said that is the form you're going to be in remember I told you about Jesus about God God is not some old man with a can that needs to be helped around right so and I saw I pulled up a line on MDC and it showed this old man with the beard you know standing there feeding um communion to to Abram on his journey I don't believe that you know Joshua met that same guy right and Joshua must have been afraid of him it wasn't no old man standing there Joshua got his sword and said are you for us or against us in other words he may look like a pretty good adversary amen right put a little MMA on them you know I mean kind of stout right but I mean really Danny if if you're a warrior and you meet somebody that's 90 years old and they're like this you're not going to pull a sword you're just going to go over there and say hey buddy what are you doing here you're old no this guy was young right when he met that captain of the host he met a young man Glory when Abraham met God he met a young man Glory when Mary Magdalene met that same man after he had resurrected right it was a young man she thought it was a gardener right but she heard a voice amen Abram heard that man's voice he' already met him one time right amen that's why God's got to meet you in justification Glory that way you'll know who he is right exactly when he gives you the new birth right remember I told you about the new spirit there was some questions in Bible study about that now remember the the new spirit you get in Ezekiel is not it it's a work of the Holy Spirit remember justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the same Holy Spirit but brother Bram said God gives you a you Spirit at sanctification so that you can what contact him amen he said the old Spirit you had you couldn't even contact yourself or even be able to to to to stand yourself so it's not a different Spirit but it's that same Holy Spirit softening up right that old nature you got amen right cuz you know what you're not going to keep that nature right it's going to die right right you're not going to divorce it you're not going to put it away right cuz you can't marry again amen you can't marry again if you got a living husband right right that old husband must be dead right now God don't kill your soul cuz that's your soul God kills the nature of that right the old nature that you have is what's going to die right so he gives you part of the Holy Spirit that's the only way I can say it the only way my maybe ddy can make it make it better but but when God gives you the new spirit in Ezekiel that's still his Spirit right cuz what he's doing is he's coming to you real slow amen he came to Abram slow didn't he that's right right took him a few few times meeting and you you knocks in the journey before he walks up and said Abraham you're going to have a son right right I'm going to visit you I personal pronoun I going to meet you right not I'm going to send another one I'm going to meet you amen did we read that in Genesis 17 I'm going to meet you according to the time of life right exactly and you're going to have a promised son Glory God's going to do the same to you and I because if he don't come remember it's the person of Jesus Christ that comes to you at the new birth same person same MDC same Holy Ghost exactly so now here's the bombshell if that's that big word if brother if the spirit of him that dwells in you is the same spirit that talk to ABR amen that's right exactly then what's wrong with our eyes not being able to see that's right what that man was talking to Abram about amen you say well those are flesh eyeballs that your mom and daddy gave you well God looked through a set of human eyes right right and then I think he said I'm going to go away or something like that didn't he say I'm going to go away amen but didn't he say he's going to come back and not be just with you that's right I don't think we got the end part right right that's right I think we're still looking at at the Old Testament anointing where God just anoints Abram and anoints Abraham and anoint David and then he leaves that's not that's not us folks that's right man so these same flesh eyes that I have tonight by the Holy Spirit ought to be able to see and understand amen what happened when that man MDC met ABR right cuz you know what you and I are going to have to produce that one that's right that talked to Abraham that's right now we know Abraham produced I right natural a natural baby but folks that wasn't the promise son right right it was according to the flesh right but it wasn't according to the spirit amen exactly mzc was trying to say Abram you're now going to be Abraham you're going to be able to I'm going to change your condition from a sinner to a saint right right that's what he's doing to you brother amen that's what he's doing to all of us that don't have anybody that doesn't have a new birth he's changing you from a sinner to a saint because I'll promise you one thing you can't do it yourself right don't ever try to think you can do it because according to the flesh you'll fail that's right right according to the flesh Abram fell according to the flesh hold on to your seat Abraham fa right sure remember he gave his wife away amen when he was Abraham right right exactly he had the promise in his hand he could sa the child right but yet he still wanted to save this old man right here right right but God told AMC God told him Abraham didn't go in and change nothing right right he didn't go in there and say oh I'm sorry I got I'm under conviction no no no aich God met aich that night in a vision right that's right he said if you touch that woman you're as good as a dead man right that's right why because God had already made a promise that that woman is where that natural seed was going to come from amen and if he touched her that whole line was gone right that whole line was dead but you know what Abraham was probably sitting back like this right here cuz he wasn't with her cuz you know what happens when a when the king wants to take a wife go back and study Esther yeah yeah they separate them right sure they put them in a place and they wash them they put real pretty spices on them and they put a real nice pretty gown on them and they separate them from everybody that's what they did Esther cuz when the king's ready to to have a woman presented in front of him she separated so I don't think that was Abraham and Sarah back and forth going on you I don't think Sarah was was was was huling for Abraham no she was quiet right and Abraham but you know what though God preserve that line he knew so much that when Abraham did get the Revelation see God don't mind if we don't get to Revelation first first go around or even the second go around or even the third go around yeah he doesn't mind fourth going around or fifth or right he really doesn't mind right but you know what he knows you're going to get it Glory you're the one that don't amen but what did Abraham do he kept walking when when AIT come and said Abraham sir why did you do that God spoke to me in a vision right that night and said said that that that was not your sister that was your wife and he said funny thing he said God told me you going to have to pray for me yeah and you're the one that goofed up right exactly a b didn't goof up huh he was just doing what he thought was right he saw a beautiful woman that already went through the change of the body not the change of life but went through the change of the body and she was beautiful right right so he was just doing whatever a king would do but God preserved what am I trying to say all the inadequacies and and the things that we do wrong God still if he gave you a promise right he's going to preserve you that's right Glory I got names right here you see this list I'm putting these names up downstairs and some of you have told me I want you to see this some of you have told me that you weren't born again and your name's on this list cuz this is the family album of children not yet born you know if you knew how many children you was going to have you could have an album right oh yeah if you were God and you knew you were only going to have um 100 million kids you could go ahe and put them all on an album cuz you're a God exactly but see there's names on here and these are just names of family and not my family cuz you're on my family thought of Ivan Mo where are these people you said that's impossible well Chris wasn't here 6 months ago no that's right how many of us knew brother Chris 6 months ago maybe these two guys did nobody else did did you no he's just he here he's Among Us sister Trudy she said add me to the list she said I just don't know that I'm born again or not so guess what Trudy to SS on this list right we're going to put this list up downstairs and if they all come to the Lord

doesn't bother you actuallyy Cochran Jonathan Cochran myON colie Josh Dale Hannah Dale Zack Dale Matthew Dale BB Dale Katrina hanses Kendra Carline Richard hon you say what does this mean Tyler hering Jeff Lance and I'm leaving it out because of time I tried to get all of your names that had kids that means something when God called Abram's name that separated him from a group of people right now whether Abram separated from them or not he didn't he brought lot with him right but in God's eyes Abram was already beginning the separation process but he said Abram Sarah what that brought those names into God's thinking right so these names if you got any to add not friends not friends I'm talking about just immediate your blood yeah your blood okay your blood K call her name we're going to write them on the left Glory right that's right Jeremiah mcfar Jeffrey Stewart Amy Stewart here was two that that uh Joseph didn't know I had down till he saw him and I don't know what Sharon's last name is or Anna's last name but Joseph Canada's Got Two Sisters that's right Esther you've got two sisters that are not here three three sisters that are not here Deborah forgot her Danielle Dale Tom McMillan Francis Gabriel Dale Fook you can put your other brothers in there I will Timothy Dy Rebecca Atkins Junior didn't that mean anything to you when I called these names amen that's right what that do you spark something in your life exactly you know what it done it brought them to your remembrance that's right and if God made Abram a promise then he made Abraham a promise amen that's right he said your seed will possess the gates of exactly you all this is natural Isaac was natural right but he was promised amen even poor O ish the Wild Child God promised he'd make him a great nation amen I didn't put him here it was okay fine what do you think church amen ain't it time for us to do what God Said to do exactly because if we're all born again if we say we're born if you're not born again put your name on that list right I want everybody in this building Born Again sure amen I don't care if you understand the seals I don't care if you understand all this and that and the other I just want you born again amen amen I just want you to be able to be like Abraham and look mezc right in the eye and believe what that man said Glory you say well mezc remember mezc became Jesus Christ and if Jesus Christ died to come back into a group of people he didn't come back just to be an unknown visitor Amen Brother Gary your son Brent right and I got your two on the list too Julie and forgive me if I didn't add your your family because they're on there but there's probably 40 people that are just our blood K right that God maybe is waiting on you to call some names amen exactly and we're not going to make a shrine out of this but I want it to be a remembrance Glory because God in Corinthians gave those people's name Abram Abraham Jacob Isaac they're all given for examples for those of us that the end of the world's come to amen and that's us that's me and you brother Danny that's us so who's God depending on he's not dependent on Abraham anymore right he's dependent on the Seed of Abraham Glory which is what faith seed Abraham believed beyond belief Glory you say my kids Abram Abraham didn't even have anything to even look at exactly he didn't even have a physical Robbie mcferon to walk into the door and I got yours on there but he didn't but we've got physical people right we got Flesh and Blood I'm not trying to make you people feel good I want these people saved Glory I want these people full of the Holy Ghost amen I want these people like that can meet mezic not cuz Papa did right right I believe he met meaz but I got to meet meaz in my journey I got to meet him glory exactly come on people sure I wasn't going this way but I'm going this way now yeah but that same mezic is a high priest right right amen cuz everybody's got that confused about being the order of mezd it was God right it was the great healer the great Redeemer right the great all and all the Great I Am cuz Jesus even identified he said before Abraham was I am right right amen now look at Hebrews 11 and watch look what look what you don't have to go there now Abraham was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God Amen amen Abraham didn't the only problem with Abraham Abraham didn't have the new birth or he would have been able to see that that city was right there you you realize that you realize that when he met me when Abraham met mezc there was the city but there was no way that City could get inside of Abraham because it was promised for his children exactly right sure and is that promised to you sure oh you believe that oh yeah I know you do but we got to start believing it for the Bible said our children's children amen right our generation right I'm not any better than any one of you so why God pick me yeah CU I said yes a't that simple Abram said yes right ABR said okay I I'll just do what this voice is telling me to do but remember he learned that voice right and that same voice that was so consistent he finally one day when he walked up to him in a tent and he said Abraham you're going to have a child amen and buddy that brought all of his journey down to one place glory and that was under that oak tree he met the city he was looking for but see remember Abraham didn't have he had flesh eyes he had spiritual eyes enough to realize that that was somebody different but he didn't have enough spiritual eyes to realize that was the city he was looking for yeah but what did God tell him he said you are going to be a father of many nations glory and said in Galatians 3:16 not his seed as of many he told ABR he said look down at the ground look up at the stars that was his natural seed but God was telling him in a type that the faith seat of Abraham is where all this is going to come from Glory all right let's turn to galatian you love the Lord and you got to love me then I told him about in Oklahoma somebody said we were talking about something and I said well you may not love me but the Lord done cuz you know what Abram was just a regular kind of guy right he didn't uh he wasn't very talented but God blessed him glory now listen Romans chapter 4 we're not going to get you should know that when Abraham met mezd Romans CH 4:1 when when U Abraham met mecdc that was the type of the baptism of the Holy Spirit right it comes in and then Abraham circumcises himself and his whole household and that type's there and then you look and you see that the type of Isaac being the promis son and he said take thy son thy only son because remember for those of you that maybe have not heard this before God doesn't finish with you at the new birth that's right he just begins to use you amen he just begins to use you at the new Earth so then you go through justification all over again right just a higher form you go through sanctification a higher form you go through the new birth a higher form you say another not another New Birth why do you think this holy spirit's right here for though right justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost gets you in the body right amen then God starts building these virtues In You by Justified Sanctified you realizing what God's done then brother Brown said the Holy Spirit does what SEALs in these virtues not that you're sealed in the Kingdom again there's only one your birth that seals you in the kingdom of God but this in the end time this is what's required of us right brother Richard Robert this this is what's required amen he never heard that that was requirement right we laugh but most of you didn't either it's a requirement that these virtues be formed in us they don't just write the Bible just to put in verses just to fill Up's space right all right so justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost seals this in then we got to walk about talk about this guy amen you know I told you the other day and I forgot to bring it I found a quote with brother Brown your flesh has got to be born again amen your flesh has got to be born again right exactly yeah cuz the first one wasn't right right that's what we're going to talk about right here now watch this is Paul after he reads the Old Testament and he gets the revelation of what's going on all right Ro in Romans chapter 1 I told him if they wanted to put it up they could but I want you to read it in your own Bible cuz you know what you mark it up you won't forget it what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh ha found question mark for If Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof the glory but not before God in other words if God would have just give him everything right at the at justification what's the journey amen what's the journey right see if if for If Abraham look you can read it up here if Abraham were justified by works he hath where of the glory hey look at me yeah I did it that's where you go wrong right right the only ey I worried about is the eye when he said I'm going to visit you amen right I'm going to visit you the eye I am the personal pronoun the one that can do it because we can't for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted or imputed unto him for righteousness not to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt like they said something we owe that was owed to us no but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify right you see that th right that's an ongoing right justify the ungodly there's me did he not you oh he justified The Godly no he justifies the ungodly right his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also describeth the blessedness of man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works in other words what David's been preaching on where David said blessed is the man who God will not impute or reckon right sin all right now listen if you're truly if you truly been Justified today your sins are gone amen right exactly right amen right you're just lot was just the Bible said it vexed lot's righteous soul to be where he was at right amen the problem with lot was though lot didn't continue on with God right lot plopped down in Sodom and said this is it Abraham was continually looking for that City Glory all right well you know why that's why Abram got the promise and Abraham that's why they got the promise right blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not accute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only he's asking a question or upon the uncircumcision also but we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness right how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but uncircumcision did everybody understand that Sunday let me break that down for you just a second in other words Abraham Abram was walking through justification and sanctification uncircumcised exactly let's talk natural all right click on for a minute we're talking about flesh he was not circumcised and you and I same way right spiritually justification sanctification are works of the Holy Spirit not in you and not cutting off the excess worldly part of the flesh all right so Abraham was look he reckoned Abraham righteous when Abram got up and started walking man you saw oh no way over there he had to meat milk I know that go knows that but you don't know that right so just keep walking and somewhere he's going to meet you amen he promised How It Was Then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not circumcision now what's he what question is he answering Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness verse n how was it reckoned after he had met mezc and after he' been circumcised and after he no it says not in circumcision but in uncircum all right and he received the sign of circumcision was a seal tell what's righteous amen of the righteousness of the faith which he had exactly when he got up and started walking sister B he had Faith amen already wasn't a god started walking right you say is't that too simple yeah brother Chris is probably scratching his head wondering why is he here and what is he doing he just got up and start walking yeah got a lot of questions but you got up and started walking amen you got to where the fountain was right and he received the sign of circumcision the Seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised right that he might be the father of all of them that believe right what's he saying Abram believed from the beginning now he didn't know he's going to have a son and all that but but he promised him he said you going to be the father of many nations right now listen people then it's God's responsibility if Abram put himself in that place then it's God's responsibility to fulfill exactly not mine or yours and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only oh I'm sorry I missed it and he verse 11 and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the face which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised right that righteousness might be imputed unto them or reckoned right so God knows that you're going to make it so he imputes it that's why those who he has Justified he is already amen glorified exactly doesn't that put the scripture together those who he's Justified you say baby form justification if it's true justification absolutely cuz you can't be reckoned Abraham could not be reckoned with unbelief right or he' have never had the child exactly and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham huh right if you're not born again tonight walk in the steps of your father Abraham amen hallelujah and you can put dick Addison you put that that's why God puts you around people right sure does that's why God puts you around people okay to do what to see God right to see how to act or not and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had yet which he had yet being uncircumcised you see that which he had yet being uncircumcised we always think well oh Abraham got the promise cuz he become Abraham and he be this right here Paul is picking it up telling you that even before Abra abam became Abraham right he had Faith amen exactly that's the only reason he got the promise Glory was that he had Faith at the beginning for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law because the law is not of Faith right but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void all you got to do is do the Ten Commandments 1 2 3 4 9:10 and you go to heaven oh yeah wrong Rich Young Ruler did it remember he said I've kept the law since my youth but he didn't have enough Faith come on people right Jesus knew one thing he could not get rid of and that was his money yeah in other words the Rich Young Ruler did not have enough Faith to say I believe what you're telling me right so I'm going to lay all this down and become one of your disciples he didn't have the faith to believe that covered the law because the law worketh what wrath right but where no law is there's no transgression right if you don't do it you don't do it that's right exactly therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed Not seeds right we'll get to that in a minute in Galatians not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all now look in parentheses as it is written I have made thee a father of many Nation right before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things what which be not as though they were who against hope Dy believed in Hope right but his hope became Faith right exactly that's right hope is not good if it stays hope right that's right but when hope becomes Faith it's solid right I hope I'm going to heaven I hope I'm going to heaven that don't sound good does it but when you know that you know that you know that's right it opens up a lot of doors right cuz you know what that's Faith who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according watch this right here to that which was spoken right not what Abram thought not even what Abraham said Abraham never come out and put his hands in his suspenders and said I'm going to be a father of many nations he didn't have a clue how he was going to be a father of many Nation did he he even tried to figure it out one time and got in trouble yeah with his handmade with his bond woman see that's why the Bond woman this guy is going to always keep you bound right but the son of the free woman is the promise amen which is by what f a i right amen where was I 19 and being not weak in faith he consider not his own body no I'm sorry according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be now who Adam I mean Abraham didn't speak that who spoke that God told Abraham that right God told you amen thank you sister Jim God told you God spoke to you you ought all said amen right amen y'all are still looking at Abraham y'all are looking back 4,000 years of what God did to some man you don't even know tonight Glory right tonight so shall thy seed be right and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead now here Paul is picking up natural cuz his body was dead come on folks he was 100 years old right he knew whether nobody else knew it or not he knew he was dead right and his lovely wife Sarah he knew she was dead and gone too cuz she was right at his age right yeah when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's wom now what's he doing being not weak in faith right he considered not in other words that didn't enter into Abraham's equation right he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief now wait a minute okay wait a minute sister Teresa didn't God didn't Abraham get on his face and laugh at God me produce a son remember Sarah got in trouble for just laughing her heart Abraham got down on the ground yeah and laughed exactly but Paul what do you say about it he staggered not hm what was what was Paul looking at I think Paul was looking at the end result right right he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory amen to God cuz you know what people there's nothing you done right to God be the glory cuz it ain't none of yours and it ain't none of mine that's right and being fully persuaded in other words he convinced himself that God was right fully persuaded now what is persuasion he had to lean to his own carnal I can't do it in the flesh yeah but he was fully persuaded what God you said I was going to have it right now God didn't beg and plead with him right cuz see that's the difference in Abraham and lot Abraham just believed it lot was like well maybe I'll just take this part of the land over here and you know you you can have all this over here and I'll go down here toward Sodom cuz it looks like a better place you see what I'm saying you watch look Read that read that about Abram and Abraham read how focused he was really you say well he was no he was moving he was looking for something cuz we're going to read it in just minute if we have time that he was looking for a city yeah now that was never written in the Old Testament right right it never was written pinned in the Old Testament Abraham was looking for a city now why do we get in Hebrews 11 and see the father of our faith looking for a city right being fully persuaded that what he had promised who that's not that he is not Abraham right that's right and that he is not able to perform that's not Abraham right that's God glory and therefore it was what reckoned to him for righteousness right now it was not written for his sake alone thank God that it was imputed to him right but for who us one more time for who us us also to whom it shall be what imputed here we go we say all this Abraham this great person there was this great person Paul's making it very personal here for us also to whom it shall be imputed what righteousness right if brother dick there's your big word if right we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for what raised again right again yeah you reckon that may be talking about us right Glory cuz he was raised one time right 2,000 years ago that says again amen for our thank you sister Anna she said for our for our justification right what to whom the ends of the world has coming if I can put Corinthians in with that right now let's go to Galatians just for a few minutes everything is it okay it's 8:30 we're all right cuz I love in Galatians what he said watch this excuse me Galatians 4 we'll read Galatians 3 in just a minute we're going to read verse 30 and 31 don't put it up there brother oh you can boy Brother Anderson he's a good kid just R you need to keep him he's good good guy see there's another one who's this Anderson big tall guy he just walks into our life amen glory brother dick when you first came to church here you were the song leader the guitar player the head musician the the third string fiddle and the fourth string guitar player in the banjo and the piano player point I'm trying to make when brother dick first got here he was about it right the stage was empty full now is it right with some absolute just wonderful amen and brother dick listen brother Dick had to do all the song leading if he was sick he still had to do all the song leading now if he don't feel good got Richard Marlo now where'd he come from that boy too I'm coming to that okay and then you know when I started coming to church there was a a dark headed guy that that that married the little girl I Used to Know call D it and Son of a going if he didn't start leaving thing now brother dick can almost not even be here do you understand what I'm saying yeah watch how God does God puts people in place you know why I put them names on there number two number one cuz I want to see the Soul saved number two if this thing goes another 10 years a lot of you going to be dead and I could die tomorrow but some of you that are in your 70s are going to be in your 80s we need young people right amen if there is going to be another generation who do you raise up right brother dickon be no another generation no there won't be another generation but if brother dick can't get do it anymore Richard's a little bit younger than brother dick not much you understand you see what I'm saying watch how God's program works we didn't hardly have nobody qualified for a deacon you had brother collie that was here and brother Dy some of the others now we got a church full amen why cuz you somebody believed the promise amen right that's right so the Next Generation if we have another 10 or 15 years those people's names that I called a lot of them are in their teens and their 20s we're going to need them to do things that maybe some of us old people forget to do exactly and that's the truth people right nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be a with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of bond of the Bond woman but of the free now just for a second the Bond woman produced a son but now when it comes to the promise when it comes to God telling Abraham to take his son his only son right now folks naturally he had more than one son right B woman right right here this is binding us right now Glory exactly but if you stay on that God's going to bless you cuz you blessed ishma he blessed Hagar remember Hagar went out under the tree and and S must just read it but she sits down and and Abraham gives her some water and gives her some bread and she's out right God God the Bible said God comes to that woman and hears her cry that's right exactly and takes care of that woman right opens up a well for see you're going to be blessed even the bond woman's blessed but that wasn't the prom son folks we want the promised son right we don't want to be bound I don't even like that word bond bound I like free amen shall not be a remember when he got to one place when he got to one place what did God have to do though Abraham said Hagar you take ish and you leave right because Isaac was the promised son he didn't want those two mixing and mingling right right exactly this is going to be a wild child as long as we let it be one right but that free woman is inside here the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what's supposed to set us free right right so will not be air cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bor woman but of the free now let's go to Galatians 3 back up when it we be finish right there I like somebody you know when when when brother Dale or any of you Brothers brother de used to do a lot and brother colie used to do a lot he would just take scripture and just go right down through and explain you know what I forget a lot but God let me be able to write these things down in my Bible right so that I can uh remember now look go to Galatians 3 verse 6 let's go to go to verse six just just scroll up to verse six Brother Anderson 1-5 is okay but look this is this is where he's getting to Abraham even as Abraham believed God it was a counted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham exactly and the scripture look foreseeing for knowing for knowledge that God would justify Richard Roberts and Richard htis he's not here but that's okay and I can't remember Richard Marlo's last name and Richard Marlo that word heathen I told you many times when I first came back to Lord sister Teresa I the Lord showed me one thing Abraham's not going to do me any good right unless I walk the steps of Abraham but as long as I leave Abraham in there that really is not going to do me any good but if I put way Dale's name in there right and I know folks I was a heathen so were you right so and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen right through what faith right preached before the gospel preached preached that's the first time that's ever been brought up God talked to Abraham God talked to ABR no God preached to Abraham right God preached to Abram preached before the gospel un Abraham saying in the shall All Nations be blessed right so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham for as many as are the works of the law are under the curse now what a minute whoa verse 10 hold on a second here what does that say for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse what is the curse death the law is death right righten for as many as under the works and I wrote in my Bible of the law or under and I underline the curse and I wrote Death for it is written cursed is everyone that continueth see that th can be mean bad things too yeah that continueth not in all things what which are written in the book of the law to do them right but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident right for the just shall live by faith Amen in other words what that's what that's what Luther saw that the keeping of the law or the keeping of the Roman Catholic law was not going to justify he just going to condemn you cuz Luther tried to do Penance he tried to do the things the Catholic Church said but one day God said hey read verse 11 yeah the just shall not live by works right the just shall live by faith Glory not by works L any man should boast the law is not a faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them amen in other words you were doing okay to do the law but was it faith it was just doing what somebody wrote down on a piece of paper right but look verse 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the death of the law right being made death for us I'm not changing the scripture all right I'm not adding to or taking from right anybody understand where I'm getting that from amen curse is the death death is a curse right right if you don't know that just keep getting older you'll understand for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree which we know Jesus was that the blessings of Abraham what the J live by faith right that was the blessings of Abraham he saith not no wait a minute that the blessings of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith right in other words what to meet MDC and bring forth the promise right that's what we're supposed to do amen bring forth the the promised son it wasn't it just Abraham brought Isaac I hope you're I hope you're trying to brother Bron preached taking God out of History amen take all these people out of History right exactly get them out of History right I thought the B said these were given for examples Amen to whom the ends of the world will come upon which is you and I Glory Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed now how did God confirm the Covenant with Abraham circumcision amen yet if it be confirmed no man diseth or adth theto right now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many stop not natural right not the same you know he told Abraham he said look down and see the sand look up and see the stars he didn't say as two seeds as of many right but as of one Glory Genesis 1 26 and 27 amen that's the man that he talking about that God want him keep sin to cuz God can impute sin to me and you but he can't he cannot impute sin to himself right and to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he said Not seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after what after Abraham remember he promised him that his seed was soj for 400 years and they went ahead in 430 years God gave him Grace down in in Egypt remember and then Moses come along I'm just trying to catch sh up with that right the Covenant that was conf confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after in other words boy you going to hate this that promise that God made to Abraham doesn't matter what the law said on a piece of paper right you're not going to disan the promise that God made to Abraham exactly amen the law didn't come to change the promise exactly that's right right am that's what he's saying right here the law which was 430 years after God met Abraham and said you're going to have this promised seed cannot disan that it should make the promise of none effect exactly people thought well now we're going to start doing the law but see watch what they did when Jesus came when they met MDC again they were the this is my point they were the natural Seed of Abraham amen right you keep them creases between your eyes and you going to get little old brother Mark talks to you and he but really that's what they were the Pharisees and Sadducees that was looking at MDC again they said we be of the Seed of Abraham amen now I'm telling you people don't let that happen in the end time yeah cuz it will they looked at MDC again but they were not of the faith seed of Abra right they were of the natural exactly can't deny that they show you their lineage all the way back natural but they were not of the spiritual Beed because Jesus told them said you of your father not of Abraham but of the devil for if the inheritance be of the law see that's what the Pharisees and sagues they thought they were going to get the inheritance and would have and did before Jesus came but when Jesus came it didn't anull it he just actually brought that promise In the Flesh amen the one that should have come not Isaac right but Jesus Christ for if the inheritance be of the law it's no more promise right dos and don'ts cut your hair don't cut your hair wear pants don't wear pants come to church don't come to church if it be just by that then it's not the promise anymore right exactly but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law question mark it was added because of the transgressions of men let me add that in there just to make you realize that's what he did he added that transgression because of our sins right till what amen till the 120 in the upper room came came to who the promise was made amen some of you smileing I'm not changing the word but that's what that's where the promise began that's where the real promise began right wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of our transgression till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by Angels now Angels can't give you the promise but it was ordained by little angels right ministers right in the hands of a mediator now mediator is not the mediator of one not a pope Pope's not the mediator between God and man we know who that was now the mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one is the law then against the promise of God God forbid if you don't do the things you're supposed to do you don't have the promise right but if you do do the things you're supposed to do you have the promise and you have your Justified watch is the law then against the promise of God God forbid other words like d said God forbid man that you think that this law was just for nothing right it's all this Old Testament exactly but that's what they had as an example or foundation for you and I cuz let me just be real honest when milasan met Abraham sure he was talking to him in a twofold manner one you're going to have a natural son you going to have but all these seeds are going to be yours but he was not speaking of seeds as of many right Paul picked that up MDC was talking about you and I exactly cuz he had us on his mind amen you Lord we were there with him glory you said oh brother Brown said we were there in the shores of Galilee absolutely but you know what we were there talking to Abraham too right sister Gil you were there not you the person I'm looking at but if you have the Holy Spirit that same Holy Ghost right that's in you tonight had to be or it's a different person right right then this whole thing's a lie come on people this whole thing is a lie if the Holy Ghost you have in you tonight wasn't standing in front of Abraham talking just like I'm talking now cuz how do you think we get it it com through the priesthood still right but not a levitical priesthood anymore not a priesthood of lineage anymore right but Jesus is the high priest and he speaks it to us and we speak it to you amen problem is sometimes we get our own speaking involved it's a law then against the promise of God God forbid if there had been a law given which could have given life in other words if the Ten Commandments is all we had and it was just in 10 pages and that's all we had in the Bible if it could have given life then he would have never should have never talked to Abraham right barely righteousness should have been by the law right but the scripture have concluded now wait a minute Paul you said we're righteous you said we're just ain't that what he just said in all scriptures before but the scripture have concluded what the law all understand right that the Promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that that's amen believe amen that's it now let's go to Hebrews 11 read that we'll be finished let's read what Paul said the great faith chapter listen to our now remember see Abraham's not our Father by anything except Faith amen Hebrews 11:8 you guys can put it up if you want to that's okay but we read it in our Bible by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after to receive for an inheritance I underlined that word twice obeyed yeah obedience and he went out not knowing whther he went right by faith he so sojourn in the land of promise see he was in that land the whole time right he was in the land the whole time he just didn't realize it amen you're in the workings of the new birth all the time right you just don't realize it yet right oh if we could just see that I wish I could open up the head and pour it in myself too by faith he sojourn in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose Builder and maker is God through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spring there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and the sand which is by the seashore innumerable now listen to this verse 13 look at that right there look up on the board these all died right in faith not having received amen exactly not having received the promises but having seen them AAR off right and were persuaded by them when that word them that's the promises yeah and were persuaded of them and embrac them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth they all died in faith not having received right the promises right so it must have been for another generation right must have been for another people verse 14 for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from when they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now verse 16 but now they desire a better country amen that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city Glory by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it is said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from when also he received him in a figure that's right what he received the figure of the promise amen but Isaac was not the promise Jesus Christ was the promised SE amen but now let's not do away with you and I because by faith they never received the promise right that's right Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph they never received the promise all they lived in such Glory they lived in such Splendor they lived in a world that maybe sometimes you and I would would like to live in where God would just rain down all kind of blessings but they never received what they were looking for what about you and I right amen I leave that with you today by Faith by faith they believed by Faith by faith they believed it said by faith but they did not receive the promise because who was the promise given to not to seeds as of many that's right and Paul picked it up and said it was Christ in you amen the hope of glory right MDC was not talking to physical Abraham he was talking to me and you glory amen he was talking to me and you that's right cuz remember Abraham was The Promise by faith we're the faith Seed of Abraham but Abraham was not our savior right Abraham couldn't redeem us now through the same faith that Abraham had we could go toward that promise right but if we just had the faith of Abraham it said right there we couldn't receive the promise right yeah in other words what are you trying to say our faith and hope is built on nothing left Glory but Jesus blood and right Glory right all the songs sing in one person not Abraham right but through faith right we got the promise Glory if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight let's stand you got the promise you've got what MDC wanted Abraham to have but Abraham could not have it right in the condition that he was in right you say oh he's great yeah yeah the great father of our faith right but the promise had to not of the law or anything that Abraham or Abram did but it was speaking of Jesus Christ The Promised right and Abraham can't do anything to this group of people right here right this group of people right here can only be saved by Jesus Christ Glory can't be saved by D giby way Dale I wished I could Glory I wished I could but I can't but if you're ashamed to put your kids on this list I'm ashamed of you yeah okay but this list is going to stay with me brother Joe's got a copy of it if you want to add now listen I'm not talking about friends we all love our friends I want my friends to be saved too but I want my blood my family right family that's where my genetics natural are and Jesus you know the Bible says you'd be there with your offsprings and that was The Offspring Francis came from you and you and her you can't deny that right right right so we believe she's going where we going amen exactly I know you do but you know what Abraham walked 25 years before Isaac's name was added to this or was taken off of this list right amen until the you understand until the promis son came right Abraham and Abram walked 25 years calling these names you sure he didn't know Isaac's name you're not getting the point God made him a promise amen that's right of a promised seed a promised child that would carry on his genetics Glory now we're not talking about natural genetics natural genetics got us nowhere that's right even coming from Abra I mean coming from Adam his natural genetics I was reading it the other day brother R said Adam's seed natural polluted this whole world sure now how could that one seed do anything to save anybody if it killed the whole human race but we got to get away from that natural seed right and it wasn't coming from the loins of Abraham it's the faith Seed of Abraham now coming from the spoken word amen this right here spoken seed word this Jesus said plainly this is the seed that the SE went to seow he SED the word that's what we got to do get these people here it's not going to take a miracle it's just going to take believing the word amen Abraham and Sarah they they it wasn't a miracle they had that baby cuz you know what God told him he was going to and you know what he changed their body back so they could Glory Abraham and Sarah there's no way they could develop and have this right here Isaac no way brother Chris but they believed what God that's right and It produced this right let's bow oure dear heavenly father Lord we love you and we thank you that you've given us even an opportunity to stand before these people that you in the form of MDC looked at Abraham one time several thousand years ago go and said I'm going to have a promised group of people not seeds as of many of natural genetics but of a spiritual genealogy yes they come down through there in the Old Testament and was hidden in the law but father the law couldn't save anybody It could only push sin away but oh God you promised that you would come yourself with no natural genealogy on this Earth no Abraham as your natural father or Moses or anybody that was great father you came through the womb of a virgin you created the egg and The Germ and placed it in Mary and came onto the Earth Lord as a child and lived went through trials and troubles and heartaches and growth of life and suffered Lord and then you became a man and father you started sewing the word into the Earth you started speaking the gospel that was before the foundation of the world written and what MDC was trying to give to Abraham father you gave in a little man named Jesus Glory the only time your beautiful name was spoken is when you came on this Earth yes the name of Jesus Christ Glory that where all man was waiting and even you father was waiting for a time that you could fulfill that Genesis 3:15 that you would come through the womb of a virgin father with no natural genealogy to look back on to say it was great or or what more but Lord when you came on Earth they branded you as illegitimate and all these other things Lord being made from the purest birth that could ever be made in the world they called you the lowest name they could call you but father that didn't bother you you were still looking at a promise that you made that through the seat of the woman you would bring all this back yes and then you met a man named Abraham gave him the promise and then here you come down and fulfill that promise so that people like the names I called that have not come yet Lord and the ones that are here Lord that are that are called and Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Lord that you can call us your children yes the very children that you wanted on the earth before there was all this chaos father you went on the cross with us on your mind and a list of names were stared before the foundation of the world Lord and then you came here to be crucified but that crucifixion didn't stop anything Lord you had a promise that it would be a seed that would come on the earth in the end time all down Through the Ages have been many brides and many things Lord but down here at the end we're promised to be set free yes and you told us Lord that if we would have the faith of Abraham that the promise will be given to each and every one of us and Lord you know in my heart a few weeks ago Lord I started calling these names Lord I know you don't get deaf to them that you hear every one of them father I pray Lord that you would as you promised several years ago Lord that that many of these names some of them would would be back yes Lord and you promise Lord that many more would come back to you father I pray now Lord that our focus and our aim and our goal is to serve you father and serving you is the serve others and serving others is to tell them about this great gospel Lord not so much that that this great prophet came in the end time or we know that comes with it but Lord let's just tell the world about you Lord Jesus Christ the savior of the world and tell them how you came and we'll tell them how you came and how you came back and said you promised that you would not only be with us but you'd be in US and that Lord that you promised that we'd be flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone and father this great holy spirit that you've given us Lord in the end time is now able to look into this word to look into the prophet's message and see things that Abraham would have loved to see Isaac would have loved to seen David all those Old Testament prophets even John the Baptist even some of the ones back there Lord would love to see this day and father don't let us take it lightly then from now on that they all the whole Bible is pointing toward this bride at the end time the promises are to be fulfilled in her and we're to be a part of it Lord but we pray that you would just now bring our families in Lord yes great yes Lord we love you father thank you for giving us the burden for these Souls thank you for giving us the burden Lord to preach your gospel and Lord to just give up oursel to you Lord may we do it more may we all give up everything of ourself that we'll not have our own righteousness Paul said with just filthy rags but to have the righteousness of Jesus Christ Grant it Lord yes in the calmness now of the Holy Spirit I pray that you would just go to these people on this list you know who they are Lord and the ones that now in the congregation I'm sure that they're they're calling the names and they're in their memory Lord that their family members Lord that are lost and need salvation that you would Lord in the sweetness of your Holy Spirit go to them Lord and just prick their hearts as you did on the day of Pentecost and that they would come back and say men and Brethren what can we do to have this great salvation Lord we'll just tell them to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and the promise will be to them that was the promise that Abraham was looking for Lord we love you we Praise Your Great Name thank you for a church group Lord thank you for the people that you've gathered together in your name father now we pray that you'd go with us Lord in the furtherment of this service that we sing the songs to you Lord and to no one else that our love will be focused toward you father and no one else that our that our desires will be for you father glory and nothing else bless us now Lord Keep keep us safe we know the devil is going to try everything he can to stop a son and daughter of God from being born but father greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world that's we need to start believing that we need to realize that you've already spoken it and there will be a bride there will be a people that will stand and resist the Ws of the devil but it won't be of our own Works father but it'll be you inside of us because we've taken the promise and held it by one word and that's faith we believe you Lord thank you for the blessings thank you for the ones that are coming Lord we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen you believe amen this is it right here amen I want these people saved filled with the Holy Ghost glory and if if I was a rich man I'd go visit every one of them and I'd never go to work again a day of my life i' try i' take but you can't do that you can't Badger them you can't go get in their house and you know that was one thing that Dad and Mom really will mom didn't do a lot of but Dad really just kind of left you know just you can't make somebody
