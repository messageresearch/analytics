just remember that people in your private equity you like turning your scriptures turn to Matthew 5 where we've been reading and we will read again Hebrews 6 Matthew 5 and Hebrews 6 father we thank you for this day in the hour they would have upon the earth that we can live and Lord have our being here and know for sure David you have come down to visit us in the last days through the opening of the word and we thank you we ask you now to just come this night and open it on to us that we may see you and walk therein we love you and we thank you forgive our sins keep us clean by the blood and just have your way bless each one Lord you promised in your word that you said you would send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction so we're depended upon that we love you and we thank you have your way now as we read the words you come in under the word by your presence in Jesus amen okay Matthew 537 we've been reading through 48 but let your communication baaaaa for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you heard that has been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man shall shew thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have that cloak also whosoever shall compel thee to go my uncle with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would bar of the turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father now remember how we brought it up you got the Beatitudes before this you know of what it is blessed is this blessing is this now he's laying down a pain to shorts it's going to move from that down from under those things he says we're blessed but then when it changes over he begins to talk about you know more like your life you know and in forgiving and going to my land you know and all like that wine first 45 seconds you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and Sun shineth running on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans society and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so after all of that saying putting it down i get these says be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect now he's telling us what it takes to be perfect and then God requires it takes the one to be able to forgive to do this etc etc right alright Hebrews 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not letting again the foundation of repentance from dead works and a fake toward God of the doctrine of baptisms and I'm laying on of hands and the resurrection of the Dead and of eternal judgment and this when we do if God premia teman they be seated the Lord is blessing to the reading of the word now we have been studying for quite a while be there for perfect and this makes about the eighth message if we've taken on this and I'm trying to get something to all of us and I know I'm mighty slowly and on like that but I I still you know when I was in school it took me a long time to learn my ABC's you know the kids now they know when they're 23 years old but we didn't have that then we were we was following them you around in the field we didn't know what the holiday bc's that anyway probably had a lot of other words we didn't know what they meant for the muse but still you know and we didn't learn to put them all together and with this kind of slope and that's the way I am in the gospel is this kind of slow brother mote used to talk about he's like a caddy and a grinding stone when you say they know where the world of the cat could take his tongue neither grindstone what it is because if he picked it off one brain fell off this tongue doctora coming back a few weeks later gets another grand after a while the holes don't come to it this takes a little while and you bear with me to try to get to you what I want to to say but now remember what we were doing and talking about that what is the difference between between the word perfect and the word perfection all right and in doing that I've tried to get you to see things and then we come along and then we reach pictures and things it looks like it's contrary in and we'll try to express that to you because I don't want you left dangling you know into a point but we went through for let the times of showing how that in the old testament did it says that no one was perfect the end about three times are in the book of Job it's a job was perfect well now are you argue with God about it are we going to take our carnality and peanut brains and I like to study because it pretty well sums it up and we're going to argue with God and say well now they wouldn't perfect well that's jobs comforters to see that was the guys that was giving him all the trouble they couldn't see it either and they were arguing about it but God said it he laid away Emma joke said I've made the atonement I've done what God told me to do he made the atonement even for his children dungeon okay God gave them to it alright so then it's not a point of wondering what it is but to compare that with the word perfect coming over yes we look at them and say they were not warned again we see the atonement is what made them perfect mmm may I know the question I'll ask you in a few minutes when we get down to something on on this but I want to make sure you follow me because the word perfect in the Old Testament we showed it in our saving these basically same meaning as the new testament work for perfect it's not a lot of difference in it it means like complete you know brought to an end by Matthew 548 it means to finish wanting nothing necessary to the completeness that which is perfect in other words full grown adult full age mature and I told you the reason that he is is because if you're going to use the word perfect if you could add anything to perfect then it was not perfect right I perfect means nothing can be added now perfect can be added to perfect right like I illustrated the statue of perfect man you have faith virtue knowledge temperance patience and but those are the same source you know what caused you to talk about the new earth the new birth makes you perfect in your soul and how human things out here in our bodies oh yeah but that has nothing to do with God because surely if he could say that job and Noah was perfect until Abraham to come and walk with human be perfect if you can do that under the blood of bulls and goats what about other the blood of Jesus Christ all right you know we know that the new birth is what you need to make you perfect right good it wouldn't matter what we tried to do we can't be perfect in our sales there's no leg to that we could be good enough probably said I hate in the Hebrews here hate to think that I was born five minutes ago and would I have to go to heaven upon some Mary or some form because I born in sin set into the nicholas batsman you know what for them a ladder all right now the child couldn't be guilty of doing anything that was five minutes old but his weight was born so if this morn long all right but if the blood of bulls and goats could make a man making the atonement and stand under the Toulmin and God would cover them and look at them and say I don't see talking about info so don't see their problems by let's say you don't look here look who I surely he said I don't see them why because you looking at the atonement they made all right so you never get down to the point of looking at the atonement in the correct order and bringing it out who will see what really perfect is perfect is so beautiful word you can add anything to it right it would mean it's not perfect I need to then perfect is more or less what God has done for us what he done for for Noah what he done for Joe what he done for the people of the Old Testament he covered their sins by the atonement did he required for them to make my crew that's right have any government all right he couldn't see their sin and it might not mean anything to you but not in the scripture where it refers to it and Joshua said said you put up with a map TM x new way to get the entire they were still headed to the promised land haven but when they got the case Barney on and they doubted God's Word through that profit then they were told they could not go in there man that's right is it all let's doubted it always been this way you're gonna die in the wilderness and said I'll raise up your children and take them Ian he did so he put up with all kind of things but he couldn't put up with the one thing that they finally done which was disbelief right nice to be able to keep his work all right now so then looking at the word perfect we we got to a little bit on the scripture but I want to pick up a few and just let you look at and just see what it means to be perfect and then we're going into to the perfection part all right so then looking at the scriptures let's just pick up a few let's go to Hebrews five and nine now let what you don't mcrainey when they when he get it no one cuz I gotta be honest to look in your Bible clip speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ Hebrews father none and being a perfect he became the author of eternal salvation of Homeland oh man being my perfect right now what does that mean about him when he was the perfect God he what did it what did it mean about him to say that being my perfect alright so there the definition of it is 154 ta is what won't I am going to get through this will just read down to it not a brother know Anderson a new give up the definition Hebrews 11 before he says God haven't provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect he says we're perfect in the new birth but then without us cannot be made perfect James do it with you think see us that how faith wrought with works and my works was faith made perfect 1st John 417 said hearing as our love made perfect we may have boldness of the day of judgment that's right because as he is are we in this world given as I love my perfect 1st John for 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not my perfect in love so now that work perfect then I've tried to get this to you and you forgive me my dears to me that's having to be say ever done but no the word perfect then if I taught you and shown you that Martin Luther I believe had any work for the agency's living heaven John Wesley had a new earth the people back their head and you were for the age they were living but now it was not the growth development that's right as it would be compared to this age true because they were not responsible we get that new birth may imperfect emma is it made a perfect helping you anything else good see then your growth development would not be something extra added it would just me more of the same God our word revealed he said the word perfect starts off as a understanding I'll just is your sins are dropped off according to the Bible they're never to be remembered again right who would that be perfect and then see then we take the word perfect and we we take it at a low form and we begin to see how much Gregory gets the higher and higher it goes with its basic meaning all the way through is the son all right all of those is taken from 5048 now if you wound down to it you look what the word perfect there has meaning to perfect make perfect perfect finish full field be perfect consecrate to make perfect complete to carry through completely to accomplish finish bring to an end to complete perfect in other words and what is it won't in order to render a painful to be found perfect to bring to the end are the gold in other words the purpose to a conference in other words bring to a close of fulfillment by event the prophecies of the scriptures so then Jesus was made perfect he was made perfect by what suffering is that stretcher that's right and become the author she became to a full eight he was born too baby he couldn't die for our sins when he was baby you couldn't die for our sins when he was twelve years over the hour 14 or whatever with it we argued with the priest in the temple he entered his ministry in about 30 years of age and begin to go forth preaching and the Bible says being made perfect in other words he come to the fullest of the completion he came to the end of his Rodney the end of all things reached him it made him to be the one that would be perfect right when he didn't have to have anything to make it perfect are you listening that's what I try to stir you up with Holloway maybe it's perfectly well none of us perfect anyone whom Allah says you are we gave the quote for it run around and said if you're not perfect you're not going to heaven he said if you're not perfect you're lost because there is no wat blackbird there's no drunks over man there's no center site you're either a Christian or you're not a Christian you're either born again are not born again the foolish virgins is not born again they don't have eternal life so they're not perfect they're waiting for a time to be able to receive eternal life right and you know when they receive it then they'll be perfect but the born-again experience match the soul of the individual perfect and places with inside of us the one that can lead us into what we have the other the statue of a perfect man group development all right whatever it takes the end do we ask the question and that's why we read our in Matthew 5 48 oh that's the word perfect then we read over in Hebrew six now for leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection we found out the word for faction it has a a great meaning to it you'd say well its growth development all right that's true well pull up that number of the jaw bone Hebrew six well the head he route 61 where we give the definition underneath so therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine oh crap let us go on unto perfection do not look at the meaning of the word perfection is a it's finisher a perfect her it's not referring to you and I because it's not referring to you and I of anything that made is perfect right God is the only one that can make this birthday he gave us a new earth amen so he gave us the perfecter it's the only way you drop the statue of a perfect man to be born again first and then through the opening the word we can attain unto these things listen perfecter now what one who have in his own person raised fate to its perfection so that would leave us out totally go we can't within our own person achieve any funny so now this is get the point what we were trying to get that Sunday move on and so set before us the highest example of faith there's only one perfect there's only one perfect and that we read to Sunday there were the probably said our perfection comes to Jesus Christ now like what brought him open always said and he said in Jesus Christ is the work I like that huh now let's read another scripture and will I want to ask you a question me Hebrews 7 11 they're for perfection we're buying a little bit of cold priesthood for under it that people receive the law what further need was dire that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek and not be calm after the order of Darren now is there for perfection we're by the Levitical priesthood now read what's in Princeton to see Colette senior picture for under it men worked under the Levitical priesthood the people received the law all right now that work for faction is a basic same meaning of perfection of of Hebrew 61 but I could give these to this lets you look at it it's numbers 5050 which means performance it means perfection a complete team a perfecting ing something going home it means fulfillment accomplishment the event which verifies the promise now Paul says Hebrews 6 wonder therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us alone to perfection what is he talking about is he talking about destroying the principles are keeping the principles as a foundation that's what I was trying to express our son deceive it sunday afternoon that perfection is dealing with the one inside of us to bring us to a place where as the new birth brothers to position us he turned wife mrs. growth development adoption a statue a perfect man you know had your faith virtue knowledge improv group development all right and then doing that we look back at the old testament we see that surely the only way they could be perfect with one thing now here's the question no listen where the old fashioned of people make perfect by the law are keeping it alone I'm pose for you to think where they make perfect by the law are keeping you the loan hardware they made perfect by the atonement mmm see which way if they could have been made perfect by keeping the Levitical law it would have not been necessary Paul says for another priesthood and develop right right and then if they could have been perfect my keeping the law you see that's what everybody thinks everybody thinks by keeping the lowest it makes you perfect Oh said what I felt was laughs all right they keep it alone the letter keeping it he said I found to be death right so were they I'm trying to express something new you'll see what Hall says leaving the principles of the doctors who cracks in the world so then if it was possible that they could be made perfect Paul says here in Hebrews 7 11 that it would not be necessary that another priesthood come the priesthood of Aaron was fine for the time but it couldn't bring people to a place that they could she want God wanted the law Colin said is spiritual we said I'm carnal now what you say the law is the word of God you agree it is the word of God the 10 commandments that was the word of god it was God run around sit in letter form ma'am but to keep that long getting even atone good we did why would they go offer the offer you re listen if keeping of the law would make an atonement for you why would you making a tone right you see those Pharisees were so perfect in their life The Dispatch to the high priest if you found one mark or see them against that high priests they take them out killing his rent give your mommy a daddy grand blood red bug grow only all in the lineage everything that'll be perfect their land be exactly right because that's what they thought of the law will see that long as they keeping of the law could not make them perfect right had to keep another Lauren listening and to keep it up if the keeping of the law made a perfect there was no need to making her sacrifice see under the law they had to make a sacrifice Wright and they wouldn't dare have not made that receive a thought by keeping the law now I remind you of a rich young ruler they came to the Lord Jesus mission he had heard of him probably and saw on his life those things different and all many healings whatever he'd seen a little different in it and he came to Jesus one day and he said good master what can I do have eternal life you remember what Jesus was talking about doing the enema well keeping the commandments he said and the rich young ruler said I think it's john 5 he said I've kept this from my youth and the scripture says it Jesus left it you know why because he knew your fried right he knew what he was telling he was correct did he had kept the commandments Jesus didn't say that's gonna give you eternal life she keep another Commandments cannot bring life right keeping the other Commandments is what we read in the scripture about faith is made perfect by works which reason to giving those scriptures remember James and Paul looking like they were contrary but they were not one saying it looked like you say but work so it look like with my faith we come find out you're both in the same time right around city faith then give our works if I'll I don't match the Word of God there's no need to talking about that's right alright so now I'm not trying to destroy the law but I realize I know what the scripture says about it jesus said he come to magnify the Lord so you can't do away with something that is magnified you have to fight you magnified you bringing it all over in have a clear you your you do it now watch what I'm saying the law is perfect mmm you agree I meant the law was perfect because it was word of God right but the person putting their own interpretation upon it see and that's what the frack season almost say he sees no empowered they taught her perfection of keeping the law repose writings about it he said I found it out that it was death he said I'm a Pharisee of the ferric season he breathing he proved it under the law we set by English but he said I found that to be dead what the law no right his interpretation amen he's understanding a water all really loves you know the actual bill all would actually the bound said added because of transgressions that's right you know what the law actually done bein to begin to make a record under the law was a record keep eyes on the record keeper well they told you don't do this don't do that don't do this don't do that now it was perfect understand me with the person who done everything that it said or didn't do what it said don't feel another word you know it might be perfect let me do a person that we grieve the Hat round but it didn't make him perfect that's when it was not a fancy or a sack you see you know I'm talking about to the high elders the rulers etc they could make a statement like David there was an adulterer murderer Rena we said blessed the man whom God will not impute sin does that mean God like the way they picked hon they come on God is gone he can't like seeing he said David's a man after my own heart he said the example of my eye what I've always tried to get you to see one time David had something that most people didn't hire get an honest and a contra hour when he was condemned her sin irritated was it then he was a special some kind of a person there was he special in the basis that he repent now you see the establishment of them making that under the Old Testament it was not the keeping of the law that made the person perfect it was the atonement that God in the law it was a requirement for to be done so then if perfection were by the Levitical priesthood of this underneath the people receive the law what further need was there that another pre should rise after the order of Melchizedek not just lonely be called them bricks of Aaron he said what are you getting that we listened to you so far so what we get when you get it do you think that even by living the letter of the word to the letter will save you did you understand what I just like them living the word to the letter by the letter right in other words doing everything it said and only you think it's a he wouldn't save them it was necessary that another priesthood arrived the Jesus would be after the order of Melchizedek and a priesthood means that there's a different form of atonement to be made good on in a Levitical priesthood he told you what you offer a lamb Graham birds this snap the other he had it all the way now oh really in the Bible is on the Tim Tim parts to be called the law see we call the whole Old Testament law now on this Ten Commandments that's the wall the rest of it was writings about the law right the only existence of the law is the Ten Commandments man the others were ordinances and things that were handed down to the people for them to do under the existence of that and the law was headed because of transgression run around and said they did not get what they thought they got he said they thought they got a book of rules he said that they got God in letter form the runaround would even take the 10 commandments and lay it in the seals and say they were the same is any possible way that anything that we could think of that would make us to where the god would save us or not prada God said if you think you've done anything that's right or haven't done anything that would make god save you he said Jesus Christ died in vain well you mean you don't want to be good for the deal now I'm honestly say if we can say we're gonna be good who live in person being good you know and doing what was right I listen brother David Gatlin haven't made a good point about being drugged you know drug your drugs are in hell but he said actually they got through draggin us all over him and beat the daylights out of they make good people out of its another words perforation when you said I stood with you won't save you right if you think there was anything you've done or didn't do is what saved you then Jesus Christ down in mind amen I didn't do I Gresham not still at your site and I never try that might be good I tried smoking I didn't care nothing about it and I mean I never did gosh how they want to keep my teeth where they're at no that's just true you know I freaking God that's why I can relate to what policy after all appalled fea that under the law would blindness and all the things he with her he said I'm the chiefest of sinners remember that you know I image the Chiefs the center because he was the closest to the truth i right that's right it's commendable that you've never drank you've never done this real ever done that that's collectible but did your profits it like this he said now sisters don't type because it you've got a long dress and along her but it means you're going to have it that's right yeah d alright so there was no way under the Old Testament are the only way on the old testament of being perfect was to make the atonement right and the law told you what a Coleman tomato I mean you know under the writings and funny they were told what to do you know he got on her dad right said to be more perfect for making that that's what I've been trying to get but was it the law that saved them earthy aroma that same that right that's the time of the message is it the law order is it to do the atonement p.c brother Dale you dont preach like everybody help I agree we but is it the truth what's that got to do it and they love reach life is it the truth of what I'm saying mmm the law can't say you they couldn't say them no that's right and they keep it to the wall can't save you now all right well do you mean it's better for us to go out live like the devil I didn't say that why would you think right when I just got to say that even in the world I didn't drink never did have no trouble with drinking sit down beside of somebody after i got saved and they start drinking the beer that you're hunting club within i just set their dime I can close my mouth and start wandering you wouldn't do that when i saw this when i saw seven cuz i thought it was garbage games he goes the devil at night to me man he already had me right when i listen so Paul says the end the code of the New Testament now you listening to the pointer under the Old Testament they made the atonement drive event and that's what covered them in mail perfect all right little Levitical priesthood ended run around set of Calvary all right you know that Jesus even came under the law the Bible says to redeem them that one of the law when he would heal somebody he'd say go offer the sacrifice of motion but he was still he went under the law he came to fulfill the law to the letter because it no man could keep it see then they would have to be another priesthood which will leave the priesthood of Melchizedek which is Jesus Christ well Reverend said we see no more of milk Chesney he said because he became Jesus cried all right all right so then if there was a new testament they would have to be a new covenant and being a new covenant they would have to be a new atonement see the ax told me of the atonement of the New Testament is the body of Jesus Christ you agree he became a sacrifice for you and I in his flesh Paul said he took upon him the sins of man and paid the price and being made perfect that's why I love it those animals are best they could do you know that they would even the fact that the red heifer can have three as many as three what hires in it and still be counted perfect they can have as many as three wires in it and still be counted perfect that's the Levitical law you seeing Jesus Christ there was no three tires he's the perfect two dominant not only then I have an eternal atonement when who died rose and went to Gloria needs my atonement that's why the Bible says that he is our advocate Jesus Christ the righteous he became as we've read these definitions he became a cola fulfillment now all the things he became the end who remember the Bible said Christ at the end of the law for righteousness and love people don't like the last night that either everybody said all the law ended back there if you're not born to be and you're still under the wall that's right let's crash to the end of the law for righteousness for them that are saved right man the world so under the law and will be condemned by the light right I bet you thought of that man only violent you were remember the way that I preached hit the way out later than you believe what you'll do but I leave under the Old Testament it wasn't everybody that was covered by the blood they was covered by the fact of keeping them from being destroyed because that was the atonement that was made uri we just become somebody drove away much slammed it down and said effort for me i'm going back nude again he wasn't forgiven it was only those of an honest in the contrite heart right now that was that way under the Old Testament what about the New Testament yeah man well they don't make no difference what I did I'm a Christian that's the madness doctrine once saved always sunny you know which I don't believe what's truly born again always going to be in heaven but not just because you say you're saying but the low having a shadow of good things the scripture says to come can never make the comer perfect because it is nothing to be able to get into this rock that night right a man right the blood of bulls and goats and animal life in the number so we can come back none of the New Testament now we have not only the high priest of our confession we have not only the one who can pay the price we have the one who can come and live in us right all right now becoming Leah Venice then we can think about going on to perfection and pulse it but now let's get over to where we are you notice that in turn anybody yet so we forget that it is free so when you come into the New Testament by the new birth is the only way you're in a New Testament that's when you do it by turn the first book of the New Testament they'll automatically turn to Matthew that's not the first book of the New Testament the book of Acts is the first book of the New Testament Jesus was still under the law here in Matthew Mark Luke and John Durrani but they listen all set there for leaving the principles of the doctrine of crime let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of networks he come and I ask you to read Hebrews look around where he preached Hebrews 6 selling not do that in the Hebrew book you'll hear bread around explaining that even the one God the water baptism no eternal hell and all that is carnal reform now how can any corner reforming is the word of God what is he talking about he's talking about to me now the same thing at the Old Testament know the law was spiritual it was the Word of God but by their interpretation and they're keeping of the law they thought it made him righteous put it in the atonement their only cover them you couldn't take it away so Paul what are you saying right around them what do you say should we get rid of the understanding of one God can we get rid of the understanding of no eternal hell and Tirpitz II know right all sit there for leaving the principles the beginning in other words don't stay on that's where the trouble in the Old Testament they went year by year by year by year by year by year for thousands of years doing the same thing you agree but when a tire changed in any form whatsoever that's why the when they come to Jesus I said we are Moses disciples yep he said young but Moses spoke a minute yeah right you know what did only Kelly would come in right they killed him because he was what Moses said now do you think that because that you didn't do anything no you didn't go out and commit see him that was the reason God saved you right cuz he had to save them because you take the difference between the old testament in the new and if you don't have the multiplication are magnifying of it you know none of the old testament to look at a woman unless factory wouldn't that come on wouldn't then but to commit adultery could be dead right d so they were doing better than we are cuz under the new testament is amplified look on a woman to lust after in the art you committed adultery already with her but what's Paul staying back for leaving the principles that's what I'm trying to get it to you with a point then wrong that's the question was it the atonement that made imperfect or was it the keeping of the law that made a perfect I tried is Paul saying go on to perfection in other words we find that bread rancid don't do this I'll take care of that didn't do that door let me sit do this okay I'll go do that I listening so much legalism until that's right nerd I'm industry that's why this church started I've heard people preach you to hell because you toward out advice defense Nikita quote smart would you don't want which kids we didn't Arthur have a pass defense you know what cuz if cow got out you don't put the counter usual offensive DN usually whooping rounded have to tell me I'm tired out apostrophes yeah yeah you didn't have to tell me dr. Grady come on dude what I'm trying to get me you to look at I'll said leaving the principles right let us go on to perfection because whether or not we keeping the message is not what sir the price paid for seeing he made the atonement he paid the price agree well you just might be destroyed like the devil if you live like today where you are the devil any problem come on you live life in there where you are the devil let's just meet up no problem with anybody usually no couldn't even leave soon well then you're not born again I said that simple enough you're just not going to get ready to don't continue you said your conscience see Paul is not saying throw away these things but he's saying these things were what the Old Testament people done to faint make them righteous that's what you see in the message today that's right you see the preachers preaching leave a list big bangs don't cut your heart don't you fight if you got to tell somebody that's been in this message one year one year I'll give that much scratch yeah I didn't say good morning I said you've been in this message one year and you listen to tapes you know better than to cut your heart paint your face that's right yeah right right come on you know you're all did it Moran said holy you don't have to have a Holy Ghost be condemned over lifetime you mean you said I need to hold it goes keep me from committing adultery with you something wrong with you conscious of a moral obligation or to keep you from doing that you know hip and soul but you see ya way I look at it I see the people of the message trying to reach perfection because I hear them today is preaching the same thing they freeze 40 years ago that's right and i know i conned that phrase out of it one time if you get in every round woman is your lab work in the gospel whether he slipped or what he said he had to make a study when he said it is your wife worth your the gospel i heard people preach if we got the women on it with lead for the retro then I've heard that she shall be saved in childbearing belongs you sisters bad kid you're saved you said you've heard that out of people that makes it yes and you have to maybe you slept them like these late ma'am don't remember it listen to my speech to you somewhere you see what's being said probably you coming after me they threw the service and they'd ask me questions about are you afraid to ask somebody a question right you killing ask me I'll tell you exactly what I'm done bad but it's like I've always say it if I'm talking about you and you come and ask me am I talking that you gonna tell you I'm talking about you okay see that way most people won't come and ask you because they're afraid you'll tell you that you're talking about them move why not nobody want to be right too when I see it two factions I see two ways that Satan perverts and cool and I look at it is the Old Testament people of what they were doing right they thought that they buy not breaking the law made in saved so that's what I see most people think today then if they're not breaking them all the word the thanks Brett around see it you know all of that that that might some sunny where did Jesus Christ what did you see I far you know I thought we were posed to believe that works his faith expressed you know I thought we broke to believe just to Gail that the Christian life was to be an automatic process from inside of us Evan that's what i was talking about on the Hebrews 6 where it refers to the perfection that that's the same word of referring to Jesus about his perfection and being made perfect he came to the position that he could enter into us and live his life through us and bring to us the things of his nature I thought that's what we were I thought Christianity was crash living in on site but I said two groups one group thanks I do the best that I can do i do the best i can be real they'll try everything you all again I just hope out either then the other side says well the Bible says of David blessed is the man to whom God won't have you seen God loves me so much he won't impute ropes into me trying to sleep like the devil and this my lid yeah now I don't believe neither one will try know everybody say it today in all of the ways of doing you hear them and they keep saying we're looking to people that message you're just falling away the people the message is not falling away the mixed multitude the mixed multitude is what's falling away man that's right i'm in a revival I've been in a revival ever since I've been in this message 4700 there's never been a dull day and me and the word all right all right rejoice daily and what it reveals to me I'm having a good time in the word right would you see the mixed multitude is what got Israel in trouble study your Bible in concordance mixed multitude and legal background you see what domina right there was a mixed multitude it got Israel in trouble this is the mixed multitude around the bride of Jesus Christ it keeps everything on last night yep but those that are born again are going right down the line they're hindered yes yes hindered right because if they don't hold they don't have somebody to teach you what perfection really is but so they think that is keeping the message well now remember the old testament if that would write that under the ernet priesthood of keeping the law Paul said there was no need for another priesthood to come right because you would have been perfect with what you know that folks is not another priesthood to come in this nice day yo man come on don't ever get mental thoughts in my mind there's not another priesthood to come because we're the priesthood always coming a message and the Lord Jesus came with a message right he was the living example amen brother and said perfect face that he live in a world of perfect thing all by himself he said he's at all and we could just live in that world of perfect thing do you think it makes you a Christian to not do wrong is that what you think you do I'll get saved get born again and they let the one this inside of you live and you never rot life Jesus not had any trouble with drinking again let's move to run around women it's their room I don't trouble the only dude well after you put him in us i thought that the prophet said that you could take a pig and he said its nature is to rutland welcome of it no wonder he said what you put the nature of a lamb inside that did he said that people go on the side of the hill t green rice now he says explaining the new earth right then if Christ is in you and me working any problem with the living well then you don't ever have to metro i doing wrong every day you win quote your prophet he said he did he said he seemed they were doing though would you see every day I've gotten a part of me that says Lord forgive now laid out at night and I'm not a prayer warrior I'm sorry never been that way but sometimes going to answer is my priority on that all right but I'm just not what's called a prayer warrior I lay down at night I said lord I love you so thank you for saving more than 0 been wrong today to give me you just make me what you want cuz I'm gonna be riding horse I want you to live that's it that's it did you see sometimes you hear it for her we got the word Sunday that Alan Richard was sitting in a traffic jam before you got the word out either 18 minutes later the traffic jam was coming at 1am I just asked a simple little prayer Lord clear that one guy with a yellow you know sometimes hears our prayers when I found out a long time ago is not only loud hard streaming prayers he's got here but I thought we believe about Elijah they wouldn't a whirlwind and the hunger for my lightning tonight and I thought it was a still small voice out of him that but you see they could not condemn the Lord Jesus in his life but they condemn him about what he called his teaching and him saying that he was God therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go into perfection first get the Perfector inside of us and then let him live outwardly and us just keep praying the word that's what I told you that I would bring you a little bit about the Statue a perfect man but I don't see any need of what I'm doing because i preciate so long to you you can't wind up and say I need knowledge and you study the message you don't get it I need difference no I need patient through a bottle Central Asia working patient to line it up we just take a well with each other come on I won't bring perfection right but that's what they thought right that's what mankind is always thought that they had to be some way that we could be good enough are not be guilty and then God would save us I told you from said anyone do matching age is before I could never say I knew what would bring the virtuous and they still you know I couldn't to try to find out what it was the Lord spoke to them and said it only can come by the revealing about a word that's what I'm trying to do tonight that's why I do ever service and try to bring something this is not a six and seven sermon it may sound like I preached it 40 years ago 20 years ago but you check it out you find out where climate is a little higher each time I had a chat with some of these just going back and listening with a marquee my mother said it covered might get him in trouble but I don't mean wrong with brother Mark II love this message I preached on a sick seal he said he didn't know any time he listened to it so he went down he had that banquet in Word form in the apologize to mr. don't apologize I wish it all in work for but I said don't tell everybody Vatican everybody going to copy you know so it's going college teen yeah you make a copy farm for them to be able to do it we'll see he could do there's a bit around here all these years the key that we just keep climbing a little higher and louder all right it hasn't been this to six and seven tournaments what I mean by six and seven is go to church in the next week you heard the sign honey we need to be perfect but take none of us perfect so I guess we just need to not go perfect they've none of us we take none no none do it no not one I thought we believe the Bible in the Prophet said that God was coming after a bride that was without spot wrinkle or blemish now is keeping the law gonna do that or is it the revealing of God's Word effect cause remember with the new priesthood comes a new atoma you remember the background for this when I was streaking about how did Moses run before God and sit prefetcher I may make it at home yep now what animal did he carry up he did incur in the well read your mama that's right next to this 32 the internal animal he cared the word college cuz he reminded god what he said he reminded god of what he had said his word is the atonement today that's right the atonement was made for all of our sins right but then the Prophet had become to give us the grace of marriage in the board at the words of a man an atonement is made for you and I it's not keeping the law that saves you the atonement but then if we don't live the law as close as we can then we just proved me wrong you see somebody here cutting the harm paint in their face a little makeup complaining LOL alright you cool you see somebody doing that just look at him and go I'm done with your long supporting brother Dale and I still get you in trouble in May in trouble but that's on I don't believe in living you stink on life I believe in the living the best we can but everyday plead the atonement off if they asked him said those Christians have sins he said they're only one only ones who have seen is Christian you said well he did say that about boiling it he said Christians and then they asked him that he sinned and he said everybody so now that must be Christians on the increases but you see is true the preaching of the gospel that the growth development can come into the bride of Jesus Trey wise people fraid of Daniel seventy weeks seals predestination marriage and divorce one God minds are so much confusion about could we we're trying to perfect ourselves if we think keeping along with what we save us then we're no different in Old Testament people but if we think we can live like the devil and get by with it relies is that plain enough didn't you know what brother they'll believe I believe in living right but I believe in being born again and let him crash live on you because none of us can keep the word that was their problem in the Old Testament they couldn't keep the law it was a record keeper of them that's why when we get there when these days we've ever remember the other day when there's expressing that dark two judgments one is the judgments of the deep done in your body where they're good or bad and that's the bride of Jesus Christ the other one is a white throne judgment that the bride does not sit before but she sets own and watch from judgment to judge those standing before but there is a judgment that it needs done in the body whether good or bad when we deciding eternal life it could be ruined Wars to see even like my brother said when I we're about rewards longer I get tired Wilma that's a good point oh that's a good point but why would we want to live anything other then let it crash within us right why would we want to depend on Leo to find other than Christ in you know little glowy why would we more to do anything other than let them crush this come and lil out of us and that's what it says perfection did letting that one come in of us who had already reached that place maybe have come and live in unless to take no start what about make on these honey listening to get
