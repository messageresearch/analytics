to drive in it with you do amen and I I think you you can see God's way you know everything about it is so much cheaper insurance is like 80% cheaper than what he was paying you know and he seeing that and that's God's way of doing things that's just better all the way around not just in our finances but in every area of your life God's way is so much better and that's all our father is trying to do is show us that that his way is better he wants the best for you you know I want the best for my kids the best car that you can get cash the best one you see when you go in the devil's territory

the clock building's almost full praise the Lord so you just look at your neighbor and say God bless you shake their hand thank you for coming today you wouldn't have a hand to shake if you didn't come today God bless you buddy we had a ministers meeting yesterday which was absolutely wonderful um they said it was one of the best ones they ever had so we really appreciate that um and we appreciate the sisters and that came and and worked and fed us ministers and we sure appreciate you thank you so much for what you did remember brother Louise he still in um Portugal and they're they'll be back Tuesday or Wednesday I can't remember which one um brother Aaron is it brother Andre's this morning preaching for him uh brother Bob will be speaking for us this Wednesday and next Saturday the 21st brother Solomon Huffman will be here it will be our last youth meeting for the year starts at 3:00 uh some of you young brothers and sisters call somebody call somebody and invite them invite them to the to the youth meeting brother Solomon is a wonderful brother good solid brother young brother can relate to the young people and we sure appreciate him so I need to know I think sister June and him we're going to continue we're going to do sandwiches like we did yesterday we had good bit of stuff left over and uh how many of you are plant cuz it's it's open for everybody but it's catered to the youth but if you'll raise your hand if you're going to if you just think about it just think about coming Saturday raise your hand half or so yeah yeah so and and you don't know who else but they got to get the stuff ready see shister June if you want to help and uh we usually feed everybody after the service on Saturday and then we have games and prizes and fellowship please all of you come and attend it's open for anybody but like I said it's catered to the the youth and we sure appreciate our youth I was watching them up front and through the window there my they've grown so much and they've they've matured so much and I know that there's a there's a devil that wants to get them but we're not going to let we're going to ply the token Satan can't put his grimy hands through the blood he cannot do that he cannot put his Grimmy hands through the blood of Jesus Christ so we're going to apply the token to him and and watch him grow up and and be young men and and young sisters and if you get married stay here in this church you're not leaving so I know cleave and leave but you know there's interpretations there so I want to um last weekend we were at the men's meeting uh at brother Barry coffees and we had a good time didn't brother boy had a good time wonderful time so but there's something that brother Barry he didn't come to me I went to him they had a display and if Brothers will pull it up this is the website is called Vision books and there it is now voice of God has stopped producing books there's no print and press in Jeffersonville anymore they've sold all that the building's empty they're not printing anything It's All Digital and it's all electronic which is fine and dandy for some but for others less fortunate they need a book they need something to read and we're so fortunate to get it in English I mean you take 1100 sermons and put it in our home and it blesses our soul but you go take them same 1100 sermons in English and put them in somewhere that speaks a different foreign language right useless the word's not useless the translation is useless so what brother Barry has done if you'll scroll it up just a little bit they're publishing the sermons what they're doing is they are coordinating with Cloverdale with the message Hub the message Hub has like huge database of of foreign languages so they come together so the process begins with the translation of sermons by the translators around the globe once translations are complete orders are placed for books to be printed offshore then they're shipped to countries for distribution by the local Ministry so the local missionaries and pastors give it out it's nothing that brother Barry does or anything from his church he's just facilitating and so brother Barry as the executive director or the leader of it he's Incorporated four brothers and those four brothers have come together in United States and Canada to put these books together now here's what I want to tell you is so astounding brother Barry coffee worked in the book industry so he had connections all over the world with printing books they're printing some in China they're printing some in the in the host countries that they're sending them to the Harvest is great but the labors are few so there's the current projects now you see it little green underneath that's how much money they've raised and how much money they need what if you didn't have a seal book what if you didn't have a church AE book those people that are standing in that line does not have one so it's astounding that they have put these books so some of those projects are completed and we're going to send them some money uh to help them but I want to lay this on your heart because it's on mine a small book a a a regular book like Christ The Mystery of God revealed or or anything like that any small book they can God's so good they can make that book for eight cents oh8 eight pennies they can make a book now seal book in a church age book Hebrew series anything thick is 86 cents a piece have you ever bought a book for 86 cents and and have eternal qualities like these books will have eternal qualities to somebody so we're going to start supporting them now I'm going to lay this on your heart you pray about it we used to a long time ago the first Sunday of every month we had a mission offering everything that come in the collection plate went to missions some of the younger ones don't remember that but us older ones we remember first Sunday of ever month all the brother dick would announce it I can hear him announce it he say this is all going for Mission since we have two services on the first Sunday we're going to all the offering is going to go to Vision books all right now I want to ask you a question and I'm going to be a little comical but I would like for every family sometime during the month now not the week sometime during the month before that first week before that first Sunday find a way to put $20 fold it up and put it in your bill fold or your pocket and like I'd like for every family to put $20 in that time now if you want to give more that's fine if you want to give less that's fine but you're putting 20 message books just by you giving $20 here's the comical part I was thinking about you know you can't even go to Longhorn and get anything for $20 now hardly go to a drive-in or whatever McDonald's but take that $20 and and Sue don't go to The Waffle House oh no okay Donnie don't go to the wff house okay but take that $20 put it in your pocket and and go to Dairy Queen or Wendy's and get that $5 bag lunch I think it's $6 now but but give you a bag lunch stick that $20 in your pocket and then the first Sunday of every month put that $20 in the collection plate and that will go toward and the and obviously the church will uh also contribute but I think it's a it's for the cost you get your money's worth and look how they need they need a million books from Malawi and it was fully funded by somebody 5,7 Church AE books now how would you be without a Col a church AE book think about if you have a church AG not a church age book in your collection to read or to listen to quotes or to say that ain't nothing but the truth because I know because I read a church a book 5,000 Church AIDS books for Burundi it was fulfilled you can see that so if you'll scroll to the very end if you want to do anything extra if God puts it on your heart to do anything extra there's how to give go to the website if you don't have a QR Reader take a picture of that with your phone phone it'll tell you at the bottom what it is either PayPal cash app or zel you push that button and you can donate to Vision books but I think it's a worthy cause or you can mail a check for us residence only you can mail a check to that number right there if you want to just write a check and give it to them straight out but I would I would on the first Sunday of every month I'd like to see everybody put a $20 bail every family not everybody every family so you gather your family together and if you're single then gather yourself together and give $10 but you'll make 10 you'll get 10 message books in somebody's hand overseas listen I love Electronics I love walking up here without 20 books or 30 books it scare you to death I got them right here but not everybody has access to this right here like brother J Hugh said yesterday he said how many brought their Bibles well some people didn't bring their Bibles they brought their tablets he said don't have to plug is in this stays charged all the time and I understand cuz I do the same thing I look up quotes and stuff on on the computers and all I understand that but I like a book and there's nothing else when they cut your power off your tablet's going to last about what hour maybe but them books won't so $20 if if you don't mind or more if you want to give but we're going to do that every month until until we can't do it anymore to help brother Barry um up there in um Hickory North Carolina so that's my uh layout to you I appreciate all of you you're the giest group in the world in the world you're the giest group versus how many people we have come to this church brother Ernie would tell you brother Joe Green will tell you per individual we give more to missions than any church that they know of now that's churches they know of cuz you can't compare us to brother Donnie's with 700 people and they give you know $50,000 for Mission work and we give 50 a whole year but we've got you know little less than a 100 so you're G your good givers God's blessed us all he's G us a nice place to to come to it's getting a little crowded but he's got us a nice place to come to he's give you a nice place to come to he give you some really good cars sitting out in that parking lot hello so anyway buy you a bag lunch from Arby's or Wendy's or Derek Queen has a real good deal cuz you get a frost I mean you get a Sunday with it just saying but just take that $20 Fold It Up put it in your billfold or put it in your pocket book and when you come up to that Sunday put it in the collection plate we sure appreciate all let's stand to our feet God bless you good to see you again brother Grace and his family back there uh they were here Wednesday night they live in Oakwood so just make them feel at home all the these new ones you know how to do that make them all feel at home and uh we love you with the love of the Lord we thank you for your support all of you together uh next weekend on Saturday we need a little bit more I would rather wear out than Rush away I would rather wear out than to rush away yesterday I was clever so I wanted to change the world today I'm wise so I'm changing myself who's our worst problem the devil nope we are Our Own Worst Enemy but yesterday I was clever so I want to change the world I want to change everything oh if we could thank God we're not God today I am wise so I'm Chang you know God even being God he can't change he he don't want to like brother Bob said he he's he he's unchangeable he cannot be Chang and thank God that we can put that on look at the changing World out here changing all the time people shifting over on this way and shifting over on this side but the bride's real steady the bride should be real stable and real steady cuz we know a God that don't change we know a God that's seen this before the foundation of the world he knows what's going to happen he saw you make it well one more time he saw you make it through all that Journey he saw you make it so God loves you so do we we're going to speak today we're going to shift it over a little bit to the son of man at Pentecost transition to Perfection so we're going to stay on this for a while because we have been into the church ages now for half a year going from the first church age and now we're at the book end we're at the book end we there's no other Church age there's no other m and you are now literally living in that church age abely you get the good and you get the bad but we're living y'all all drove you lay to see a car to work I mean and you drove them here today right easy comfortable air heat brakes Windows some of them Drive their s but we use that but you know what we live in it but we're not of it that's right we've got to detach oursel from the world and get in this stay into Christ all right so that's what we're going to be speaking on now because that's there is a transition the first church age wonderful and we were talking about it yesterday brother randam said that the first church age should have took a Rapture they had everything in line they had everything going right they had no false Doctrine yet they should have took a Rapture but the full scripture had to be fulfilled that the corn of wheat had to go in the ground and die and abide alone in the church in the middle Church ages to come back up so that Luther would have a message Wesley would have a message Pentecost would have a message and then you're setting in the last message the eagle anointing message of the end time so we're going to transition now to Perfection because each one took a dip in the Holy Ghost but today I stand before you to tell you today we are at the fullness we are at the Apex we're at the Capstone this is the Capstone message we have arrived we have come to it and it's here for if we'll just yield ourself to it so we're that's what we're going to be speaking on now even through brother BS all his ministry it's a transition to Perfection cuz remember he allowed a lot of things during that Pentecostal first part of his ministry right he said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things and can't teach them ABCs if they don't algebra if they don't know the ABCs but when he come up to those seals and come up to the very end from there to the end of his ministry that was a Perfection that had never been on the earth since Jesus Christ right cuz he was the son of man so now we are the son of man in the end time okay the word made flesh in a group of people let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this day Lord we appreciate the people we appreciate your presence we love the worship father and we thank you Father for giving us good song leaders good musicians and Lord everyone responding Lord with with feror that they they want to they want you to talk to them today Lord so I pray that you'd move me out of the way Lord and you speak to the people father give them Lord Supernatural hearing today that they can hear what the spirit says not what just an mortal man says but what the spirit says to the churches father forgive us of our sins and many mistakes Lord just be with us lead us and guide us bless the ones that are sick sister Johnny Sister Mary all the different ones Lord we call I pray that you'd bless each one father be with the ones that are watching in Lord that you just touch them Lord and and sister Audrey and different ones Lord that that need a touch from you father I pray that you'd be with them today Father just bless us in Jesus name amen so we'll go to Joel 2 and it shall come to pass afterwards what's the afterwards the afterwards is the corn of wheat going in the ground pomor canor and all that eating the bug the bug eating the plant and it shall come to pass afterwards all right the restoration part that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon on the servants and the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit 1 Corinthians 13:8 charity what is Charity that's the love of God that's Agape all right charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part Paul was a prophet he could look through a glass Darkly he said I can see things but I Grievous wolves and he makes all these statements but he never saw the end because he had to be another Prophet a bookend Prophet William brandom in the end time but Paul Knew by the holy ghost that something was moving in that direction all right he just didn't know how long remember he was trying brother R said he tried to get them people to realize the Lord wasn't coming during that time he knew that he was looking and seeing something but when that which is perfect is come all right we're transitioning to Perfection but when that is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away now you're not going to do away with the foundation of this building right if you do we're all in trouble we're going to build on it but you're not going to go back down there and say now that's the foundation we know there's a foundation under this building so then build from there so we know there's a foundation in the Bible with the prophet's message let's build on it all right when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child it's not a problem being a child it's a problem staying a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things in other words my thought process changed for now we see through a glass Darkly is that was saying but then face to face listen you and I brother John today are face to face with this message we're face to face with God and we're going to have to give an account if we do away with this message like many people have done but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now B the faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is agape love or that headstone charity which is the son of man in the end time in human flesh called a bride you may be seing the Lord that his Blessing to the reading of the word but he had to start somewhere so in starting somewhere kind of I kind of froze there for a minute I looked the clock it was 11:42 I had this little little twitch but it's gone now so praise the Lord I got a big bottle of water and I'm good I'm ready to go I hope y'all ate a good breakfast most important meal of the day especially on Sunday Acts 2 verse1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place so God started his church that way all right he's going to fill them with the Holy Ghost and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven there a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared under them clo and tongues like as of fire and it set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost how about 120 people at one whack like about this building plus a few more receed the holy ghost at one time powerful but God had to do that to get the church started so that they could what go out to the 3,000 downstairs and those 3,000 could go out and you're sitting here today as a recipient of that experience on the day of Pentecost in the upper room you're sitting here today you're a benefactor of them receiving the Holy Ghost cuz without them receiving it you're not going to receive it amen all right so you receive the Holy Ghost just like they did may not have been with an emotion but you're going to have an experience the prophet of God said you're going to experience something and then you're going to move forward from that experience whether it even be justification or even sanctification but when the Holy Ghost comes that's the burner that burns all that out we were talking about that we may cover it again they were all filled with the Holy Ghost who began to speak with other tongues as a Spirit gave them others now for the some of the new ones we we have a a chart here this is the church agent we've kind of filled in a few things I say we dad did that me and him did this um years ago when he taught on the porter that's the red letters in there so what happened is when the first before the first church Aid started there was a day of Pentecost I just read it all right I'm not saying anything do you say Amen amen amen amen so there was a day of Pentecost there was no Messenger to that age though Peter was the spokesman he stood up and said men and Brethren you've killed Jesus and you've done this the determinant counsel and all these things and he said they said men and brother what must me do he said repent and be baptized in name you know yesterday brother Jason was you know expounded on that a little bit but you know what that still Thrills my heart that that I can read acts 238 and know what it says that I can read Matthew 28:19 and know that's what Peter said that ought to excit you that you know that cuz listen folks there's 8 billion people in the world today probably a billion of them are somewhat Christians they all baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost all of them except me and you and maybe a little spackling of other people but we understand and know that what Peter was talking about is the same thing what Jesus was talking about we know that and and to us it becomes common but it shouldn't become common when somebody reads reads a scripture that that we can tie ourself to you ought to say Amen if you don't see your name in every verse Christ in every verse I say see you in every verse you need to read it again but we had a Pentecostal age which came in like I said a I'm not zud street but ad30 Jesus died came back on day Pentecost so they had a little time in there and then what did Paul Paul comes on the scene he gets the Holy Ghost and he starts his message he's a prophet he's not a reformer he's a prophet all right because God wanted his church started right so he did it with a prophet that's why God wants to end his church right he sends us a prophet all right not a reformer so then you come through here and you see all these Church ages and they're not exactly in the little round um holes we got there they lap over they connect to each other God don't just abruptly stop one age and start a new one they they actually overlap or just like these steps this one steps on that one well that one is connected to this one but it's not that step it's a different step but they're connected so those ages are connected all the way through but but to have an alpha bride and an Omega bride that's the two bookends that are to be the same all right everybody with me then if it started with the Pentecostal age it's got to end with the Pentecostal age right before the last Church age so the Holy Ghost came himself we'll read it later on where brother R tells us that on isusa Street 1906 when the Holy Ghost fell that was the Holy Ghost himself coming to restore the church to restore the gifts all right amen so now let's continue on so the upper room Jes Jesus told him said I indeed baptize you with water or this was John speaking but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire we were talking about that yesterday you can receive the Holy Ghost on your spirit realm and be lost and go to hell that's so you can't say I got the Holy Ghost Judas had an anointing of the Holy Ghost and he was the son of predition he never got it in his soul like the 120 in the upper room I've been this message so I got the Holy Ghost no they ain't going to get you nowhere you got to be born again yes sir and you got to be born from above you got to take this nature that you've got and have God burn it out and nobody can burn it out but the Holy Ghost with fire now when he comes in with the fire and burns it out and then he resides inside of you guess what that makes you a born again believer that takes that Genesis 1 12627 man and puts that part that God saw you were can't change his mind remember that's right that piece a part of him that he saw came right inside of you yes sir and made you a son and daughter of God Amen bire you into the body of Christ now you're not a creature of the earth you're a creature of Heaven I hope y'all en I hope y'all understand that amen if you're not born again you need to get born again okay you need to be born from above now watch what brother B said look the future home he said I'm trying to get to you now watch he's going to do the Earth see it isn't going to just going to be another Earth that's why we don't believe there's some in the message do believe that this body is just going to rot away and we're going to get a brand new one now that's not what he's going to do to the Earth he's not going to do that to the Earth brother ROM prove that now the world thinks that the world thinks this place is going to be annihilated and we're going to sit on clouds me and brother Richard are going to be playing hearts together I don't think he can play one neither can I and I don't want to be sitting on the cloud for eternity I'd like to have my feet on some kind on something that is eternal so it will be the Earth your body will be redeemed the one the mom and daddy gave you will change in the atoms and you'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye there's an empty tomb over in Jerusalem there'll be an empty tomb right here your body's going to come out of that ground God thought so much of you he put you together amen he's going to keep you together sure it'll be young sure it'll be changed sure it'll be new but you become a new creation when you got born again but the Earth here he said it's going to be burnt off same Earth same elements just burnt yes sir and God's going to do the same thing with us at the baptism of the Holy Ghost he burns us off on the inside but there's going to be a day when this body is going to be changed there'll be a fire come hasten the day Lord that this body will feel that fire yes sir inside of our bones and those bones will change in the moment in the twinking of an eye well it's not a it's not a hope no sir it's a promise and if God said it he can't change his mind somebody just said that so in the future home that's why I love the future home give me that book because it tells the complete Plan of Redemption all right it isn't going to just going to have another Earth you're not going to have another body it's going to be the same Earth now what are you your Earth your body literally came out of this Earth yes sir your mom and daddy ate potatoes and beans and and if you're if you're a vegetarian that's all if not then we'll pray for you but meat that the cow died but what did the cow grow up with eating grass or eating corn that what came out of the earth so everything came why we call it Mother Earth what we get every all of our nutrients so Mom and Daddy had all the nutrients they got married they got together and then in that process there you are you're made of the same 16 elements as your mom and daddy is that's right all right but now remember when you get born again though you get transformed into what into his kingdom are Sons and Daughters of God by the new birth inside that's why it's a secret amen it's a secret but you're going to express that secret you will Express what's inside of you I don't care what it is it's coming out folks was talking to I think I was talking to brother Bob yesterday you know if we are in the third everybody's going hollering third pole Ministry we're in the third pole we're in the very end do you know what the third pull is it's preaching to the totally lost someone sitting in your congregation I'm not saying this one I'm just saying ministers think about it somebody sitting in your congregation they can never be saved that's who we're preaching to now you better get in yes sir you better get in that Ark because if you don't get in the ark you're going to drown listen it's time to check up it's time to check everything up all the way from one thing to the next cuz God is going to do what he said he was going to do he saw a group of people come to Perfection that's right oh I don't see it in them we look at it in you first you want everybody else to conform to your image the only image I want to conform to is God's image that's all all right and where brother R stood we were talking about yesterday brother R stood and said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella brandham he knew there was another William brandham that had developed inside of him so much and you know he said that you know what he said it right before he died just a month before he died on leadership or communion he said I'm I I found out I wasn't a he didn't deny his mom and daddy but he had been transformed so much till he had a Heavenly family and the Earthly family just shed away thank God for our Earthly parents they're the ones that got you here all right but they ain't the ones going to get you there right because you born in sin was all born dead until we get the new birth all right now look I'm trying to get the Plan of Redemption to you if I don't get nothing else all right he's talking about us at a future home giving us Dimensions telling us where we're going telling them where it's going to be telling me it's streets of gold it's Paradise it's got rivers of water it's got all these great things he said I'm if you don't get anything get Plan of Redemption cuz the earth goes through the same thing you go through water baptism under Noah sanctification under Jesus shedding his blood and it dropping literally dropping on the earth and then the holy ghost coming in the end time with the fire to burn all that out yes sir praise God if I don't get nothing else the baptism of fire on it only is to cleanse it and make it a fit place for his Meek to live in oh like he did us his creation yes sir to live in yes sir God's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel now like what brother said last weekend he said you know he said your soul is sealed in by the Holy Ghost right you either got it or don't they ain't a middle ground in the soul that's right like white one of the two you either got the devil in you today working or you got God in you working but that next Rim we we spoke of this many many times but I like the way he put it he said that's your maintenance department all right you get your power from the inside but you got to maintain that with your what memory reason conscious effects and Imagination that's your maintenance department you maintain you maintain your spirit realm cuz you control that or you let the devil control it or we let God control it that's right amen well praise God anyway it's your maintenance department you I know some of you worked in maintenance if Aaron was here he works in different things brother Boyd listen they're the one of the most important people in the building if something breaks down it starts costing you money we called the maintenance department that's right and we didn't have to call them from 30 miles away we usually had one in house that's right let's get one let's get one house well we ain't got to go look for it he's right there and he said oh no don't put that there oh don't look at that praise the Lord he had to give us the baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost come in and live baptism of fire in other words he's got to burn all that out before he'll come in that's right then when you get that baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost can come in what as it does it burns up everything contrary to the word out of you amen have we had that burning have we had that burning you know burning is burning is bad different in places but burning is really good when you burn off a piece of property right you burn all the underbrush and all the new starts coming up but remember it's a control burn an out of control burn is is not God God's never out of control I just got that thank you the Lord thank the Lord like California they got them wildfires and every that's what they're called some of you wildfires some of us wildfires but when the fire of God comes in he don't make you wild amen he makes you fervent for the word of God he makes you fervent for the people of God he makes you fervent to make sure you see that your brother and sister has everything they need amen from you yeah from you we're all sheep all right it won't believe nothing else but the word because it's the word we can't supersede the word if we do we're in iniquity that's right brother brandham first seal mystery of iniquity but the Bible says in the end time that iniquity will abound well I know that says that but I'm not going to do it that's iniquity that's right now that's what we were talking the other day the evidence of the Holy Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost all right you ready it's when you can receive the word not some system amen but have a what clear understanding right know who you are and what you're doing here amen Satan don't want us to know that but God does and he he will have a people when brother Bob was speaking this morning I thought well Lord if I stepped into your mind which just for a few minutes he knows everything we're going to do right ups and down ins and outs but to him that's nothing end of the road all right but remember I was thinking also this though we're a child of God though we're a son and daughter of God remember what brother R said this is how we can sin and not get by with it this is how we can sin and ask for forgiveness and God give he can't see us you want me to read you the quote brother Brown said he only hears your voice he said because one second in front of a holy God in our condition he'd have to do away with us so that's why we have that Advocate we have Jesus Christ in between that can go to the father not two people but that power is transferred to him and he takes it to the father and says they didn't they didn't mean to do that you hear them they're repenting repentance is good good for the soul am not some system but have a clear understanding how do you know the word is clear understand it watch it vindicate itself yes sir amen that's all you got to do watch it vindicate itself all right and listen I'm going to tell you something that's why we've been here 60 years after the prophet left he's shaking the bushes ones are going to make it yeah the ones that are hanging around because remember what happened when they went to cadis barnea remember what happened when they went to the promised land only two people got the Revelation now the younger ones come up during the but they had to go through that Wilderness Journey they had to watch their mother and father die come on without cuz Hey listen what is our promised land it's the Holy Ghost we know that right and that's what we should be looking for but they were literally looking God said I'm going to give you this piece of property right here God said the Creator said I'm going to give you this piece of property go to it it's yours you may have to fight for it but it's yours it's your property and 2 million left and only two of the original made it AC cross brother BR said one in a million but the young ones that come up 20 and younger they watch their mom and dad die but they something in their heart said sister Regina I know there's a Promised Land I know there's a God I know Jehovah told my mom and daddy cuz they told me we weren't there we were weren't born yet but mom and daddy told me or or Moses told me or Joshua preached to me one Sunday is anybody listening to what I'm saying or somebody said something about my inheritance that's right and now Joshua and KB I know them back there said I don't I we can't do it but we're going to be like Caleb were more than able yes sir he started at 40 he was 80 years old so a doesn't matter he said I'm more than able he said I'm stronger now than I was back then why because he could see the Promise can we see the Promise we're living that close to the promised land folks that close I see this do it well you say I see this do it and oh yes weeds live the same way but it's got to be the entire word to be the bride you have to be part of him he is the word and what a part of him is it the word that's promised for this day yes sir he's calling a bride in this day he's not calling a Luther bride in this day he's not calling a Wesley or a Pentecost he's calling a mature bride in the end time to take this thing and get out of here with it like Brother Richard Wilson says just as sure as I'm standing here that's going to happen Ministry of Jesus 1953 you know what I done I buil me a little fire and said the old boy he's talking about something he done to a turtle I think it was or something he moved then what we need today is not Church joining and arguing about baptism just the Holy Ghost in fire that'll make any church move get the Holy Spirit back in the church and the apostles and teachers and so forth into their places and let the Holy Ghost go to reigning on a church like that and see what takes place signs and wonders and miracles will follow sure it will what a promise but I want to tell you back up just a minute when we started in Luther and Wesley remember they fall under the man anointing right everybody with me the liox man and Eagle brother Timothy Dodd was speaking on this last weekend and I mean he brought a boatload but this one thing he he made me realize which I wouldn't have brought to you that's why I like to go places and hear other preachers I'm not saying you don't not to do that I'm saying you be careful but you listen there's some good stuff out there we ain't the only boat in so in the ocean but brother Timothy Dawn he said you know brother brandham now remember brother random had two Ministries all right we're going to cover that is everybody with me there's two Ministries brother R had a Ministry to restore the back to the faith of the fathers and then bring his message now his message was not in the man age brother K his message was not in his first part of his ministry from 63 back was not the eagle age that was just restoring what's already been known he was just bringing us back he was renewing our mind to what had already been on the first day of Pentecost nothing new but when he come to the seals that was new that was something man had never looked at he said Remember the white thing was took off of the pyramid he said light shined on things that had never been shine on before that's the eagle anointing that's the prophetic anointing sure he was a prophet when he was born sure he was a prophet in 1947 amen he was a prophet to the age we don't we don't discount 47 to 63 but that was restoration I'll read it to you next time I preach brother bam said not in the days of preparation that's right but when he begins to bring his message which his message were the seals forward don't get quiet on me so the first part was a man anointing so brother Brandon preached under the man anointing you can see it now I can see it more clear now than I ever have before he's trying to get those Pentecostals to come to a place he was trying to pull them up some did some didn't we were talking yesterday brother Jason Watkins said that now there's like 13,000 and something different denominations now brother brandham in 1950 something he said there was 969 that goes to show you how powerful the denomination is brother Ram didn't destroy not one denomination when he was here he brought people out of them come out of her my people and we did too but he didn't just lay them denominations waste he told them they were the Antichrist he told them they were the mark of the beast and they went right on growing 13,000 different interpretations of that Bible right there and several thousand in the message but he was under the mount anointing so let's just keep that in the back of your head plant that little seed brother random was at the restoration he was restoring things back so that could bring his message to the people that had never been preached before because the only person that preached the seals prior to brother random in its truth was Jesus in Matthew 24 hello oh yeah Lin and all them they that ly wasn't a prophet he was still a trinitarian we see this picture over here's got to be all put back together like it was over there or it's not an alpha bride and Omega bride so let's remember that brother randam under the m anointing that's what he was doing he was trying to get the people but when he come to 1963 well prior to 1963 he had thousands in his audience hundreds of thousands of people when no seals broke and then he kept going and preaching these different things they just kept falling away falling away the greatest anointing he ever had he said was during the seals he said hundreds of my friends will go away and he even told them on questions and answers on the seals he said you're not getting it that's right it's not for you he's telling that group of people they were under the man come on somebody they were under the man anointing he didn't say they weren't born again he just said they're not getting the message of the hour he said it's gone from you but what there's a group of people that's going to catch it there's a group of people that the crystal is going to be just exactly right and whenever they hits that Crystal they'll say that ain't nothing but the truth we can't stand a man ofor we can't stay that's my whole point we've got to come the transition to Perfection has got to be in the bride Jesus never ever said I was wrong but he was God but that son of man Ministry is going to be back in a group of people I like what brother brother Jason said he said now listen we say this she is him and we put this thing real close he said but now remember you'll never never be God you'll never be the husband we have headship we're going to be so close amen she is him we have his potentials we have his characteristic but we ain't Big G Big G rules we Little G's but big G rules sir all right that's why you have to have headship we always know he is the head he's the head of the what of the body the church which is supposed to be like him right now look questions and answers on the seals this is on the seals you see each of these ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is a work of the holy spirit all right sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet now listen let me insert brother R's name right there he was a prophetic Prophet see Mo was not param was not bartleman all them down they were not they were the founders and the spokes people just like Peter was but we had to have a Prophet come on the scene to bring us to Perfection God's pattern never changes somebody said that this morning God don't change I don't know who it was he's immutable man he's good that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down why no Messenger to the age of of Pentecost cuz it was the restoration of the gifts they were still trinitarians they still were baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost they hadn't come to the fullness yet some had come out some had become then though Jesus name Jesus only trinitarians brother R said remember he takes the leaf off each tree and puts them together he stood in that Gap he stood in the gap between the Pentecostals and this age he stood in the Gap no Messenger to the age though cuz the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism but at the end of the age in other words the end of Pentecost there had to come a prophet or there had to come A A preacher and he had to be a prophet I'll read that in just a minute as it always ends upon the others we find there then the messenger sent all these Scruples and things are to be placed in their places now that's restoring all right like that then the Rapture comes for the the church now brother Ram was talking about the Holy Ghost coming and restoring the gifts to the church those gifts were always in the Bible brother rand's message even the seals and even the great messages he preached all in the Bible right he didn't write a new Bible he didn't have a word of the Bible he just give Clarity to what was already there he gave Clarity where man had clouded it up he broke back the the the the curtain of time and he said look this is what it is it's the love letter cuz if you just read the Bible it can condemn you to Hell you'll never get anything I'll never get perfected I can't do this no you can't but if you let the one that wrote the book do it cuz when he wrote the book he had you on his mind he had your characteristic yours individually had your characteristic on his mind when he wrote that come on he said they're going to need this one day in 2024 maybe tomorrow maybe the next day there's a situation you cannot get a up oh down can't get around it you go read a scripture and say thank you God there's my Deliverance well that was eternal the word don't change he puts this listen this is a very small book yes but it's Eternal and it's got everything you need to change your body and put you in the future home and this is eternal just think about that I mean Webster's Dictionary is bigger than that it is now but this is eternal find yourself in this book folks if you don't find yourself in this book you don't have the new birth cuz the one that wrote it is the one that's inside of you actually looking through your eyes if you got the Holy Ghost remember amen it's inside you and what you see I mean physically see he sees hello think about that remember what old remember brother Sher what he said he said now devil listen listen so it was funny but it's it's true old brother shider he's old Gruff big individual used to go to church here and he passed away but he went to Brother Richard Wilson but uh brother Grace he said he said devil if you going to play in my mind he said I'm going open this Bible and said me and you going to read amen cuz the devil can't stand this he said me and you going to look through these eyes and we going to read what God said about me do that sometime you say oh the devil ain't that close you're deceived First Corinthians 12:3 devil don't bother me oh boy well let me let me take a vacation and y'all handle him for a little while wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaketh by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a curse and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost you can speak it but there's no meaning behind it all right this has got meaning behind it when you have the Holy Ghost and you say Lord Jesus he listens the god that created everything listens God don't have no ears yeah well God's got ears better than we do that no man can call can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost now there are diversities of gifts by The Same Spirit and there are differences of administrations by the same Lord that's we're putting the church together I I like what um we were talking about yesterday morning you know the Apostle Paul being a prophet when you read his writings he set the church up told you how to worship told you how to study told you how to take communion even though he went to the communion table told you how to take communion told us how to conduct our life told us what preachers are supposed to do deacons are supposed to do what this was supposed to do Paul told us all that in just a few writings everything we need is right there so we can't discount Paul I I wasn't saying Paul Paul didn't see the seals but everything we got in the seals opens up the Bible of what he wrote The Love Letter CU if you don't get the Love Letter like I said before you'll be condemned but that in between that love letter that God wrote To Us by the Holy Ghost you and I are the writers of this Bible oh don't get quiet who wrote the Bible the Holy Ghost AR we talking about you getting the Holy Ghost okie dokie there's not two of them sir okay listen that's why we can understand this book the person that wrote it is in there telling us what he wrote if not you're going to be confused but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to prophit with all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom now I broke these down last uh Wednesday but I um we're here today so it's the skill in the management of Affairs skill and discretion in imparting Christian truth that's wisdom we have the gift of wisdom in the church Supreme intelligence such as belongs to God that's not man's Wisdom then that's the wisdom of Almighty to another the word of knowledge look he was very specific by The Same Spirit all right Paul said by The Same Spirit you're going to do these things knowledge signifies in general intelligence or understanding the general knowledge of Christian religion the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion listen there's a lot of people know God no of him that's right right they use his name in vain all the time but a deeper more perfect understanding if you get that wisdom of knowledge wisdom then you get knowledge it's a knowledge that this world listen don't the world call us crazy we're the cult we're a cult we follow a man we do this the sisters can't do this you can't do that we ain't can't there's nobody in this building can't you can wear whatever you want to right you can smoke whatever you want to you can drink whatever you want to but I'm telling you the want to ain't there no more if the want to ain't there no more it's not you think about that the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion such as belongs to the more advanced especially of things lawful and unlawful for Christians moral wisdom such as seen in right living you know brother Bron we were um when Brother Anderson became a deacon I was reading through what brother R said and you know he comes up to a place and and somebody handed him a note and uh a couple days before and it was a brother's name it was two brothers it was brother's name and another brother's name and he said now this brother's good he said this brother there's nothing wrong with him at all but he's not married a deacon must be married that that's the qualifications brother R tells you a deacon has more qualifications than a pastor does don't get quiet it's in the Bible all right so a deacon has got to be the husband of one wife all right and have his household right so brother Ram said now this brother there's nothing wrong with him at all except he's not married so he's disqualified they didn't call the brother's name he said now this next brother y'all brought to me he said he said good brother also wonderful brother Young Brother married but he hadn't been in the faith for about 6 months he said he don't have enough wisdom and knowledge yet he didn't say that exactly but that's what he was meaning he hadn't been in the faith long enough to make decisions or help make decisions or help lead a church all right is everybody with me so that's what the qualifications of this that wisdom and knowledge will bring you to a place to where you can have an office yes all right so to another Faith there's some of you in building that has wonderful faith and some that don't and I'm one that don't I just believe I mean I don't have to have anything worked up I just believe what God Said but we got to have faith yes by The Same Spirit that's the conviction of truth of anything my faith is in that God's right my faith is in that that Bible is right and he sent us a right Prophet to tell us what's going on that's my I put my faith in that to another the gift of healing by The Same Spirit or healing means to make whole or to cure or to heal the gift of healing is here today if you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can be the most fit person in the building but you're the worst person there ever was if you're not born again so there's healing in what there's healing in receiving the Holy Ghost there's also healing and praying for the sick right to another the working of Miracles Miracles is strength and power and ability if you'll um remember what I told you that word miracle is a same word as dunamus which Jesus said go to Jerusalem you'll be endued with power from on high dunamus is where they get to word Dynamite from so that's the same way with the Miracles man it be wonderful to have a miracle right but sometimes God heals Divine Healing is is time listen God divinely heals us every day that hospital up there's full of people that may not be a 100 Christians but when but when the doctor does a surgery and sews them up they can't do no more God has to put themselves back together God has to do those things and he sends a healing Angel y'all may think I'm crazy he sends a healing Angel up there and heals them because they're human beings and they have faith in the doctors and they have faith that the nurse will do the right thing and but sometimes it messes up but you know what not with God right with God there's Miracles and I've seen Miracles I know most of you have seen them too it was a miracle I'm standing right here today I knew somebody said that so to another prophecy now this is not listen this is not being a Prophet this is prophecy all right somebody could stand up and prophesy but it's got to be judged by two to three witnesses to make sure it's right okay but listen there's a difference in that and a prophet you don't judge Jud a prophet nobody judges a prophet but God God's the only person that judges a prophet you can't judge that's why these people that are trying to judge brother random they going to have a hard time with the day of judgment to another prophecy a discourse emanating from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of God whether by reproving and admonishing the wicked or comforting The Afflicted or revealing things hidden I had a minister that was here long time brother Jimmy Harris took me aside told me something secret that he was that was come from divine inspiration I believe he came to pass we Marvel sometimes when it comes to pass but if God says it somebody said today he was perfect and couldn't change listen I've heard people say this is a God thing this is a God thing this is God handling everything to another Discerning of spirits or judging so somebody's got to judge if that spirit's right or wrong right to another different kinds of tongues the origin of the expression is apparently apparent to be found in the fact that in Hebrew the tongue is spoken of a leading instrument by which the Praises of God are proclaimed in other words speaking right and that according to the more rigorous conception of inspiration nothing human in an inspired man was thought to be active except the tongue put in motion by the Holy Ghost all right to another the interpretation of Tong now see that's the two lowest gifts that's number eight and number nine and that's the ones we say well we don't have the gifts working in our church cuz we hadn't piing that's the Lesser gift I would that we'd have that but I'd rather have somebody with wisdom I just read you the scripture all that can cease yes remember I just read you that all these things will cease but not charity or love or agape love agape love is not sloppy love I didn't say sloppy I said agapy right bio love is sloppy love I'm sorry but it ain't of God it wasn't supposed to be hello filo love was not supposed to be a part of this that was brought into being when Adam and Eve did what they did and God approved of that he had to approved of that and said okay you live like that you take a husband you get a wife you're supposed to be the head of this one we've changed the Covenant remember the Covenant was like not that man and woman was equal before the fall try that in the message church every once in a while but you are you're not going to get over in heaven and just and be a lesser vessel right sorry to another the interpretation of tongues to interpret to translate what has been spoken or written in a foreign language into the vernacular now the vernacular is is what you can understand it's in your language all right but all these work it one and the selfs Same Spirit divided to every man severally as he will for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether it be jew Gentile Bond or free and who all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many amen the Bible tells us not to seeds as of many but to one seed which is Christ but that one seed is in a multiplied form called a bride amen all right tell me y all to try sleeping at night what it takes to overcome unbelief I thought we was going to be able to have a wonderful time then these other nine different spiritual gifts oh I'm sorry this is 1960 what it takes to overcome these different gifts should be operating in the church to keep the church clean like the Anan and safire and so forth the spirit of God rise up and call somebody out tell them they're living wrong and rebuke that sin openly it don't sound very good does it but that's what we're supposed to do rebuke that sin openly and that's what the holy spirit is in the church to keep the church clean and ready for the coming of the Lord so it keeps the church clean perfected and clean ready for the coming of the Lord now let's look at just for a moment because we're transitioning now Pentecost was true and real remember listen to me Pentecost was true and real because it was in the Bible and the Prophet told us that it was the true Holy Ghost falling on a group of people so Pentecost wasn't false they had some falsities they have Perfection they had a perfect Holy Ghost but remember I read you here in just a second where brother Brown said the Holy Ghost can only work with what you give him that's right remember he's timid so now look then Along Came the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they cabbaged down on that in other words they sto stop God moved on now there cannot be no more ages it's the Le Phil he said Philadelphia but he meant he said the Ley and age we find in the study of the scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age every time so so so what did Paul come at the end of he didn't come at the end of Ephesus he came at the end of that Pentecostal age I was telling you about ad30 remember he said I should have been there I was one born out of due season brother R said the same thing over on this side Paul come at the End of the Age we find out irenius come at the End of the Age Martin the End of the Age Luther the end of the Catholic age so he's identifying exactly what was the Catholic age huh it was Columba right that's when the Catholic Church Rose there wasn't a Catholic age but it was during that age the the Catholic Church grew and what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age Wesley couldn't come at the end of his own age he couldn't bring message backwards no he had to come at the end of the previous age bring his message God he went down to the ground into the he died his message denominated and what to do God brought another one up but he came as the Holy Ghost himself to bring us to a place to where brother brandham could step out on that he brought the gifts back in now brother Bram first part of his ministry was what gifts gifts were operating all the time in his ministry even in his church so at the end of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the End of the Age of sanctification now what was what was the age of sanctification Wesley all right through the B then what at the end of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the End of the Age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Pentecostal age what we've been talking about isus street at the end of the restoration of the gifts coming up to about 1915 to 1920 brother R started preaching 30s all right everybody with me he got his Commission in 47 but folks he was on the river in 1933 baptizing those people when the angel came and told him his message would forerun the coming of the Lord right so there was that lap over so now watch at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are to receive a messenger that will take all these Loose Ends out there and reveal the whole secret of of God for the rapturing of the church now remember that was the man anointing that was partial remember lion a lion's very very powerful right powerful man powerful U animal but he starts out drinking milk the ox is very powerful big animal what the start out doing drinking milk man every one of us sitting in this building started out drinking milk amen but now the eagle there's no milk glands Mama eagle has no milk glands Mama eagle takes the food kills it chews it up and puts it down the throat of that baby until that baby can go catch his own food that's the eagle anointing that's what brother brandham was doing he was giving us Eagle food there from 1963 on now to me Lord It's Eagle food from 47 to to the to the end time right amen but there was a people during that time listen there was no message church when he died there was no message said we're we're going to be a connected to brother brandham no they scattered like the wind another group brother Mo different ones brother Mike Canada different ones they picked that up and started having churches this one got started in 71 but brother Mo was there with him in the 50s and the 60s right that transition that lap over brought it now to this day and the old ones like brother Mo brother Dale different ones they're passing on because they God keeps moving God keeps moving right on through God somebody told s me this told me this morning God's perfect he don't make a mistake all right so we got to go from partial to perfect so brother brandham started listen to me real quick he started in the partiality of the Pentecostal movement cuz they didn't have they had Loose Ends they baptized wrong they believed in a trinity believed in eternal hell they believed that the gifts gave you the Holy Ghost now that's wrong right God can't now God can write a wrong but he can't work with a wrong one more time God can write our wrongs but he can't work with your wrong I'll read you here in a minute brother Bri said the Holy Ghost is timid it only works with what you give it yes and if you give it garbage come on if you give it garbage it's just going to sit there I pray to God that we all give God something to work with give that Holy Ghost something to work with amen read your Bible pray pray for people because we have come got to come to Perfection and we are in that time right now yes sir there was no other anointing we do not work under the milk now Paul said milk's okay like I said all of us sitting here I don't care how old you were you had some kind of milk when you were growing up baby form for Mama and all that all the way through even if it's that old nasty stuff that they give you yeah and crushed up English peas but we had to start that way yeah that was horrible stuff it didn't even look good but we ate it why cuz we couldn't eat meat at the time but when we what when we spake as a child ate as a child we were a child but now I don't eat my English peas mashed up I like English peas but don't mash them up it brings back memories cuz listen folks I'm telling you when I was growing up I tell when I was growing up you didn't have all this baby food at Gerber everywhere now you had a f few things here and there but Mom would Mama Eagle would crush it up and feed it to us we didn't even have a food processor brother John L John don't roll your eyes don't roll your eyes son we come through this your daddy just ain't told you everything yet it's good to see you man you're looking good look good looking kid I on a kid anymore you're an adult so watching the third seal but ain't that true I mean that's what we done we came through that mashing of the of the food and and feeding it to us to where now I don't like that no more I don't need that I want some I want some steak and yeah tell them brother brother boy and bators you know what bat is that's a big old baked potato some of y'all shook your head other look kind of weird so baked potato I like that mashed up a little bit but we moved through that we had to go through that so my point is Pentecost had to go through that baby stage they had to right cuz they were babies brother R said babbling babies so because he had to take the children and take them and transer them transform them to the fathers some did some didn't you and I did we weren't back there in that age but we come from baby form to adults third seal 1963 now look what we find out as we've been studying that down Through the Ages we've had reformers now down Through the Ages we've had reformers not Prophets everybody with me now what does a reformer do alcoholics anonymous is a reforming okay they say you always are drunk if you're drunk you're always going to be one it's always going to be there so don't go to a bar don't don't don't don't don't let you know don't start drinking again that's reforming that's suppressing everything the Holy Ghost does not do that you become a new creation if I was an alcoholic and God saved my soul and give me the new birth you could put me in a bar with 9 million people and 9 million I wouldn't want to be there anyway but you could put me there and there'd be no temptation that's because the person that made me do it is gone they're dead so they were reformers not profets reformers and each look now each office carries its own work now watch he's going to explain this just like a man that's a telephone operator he isn't exactly an electrician he might do a little job at it y'all don't know what telephone operators were they used to have to okay watch an old movie just like a man that's a telephone operator he isn't exactly an electrician he might do a little job at it and like if a man is a lineman well a man that's a post hoold digger and never did any Line work he better keep off the line remember brother Brandon was a lineman but he might do a little patch-up work we don't want patch up we're going we're transitioning now from partial to perfect we're transitioning to Perfection but you got to start somewhere but when the real thing is to be revealed at the last day of the last part of the church you and I are the last part of the church is when God has said that he would send to us according to the scripture and we've searched it through and through that he predicted that the spirit of Elijah would return in some person yes now he was specific do you know they believe the spirit of Elijah is here I've heard him preaching he preached on internet but not message believer they just throwing it out and said it's just the spirit of Elijah on a group of people no Spirit of Elijah was on brother Ram amen and then we're little eaglets underneath that but he's the prophet messenger we're not right but when the real thing is to be revealed at the last day of the last part of the church is when God has said he would send to us according to the scripture remember behold I send you Elijah the prophet and we've searched it through and through that he predicted that the spirit of Elijah would return in some person now I think that's been made just as clear and we're looking for that to happen somewhere in anointed person in the last day to rise up you'll hear a lot of Fanatics and everything else it's the devil trying to take away from the real one when it gets here but it will be properly identified and we believe that okay I know we do but the world don't and watch that and you'll know and then when now the elect will know the Lord not the others hallu they sure won't do it it they'll miss it a million miles for seal 1963 will be done here just about 30 45 more minutes I ought to woke you up just a second now watch this is this is this is this is the part I wanted to get to now brother Bown 1963 is on the fourth seal he's recapping the first three seals all right if you you're watching brother ra he'll spend 20 minutes recapping the seal before and then bring his message all right not under the revelation of the lion age now see so so there's a revelation they didn't get hello pay attention not under the revelation of the lon age or the first age the early age this wasn't revealed now what is this he's preaching the seals come on Paul died before the seals even come to to John the Revelator so now look the next age was the age of the ox which is the Dark Age the middle age it wasn't revealed as what it was we were talking yesterday there is no church AE messenger ever knew he was a church AE messenger except maybe Paul and brother brandham I don't think Luther ever knew well I'm just a messenger I'm the church age messenger number five and Wesley didn't either they just what they got the spirit of God they preached the word of God and they let the chips fall where they may but we know and we can understand by their characteristics that it had to be those people all right it wasn't revealed as what it was nor the manlike Beast of wisdom representing the reformers Luther and Wesley now watch you said and so forth Luther Wesley and so forth Pentecost and so it wasn't revealed but in the eagle age the last age the prophetic age where there is to rise a prophetic utterance to whom the secrets always comes amamos 2 and9 what I'll do nothing till I reveal those secrets to my servant the prophet so Malachi 4 it says turn the heart of the children to the fathers lest I come andile the Earth with a curse and we know brother random he C he tried to take the Pentecostal babies to maturity that's the children to the fathers what faith of the fathers back to Paul back to Peter and back to the original Church Hebrews 6:1 Paul's telling us said therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ don't leave them like do away with them had a brother not too long ago he said oh we don't have to take communion and we don't have to do this he said Paul says just leave those principles I I said brother that's not the way I read it communion is important to me all the water baptism that's all important to me that never went away I don't have to get baptized every Sunday though but I know where I came from and I know it's important so it's laying there as my foundation so we don't leave the principles listen Paul would be he he'd be a false prophet if he meant what you're reading right there to just leave them and don't ever do them no more Jesus said do this till I come therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on let us transition from partial to perfect let us transition from from I once a child I spake as a child I ate as a child I did childish things but when I become a man I put away childish things L look not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and this we will do if God permit in other words we're going to go on to Perfection but we're not going to ever forget the doctrine of baptism how in the world can you forget your baptism if you've never been baptized then God bless you you better it's important it ain't mandatory but it's important I mean come on these people been saved and have been baptized all right but it is important if you're sitting here sucking air today and you haven't been baptized you need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ all right but we're not getting away from that but I got it right here in my head I was baptized down in Gillsville can the creek name of the Lord Jesus Christ January 1989 I remember that you don't remember the day you got baptized you better remember the day you got baptized some of you ought to know it cuz we just recently did it right but we're not leaving those and not ever preaching them ever again that's what that brother no we don't we need to go on and do these brother you got to have this right here this is your foundation listen this is your promise to get to the remember the baby food if you didn't eat that baby food you didn't you're not going to be sitting here today you're going to be gone passed away so we ate baby food when we needed baby food and like I just said I can't forget it I can't forget them mashed up peie but I ain't going to eat them again I'm going on and this will we do if God permit listen brother R said look he said you using wrong end of the string now this is this is an angel talking to brother brandham all right he said you're using the wrong end of the string he's got he's in a vision he's fishing he's trying to catch trout right and I looked down on the floor and there laid truly there laid the string all went out a nice ate them an inch and taped down real nice he said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things you'll cause carnal impersonations remember after brother Ram came on the scene they had people that had oil coming out of their hands and and blood coming off their forehead well they were doing it all theirself that wasn't the truth and you know what happened their life proved it right he said no that's true I perceive your Prophet 1953 there's quite a difference between a gift of Prophecy and a prophet what I was talking about a minute ago a gift of Prophecy is in the church but a prophet is born a prophet all right that's the difference so this man might prophesy tonight and never prophesy again all right it might be on that woman over there the next night this man back here the next night and that one over there but when the gift of Prophecy is operating it cannot be received unless two or three judge it and see whether it's right or not but a prophet singular Prophet p r o p h e t is born a prophet comes up a prophet everything he says is in the name of the Lord and it does not have to be judged only by God is absolutely truth if he's prophesying now a gift has to First be recognized to be in the Bible and then if it's in the Bible the man claims it then if God confirms that gift we know brother right God confirmed his gift over and over thousands and hundreds of thousands of time then he ought to believe but now remember that was under the man anointing that was the worm on the hook the hook was full Perfection the worm was to get them to come to get them to come to that but what did they do they eat the worm spit the hook out we've had that had we brother Danny several times but that's what they did they didn't get the hook they got the bait and they continued just give me the worm I don't just give me the worm don't give me that hook just give me the worm then if that gift is testified by God then God's giving the man the gift if God says so you have no right watch this you have no right to doubt it you we have no right to doubt that brother brandham was a prophet if he's Vindicated which we know he is well now a gift of Prophecy gift of discernment gift of wisdom gift of knowledge all these things are Divine gifts that sets in the church and oh God grant today that we'll all come together and see that those nine spiritual gifts move in the church operating the whole church body then we'll have a Rapture look watch this then it will be called out then we'll have a Rapture so there's a cing out coming if we can't have faith for Divine Healing how are we going to have faith for Rapture in faith the church has got a ways to go yet but I believe God will do it I believe God will do it we ain't going to we ain't going to be able to do it God will do it just a few more quotes we'll be done we read these Wednesday night I'm going to read them again the holy spirit's very timid just a little just a little least little thing Grieves it away that's why we have to have order in church that's why we have to have you know kids not running around and playing and eating and drinking and all that stuff little kids we know we they do that that's fine but now if you're 8 nine 10 years old sing back there eating a sandwich you're in trouble if you was mine you'd be in real trouble well don't get quiet we've had these things set in the church for us this is not new this is something brother randam read Church order rech order and Doctrine very plain that's why we don't run he said he said you a kid running a church he said would affect the next meeting it would grieve the Holy Spirit from this building so much the next meeting would be hindered wow so let's do the best we can we do a good job in church order you get to Rushing look now watch you get to rushing the holy spirit's very timid and I don't want you to rush I want you to be reverent like you have plenty of time that's right be alert the holy spirit this is all in the prayer line brother R was telling teaching the people don't get up and walk around don't move he even he said don't move he said because you're a spirit and when I'm catching that Spirit In other words he didn't say this but it is what it is he watching every spirit and when the spirit's moving and the Holy Ghost is moving there could be confusion or I'm going to try to find that quote I found it one time and I can't find it again I'll try to find it where brother R said he said something happened on the platform he said the Holy Ghost left the platform and left me standing there it wasn't something he did it was something somebody else did and left me standing there and he said I'm no good listen to have the Holy Ghost that was a special gift he had to one generation we can have it to a degree but not in the scale he had it that was one gift for one generation that gift that he had a Divine Healing you and I have Divine Healing sure but not where we can run a prayer line and and and call every person in the prayer line and tell them where they was at yesterday and what color the doctor's glasses were and we that's not let's work on the nine spiritual gifts first all right that that was what was given in the church to keep them clean very timid it just won't tolerate nothing wrong identify Christ of all ages the holy spirit is timid very timid and where you have just one unbeliever or a skeptic sitting around the Holy Spirit cannot work hardly remember Jesus do you remember in the scripture where Jesus they laughed at him they disbelieved him and even him being God Almighty and human flesh he had to take that person out of the city that's right get him away from everybody so that he could heal him think about me and you remember Jesus had to had a man let a man Plum out of the city to heal him one time just to get him away from unbelief Queen of Sheba there's too much confusion the holy spirit is timid everything must be decently and in order for the Holy Spirit now this is one that we'll stop right here we need something to work on before the the Holy Ghost can ever go to work all right is everybody with me he's got to have something to work with pray up read up don't bring them demons in we got enough here already leave them at the door prayer folks prayer repentance I do that every time I walk through that door now not when I'm up here working or doing something but in the mornings come to church or in the evening I said God forgive me of my sins I said I am so sorry anything I don't want to hinder and you you've heard of me before some of you young ones don't young people that that are coming now when you when Dad was preaching and and when he prayed for somebody I didn't pray for that person don't look over at your neighbor tell you why cuz that's between the preacher that was anointed and that person right that person works the gift everybody with me but if you're sitting over there with unconfessed sin come on somebody you sit over there with unconfessed sin you can hinder that person from getting healed so I rais my hands and even in the back there when they're praying for him if I in the back I lay I say God don't let me do anything let no spirit inside of me hinder that person getting their healing now see to me that gives that channel time to work between these two people cuz that's where it's got to come from it's not a group thing when you come up here as an individual it's an individual you're you're looking for something and you got to work the gift you're working it now or hindering it one of the two so he's got to have something to work with so try try that sometime just pray for the person that's okay I'm not saying I don't but I'm just saying God don't let me be the one that hinders them getting healed don't let anything I've done said Spirit what just Lord just clear my mind and let them get their healing right that way it ain't somebody stand up here say I laid hands on them and prayed for them and they got healed that's garbage ain't no stinking individual ever healed nobody that's right Jesus Christ is the Healer he's the perfect one we just operate the gift we can't heal nobody you know that oh this Pharisee age that we're living in that was in 1957 wow I'll tell you I never let a seventh grade dummy tell me I come from so so and I got a college education but you haven't got gumption enough to know how to control it maybe he was telling those Pentecostals you got the gifts but you're doing them wrong you're hindering the work remember brother R said one time he said that sister hindered the prayer line cuz she stood up just stood up and started prophesying every service said she'd get ready and get her hair all fixed up and you know pull her hose up and all that stuff cuz she was getting ready to stand up and make a spectacle brother Brown told her to sit down and shut up remember that hm you know how to control it that might mean a lot whole lot different brother I tell you Paul had one too but he said he forgot everything he's talking about a degree but he got forgot everything he ever knew in order to find Christ the trouble of it the church needs today we need to dump out a whole lot of stuff so we can be filled up again dght Moody said God will only fill those who are not full of their self and what a profound St statement he said how can I teach them algebra when they don't even know their ABCs and other words under the man anointing he's trying to he's trying to pull them he's pulling them trying to get them out of that age some of them come some of them don't how can I tell you spiritual things about heaven tell you them spiritual things about Heavenly things let the Pentecostal Church let Lula Church straighten itself up get right with God and I'll prove to you that the Holy Ghost will come right in while this the church will be so full of the power of the Holy Ghost that can't be one member do one sin do you believe that the Holy Ghost will call it right out like Anan in safire but you can't do it when you won't even take your kindergarten training certainly not magicians come on 1 Corinthians 13 we go back to that again we'll cover this next time we'll start with the transition to Perfection we we really got you a background now but we'll get to it charity never faileth but whether that be prophecies they'll fail tongues they'll cease knowledge it'll vanish for we know in part we prophesy in part let's stand our feet but when that which is perfect is come now look Paul is prophesying when that he didn't know what to call it okay he didn't know what to call it he said it's a that but when that which is perfect which was the eagle anointing the message of the hour under brother brandom the eagle anointing that's the that he's talking about boy I mean and we're in that that we're in that but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part now look that won't do us any good today you got to start knowing part but we're going from partial to perfect you said I can't do it you just stopped yourself right there you just confess with your mouth that you can't do it so God only what he goes by your confession he's the high priest of your confession well I've got all this and that and the other well so do everybody else this person set beside of you got as many problems as you do work on your own don't try to work on theirs now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity we'll start right there with Revelations 3:14 folks we are in the beginning of the creation of God this is the way God want it to wanted it to be in the first church but they weren't required a Rapture you and I are required a Rapture what was the beginning of the creation of God it wasn't when he said let there be light that's a finished physical creation the beginning of the creation of God is when God made him a body and stepped into it made him a baby I made him a germ and an egg and the spirit of God came in he was a beginning of the creation of God now what is what was his name Lord Jesus Christ but what was his title son of man that identifies right there that we're in the son of man that last age is in the son of man age cuz we are back to the creation the true beginning of the creation of God you are standing today outside of your Humanity the way God wanted you I said outside of your faults and your Humanity he wanted to have somebody walking in human flesh that had his spirit inside of them in its fullness not in training got to take training wheels off sometime learn how to ride all right let's

saying this is that was just so I figured maybe it was $2 a book $5 for the big book you know that that for to produce them he said no he said we can make millions of them for8 cents a piece and I'm talking about your regular message books and and 86 cents for for the seal book The Church age book less than a dollar and it's just a miracle and then they distribute them no charge for that so I I think we need to get on board with that one and and help the bride that we'll never see but I'm going to tell you something somebody told us today that God knew every thought he knew everything that was going on right abely you take your $20 and you put it in there next month I'll promise you when you get over there brother John when you get over there somebody's going the everything's going to be made known right somebody's going to walk over you and say hey buddy God revealed to me that $20 you give am it brought me to the message oh oh God can't do he specializes in that yes all things
