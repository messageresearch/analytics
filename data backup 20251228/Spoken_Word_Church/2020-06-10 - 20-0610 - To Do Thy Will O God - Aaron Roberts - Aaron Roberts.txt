i'll title this to do thy will o god in hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect for them would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have no more conscience of sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it's not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body has thou prepared me and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin has thou thou hast had no pleasure then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god now this is one of the things that caught my he says to do the will o god above when he said sacrifices and offering and burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou wouldest not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo i come to do thou will o god see i come to do thy will ago he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all amen amen god bless y'all be seated that's all right i may fall apart i don't know what i'm gonna do tonight but you know sometimes the devil jumps on you now the lord lets things happen but you know what we have the victory yeah i tell you what when you get stirred up you know what when the when this when the peace of god and the holy spirit comes and and ministers to you you know what it makes you it makes you appreciate because many times you know the things of the day and the and the the things that we go through in this life can be hard and difficult but let me tell you what when the sweet holy spirit comes and touches you it changes your life and you know what you just can't praise him enough but i want to speak to tonight on to do thy will oh god because and and that's what struck me was when reading this scripture because he said i come in the volume of the book that is written of me to do my thy will o god and then right below that he comes back and then when he's speaking of these sacrifices and offerings and all these things he said lo i come to do thy will o god he said he taketh away the first that he may establish the second amendment and you know you know in the scripture when paul is writing here in the in in hebrews you know and this is very familiar scripture and many times it's been read and been spoken but you know when we go back and we start looking at at this scripture and you know it always amazes me when when you when you go back to that time and you and you look to see what they were doing and many times when you start talking about going into that going before that altar when that worshiper brought that lamb that lamb had to be spotless when when they wanted when they wanted to have communion with god and they wanted to offer this sacrifice they didn't just pick anything they went over that thing with a fine-tooth comb they wanted to make sure that thing was perfect there was no blemishes there was nothing because they wanted to uphold exactly what god told them that it was going to be and when when they brought that thing before before the priest when they brought his his sacrifice and for his for his sin and for his shortcomings and all he brought that lamb up there and you know that lamb was put on that altar and he laid his hands on that on that lamb and he held his hands and he confessed his sins upon that lamb and that lamb was laying there and he confessed his sins as he laid there and then that high priest as he stood there and he held his hands upon that upon that lamb and then the high priest took that knife it was and cut that through that lamb's throat and there it was it was bleeding and the blood was going everywhere and you know he was standing watching this gruesome thing take place but you know he was realizing that that lamb took his place that he ought to have been right there but that lamb took his place and he stood right there and he watched that horrible thing take place and then he stood there and as as that lamb laid there and the high priest burnt that burnt that lamb he burnt that lamb completely all together and we know that you know if you look at this that this scene when when you take a an animal and other ones here have killed animals and when you lay them somewhere and you cut them and you know what takes place when they're when their bowels release and different things you know what it's not a it's not a pretty sight and then when you're having to burn that with fire and you're burning the hair and you're in the intros and everything like that and you know god called that a sweet smelling savor to him but you know what to human thoughts or ideas you know what there was no place that you would want to be but you know what that was taking his place and what what a horrible gruesome thing that was but you know what he walked right up there and he and he went through that whole procedure and through that whole ceremony and you know what he turned around and he walked right out with the same desire that he walked up there with you know because he never could make him free but you know what he just covered his sins and then he turned around and walked away just the same man that he was but you know what thank god there was one that came that that matched the perfect lamb of god that fulfilled all the word and all the scripture that god came himself in human flesh to take that away that when he laid upon the altar of the dying on the cross and he took and he went up there and he took all those stripes upon his back for me that i can have perfect healing and he went upon that and he went up on that cross and he died as the perfect atonement for me one that i may be perfect in myself why not looking back at what i've done but what he's done for me that i can be perfect he became sin who knew no sin that i may become the righteousness of god amen amen god was not pleased in those sacrifices he did not want those burnt offerings but what did he want he wanted that perfect lamb of god that came he came himself because it was what the word had promised it would take place there had to be one that could bridge the chasm between man and god amen amen and he said that he would come and he'd done he said he came to fulfill the word hello i come in the volume of the book that is written of me to do thy will oh god oh glory you know what if i said this last time and i still believe it today if if the if the story of because when when jesus stood there and and matthew and he said go into all the world and preach the gospel well you know what if the power of the gospel doesn't move you if it doesn't thrill you if it doesn't excite you then there's something wrong if we ever get to the place where the word becomes common to us then you know what we need to get back into the altar if if the word doesn't mean anything to us and it's not it's not because you know what every day i wake up you know where i am today and the things that i go through in my life where i am is because of calvary you know there's many people that you see today you know what they're bound and and all and also all the different things that that you can think of and people look at and you go out there and you see people and all of the things that they're so sad and they're so bound by so many things and you know what there but for the grace of god go i but god gave rich in mercy to me has delivered me from those things and you know what it's to it's for us to declare to the world that there is a way made that there has been that is free i didn't have there was nothing that i in myself that was good there's nothing that i could do to receive it but it was by the grace of god amen it's not of works lest any man should boast but it was by the grace of god and you know what it is for us to declare to the whole world that there is the grace of god we're not we're not super humans we're not we're not some great person we're not we're not we're not some special class of people why we're just we're just just like everybody else you know any time anytime we get to the place where we think we can stick our nose up in the air you know then we've got a problem because we've not received the richestness and we've not received the fullness of calvary because if you ever receive a revelation to realize who you are where you came from then you know then you know what you become humble because the more god reveals to you the more humble you become we never want to forget calvary we want to never forget where we came from and what god has done for us that he he became sin he became us that we can become him glory amen you know this i want to read this this quote here this is from the angel of the lord and brother branham says he said no there's many people in the ba in the bible that teach that teaches the bible as a historical book he said which it is and it but it's more than a history he said it's a prophetic book also that foretells it tells what was it tells what will be he said do you accept that to be the truth and now the same jesus that was is and will be see he's the same jesus all the way through the scriptures the same christ all the way through in the beginning he was in the middle of the book he's here lo i come in the volume of the book to do thy will o god o lord and in the end he's alpha omega the beginning then he which was which is and shall come the root and offspring of david the morning star the rose of sharon the lily of the valley while he's he that's that's just him isn't it he's emmanuel he's the root and offspring of david see he says now his ministry carries on now many peop teaching the bible as a history here which is fine he says but he said talking about seminaries he said but you can't find that in school he said you don't know that by genealogy he said you know that by neology on your knees before god it doesn't take education it takes a surrendered heart god works on the heart so many people want to know what god who god is and they want to know more about god and you know there's many people in the world that don't know who god is and they don't want to know about god and that's okay they get to make their own choice but you know there's many people out in the world and and they think they know who god is but they don't know anything about him and so you know they they're trying to find who god is but you know that's who you and i are are the ones to show the world who jesus christ is that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever because you know people aren't looking people people are not looking for another book you know there's many people in the world and that's and that's their whole claim in life and that's their whole goal in life is to write a million seller they want to write words they want to get up and they want to be a speaker they want to get and to lecture people and all kinds of stuff well you know what if one person can get up and and speak in psychology then somebody else can get up and speak in psychology and get right behind them and refute exactly what they have to say but there's one thing that you can't refute there's one thing that you can't that you can't uh dispute and overcome and that's the holy ghost and you know you know we don't we don't need people that are educated we've got a lot of people that's read in this message and they've read the books and they've read the bible and they've read a lot of things but the one thing that like brother branham said he said well i may not know the bible real well but he said i know the author real well well there's a lot of people that's read a lot of things but you know what they don't know the author real well they've not they've not had a born-again experience of knowing who the author was and if they did then you know what everything would change because you know we don't need more people reading books and writing books and writing all these kind of things why because we've had many many people have stood in the message and and they've had all their kinds of uh camps and their groups and their and their theology but you know what that ain't got anybody anywhere it takes the holy ghost and it takes an individual affair between each one of us having our own revelation of who jesus is that he can speak to each one of us and many people you know they're trying to find the next person who's going to be the great person to do this and that let me tell you who the great person is as i said last time the greatest of all is jesus christ and that's who we need to look to if we got our eyes on somebody else you know what we're looking in the wrong direction so i want i want to introduce you to the greatest and that's jesus christ i want everybody to know he's the greatest whatever you're looking for he's the one he's your answer whatever the question is the answer is jesus no when when jesus come upon the earth jesus came to do one thing he came to fulfill the scripture and you know there's a the scripture says it that jesus said he said the son can do nothing in himself except what he sees the father do he said that do with the son likewise so we know that when jesus came into the earth he came to do one thing he came to fulfill he said i come in the volume of the book that was written of me and that's that's one thing i want to look at tonight he came in the volume of the book he came in the volume he came in the book you know what when he came in the world he came to fulfill what was written of him so when so when when adam and eve came in the garden and and god spoke and said and said that he would put enmity between the serpent seed and the woman's seat so when he was speaking from there all the way through in the scripture he began to speak of this one coming right and when we see all the way through the scripture even when moses came and moses spoke people looked at moses and and they saw moses but they didn't see jesus christ they didn't see the fullness but you know that was god speaking to the people here they are here they are building a tabernacle and they're looking behind the holies of holies watching where the high priest went into there and didn't realize that god was on the outside as a pill or a fire as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night brother branham said grace gave them a prophet so the prophet was god to them and they didn't realize it right they they had more they had more their eyes upon the sacrifices and and the burnt offerings and the incense and all these other things and missed the miss god just when he came and he spoke to moses upon the mountain and he gave them the ten commandments and they didn't realize that was god trying to communicate with them and you know they just took it as a book of rules and mis and miss that it was god giving grace to them speaking to them and they thought well you know this is well you just whatever god says that's what we're going to do you know what we can't do it if you think you're going to be able to just like they they felt miserably they tried to they thought they could live the life they they thought well we're just going we're just going to burn incense and these and these lambs and all these other things we're going to have these holy convocations and all these other things and you know what they miss god why because they just became rituals people come to church and it just becomes rituals it's come in we're going to stand we're going to sing we're going to pay tithes we're going gonna sit down we're gonna hear somebody speak then we go home and we miss that god speaking to them god's spiel god wants to speak to you god wants to communicate with you he wants to commune with you many times people you know it's it's just you know i i have people that i work with and you and you try to talk to them and the whole problem is they want to do all the talking you know how do you help somebody when they do all the talking if they got a problem if you talk it's like will you be quiet and i'll talk to you a minute sometimes sometimes they talk all you you deal with people and you try to they want to talk to you and it's like well maybe if i could just communicate with you telepathically i'll just send it to you in your mind and then you'll know it well they don't work that way and many times people say well they want to have they want to have a prayer time well they think they're just gonna sit down and talk to god i'm gonna do all the talking no you need to be quiet so god can talk to you you know there's times that that i wake up and as brother dale said many times you know you wake up in the middle of the night early in the morning you know brother brother brown said that was a good time to pray early in the morning you know you and the lord wakes me up sometimes early in the morning and i'm like well i don't know why i'm awake i was like well lord you want to talk to me maybe maybe try and talk to me why because sometimes you get so busy during the day maybe the lord wants to wake you up early tomorrow so he can talk to you sometimes i woke up i got a little brother gave me a little ipod years ago and i have it beside the bed i listened to brother brown well you know there's been times i've woke up in the middle of the night i started listening to brother brandon all of a sudden brother branham says something i got to stop it and rewind it and play it again because i mean all of a sudden it just strikes you something that brother brian says it's like well maybe the lord woke me up because he wanted me to hear that he wants he wants to speak to you and you know maybe maybe it's you know we think you know we're going to hear this audible voice or something maybe it's something god wants us to to look at right he brings a memory of you know a thought to our mind or something we've heard or you know maybe he wants us to look at something you know sometimes you wake up you don't know what to do sometimes you pull out your bible you start reading and all of a sudden something speaks to you well maybe god wants us to do that maybe god's trying to speak to you because you know if you want to get closer to god you read your bible and you pray and you and you commune with god and you allow him time to speak to you you set aside that time that what maybe maybe he'll speak to you right amen you know because i don't know about you but it it it's i would hate to think that i woke up early in the morning and just laid there and not got anything out of that and missing all that sleep amen but i tell you what if i miss some sleep and the lord talks to me that's okay i can handle that i'd miss some sleep to have the lord speak to me you know sometimes you get blessed in the morning and it's like well lord if you give me another blessing like yes just wake me up a little bit earlier exactly i'll take another one of these but you know what because you can make up sleep later on but you know what you can't you nothing compares to having the lord speak to you i want him to speak to me so he said he come to do the will of the lord the will of of god god spoke to him god gave him and he said he and he said and his ministry can take carries on his ke his ministry continues on the ministry of jesus christ continues on today where does that ministry continue at today you know many times people want to know what what the will of god is and you know he said i come to do the will of the father and i didn't have a thought of my own but i listen you know i heard from god and he gave me what he showed me what i needed to do he said you know that that ministry continues on today well you know if he if he was the same back then that he's the same today then if he spoke to if he spoke back then that he speaks today and what is it that he wants us to do because he said he said the same scripture that spoke of the bridegroom speaks of the bride and you know if if he spoke back then and he gave jesus and jesus is our example amen jesus is the one that we're supposed to be following that jesus is the one that is our our example that we should follow and and see that you know why the way he done things is the way we ought to do things and if and if he and if he was that way then we ought to be the exact same way then you know then we should stand up and be able to say that you know it's not it's not me that do these things you know i i don't have a thought of my home but but i do as the father tells me the father leads me and i can do these things and many people say you know what what is the will of god it's the word of god and people you know what is the will for my life what is it that god wants me to do because you know and and you know as jesus came he came to do the will of the father you know what does god want me to do where brother braham says you know he said sometimes we got to get desperate man you know god you know because we don't get desperate enough sometimes we need to get desperate before god to find out what god wants us to do you know brother brandon was speaking in and uh he was speaking in this uh is this the sign of the end in 1962 and your brother brandon was speaking of of trying to understand what god was wanting him to do at this juncture in his ministry and you know and he told sister media he said you know he said i've got to the place now where he said i'm just go out in the desert he said am i going to take any food or water he said but i'm going to stay there till i get an answer from god he said you've got to get desperate with god he said that's the problem we don't get desperate with god we need to get desperate before god he said if you if you you've got to get to the place where you want to know what the will of god is he said and how can you do the will of god if you don't know what the will of god is but you've got to get desperate before god and many people have never got to that place to know what god wants them to do but we can get desperate before god to know what the will of god is what god wants us to do in our lives that we can be just like him because i i want to i want to share with you one thing because when when jesus came and he said i come in the volume of the book that is written of me to do the will of god well you know the same scripture that speaks of you and i spoke of him as the bride where this same thing speaks of him so you know what the the same scripture that speaks of us then you know what there is a volume that's written of you read the same book that's written of him is written of you so when you stand before god you know we can say lo it is written of me although i come in the volume of the book that is written of me to do that i will so here is the will of god that he wants you to do is the word of god if you want to know what god has for your life then you get right in here many people many people have spent all their time you know they're trying to look in other kind of books and and all kinds of other things and trying to find what what the meaning of life is and and you know all these great philosophers have wrote wrote a lot of books and everything and at the end of their life you know you can go back and you look at confucius and all the different philosophers and all the ones that have great monuments built to them and great uh areas of theology wrote to them and everything like that and you know what people don't have any idea i mean all of them said well they're still trying to even in their later parts of their life they were still trying to figure out what the meaning of life was they're still trying to figure out what the great meanings of the universe is and everything but you know there was one that came and he was born over a manure pile in a manger and he came and he said i am the way the truth and the life and he and he and there he stood said here is the son of man that came from heaven that came down from heaven he said search the scriptures and he identified himself as as the one as emmanuel god with us here he come he came down from heaven to fulfill these scriptures and he said he said search the scriptures and see if i'm not fulfilled and filled the word he said because in them you think you have eternal life but he said they are they that testify of me so the word that was written of him is exactly what he fulfilled and so as he was fulfilling the word then thereby you and i have the exact same testimony we should have the same testimony because you know many times people say well you know i'm i'm not at a certain per i'm not at a certain level i'm not a certain person i don't have a certain gift i don't have a certain ministry you know what god called you to a certain place you need to find the place that god called you many people are worried about you know trying to compare themselves to everybody else but do you look in the scripture and search the scripture where you can say lo i come in the volume of the book that whosoever will let him come and deny himself and pick up his cross and follow me he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and it says and this is unto you and and your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the lord our god shall call so if this was written then then then when i walk out there and i say you know what i believe that and you know what then i then i repent of my sins and you know what i'm walking in the volume of the book that was written of me amen then that's the that's the volume of the book that's written of me one because that's what it says whosoever will let him come well then you know what he said put your name in there well if that's if that was you then you know what when i walk up there and i got in the water one day then you know what that was the one that was the word that was written of me that's what was written to me that's what god wrote to me i don't know about anybody else but that's what he wrote to me when he when he said to go into when you repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ he said you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost well then you know what if you if you've truly repented then you know what god's obligated to give you the holy ghost why because if you he that believeth so you must continue in the word amen he that continue in the word is my disciple indeed amen he said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free right so the thing is is so we went through the the oracles of god and we follow the ordinances but you know he said if you continue in them so what you're saying in the volume of the book that was written of you so then then we're right here in the scripture so when we're reading this scripture we're not talking about peter and paul and james and john and moses and all the rest of them why because when we start reading this book like we're supposed to because you know what god will give you these holy ghost glasses that he'll change your eyesight where you can see supernatural things and when you start reading in the scripture you know what we're not reading about paul and james and john and all the rest of them why because you start to see jesus christ and you start to see jesus christ in you why because the word that was written of jesus christ is written of me well because you know the scripture says we've been made more than conquerors through him that loved us glory amen then if i'm i'm more than a conqueror than all the other things if if i'm an heir of the father and i'm joined with jesus christ all the things that were written in the scripture of jesus right is written of me then i know what god has given me he has given me exactly what i have need of brother branham speaking this is this is to take on the whole armor of god brother brown says and so now god knowing at the last days there will come intellectual giants there will come everything intellectual all kinds of the enemy with reasoning powers to try to prove to the church that the days of miracles is passing and all this god packed in the baptism of the holy ghost with what speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies gifts and all kinds of things they may seem hard in training but brother on the battlefront every one of them's got to be used god equips his soldiers exactly what it takes to use amen right they say oh just learn psychology that won't work no sir he said they say that's no good he said that yeah that's as thin as the broth made out of a shadow of a chicken that starved to death so that's no good we have to have the power of the holy ghost coming upon a man with all nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him all you say i just don't like to get out i don't like to pray all night well then you're going to get killed out there on the battlefront he said you stay there till god equips you with the baptism of of the spirit then everything that you that you've got need of in this world in the world to come lives right in you the all-wise god know how to equip his army he equipped it with the baptism of the holy ghost that's exactly what he sent for these last days he knew that we'd have to have it he knew that the people would reason would go to reasoning this word when it come in print out here what would happen and today we find the people saying well where is that god of history where is that god that crossed the red sea where is that god that healed the sick see they tried to go back and he said what good does it do to give your canary bird vitamins and take him give him have good strong wings and keep them in a cage that's what they try to do with the people feed them all kinds of vitamins of this and that and the other and the first thing you know tell them all the days of miracles has passed you've pinned them up in some little thing down here it's a lie christ is the same yesterday today and forever god knowed it would take the baptism of the holy ghost to prove his latter day signs that's right many people you know because nowadays that's that's the that's the exact where the land that we're living in you know you talk about the children of israel going into that land and you know when the when the spies went in and they saw the land and they knew what it looked like because it was exactly what god promised them in the land but you know everybody could see the giants that were standing in the land and you know they said well you know we just look like grasshoppers in their sight you know because they're so big and you know there's many people that come up with that same mentality today because you know they walked in the message and they've talked the message and they've read the message and you know and they've done all these things but you know what they're still standing in the land of these intellectual giants and you know there's and it's still the way that that same way today but you know what it doesn't matter how big it is and how scary it looks or whatever you know the devil is a liar and he's always been a liar he always will be a liar but let me tell you something brother jesus christ is the truth and this message is the truth and if you receive a revelation of it it doesn't matter how many wins blow it doesn't matter how many doctrines come or whatever devils come before it you know there's one thing about it he said that he would put serpents and scorpions and all the powers of the enemy under our feet and we would walk over all these things and and none of these things would hurt us well you know what the devil's going to try you on that but let me tell you something the same the same one that spoke and he said he said the president of this world has come and he's got no power in me he's got no hold on me he's the same one that spoke and it's the same word that speaks of you well because if you can get a hold of jesus christ and surrender yourself because he said it's not by education it's not going to be about learning but it's by a surrendered life if you can surrender yourself before god and allow the holy ghost to work you know what he has no hold on you amen you know because the devil you know he he's going to try he knows exactly how to attack you he knows what works in your in your area he knows what what what you have problems with right right he knows what each one of us face you've been he's been battling man for many many years thousands of years he knows all about man he knows everybody's weaknesses right he knows what punch he's got coming towards you he knows everything that you that you know he know he knows you as as brother biscuit said the grab bag of life you know each one of us were born a certain way and we all have uh you know we all have complexes and and we all have different personalities and we all have different things that we have to overcome and deal with and it's just it's just the grab bag of life everybody has something different but you know what god has a way to over to bring you through those things for you to overcome through those things and the devil knows how to work at you he knows how to needle you he knows how to frustrate you he knows how to come at you but you know what god give us the power brother branham said you know when he when he spoke of giving his in his army the holy ghost brother brahm said you know he knew what to equip his army with and he said what did he quit his army with not only the holy ghost he said but he equipped his army with the word he said one because he knew that this army was in the last days would need the word he give this army the word we are anointed and we are equipped with the holy ghost and the word thank you lord and you know what it takes both one because many people want to live want to live and this and they just they just want to you know just live in the spirit and they want to they just want but you know what it takes the word too and so many people you know they just hold to the word and it's just word and there's no spirit there's no life there why because the spirit without the spirit the letter killeth it takes both of them but you know what we have been equipped with the holy ghost and we have been equipped with the word god give us the word that we can overcome and so here we are standing here we have what we have ne we've and he said whatever you this army has been given everything it has need of in this world in the world to come he knows what conflicts that you're going to face before you ever went out on the battlefield before you ever had to go face this conflict and you know what he just didn't give you something and said here you do it right he didn't he didn't just give it to you brother branham said that he took the exact same thing when jesus was standing here he said he wanted to show you that it would work and so when satan come to tempt him he didn't do something miracle or anything like he went right to the word to show that he could put the devil in his place and he said it's the same thing with you and i we have been given the word that we can put the devil in his place that we can back him up well because we can be fortified behind the word that he can't get us right that we can destroy all the powers of the enemy put him where you where he can't get to us but you know the thing is you you have to be the one to do that you have to get fortified behind the words but you know you can realize that that you have been given the word and understand that when he said lo i come and the volume of the book you know it's it's the same thing not that you know that brother dale's going to be the one to to speak the word or do these things or brother wade or somebody else is going to do you know what you're going to be the one to do when all the powers of hell when every with everything the whole foundation of hell shakes when the weakest christian gets on their knees and starts to pray through why that's the reason god don't want you praying that's the reason god don't want you seeking him that's the reason god don't want you in the word why because he wants to keep you bound i'm sorry satan thank you hey don't tame me for what i say but for what i mean there you go i know that's the devil trying to fight against me there but that's what but that's what satan is going to try to hold you back amen amen satan is going to try to stop you from communicating amen you know people people you know they you know the people get they think they get blessed with things and you know people people want people want to go through the life and and they want to do certain things and and they think well you know if i if i can just reach this this one spot or they can if i can just do this one thing you know they were they were searching to reach this apex and you know the thing is is maybe god don't want you to have that maybe god don't want you to go down that road god don't want you going through these things but you know people people they they're so worked up on trying to trying to achieve something you know maybe you need to stop and think and and it's so interesting how some people are the ones that that can tell you how you need to live your life and god has they have your answer for their for your life but they ain't got an answer for their own they blow around like like a leaf in the wind but you know what they got dust seth the lord for everybody else well you know what you know i i look at some people like that and you know i was like that would be the last person i won't talk to that's the last person i don't get any kind of information it's like whatever you tell me i guess i'll do the opposite yeah but you know people people get so robbed but you know if you want to if you want to know what god wants in your life then you know what you need to pray because you know everybody everybody wants to have thus saith the lord and they and and it's so funny people people are trying to achieve something and every time every time you turn around it falls apart and you know we we we struggle with things in our lives and it's like well i want to do this one thing and i struggle at it and i struggle at it and you know what it don't work you know why because maybe god don't want you to do that bro and sometimes it's like you know it's the best thing ever happened is not to do that there's there's people you know they spend all their time you know working and they want they want to uh you know they want to make all this money and everything and hey i'm i'm going to tell a little something uh i was listening to brother matthew bray the other day and he was up preaching he said i don't need another hundred thousand dollars in my bank account he said i need jesus christ and i was like brother matthew you got a hundred thousand dollars in your bank account he said i need another hundred thousand i was like i gotta call brother matthew brother matthew's got a hundred thousand dollars i almost get jealous but i'm sure i'm i'm sure he didn't mean that but but you know there's there's people they get like that you know it's it's the hundred thousand it's the million you know they're looking for something else you know they're looking for the next golden opportunity and you know what they're missing they're missing the whole golden opportunity in their life is because this is where it's at people people struggle for all these different things and you know why why struggle for these things when you know all these things are going to fade away here here's here's people you know it's so funny i was i was listening to this brother's testimony and he was talking about years ago he wanted this sports car he said he said man he said i'll work my fingers to the bone to get this thing me said man he said i saved every time he said i didn't go nowhere he said i've done all these things he said i cut every corner i could he said i squeezed every time i could he said i piled up the money he said i went and bought this sports car he said man i thought i had it made everywhere i went he said i wanted everybody to know i had that sports car bought that thing had that thing in the driveway he said i went out there and he said i polished that thing and cleaned it and everything like that and he said i didn't let nothing touch that thing he said man it was all about that sports car he said man look at that man driving through town having them girls look at him you like my sports car my sports car he said you know what he said i think i'm crazy he said i'm married got three kids he said you'd have to shovel a whole lot of dust off that sports car it's in the garage or barn out behind the house he said it's so dusty he said it don't even run but he said for years all i had in my life was that sports car a sports car and he said you know what what is it now people spend all our time trying to get an education people struggle and strive to get doctor in front of their name there's a lady was reading an article about some time back this lady she struggled all she wanted to be was a medical doctor she spent all of her life studying she didn't have the money she graduated she's a medical doctor she goes a million dollars in student loans here's a lady that spent all her life studying since high school that's all she's ever wanted to do is have md by her name md they said trying to pay off a million dollars of student loans at the current rate they said she will spend the rest of her working career trying to pay off that million dollars because you know what they don't give you that million dollars but they're like man if bernie sanders could get in there they could just wipe all that dead away yes okay well you know that's what bernie said he got up there and he was all all those college campuses bernie's up here so we need to wipe away all this debt and they're like yeah there was a there was a they had this uh article they were they were interviewing all these college students and they think that's a great idea yes well let's get rid of all this debt it's beautiful wonderful excellent and then so they said well here's an idea we come up with a great idea and we want to show y'all share this with you they went around and they found all these college students that agreed with that idea and they said who's paying for your education oh my scholarships or my parents are paying for it i owe nothing sitting here with nothing i'm going to graduate i'm not going to owe a dime but they think that we ought to give away all this education free all these other people turned around and said well we have this we have this opportunity for all of you that don't know anything we think all of you should should pony up uh ten thousand dollars and they're standing there with their friends who owe thirty forty thousand dollars in college debt and so we think you ought to give ten thousand dollars to them and they're like no way it's like well who do you think that that this trillion dollars that's owed who do you think's paying for that all the taxpayers are paying for that and they you know it's so funny people people don't realize that the debt that somebody owes somebody's paying on all that it's not just free and when you go to work you know what you're gonna start paying taxes and you're gonna start carrying that load and your grandkids and everybody else will and everybody thought well that's a great idea and until they find out exactly who owes it well you know it's it's the same thing everybody thinks boy you know they come up with some great idea and you know what the devil's got a good picture the devil's got a good plan he was going to show you this great picture but you know what you don't know exactly what you're going to pay for it what what what will you give the bible says what will a man give in exchange for his soul what prophet if a man he said if he if he gains the whole world and he loses his own soul you know the other day i was thinking about that and i was i was listening to one of brother luis's uh podcast and you know that come to me you know it says what would a man gain if if he if he gained the whole world and he loses his own soul brother branham says your soul's worth ten thousand worlds so you'd only gain one yeah so what would what would happen if you oh if you owed so if you owned a ten thousand dollar rolex and so and so somebody sold it or you know bought it from you for a dollar well you know i wouldn't do that for nothing under the sun or you know if you had if you had a ten thousand dollar gun collection would you would you sell it for a dollar or a ten thousand dollar car or if you had a hundred thousand dollar car or a you know five hundred thousand dollar home would you sell it for just you know 500 bucks or a thousand dollars or whatever well i wouldn't do that but you know what when they start thinking about their soul and eternal life and being eternally separated from god you know what are you going to what do you give in exchange for your soul what are you going to give in exchange for your life and people and people say oh you know i want to i want to do this and i want to do that and you know all these all these great lofty goals and everything like that but you know what if you've not become a son or daughter of jesus christ if you've not become a son or daughter of god if you've not given your soul to god if you've not become born again you know what it doesn't mean anything it doesn't matter you know you can you can do the greatest things in the world but you know what when you stand at the day of judgment it doesn't really count for anything but you know what you know i'm so glad that i that i have made the greatest investment that i can make and that that is investing in jesus christ why because he invested in me he gave all for me now i'm going to give my all to him i want i want to give my all to him i want to be all that he wants me to be i want to give my all to him that i can be exactly what he'd have me to be i don't want to have any of my own ideas i don't want to have any of my own feelings or thoughts or anything i want to be what god has for me i want him i want people to see him and me i want to be because if he said that he come to fulfill the book that to come in the volume of this book to do the will of god then that's what i want to do i want to walk in the volume of the book i want to know it from genesis to revelation i want to go through there and i don't want to just read about somebody else's exploits i want to see myself in there i want to find myself in the word i want to find myself because that's what jesus came to do he stood there and he picked up the book of isaiah and he read and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled well you know what that is what you and i have been given that's our commission in this date is to stand up and say this day this scripture is fulfilled why because you know and we're still fulfilling that scripture but you know what there's a great day coming and god has given us the commission to take a body change and you know what somebody is to take that body change that somebody's been given the commission to do that you have been anointed you have been equipped you have been given the word you have been given the holy ghost to do that one because the last enemy that is to be conquered is death why because many people have we've we've seen how he's taken all these ones down and he's you know he's conquered these one and all these ones are going down but you know what they have fought their battle they have they have fought to run the race fought the battle run their course that has come to us because when they done their portion then they went on then they're in their reward then you know it's been given to us to take the baton and run the race as paul said we see this great cloud of witnesses let us run this race one because that's what god give us he he called us to this and people say well you know i don't know if i can do this or not well let me tell you something brother god called you to do it right god give you this this because your brother brim says in the message thirst he said how many times i meet people that's prone to be a little nervous when they we find out that they're trying to do something and everything is just blocking it off on both sides they say he said it might not be the will of the lord see now don't let the devil lie to you like that he said the first thing is to find out whether it's the will of god or not then if you want to know whether it's the will of god look into the bible there it is that that sets you straight it's the word of god and then if you see it's in the word of god for you to do it like for instance seeking for the baptism of the holy ghost many times i've run into people and say well i've sold for the holy ghost and i just couldn't receive it i don't believe it's for me every time i get down i get sick i go to pray and if i fast i get sick and if i try to stay all night i stay up and get so sleepy i can't get off my feet remember that is the devil amen because god intends for you to have the holy ghost it's for whosoever will all right amen you know many times people people you know they say well i don't know if it's the will of god or not we're going to get in the word and find out if it's for the will of it's the will of god for you or not people you know they're worried about how things are going to go but you know what you get in the scripture and if god give it to one person then he's obligated to give it to you he said if you meet if you if you have the right mental attitude and you meet the same same standards the same obligations that thing but then god's obligated to meet your need to give you exactly what you have need of to meet just like he did somebody else because he's not a respecter of persons brother and this is from power of transformation brother braham says he said in romans a very very familiar chapter he said i have a few verses here and he's speaking he said i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present yourselves a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service he said i thought that was so beautiful for this group this morning he said what have you you done did you know and it's a conjunction i understand he said but be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god that's what we all want to do is be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of god now that we have been saved as we are then that we have been filled with the holy spirit as we have now we want to we want the mind that was in christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the natural things of life and be brought in to be in to do the perfect will of god by transformation of god's spirit by his word and this is from i want to read one more quote this is from the from the masterpiece and brother brown says he says and he's speaking of of of adam in the in the second adam and he says and now for nearly two thousand years god has been again making him a masterpiece he said because he struck adam a piece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect masterpiece that he struck at calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the new testament that's all he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and old is husband and wife and it's taking the new the old to foreshadow the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece in the making amen so if whatever he done is exactly what we done is is our commission and that's what he's equipped you to do so if he died and shed his blood you know brother brother brahm said if i could if i could hold a charger that held the blood of jesus christ he said how precious that blood would be that i would hold that blood and he said how careful i would be with that blood that i would hold it but he said you know what he said i stand in front of the purchased of that blood and he said he said how precious are you that if that if we look at if we look at calvary and we see that blood that was shed and we and we think of the blood of what what he went through for you and i and you know what you are the ones that he done that for that he became sin that he became the lowest of the low that you can become greater than than you can imagine in your in your mind but because he said he said it's not entered into the mind of man into the heart of man what god has in store for them that love him why because you know he has brought us to this place well if the scripture speaks of him and we and we rise up and we think about how wonderful he is and and how holy he is and how and how glorious he is and all the things that all the adjectives that we can put before god and we think about what god is and what the greatness of god and you know there's not even words in the human tongue or any language in the world that can express who god is and his greatness and and all the adjectives that you could describe about god well you know what brothers and sisters you and i are the same one why because we are he said we're born of bone and we're flesh of his flesh and we're spirit of his spirit and we're word of his word well if it speaks of him then how great are you and i why because that's not what we make in ourselves but it's because you are the apple of his eye you are his vision you are his vision of what he wants and you know what he died that he could bring us this this to close this chasm for you and i to become just like him that we could be him made made flesh in this world that you know what he came and he said he said did i go away to prepare a place for you he said i came and i died for you and again i really done exactly all that i could do for you but he said i go away but he said you know what he said just in a few days i'm coming back and he said he said i must go away that he the hum comforter can come and he said he'll lead you and guide you into all truth and you know what you and i are that today walking in flesh to show the world who jesus christ is and you know what he's coming back for a bride that's going to be spotless that's going to be perfect without wrinkle or blemish or anything that's who you and i are well because god brought us to this place you think you know what what am i supposed to do walk in the volume of the book that's written of you one because everything that he wrote in this book is right about you man when you when you read about the all the all the characters in the scripture and realize all these examples were given to you to express you amen man it's beautiful amen god wants you to look in that scripture and find yourself he said find yourself in those bible characters when you when you see when you see esther as as by the way he's been preaching about when you see esther and all the things that she had to go through but you know what god wants you to be just like this you know god has a place for you to come and you enter in man god has work for you to do god wants you to be just like that all the way through the scripture all the different the types and the shadows that are there that speak of you and i yeah you know many times like brother ram said we live so far below our privileges we don't we don't realize what what god how god sees us we spend our time looking at ourselves in the mirror and we look at we look at ourselves and we down on ourselves and you know we get all these type things well you know what if you've got a problem the place to go is to calvary we need to we need to get under the shed blood we need to find ourselves in the word amen why because if if i you know because he said if if there's something wrong then you know what we can be covered by the blood glory a child is chastened of the lord he said if we should if we judge ourselves he said we're chasing to the lord that we won't be condemned with the world that's right you know what you're always going to have problems you're always going to you're always going to have trials you're always going to fail but you know what there's a time to get past all of that that's the reason paul said forgetting all those things in the past you know you can't do nothing riding looking in the rearview mirror you always time looking back and worrying about things in the past you know what because you you've got to get to a place where you get a revelation that you know what it's under it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness god don't remember it you don't need to be remembered why do you you know people let the devil just beat everybody beat you up you know it's like that that lady that i work with you know she gets so worked up over everything it's in the past and you know and she just she worries and frets over everything
