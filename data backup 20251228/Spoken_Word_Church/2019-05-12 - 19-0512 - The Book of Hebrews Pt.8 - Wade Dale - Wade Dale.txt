========================================

[Music] [Music] [Applause] um one out you have one out of your best you get to all right here we go he bridge with in Hebrews let's go to Hebrews chapter 6 verse one we ended up with verse five I mean chapter five leads oh here we are winds chapter 6 and this is the wonderful chapter Paul starts it off now remember as we've been teaching these are letters that Paul is writing to someone all right so he's writing it to the Christians that are there at wherever he's at at the moment writing the letter and it's a complete letter so we go back to five right here and we see this is when we ended up though this is a letter man honey put the man put the chapter this is just a letter scholars put the chapters in when they see that the thought changes but I I wished it would just stay the way it was it's like a letter written straight down all right so this is the leverage straight now because sometimes we probably lose our thought immersed in tact we just start reading in Chapter six we kind of lose what Paul is talking about the go back to the five down at the bottom verse twelve or when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God in other words starting over ABCs going back to kindergarten all right and your Christian experience and I become such as have need of milk and not strong meat looks good but we like strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for his debate right and God doesn't trust his word to babies he trusts them to full-grown people now we all have to start his babies we all begin as babies we all like milk but I love the analogy that I always show people bet you want to go preach somewhere else about the full combat these the lineups man and eagle the lion starts as ferocious as he is and it's much an amazing the lion is the first thing the first manga line does is what drinks milk all right way the hops when the Ox is born the Ox drinks milk and it learns to eat grass and all these other things and then man even man is strong as we are with the teeth we have four canines them to eat meat and all the other thing with we start out with no teeth and drinking milk right don't feed a baby a steak but now when I baby gets about five or six you chunk it up a little bit today but what will happen it will choke that son went that way I see the gospel God has made it so simple that you can look at your everyday life and see your Christian walk all right because you started out as a baby you can't walk somebody has to help you somebody helps you as a young Christian always helped you have the young Christian and you can able all that helps you and the young Christian navigate in your life group and teaching you how to be a better Christian I mean what's your obey I mean if you're born and depending on your your Christian um in Europe your newborn babe in Christ but now we get to the last one which is to Eagle anointing which is line ops man become another Eagle has no milk blames the mother Eagle has zero milk glands there they were not they were not made to be given milk they were made to eat meat but what Mommy Eagle have to do is go kill the thing chew it up regurgitate it and stick it down into the throat of the baby and she knows exactly how much they'll take to not choke them all right that's the same way with the gospel please give us a possible prophets basses teachers and evangelist to come here on the Sun in winds din and every time we match play or whatever you want to say listen to a sermon that is mama eagle chew em to be pieces up and giving them to you as you need them but now then there's got to be a time though that if you're still 30 years old and you're a 30 year old eagle and you're sitting in this going there's a problem that I'm sure I'm sure Darlene would be let's get to have her here today I want to put but we you know sister darlings here and and she's the youngest of the whole bunch so she's very young back with you the oldest child and but you know they may eat today welcome that likes coming before my family's coming to my house and we're gonna eat we're gonna eat turkey and crazy and all these different thing but you know what I'm not gonna get up in the morning and Mama's gonna be still sitting in the house you know at the table going so I need to be me now may have to later only love one of my analogy is is darlings never how old she is young she is she's not going home with sister Hannah every day and Anna wakes up in the morning and she's got her life the little Charlie got her life to live and Darling said at the table in the morning you know you just sometimes you just have to say grow up get your own teeth go get your own go get your own food yeah you get your own teeth because somebody's hurt so you know so that's the way it is in the gospel God doesn't always want you to stay in the eagle's nest he wants you to be Annie gonna be able to fly and do your own thing tell me your own food eat your own meat get your own revelation okay so we can see that to you it's just not it's just not fruitful for you don't have old older children that are still at home but it's just there's just something going on there but strong meat belongeth to them that are a full age are mature even those who by reason of use in other words we had to learn to eat some of us have quit learning how to eat we just eat yeah we don't need for sustenance we go be like but but even by reason of use have their senses exercised in other words what we eat three meals a day or two meals their ever want you to meet eat to sustain you same way in the gospel you know what you need you ought to the Christian know one thing for sure when you're in a dry spell and when you think you know you you're the whole world don't copy just from one thing it's a growing thing it's a growing thing don't don't you know God doesn't want you to cry daddy daddy daddy daddy he wants you to grow up you know figure things out for yourself use the Holy Spirit that's inside of you to live your day in the life and even even also live your life as a Christian to read what's in the Bible do what's in the Bible because that's what totally those did it's the person of Jesus Christ inside of you teaching you what to do but strong meat belong to them there are a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil and that is our discernment to discern both good and evil because we are given that sense to know what's good no one's evil especially being a Christian now if you're if you're not a Christian then your world is convoluted your world is is out here where like I said before smoking drinking gambling cussing and all those things and I still go to church I mean actually that may be a baby big girl up you know gonna come to this church and listen to what's going on in this dirt and be a baby very long you're either going to go out are you going to grow up one of the two so that's why I think you know people sometimes have a problem with with a prophet with brother Brandon you know following a profit but we follow Jesus Christ we follow what he says but it's all in the Bible so what we're doing is we're getting an amplified version we're getting them but we're getting the big picture mama eagle because there's a lot of things in the Bible we didn't understand so God had to send a prophet to tell us what God was saying not reinterpret it but tell us these actually what it's been saying because it's hidden from the eyes of the wise included it hidden from the ones that are that are that are not Christian it's not just I hate to say this but dogs are segregation with he's always been segregation was read brother and brother I'll tell you God is the segregation with these segregates he don't you to mingle he did one Israel to mingle with the world the worst thing of Israel one is starting to marry Moe Bock's and ice and hip tops and websites and all the other side and oh my that's now so you understand what I mean so it's all their nights it's what got Israel in trouble but God said stay with your own group alright stay with your own people same way with in the gospel sure we have to be out in the world but we don't have to be able to world we have to be different I don't normal it's not their normal our normal to them at that room then we're not supposed to think the way the world things go tell the mind of Christ that's what we'll get into later on but we have the line of Christ which crosses the one it's going to turn us back to the word but now Paul has to give us faith over here and he said okay down at the bottom but strongly belong to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil continue reading this is not a chapter right therefore therefore in other words what I just said all of it is a wonderful orator he's in heat well you know that's where - God's perfect so God was talking to Paul this is the Eternal Word and it will change right so Paul says therefore all that I've said therefore leaving the principles now here's where we get in trouble sometimes but that means elementary discussion of now does not mean that we're supposed to get away from water baptism and all the all the major doctrines in the Bible but we're not supposed to be the 30 year old kids setting setting him up in the parents house waiting on the parents feet all right therefore leaving get out of the house go find your job buy your own food amen therefore therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ now what do you do Easter babies here okay but don't stay babies yeah everybody's baby when they start we all start same way long right right but now if we grow up and eat strong meat like he said there in verse whatever that was 13 or 14 down to bottom he's staying now therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection or what maturity God won't mature people perfection completion not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works no what's he saying today if we have been to church today then brother Dale may drop back I may drop back and we may just talk about some things that we usually don't talk about because hey we don't want to show the people we don't want to show them we want we want to say that that we're you know good Christian people then they end up what mama evil it's not gonna choke but we don't talk about water baptism every Church we don't talk about no eternal hell they reserved we don't talk about there not being a Trinity or service but we do interject those things in there for the ones that what listen in every family there's older people middle of aging younger people so when you have a family reunion you don't just get up and you say well I talked to all the adults today well no there's some kids still there there's some things you wouldn't say that you would say if they weren't there or would not say would say if they were there alright so you have to be careful same way with the gospel you're preaching to a group of people upstairs this family members it's all different Asian but what's God want to do though he's wanting to draw us that's why I believe God did sent a prophet he sent a prophet to tell us exactly what the word says and for us to grow up and die and not be babies and not be not being wondering about you know you turn a kid loose in Town Square in New York what a disaster yeah but now you take somebody like John she's 35 years old he's been times where the town I had no reservations with him getting on a plane flying on penguins in Times Square why he's an older with toward all right okay Joanna order go to her Christian will show their self and not cry so much but what why cry Moses speak that's what we're coming we're trying to come into speaking condition I'm not not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God now the doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands more region one today I found about the laying on of hands and it's connected with the number seven we're gonna talk about seven seal today with no problems and over seven but about quote a on the hands and a resurrection of the Dead and of eternal judgment and this we will do will we do it God permit okay we're an impossible it is impossible don't know did you put it see another battery okay we may have to get another that clocks probably go over this jerk here did it right okay before he is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made for takers of the Holy Ghost now not possessors get this right you cannot possess the Holy Ghost in your soul being possessed by ghosts I will take it in every time you cannot possess the Holy Ghost in your soul and fall away okay but you can be you can be enlightened you can sit in a messy church look what's happening tonight that scripture just exact what's happening today people taking the messenger for 20 30 years listening to the message and then go right back down in the world you can't do that and have the baptismal all go okay and were made partakers now you can be making the takers you can be you can be impulsive noted ones you can been truly anointed by the Holy Ghost but it's just on your on your spirit round not your soul and I'm tasted the good word of God you go to church you'll get the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing that crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put into an open chain so that's what's happening now because watch what this this this will tell you if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance now look there's another place where you talk about there's no more sacrifice there's no sacrifice for this there is no there's a sacrifice for ignorance but there is no sacrifice for knowing better and not doing there's no factor class for that you got to go back and you got to repent and you got to be backed out of the name Jesus Christ or and and receive the baptism a wholeness unless you blast me that's the only thing I even might even be an ax murderer or a whoremonger whatever you going to be but if God gets ahold of you and gives you the new birth you're just as clean as a person that there would be anything that's to me that's the saving grace of Jesus Christ but now don't do that and don't find Jesus in jail every once in a while and just you know get go to read in the Bible till you get out of jail you know little man say that's not finding Jesus in jail that's just getting caught all right so you can't crucifying afresh and put him to an open shame because remember true repentance those who these justified he's already got glorified those who he's justified as a journey but now you can be justified and lose it all that's just what the denominational world calls being safe i but we believe in salvation we believe in salvation and the Bible says if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ now shall be safe but we understand too though that the mean that we get of that is that if you continue on us what I told the guy one time he I told him I got saved he said well that's great I got saved a couple of years ago I said Bob no ball no you bought but Bobby this guy was Bob stump was his name he was the bank president and he said yeah I got saved a couple years ago we have a bug light in his hand cursing like a sailor and I just listen Bubba would you get safe from and he just looked at me with that far off there I said to get saved means you were in the water ground me because we were in a boat fishing actually so I had I had captive audience he couldn't go home they were out of milk way so we were fishing some little retreat we had but when I owned James II we got together with all the banking people come they love you because you borrow their money and you can hide in the bank so it's old stuff without them you know we go fishing when I said tell me I said same means if you following the water and you're grounding somebody picks you up put you back in this boat now the way you're telling it is is yeah you might have got picked up put back the boat we keep his job run back no water either and he just kind of looked drains and started a new conversation and you could have had a work with repentance the Bible says you know ask God and he'll know yeah Trumpy sends off but we don't want to ask you that one I ask him to take that person that may motivated me to do it to begin with if you'll take that person out and fill it with the hope of those you won't go and do the same thing again and they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and pleading to note the shame it would be shameful for stump his name with John Stumpf what the father makes me think John's done and he will be shameful for job but John to tell people he got saved and he starts testifying to people and he's standing there with a bug light in his hand you know and talking about all of the things that he does at the bar and you know all that stuff and you're going well that's an open shame what Jesus Christ died for yeah he died to take all that away from us give us some newness of life when we walk in newness of life for the earth was drinketh than the rain that cometh off the pond it and bran for herbs meat for them by human distress he receive a blessing from God all right Nate speaks in the make a point here but that which bad thorns and briers is rejected and 9 - cursing who tended to be burned in other words what's happening people get a blessing from God alright the rain the word the anointing falls on the just and the unjust it falls on the good seat in the back seat remember the Bible in one store that shows a good season and one store that so it's bad thing all right but Jesus says leave them alone the Lord let them grow because you know what if you go out and we plant food plots in them in the fall and we taken week this ground that we do is just like this I mean there nothing growing in it legal out we plant clover only plant arrived we plant wheat and about three weeks later you know you got up but you let that anything there's not a bad seat on the whole place but now about a month from there you see that about 50% of that its thorns thistles Canadian thistle which it's just it came from that it's going back you know what can I get this little Danny Oh it'll LLL beat you mama knows whether they yeah I said it came going back many ways but you can't but I've seen this once you get started you cannot tell so I can't go out there with a hole and start digging up plants that I think look like no you gotta let it mature so God said member they told us to leave alone let on the tour when the harvesters come in to read they don't know what's corn and they'll know what's private all right same thing with the deer the analogy is the deer will pick through and eat all the clover and leave all the other stuff I let them pick it you know but you got away with tours though so he's got to wait to you and I have come to now on time of the end of all things and God is going to see who's more toward who's not okay because you weed you weave looks just like this and you corn looks just like this but now with any growing up than what this is gonna manifest to see this is going to manifest the seed that it's starting with this is going to manifest to see didn't start to clear and it ain't the same seed you know God's the harvester we're not going to call us now see because watch them the analogy with Paul I'm trying to think of which one is where it's there's a Polish water I'm planning to polish watered or something in but God gives me so it's god that's gonna take us out of here now watch them at one a five fold ministry is is where the we're the fertilizer you can take that the wrong way where the fertilizer where the where the Master Gardener right we lay these things out we fertilize the ground we water it with the washing of the part of the work that's our job but my God's gonna get the increase God's not come to me and I'm trying to think of that as I'm talking I'm trying to think of that scripture where it says that the Reapers will come in and reap the harvest right and then what someone will be bound and burnt some will be bound and taken up all right so that's that's going to do that not us but all we're doing here is to fertilize and water and what be a Master Gardener I like being a Master Gardener being a Master Gardener you see some really beautiful things come up so no Papa ministry would be your caretakers definitely put it that one if i whole ministry would be your caretakers God will be the one that will get the increase you'll be the one that will pick us out of here now meet the disciple make sure that he comes and does that but we're not the soul don't make us so much good we're not all that good for the earth they drink them in the rain that comes off the pond it and bring forth earth meat for them by moving this dress received blessings from God but that was best Norman price is rejected and not unto cursing whose hand is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded by the things of you what he's come by those that are of the right seat those that are of the right plan this one not this one and things that accompany salvation now here you go right back to what he goes right back to maturity its accompanying style but accompany salvation what happens is it's like like I said you know you you get the baby here and and there babies are wonderful because we know their babies and we don't expect them to do anything but my baby's day all right but like I said as they grow up and they're still in diapers in their 20s and 30s and they're still eating late babbling that's what I'm that's a long time ago more mangoes what that no well tell me old one but you know mama still don't need today we're gonna have green beans he's not going to go over there mash the green beans up so that we can deal well because we've matured what we've come to salvation we become a son and daughter of done now God doesn't say beautiful baby and go over here say in the corner and he just goes beautiful babies then your platter beautiful baby another baby will die all right and so what does the company salvation the growth development the one for you and I some but though we do speak a company we are talking about the things that accompany salvation today that's what I think that that I believe that everybody calls to message the only different thing the message to me is that it's that part that accompany salvation it's not just divers know supposed to live the Christian life he wants be God made manifest on earth in a human form right forgot it's not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love excuse me which you have showed toward his name in the GM minister to the Saints and do minister and we designer that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of open to the hand in other words not just preachers everybody they'ii be not slothful or slow work or dilatory but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises you see that said now there's one promise which is the Holy Ghost but there are promises given in the Bible yeah there's nine spiritual there's all these different things that come about that we as we as believers not just Mexican believe believers we believe what God's done because what do they look hey bruh Ham God made a promise to Abraham pay for him brother turn your Abraham you said in your house you're not thinking you're making idols right they've heard April sorry Avram was making idols with his daddy was working in one thing about God at all and all of a sudden this voice now it's not in a book it's not in a video it's not only DVD this voices Abram get up and leave where you're at now that's the exactly what happened to Abel me hey everyone heard oh boy stick stick get up and leave and if you're reading Genesis 1415 in there God starts telling him I will do this I will do that I will give you this I will give you this I will give you that and then Abram all right brother turn just gets up walks out the door leaves everything by that now see that's unbelievable honestly it's unbelievable and our humanity is unbelievable because I'm sure saying is probably talking to Abram at the same time no Abram you don't think you can stay right here you make any big living you're doing really good your daddy loves you because you help me with the work you did getting over you need to work there you see the circumstances but that's why Abraham or Abram starting as Abram the baby to come to Abraham the mature man is because God loved Abraham because he knew Abraham would do exactly what he said he's going to do so this so this voice speaks to Abraham reason Omega in this point is he died speaks to us we've done media we've got phone we've got self-service we've got all this internet and Wi-Fi got had Wi-Fi long before man did he talk to us without a liar didn't but he was talking he's talking to us and he gives us all these all these tools and then we say oh that must not be done or we're slothful we shouldn't be slothful we should be more now more aware of God speaking to us and you know what brother Branham told us said now if you give you the way to tell where this daughter not is to go right back and put it in order so say we'll put it in the work he might put a little bit of it but he won't put all of it in the work all right so buddy you see if you if you get a thought how many we got a thought and never ever again entertained it my million oh right but like I told you many times in my Christian journey is there's only been a few times that I know God has spoke directly to me not inaudible boys just inside my head told me things we're gonna happen maybe two three times in my whole Christian experience but still I know that voice I know that tunnel I know when he said but you know why I know it's good it always comes back always films the back I mean you tell me oh if we get dr.aman we go well oh that's the war that's going to come and it doesn't come back I promise you one quart right I promise you you can just remember one thing that was not God if it didn't come to pass that's what I say them you know we we are God that we say he never changes his mind but we all got to change this mind a lot of work does I'm going around here in this dress and Doc told me to well you get there you go I'm not like I'll go this one oh well that ain't where God sent you to that room right very one God may promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessings i Westing a multiplying I will multiply they and so after he had patiently endure he attained the promise now how patient is that God came to Abram that's 75 years old and said you're gonna have a baby he waited 25 years we can't wait 25 minutes hello we can't wait 25 minutes he patiently endured and what happened you don't blame you that was gone he had the baby but remember there was a big long journey in there Genesis 14 15 16 17 they're right in there they they God had to finally meet him face to face and say you're gonna have a baby with Sarah alright so sometimes I don't give you all the direction but he sends somebody to give you the direction nobody favor wonder well Abraham would have walked outside and saw the three men coming and thought they would go home Wiz isn't just over you know what's that one thing scepter Oh I will fall back into one I said but no I really want blood look at the attitude that's what is what palms tell us about now about the attitude he made a promise to Abraham so you a nice Christians when he burst you into the body he gives you a promise he said you are my child and I'm going to take care of you but you got to do what it says in there you got the blueprint you got you got my DNA right here so I want you start looking like because you know part of me so he told Abraham and he patiently endured he obtained the promise that's why we've been in this thing for you know 50 years some more than everybody know more than that but I like that scripture brother Claude always quote those who endure to the end shall be saved those who endure to the end shall we say why because in the end you're gonna get your maturity you going to see your Canadian this one within build purple satanic nasty gross looking but armies really like it and I hate that because they pollinate them and they grow everywhere but but you see that thing you go oh that's just the devil sticking up yes but you know what you got a way to lap the tours then that's got to be chopped away and thrown in the fire but you've got some really good clover down at the bottom there that has been look for awesome so same way with you and on gods wait listen God we're not waiting on God gotta wait on us to come to authority don't work we're not a bunch of babies well we don't cry daddy daddy every time we need something we can speak and let it happen right so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise what do you have he had the child that he was promised to have four men barely swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all struggling or strife or dispute right wearing God willing more abundantly in other words than you and me to show unto the heirs of promise that the immutability of his counsel now once he told me he's going back to Abraham Abraham I told you what's going to happen then you gotta wait on it go say that word means unchangeableness okay so in other words immutability is infallibility he is in power God is infallible when he speaks something is immutable that cannot change will not change and the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath confirmed if I know what he said Abraham you're gonna have a child and he's gonna be my promised son I promise son now we know that that is a tight because excuse me I think was not Christ he's talking about the US and some about Christ coming the promised child all right but he has to give you an allegory of of what happened in the Old Testament that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie so I can't lie if you and I remember I was preaching a couple Sundays go on were just right out of my head going back to I'm nipa tense when - I'm impotence me now I'm never getting all powerful with God God's mad man that has done anything that makes two immutable right are two omnipotence so about two immutable things so in other words it got a contract I have two so Abraham or Abram Abraham had to believe God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness so there was an immutable thing here where he believed what God said then you got gone here you can online then we have a strong consolation with a cliff for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us look we totally have a the soul both sure and steadfast which endureth in that within the veil now remember that's your lair you have an outer core you have an inner court in the Holy of Holies and there's only one man who can enter it behind that veil and that's God itself all right whenever the forerunner is for us enter even Jesus whither the forerunner is for us entered entered even Jesus maiden high priest forever after the order of melchizedek in other words he went in and remember when Christ died the veil was rent all right and we're going to really stop run down because we're going to get into Melchizedek next Sunday but we'll read just a few it's just about 20 African we don't have this per second for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the Most High God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed in food during them also later he'll give a tenth part of all first being by interpretation King approximants after that king of Salem which is King the peace without father without mother now a lot of people believe that that was an actual priest person or somebody and I said without closet without mother now who in the world is without father without mother there's not a soul on this earth don't have a father no mother except one man 19 is Christ all right or God Almighty without father without mother without descent those who didn't have any brothers or sisters naturally having neither beginning of days nor ending a life I don't see how that's pretty plain who that is okay but made like them to the Son of God abideth the priest now the Timmy now see now consider how great this man was it was a man and we'll talk about that next Sunday we're gonna talk about male care that they coming down a meeting Abram will actually go back to Genesis really get into this next time you swim god bless you happy Mother's Day to all mothers and take around a you to give something [Music]
