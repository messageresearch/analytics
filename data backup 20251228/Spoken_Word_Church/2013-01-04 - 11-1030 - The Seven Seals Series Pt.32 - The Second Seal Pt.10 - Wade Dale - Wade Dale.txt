========================================

hello hello God's time God's time God's time God's time whatever you got to say worthless right now Matthew 24 step on your first sorry oh with your foot that's why I was stomping on she's got on purple glasses got on purple real brother to fight you want to drink glasses accessoriz you got that on oh baby whoa okay all right I think those are opposite good morning everyone all right we're going to try to wrap up I know we we were supposed to look up sanctification and you should have thank you and but let's read we haven't been reading Matthew 24 let let's go to Matthew 24 and let's read and let's let's pick up first seal second seal body breaks are okay okay I was talking to her Matthew 24 take heed that no man shall deceive you look at verse 5 for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many what was the first seal a white righteous Church went out everybody assumed that was God so many shall come in what in my name saying I'm Christ and that's what they did they become that the Antichrist Spirit they thought it was God people thought it was God that's why it was a white righteous church that's why it was so innocent that's why it went out in the power that it went out cuz they thought it was God but it wasn't right but there was a group that went out and they were Christ but they didn't deceive you see what I'm saying they didn't deceive all right now look at the verse six and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars now what happens in a war there's blood there's death right remember the symbol was take peace and kill so there's your parallel between the second seal and verse 6 and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet now in my Justified condition just talking from my experience I didn't have a big battle I knew my sins were forgiven I I felt like God had had had had emptied that into the sea of God's forgivness but now the battle really began wars and rumors of war the battle really began for me at sanctification cuz that's that's when this guy has to start lining up right it should have been in your experience you should have had the worst problem in sanctification because that's when the unclean Spirit goes out walks in dry places seeketh rest and findeth none and if you don't fill it with something he's going to bring seven of his buddies back with him and you're just going to be a religious person then see there's your wars and rumors of wars you think well that's natural that's true remember there's a natural application to the seal then there's a spiritual application to the seal the spiritual application to the seal is right here Tim said the other day I'm saved battle right battle battle station you better get your gun because you know what brother Brown say Satan will train every gun on you why you're trying to do better right and you're you're coming under and sanctification brother Ram said and and brother Ryan covered it last night he give you new spirit but not his Spirit to give you a new spirit what a new spirit to say I want to come to church I want to study more I want to pray more I want to be around another group of people right what does Satan do he puts him same old buddies back in there he puts him same old thoughts back in there he brings the same old things back up what then there's your War right you wasn't Waring when you when you were not a Christian were you Waring I wasn't Waring all there was little things in my mind you need to go to church well that was God just kind of pecking you know sending a little signal right but when you know it didn't let's just take for example just plain language today I have no desire to go buy a pack of beer or p p of beer but when I was in the world it didn't matter I mean did it bother you no it didn't bother me I went and did it why the old nature was still there there was not the War but see when God came and said and I accepted that he had forgiv my sins and that I'm just as righteous as he is on my journey on my road baby form justification you got to realize even at baby form justification that you're starting going you're going somewhere you're going two places you're either going back or you're going forward one of the two can't stay neutral in any of these all right but at justification he chopped off my past sins we you know I felt empty but that desire to do certain things were still there why because that unclean Spirit had not been to grow out but then when God when I started coming to church and I started getting under the anointing of what was going on listening to the word that's when the conviction came when you went and grabbed that you know um cooler P it open and you just grab that beer and you put it in course I never did that but there was a lot of other things I did do but you grab that beer and just I see people at Walmart you know all walks of life they got beer and wine I mean to them it's nothing right to them it's just natural I'm going to have me a beer and maybe go to church on Sunday but I'm going to have me a beer and and and and then you know the guy puts the cart in of cigarette he's not going should I do this or should I not do this no it's just automatic just like me and you going to getting milk now you just put that guy on the milk why there that desire the old man is still there Satan is residing right but now in justification there starts a separation right all right this white righteous Church in the first seal what caus Satan to ride out was is because a righteous true church was there that had been driven that had driven him out in the upper room the 120 upper rooms Satan was driven out of those 120 people right cuz they went through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost all at one time because they had been tutored the word that they hell come alive right all right that can happen to you today or it could take you a year in justification or a year in sanctification that doesn't matter as long as you see that you're progressing as long as you see that you're doing the things that you're supposed to do all right but still that's the greatest battle is sanctification because you know what God's going to do God's going to say you're still lost now you might be giv eternal life I don't like that might be I don't like might be when it comes to my life continuing on or or or being you know thrown out somewhere I want to know know that I know that I know but in sanctification though God's coming and saying hey keep going keep doing what you're doing you're doing fine everything you know and through the ministry I'm not talking about God just coming and speaking to you he speak to you through the minister speak to you through through reading the Bible reading the prophet's message like brother Ron said last night just that was that was preached to us whatever they did with it the people that were sitting in that congregation in the 60s and 50s and 40s whatever they did with it was their business they weren't the fin voice to the final age you and I have come up to this message and there's a period there's nothing past us that's going to come and help us out this is it so he was speaking to me and you so through that voice God was trying to get a bride ready get them Justified get them Sanctified get them filled with the Holy Ghost right right but there's a war in between there that's what brother R was talking about last night remember he's talking about the war there was a there's a war started why because it's opposing forces that's why this second seal says and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not trouble in other words don't be troubled Satan will come I promise you if you hadn't already look out he's coming that's right but he's going to make you religious though and put you in a message church and say oh everything's all right that's the worst deception that's right but you got to go on to that third step all right but we're still in the Second Step so let's not get to the third one so sanctification is to make holy set apart as sacred consecrate now that's what you've got to do got to start doing the right thing that's right cu the spirit he gives you brother Brown said it's the spirit where you can at least deal with your own self cuz cuz I I didn't get Sanctified because June did that's I didn't get Sanctified cuz my daddy did I got Sanctified cuz I did all right so it's an individual Affair it's us helping but it's an individual Affair you got to sit down and say God this is just me and you this is just me and you I I can't pour it in it's you and God all right sanctify consecrate to purify or free from sin sanctify your heart to impart religious sanction to render legitimate or B in to sanctify a vow to entitle to reverence or respect to make prod to make productive of pro productive of or conducive to spiritual blessings all right and you do you become productive in a Sanctified condition because what are you doing you come to church start paying your tithe start doing the right things that's right see but Satan's going to say oh well you got something else to do today or that's true watch it cuz remember justification is a hope you make it sanctification is a hope you make it the new birth you made it so you're still at the hope so so be careful but the best thing to do is is tell Satan say look whatever you going to do that's okay I know you're going to be there like we talking about uh coming to church you know brother Ron was saying we need and he did he said we need to be in church you need to be where you're supposed to be you need to be under the the the ospice of of God and the people of God and be around the people of God but Satan's here more than most people are he'll tell you it's okay to stay home and he'll come to church get like brother Ron start diing your hand like again get around him you get his Spirit you hear me are you with me are you with me are you with me Tyler did last but huh Tyler oh I'm sure he did but that's what he did you know Satan will tell you something to get you out of church and he's going to be here first thing he don't miss a service not one but see we start doing and and right there is really your dos and don'ts at justification you really don't stop cutting your hair or wearing makeup or pain or all that stuff it's sanctification when you really sit down and start reading it and that starts convicting your heart oh it's okay to do a little bit you know I see some of the sisters here in the church that hair don't ever grow except straight that's not that's not God people that's not God wearing a little bit of this a little bit of that when we going to know that at sanctification that's where that's supposed to go out not at the new birth sanctification that's when the unclean Spirit the Bible says Matthew 11 I believe it is the unclean Spirit goes out of a man right true that's when it goes out now sanctification and New Birth may be together and it goes out and you become a you know a born again Christian but if you're going to you're going to go through those three stages I don't care who you are whether you go through it the same morning evening or it takes you 60 years but you're going to have wars and rumors of wars right and you even gonna have wars this war continues on to the end these wars don't stop but look right here it says right here and you shall hear wars and rumors of War see that you be not troubled for all these things what all these from five down through all the seals must happen and then the end is not yet so see at sanctification is not your end at the new birth is where you old dead you dies and ends right not in sanctification the old you still alive the old nature is still there but it's being driven out why you do what you're supposed to do all right same way here you listen to what the same doctrine that that that Satan's taking and he's deceiving his people with you take the truth of that Doctrine and it puts you in in the path toward a new birth right right all right so see all these things brother Ron and I were talking last night we were kind of going over some things but but that's why I want to make sure that we don't see all the bad cu the seals are for us they were for no other generation they were for no other time they were for no other bride except for the ones that sitting I'm looking at right now and the natural part of the seal we don't get cuz it's bad Antichrist false prophet all look at all this false anti false kill kill blood dark that's not we're children of light right we're children of live not killing you understand what I mean but if we don't get the spiritual application of this that we do have to die that's right we do have to listen and take the sword of the true word of God listen to a true Prophet give see all you got to do is cover up a few little words that you get Christ Spirit true Prophet put you in the bride all right but now we know and understand that these are for the Redemption of this man here but I want this is just still let's just look at this as just sanctification where the unclean Spirit goes out because you know what once you get born again you know how it's taught here at the church we go through that start over again we got to still ask God to forgive us of our sins cuz we have them he's just to forgive us and then Paul says I Die daily so there's a daily sanctification not just that not just that the snuff box went out and or the pill box went out or the beer can went out well guess what if Satan can't get you one way he's going to go right around here and he's going to come in this way and he's going to try to get you in another way right even though you're born again right even though you're born again that's right but God's made a way because the end is not yet so the end of you right there chapter and 24: 6 the end is not yet now listen let's just give you a little thought though for the third seal listen to number seven for nation shall rise against nation and King D singular against kingom Satan's kingdom against God's kingdom cuz Satan's kingdom is this right here God's kingdom is the new birth that's what the third seal is going to tipe right the new birth Satan's kingdom is going to be against God's kingdom cuz really if you're not born again you're still in Satan's kingdom that's right cuz your soul is not born again you're not Gods you're not a son and daughter of God now you're potentially God knows God knows but you don't don't God knows if you're going to be a son and daughter of God but you don't that's why you got to keep that's why they asked brother brand said brother brand if if there's only going to be so many saved and and God knows how many why do you keep preaching he said well God knows I know that's right God's one that knows I don't know I'm I'm going to be like him I'm going to preach that everybody is saved and then somebody will be drawn to that and be saved okay and God knew that but you and I don't that's why we don't stop and say you see a lot of people in the message think redemption's over and all this stuff all those stupid doctrines I don't like the word dumb crazy anti false they got these doctrines that redemption's over and nobody can be saved well you know what if I found out right now that that was true I'd go to the house why stay here that's right yeah why do what we're doing yeah that's right why why pay my 10% of tithe to something that's already over I go home eat drink and be married true and that's you know what that's what that Spirit takes them to do they get so self-righteous they're so remember God said they'll believe a lie and he will let them believe it and they'll be down by it in other words he's not even going to tell them it's not true he's going to let them believe that lie and be down by it that's what that's scripture all right so I'm going to act like it's not over with Redemption is not over with you know what if I found out Redemption is over with right now my kids w't saved I don't what I do probably blow my brain though cuz what do you got to live for see we still got to live every day brother R said live every day like Christ is coming but live every day like he's not coming that's right if you building a house he's to continue build if you know coming tomorrow he said plant potatoes today he said you just plant potatoes today see because you get it you know why you lean over to one side and you get into that crazy Bunch that that hey everything's done and finished there's no reason to do anything you get lazy you quit your job if we knew everything was over why would we even like I said why would it even be here that would even change my mindset it change your mindset if everything was done and over and there's nothing you can do about it cuz when Redemption is over there is nothing you can do about it right let's go to house I I can go hunting this morning it been a good morning to get in the wood amen D amen yeah it been a good morning to be in the wood I walked outside this morning that's Frost everywhere and I thought wow be a good day to be hunting but you know what I come here and go hunting I'm hunting right now we're hunting for that last one to come in right so but see Satan will tell you he said you go hunting you call in sick like brother Joe said you call in sick no no we got a driving force behind us if you're born again and that driving force is even at sanctification he gives you the new spirit that new spirit is to be able to come amongst this group of people and not be ashamed not be ashamed see I'm not shamed to call you Breen even though I may know you're in a Sanctified or you tell me cuz I'm not going I'm not going to judge anybody say well I believe this one you don't do that don't do that but when you come tell me and say hey I'm in a Sanctified condition and I'm having trouble I know then what to pray for Timo com said I'm saved I said Okay God protect that boy Satan's fixing to let him have it if you didn't let him have it before he F to let him have it right tempt you with more than you've ever been tempted with before but you know what the end is not yet that Timbo going to be saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost cuz that's what the Bible says that's because King Nation shall rise against Nation Satan's kingdom is going to fight against God's kingdom and there shall be famine and pestilence and earthquakes in many places and all these are the beginning of Sorrows all right that's going to be the third seal that we're going to get into next Sunday Lord willing and then we'll be gone the next two Sundays so who who's you did it last right wants to call you going call in six for two Sunday all right well we get somebody maybe we ask maybe brother Ryan can get up and do one that be good maybe brother Mark yeah maybe Brother Anderson Danny's already said no he's not ready yet not till his hair getting gr we got Bob and we oh yeah somebody will do it but anyway next Sunday we'll we'll start on the third seal everybody clear with the second seal think of that seal read that second seal again and think about you because see I can stand up here all day and tell you what I think that second seal is but God's got to reveal to you what it is that's right to me the seals are the most individual affair with God that ever has been on the face of the Earth you got to say God I hear what that man's saying but I want to hear what you're saying out of that right and then make it personal cuz even though you're born again these things are high this is a higher order of justification than what we're talking about a higher order of sanctification than what we're talking about but we're just kind of trying to get the basic down maybe we will go over it again but read the third seal and read just go read all this Matthew 24 and just kind of get a just kind of get a feel for for that part of the seal because brother ROM didn't he come to the four seal I think it was till the Lord showed him that's what it was brother you can't find somebody do let know okay all right we'll uh we'll see what we can do I don't want to wear you out brother Jo I mean you know being being on being on Social Security okay how'd it go yesterday pretty I don't want to be spiritual but it wasn't one of best services okay okay all right all right let's go
