Haven seen him in a while got to see him you on and we pray the Lord would just bless you as you come to be with us as we uh celebrate our 40th which would technically be tomorrow on the 4th day of July we started here July the 4th 1971 and so we you know we're just having these services this weekend for the glory of the Lord and to you know to thank him for 40 years that he has given us here and you know the Lord has been so gracious to us we not a been people on the internet would wonder what in the world we're in a little small building but there's one thing about it that's paid for so we don't have to worry about that and we haven't been head over heels in debt having to burden the people to make them pay for stuff we've all tried to do and we've got a pretty good little uh Network set up of helping some of the missionaries in the foreign field sometimes we're very proud of that and very proud of what God has done for us for 40 years and mainly because he has been with us and taking care of us and giving us the the honor and Glory of being his children and keeping us out of the doctrines that are floating in the message and all the things and sure Satan has tried everything he could but yet we're still here believing the same message and walking in the same light of the hour that we started in and thanking God for all of the things we were counting up last night there was seven here last night that were part of the uh Regional you know ones who began uh here in the church cuz when we started there was five families that was brother Mo and his family brother Cunningham and his brother Robert Holland brother uh Robert Lewis and my family and all and we you know we were trying to serve the Lord most of you know the first service we had five cars parked out up in the front cuz the back was just a jungle of the headge stuffff and we uh you know there was a car came down the road running about 85 mph about half on the road and he ran into all five cars and total lost brother Mo's car and mine and everything else but you know uh we parked right back that afternoon there was one person and I won't call names but one drove down in the hole but the rest of us parked our second vehicle in the same place that we were parked on that one and Company would come a lot of times and go up the streets and park around around and we just you know just talk in a minute while the ones are coming in but we appreciate it and appreciate God being with us and a man we've thought a lot about it cuz there was a man came out here that was the mayor of the city and he said uh you don't need to be out here in front on the building uh parking we'll clean out the back back here far year we were just renting then and and he volunteered brother said we'll pay for the gravel and if you'll fix it well you know the man lived about 1 month and passed away so maybe that would be his uh you know deed he done that would be to help God nobody didn't ask him and and everything he just volunteered so we we appreciate it it's been a long run but yet very very enjoyable I wouldn't change any of it because that it would change my character and my nature and my ways and we appreciate it we got an announcement from Brother Ernie villain noo that uh there is a brother in uh Russia in Siberia big long name I I can't pronounce but he goes to a church in Russia and his name is brother Boris b o r i s but he was a minor and got hurt in a mine accident and they gave him about a 2% chance of survival but he's already lost one eye and everything and fighting for his life so just remember that and just pray that the Lord would touch him you know and the one that Terence mentioned about Dar and Iran we don't know they were they had already said that they were going to uh facing the death penalty and they refuse his objection so let's just pray the Lord would be with these and you know and help everything and and take care of everything and all of that but we we appreciate all that let's let's sing that we sung last night brother dick it's number 57 before we bring brother Reed out in the uh number 57 in the spiral book and it's 387 in the red book The Battle himy of the Republic because that's what we we believe and we believe that we've seen these things and seeing God dwelling Among Us and taking care of us all of these years and we're facing our fourth of July which is Independence Day for America and we have appreciated our independence to be able to serve God and at least until this time to be able to serve him you know with our the way that we believe and what we we think about and and I'm not worried about the rest of it because it'll be taken care of in the hour that we have need of God will be there to do it so let's just sing this but we always sing that a four verse first don't sing the the first one sing the fourth verse because it's only through him can you and I be anything all right so let's just sing it and just we get ready the beauty of Christ across theet with the glory in his that he died to make let us make is my GL Glory hallelu think about it there anything we have whatsoever is what he has

God's bride not by marit or any good works that I've done it is all by God's soing grace The Sovereign Grace of my god oh one in a million a milon oh what a position have received and I call from God and though I don't understand it and so undeserving am I it is only by the so Grace The Sovereign Grace of my God that's right now they wonder why we're different they were the rest when we walk by just like h k he was jealous when God received a oh it looks like K would have known it wasn't works but by Revelation no it wasn't by his word that day it was the blood and it's the same today one in a million b in a million am oh what a position have received and I call from God and though I don't understand it and so UND deserving and I it is only by the so Grace the s Praise of my God glory praise the Lord the Lord tell there's a lot of Revelation in the songs that we sing praise God just have uh two prayer requests that I have from back home just um on Thursday before we left um brother MCO and brother McCoy actually years back he was um one of the deacons at brother Brady he's now pastoring the church in tickets um in sentan and he lost his wife on Thursday um so you know just remember brother McCoy in purr and um you know I think being married for that long I usually say they they're together since they were kids and um you know all the years and you know I know it's hard for my brother and uh he has such sweet Spirit we just pray that God would be with him and the children at this time and then also um just about 2 months ago brother Louis daughter um she's Galia she's um 10 years old she was dnos with sugar diabetes and um she' spend some time in the hospital they try to um stabilize her her sugar level and when it was stabled she was out of the hospital and um you know just before we we came back she was back in the hospital again and so you know just want to pray for her also remember her in your purse um you know it's one thing when you know it's an holder person and you accept that and so but when it's a child it's it's really so hard you know so we just remember that in our Pur and you know remember the family it's really just um different for them you know um having to you know give her special meals and um you know she can't eat some things and to um you know um administer the medication and all of that so you just remember them in your purse as they go through this time but you know one thing we we're certain of um we're going to hear more of these things but the bride's Redemption amen is secure amen some of us won't make the change um but you know what we want to make sure is that our names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen we want to do all in our power Amen to keep the sacred words of almighty God this morning also I just certainly would like to say to the church here in Lula uh congratulations and all the years that I me you've been together and um last night you know I reflected on that as a family unit together and um you know we cannot take from the fact that you know only men of God um as over come the fleet of being of holding a church together for all these years and we certainly thank God you know that you are Overcomers in this time am because it's a hard time to overcome but you are certainly Overcomers in this time and we certainly thank God for you all and for the church here in Lula and um you know Brother Sam was saying how small you are in the small place but I I think over the years since I I've met you all you have accomplished great things might be not just here in America but other places in the world and I think the rewards are in heaven for that which you have done because we can't do more than our faith would allow us to do and I thank God for your Fai amen and H linon we are indebted to you for many things and over the years that you have done not just for us in linston for for the the rest of Jama amen praise God that's all right I I use this one it's not the system it's me I move so much really but um I tell them I'm kind of emotional I'm Jamaican amen so let us stand on our feet this morning as we look to the word of God praise God just thank God for his word this morning and for the message that is revealed to us in this day amen I'm glad to be identified that's right with the word of God glory for our day amen and to be living in the day when the son of man is revealed among his people I'd like us to turn our Bibles to the Book of Revelation CH 14 I'm going to read from verse 9 to verse 12 you know I believe certainly as I'll speak this morning the stage is set yeah and um you know we we've I think it was all over the world just a few uh weeks ago that there was a prediction that a certain date there was going to be the ending of the world and people were nervous they were perturbed they didn't know what to do really and you know people come and wherever they know a Christian or a minister they come to ask you I mean do you believe because what they really want is not to know if you believe what this guy said they they want to know if this is the time because if if you don't believe it's a time that they can go on and live the life they live amen so you you know I I I don't want to discredit the guy really I don't tell them well it never it can't be I said listen it could be the day before right so the essence of it is that you ought to get ready they don't like that kind of answer really you know they want somebody to say oh well he's a fool and um it's wrong and it's a false prophecy you don't need to I mean hey these things will happen brother bam says because they feel the anointing of the time hello and and so we also believe that the hour is lit amen we ain't going to put a day on it we ain't going to put a mean a certain day but we know the hour is late amen and uh they're feeling the pull of the hour and you're going to see more of this coming in but it's telling you and I Hallelujah to get grounded in your faith because we're getting out of here amen praise God let us bad our gracious God and our father Lord we thank you for Lord the day that we're living in God Lord that the prophet one time said it's the most deceiving age that there is but Lord God to the bride it's the most glorious time that oh God we could live Lord I I know that Isaiah and Jeremiah and then they would love to live in the day that we're living in and to see the word that is revealed for this day that the prophecies that they've spoken of that Lord God they They Carried the impulse of that anointing uh Lord deliver the word and the anointing left them but Lord God today we're reaping the benefit of the things that was said Lord what the day to see unfold before us yet Lord God to the world it's going on just naturally but to the little bride Lord God we we see great exploits by the word of God and Lord God we know that this is a time when if there's anything that we need to do is to look up because the Bible said our Redemption draw it nigh bless us God bless every home that is here this morning Lord every family Lord God you know the needs Lord we pray that oh God you would touch the sick and The Afflicted and the dispossession and the downcast oh Lord God we we know Lord God because of the pressures of the time Lord God we know that there's so many depression and and and things Lord God but Lord you are in control this morning Lord God when we look at the things that are happening let us place the days but Lord God may we hold on to the word because Lord God we've got a prophecy that is able to keep us bless us now as we look to you believe you in Jesus name we pray amen and amen am as we read Revelation 14 and verse 9 and the third Angel follow them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the Beast and His Image and receive his Mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture I mean into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascended up forever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the Beast or his image and His Image and whosoever receive his Mark of the mark of his name here is the patient of the Saints here are they that keep the Commandments of God and the faith of Jesus may the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word as you may be seated over there in uh Revelation chap 13 and verse 8 and all that dwell on the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man has adhere let him hear amen praise God I I believe these are this is day that we're living in Brethren you know I believe that the stage is seten yes sir amen right it's coming in in preview and and we're seeing the things happening first little by little and then it's coming at to it like a flood amen you know in said Matthew 24 you know there when Jesus went to Jerusalem and and you know being in in in the this great big big famous city they begin to show him the building of the Great temple that it took Solomon years to build and Jesus begin to say to them see there there'll not be one stone upon another that shall not be torn down and you know when when he moved away from the multitude the disciples came to him and ask him privately Master When shall these things be and what will be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world you know like to break uh amen the theme of Jesus's message brother brand me put it back to Revelation chapter 6 of the seals but there were three things that he made mention of there will be a religious Force there'll be political force and an e economical Force we find there brother brandham amen he was talking about the the publication of I think the the name of the magazine was the the the herald of his is coming right and he said that they wrote in their magazine they they were calling the Believers together they said fast pray fast pray because something is fixing to happen right they were feeling he said they were feeling the impulse of the days the anointing of the time that they were living in he said but they have not recognize the Awakening of the Bride that's right amen exactly you brother Brandon said in the time of Jesus's birth he said because of the the anointing that struck the world at that time he said there were many marries that came on the scene that thought that she was the one but God had a Mary are you there with me you know PR when we look at the time that we're living in you know I was just uh me noticing that Israel had just celebrated the the anniversary of the birth of their nation and they said there was a a political disturbance because they said those Palestinians that had left their homes from 1948 they were driven out they said they came to the borders of Israel and they had with them the keys still they preserve the keys to the homes that they left because they are saying we're going back come on hallelujah amen but brother do you know that there is something that constrain them right prophecy amen prophecy is holding them off that's correct hallelujah amen what a day we've got to be wary of the things that we see in this day amen we find that the spirit of denominationalism on is on the arise again there's a call of unity around the globe they're saying let us come together right Hallelujah the uniting of churches the the the union coming together Bren all of that is for a purpose it is fixing something is about to happen the stage has going to be set Hallelujah now we find that you know if you take it back to what brother BR said in Daniel 70 weeks he said after the rapturing of the Bride there's going to be a confederation right that will amen set up that treaty come on Amen and we've got to we we see now the elements of that that is coming on right amen you know I tell you Bri now it's not just a time where where sometimes get so caught up in the SC squabbles at home yeah and the little things that are happening that we don't get a chance to look over the horizon and see what is taking place amen hallelujah but we know that all organized religion is going to come together in an ecumenical council and we've seen it today a worldwide leadership they're looking for amen the finances of the world everything amen coming together it's a mark for something right the church system the Roman Catholics the Protestants Heen her daughters they're all coming together right Hallelujah they're building a force but oh we know that what it is it's a religious trap right are you there with me right Hallelujah he there will be a persecution am me for refusing to take part in that Union right oh brothers and sisters oh you know they said oh the mark of the beast is coming the prophet says

and they said W it's going to lift this economy they're going to get borrow from China you're going to borrow from the Chinese and so you're going to be inded to another nation and when a man is inded

and Brethren even the Canadian dollar is stronger than the us today oh right do you know that amen and soen as soon as they begin to lose confidence in the dollar what the world will do they said we cannot beg our currency to assist them that is failing and so the only system that is constant is the gold standard so I tell you we're getting back to the gold standard and when we do who's going to have the power the prophet says Rome has a goal exactly absolutely oh the stage is all set am amen right Hallelujah Glory you know Hallelujah communism Heen brother said was just a tool yes used for a time but where is communism today it's all gone right and the economy of Russia is a market economy the economy of China is a market economy and if you look at the scales of the world of who the exporting nations are America is way down oh yeah because as far as consumption they're on the top yeah but in production they're are the bottom exactly that's right amen hallelujah amen so he said Rome he's going to call in the gold standard and Hallelujah then what will happen is that Europe has 37% of the world's economy the United Europe and there's only about four countries in that that does not use the euro yeah and one of them is England and Norway and a few of them really because they are proud of their currency yeah but when the gold standard coming it's going to get Pig back to the European dollar right and then the consumption of America you realize that your inflation is going to move far above what the people can afford because they're going to trade for a dollar that is higher in currency value than they own so bre you can see the systems of the world is changing hallelujah amen once the the global church and the state are united together then The ecumenical council

somewhere along the line yes sir hello amen if your experience are no different than 40 years ago there something wrong somewhere that's right right when Israel came to Jordan after 40 years he was a brand new group of people right it wasn't the bunch that was rocked on the Cradle by Moses it wasn't the bunch that that cry and complain and murmur about the things of God it was a people who knew how to use a sword who were ready to fight who would stand up be F against Hallelujah anything that's not the word of God hallelujah Joshua and a Caleb amen hallelujah those that were born in the wilderness hallelujah amen they weren living on the stories of yester year right oh that all Hallelujah Moses had a glorious experience and we're living on Moses testimony people who had a testimony for themselves that I seen the bit of water turn sweet I've seen what happened to core along the way oh yes there's going to be a DA along the way h on somebody but identify with this word and I'm standing with the identified word that's right amen sir people are going to come and people are going to go love them anyhow is that right right amen you know I tell you you know over the past year I see people who have left the church for years some of them I honestly tell you I I didn't remember them but they come back yeah come on I you know they they see sometimes and they said hey Reed remember to pray for me if I be honest I said man I didn't even remember you but I tell you one thing I want to stand there if they do come back we're still they holding the feet Hallelujah because we are identified with the word of God Amen you can't be upset with a man because he don't see the truth right right you you can't be upset with him because he can't go no further that Hallelujah that his faith would take him but I tell you one thing stand there in truth that if God per Adventure would turn his heart and he comes back he'll be still there still plowing on the same word of God hallelujah amen do you love him this morning so Ephesians 5 and verse4 you see the call of God is for individuals right individuals we like to come collectively as a church and as a church we rejoice together but if individually you don't take a mark for Christ when you come together collectively there is really nothing in you is that right every man has got to have a personal relationship with God every man has got to meet the fire of God how you telling me every man has got to have the new birth hello you must be born again Hallelujah you must meet God face to face H you must Jesus Christ must personally revealed to you amen you know who you are amen you you know you got to say I'm not here because Samuel D is here right I'm not here because so and so is here but I'm here because God placed me here and sometimes some people feel like they not a part of the body of Jesus Christ and so you say go move and and and they get offended and they even leave the church well I tell you what me you can't get me to leave it right cuz you didn't call me hello and even if you disciple my life it is God who I'm standing on oh so much we find people follow people's admiration oh and the person feel and they feel to yeah you find in the church oh God Heen that people brought in people and they they become their own disciples so the church they don't listen to the word that comes from here they listen to that person who have brought them because you see when he bring them he tell them that oh you know this is brother so and so and brother K's got this problem and this one got that problem and that one got that problem so you you don't go in that company you don't go in that company you're going to stay with me because I'm the one oh yeah oh my I tell them I said the only way that I can Pastor them I don't care where you get them from you can get them from hell you got to deliver them to the ministry hello hello hello and you're going to tell them that I will fail but the ministry of Jesus Christ will never fail right are you there with me let them go Hallelujah so people are there and they're bound oh that that's a spirit that leads to denominationalism brother B said that Spirit binds Brotherhood right Hallelujah you're not free to worship God all you before you know so much about the people you can't even fellowship with them come on yeah bre I I don't care if you are a devil come on I don't care who you are we've got to believe in the redeeming power of the Holy cost that's right hallelujah oh that God put my sins in the sea of forgetfulness Hallelujah he put us our no ficient and that's what God did for you and if you can't see God in these that you've got here this morning you'll never see God Amen Hallelujah Ephesians 5:4 he said awake though that sleepers if you're sleeping in the midst of a week Hallelujah right amen may I say literally in spiritually if you're asleep awake right he said arise from the dead and Christ shall give you light Hallelujah these are the sleeping among the dead dead out of these are the den dead denominations that are floating with them God Cries Out awake up and repent of your fall amen hallelujah hallelujah amen there they are amen lending their influence giving their time and their very lives to these Antichrist organization and all the whole thing Hallelujah is it is it all right they need to repent and turn to the truth amen amen you know the Bible says and you shall know the truth right and the truth shall set you free yes sir amen are you there with me amen you know I I I learned this one thing since I came to the message and you know I I've always considered myself a young person but I tell you I came in you know 1985 that's a long time and I've seen many things and you know I'm not standing here this morning because of the people that I knew that belong to the message no sir come on if I was looking at their lives and the things that they do yeah maybe I would be discouraged and I'll be back in the Baptist church today amen but I tell when God called me by his word amen there was something that God did to me right that I know that this was a call from where I was and what I was to the word of almighty God and you know I tell you over the years you know I hear them said where you know this brother son so that brother so so Brethren I tried always always I struggle to find truth come on I'm not afraid of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen I'm not afraid to be challenged upon what I believe no I'm not challenged to dig deep in the word of God am me I'm Adventure on a limb leave me alone because I've seen something that I'm going after hello I believe that this word is going to give me a body a change and I'm going after that change are you there with me I'm not here because my parents believe in it my parents never believe it there's none of my family that is in it but God called me miraculous to the word of God and Bren every day that I live and the more knowledge I have I see that this word is a truth they said when you find the truth you got to follow it everywhere amen you know the oddest thing is when we stand and we declare that we find the truth and tomorrow we're no longer in right hello somebody but I'm persuaded this morning that he's able to keep that which I committed unto him again today thank you Lord BR after everything is in place right Hallelujah you know there's no new happening around the world that we can say we didn't know that was going to happen no sir that's right the stages are being set the things that brother B said he said it in a small way and when he said we didn't understand what he was saying but the more we look is the more we realize that the prophet was seeing something that back then nobody was seeing but today it's all coming together right exactly yes there's a falling away but I thank God for the the Revival of the Bride of Jesus Christ they will stand upon the word of God no matter what and when we see a church that stand for 40 years then will rejoice in Christ Jesus right hallelujah amen I thank God this morning for the fighters that keeps the door open Amen brother I know you got the experience that we've got you know we we've got some persons that they come to church one service for the week some two and some three yeah yeah we've got some people that come to church sometimes but we we're glad to see them every time they're there right we got some people who their own aspiration is to make sure that the church progress gloriously with the word of God and we thank God for them we got all Peay Warriors that would pray all night and to make sure that God answer our prayers and we thank God for them and Brethren no matter what's your experience you're a part of the economy of God H God will make all of us the same and we don't have the same experience but together we are the children of God and Brethren everything is in place we we trust God that when that day of the translation we all be the number that's right isn't that your desire this morning I'll be the number that day of the translation God bless we Hallelujah is there any with a need this morning I tell you God still answers prayer St Mark 16 is still in force this morning amen hallelujah you know the Bible said is there any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church and anoint them with oil and the prayer of faith hallelujah amen I still believe in that prayer of faith this morning I still believe that these sign shall follow them that believe we're not here because the signs
