========================================

trust everyone's doing well um all right so uh let's just go to the Lord in prayer dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for another opportunity that you've given us father to be gathered here together today Lord to worship you in spirit and in truth father God lord and to Feast upon your word father Lord the more we look into your word father we realize Lord God how interconnected everything is Lord God you are certainly Lord the same yesterday today and forever father and Lord Jesus we just pray dear Lord that you'd help us to understand Lord God Almighty this little portion for this morning we just commit ourselves into your hands now and ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I I want to talk this morning about I will have mercy and not sacrifice and um okay a praise the Lord yes thank you all right and uh I created that image last night by AI but if if you get if far away from it it it doesn't look right but I guess up close you know it looks a little better he looks like a merciful Jesus doesn't it so um and the scripture here in nahom 1:3 says the Lord is slow to get angry but his power is great and he never lets the guilty go unpunished I want you to keep that in mind he never lets the guilty go unpunished but yet the Lord is slow to get angry amen Psalms 103 8-11 the Lord is compassionate and merciful slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love he will not constantly accuse us nor remain angry forever he does not punish us for all our sins I'm reading from the New Living Translation so that's why it may not sound like Old English he does not deal harshly with us as we deserve for his unfailing love toward those who fear him is as great as the height of the heavens above the Earth Psalms 145 8-9 the Lord is merciful and compassionate we' we keep reading that right slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love the Lord is good to everyone he showers compassion on all his creation and then to Moses he said the Lord passed in front of Moses calling out in Exodus 34 Yahweh the Lord the god of compassion and mercy I am this is him saying it personally I am slow to anger and filled with unfailing love and faithfulness I lavish unfailing love to a thousand Generations I forgive iniquity rebellion and sin but I do not excuse the guilty amen so you can read that that hold that that scripture yourself now in Matthew chap 12 we we we read a a very pecular scripture and this is when the the disciples Jesus and the disciples were walking on the Sabbath day and the disciples had a need so did Jesus they were hungry so they were they were plucking the the ears of corn as they were walking through the corn fields and so we read here it says at that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the corn and his disciples were in hungered all right I highlighted it because that was the need at that moment that's what that that's what was needful that that was the need at the moment now I want to ask you was that sin to be hungry not at all right is a it's a natural human uh desire right to be hungry and watch and began and to pluck the ears of corn and to eat but when the Pharisees saw it but when the Pharisees saw it they said unto him who Jesus Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day so now they're they're not looking at the need they're just looking at the law right they're looking at what is written they don't they don't care about the human emotion part of it they're just looking at the law aspect of it the law says this you better do I don't care if you're hungry that's what it says thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath Day verse three but he said unto them Jesus said unto them have ye not read now he takes them back to the word because he is the word have ye not read what David did when he was in hunger in other words when he was hungry what did he do you you you you Pharisees who study the word and and and and look at it do you remember what David did when he was hungry and they that were with him how he entered into the house of God and did eat the house of God now Tab and did eat the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them which were with him but only for the priests now this is this is the uh this is an image of David talking to that to that priest when he went and he was also in hungry because if you if you look back at that story David was fleeing from Saul and he was and he Saul was after him and he had some men with him and he was he he he was fleeing and so he he got hungry didn't know where else to go so he went to the high priest now in if you read in 1 Sam you can read that in 1st Samuel 21 and so he went to the high the the priest there his name was ahc now ahc he did not have bread but the bread that was exchanging it was being exchanged out with new showbread because every Sabbath day the high priests were supposed to go in there the day before there was showbread that was supposed to bee uh uh uh prepared uh fresh showbread and it was supposed to be prepared and placed on the table inside the Tabernacle every Sabbath day now every Sabbath day now on every Sabbath day nobody was supposed to carry anything nobody was supposed to do any work nobody was supposed to do anything according to the law of Moses according to what God had given but the high priest could because they were working inside the Tabernacle and so they they could carry things now I'll show you here in just a moment 39 categories of things that the people of Israel or according to the law of Moses they could not even do and one of them was carrying things so this showbread was being exchanged out by the by the priest a himc when David came to him he was exchanging that showbread to new showbread and so David says hey what do you have there uh what do you have there is it possible that me and my man could have some of that bread now that bread was only supposed to be eaten by the high priests or by the priests excuse me and they were supposed to eat it there in the Tabernacle him and and and the high priest so the the the priest gave him an opportunity to eat of this showbread that really didn't belong to David but because David if I'm just kind of paraphrasing the story because we'll be here forever if we and so and so the priest asked ask asked David he said have you laid with with women in the last few days he gave him in a stipulation because they could not eat of that showbread if they had been laying with women so David said no me and my man have not and therefore that made David he he could he could partake of that so it wasn't that David went in there and just grabbed the showbread and and and and it just came right out and and no he asked for permission the priest gave him the the the the the reason you can eat only if this he met that condition and therefore he was able to partake of that of of that showbread right now Jesus was referring back to this story right because if you look at it from the surface and if you don't look at those little details you think David just went in there am man according to the phes and he just grabbed showbread and and and and didn't care and just moved on and me but that wasn't David's heart and see and what I'm talking about this morning is I'm talking about the heart because this is what Jesus is addressing here in Matthew chapter 12 I believe it was so in Mercy and and because David and his men had a need and because David and his men had met the requirements not having been with women recently a himc offered this bread to David which really belonged to the priest to eat this is what the the the showbread looked like it was two stacks of six which represent which which was 12 represented the the the the tribe 12 tribes of Israel now this bread was supposed to be eaten in the Holy Place David was able to enjoy this bread with the priests I believe in that Holy place it doesn't say it there but maybe they ate it there in the Holy place I don't know or it was outside I'm not sure but nevertheless he was able to feed his man and he was able to feed himself praise God now it's interesting because Jesus brings this up and and and what what do what does Jesus say in John 15:7 if ye abide in me and my words abide in you remember he is the bread of heaven right ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you Amen in Romans 81 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and so you're asking what did these scriptures relate to what I'm talking about amen when you are in Christ when those priests those priests were free from that law of caring things and stuff like that when they were in the Tabernacle outside of the Tabernacle you were not supposed to carry anything you were not supposed to work you were not suppos in the Tabernacle or in Christ Jesus there is freedom amen and you and I are priests Amen in this hour that we live in right praise God so there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus praise God but we live by laws and regulations and everything is is is dos and don'ts if you are not in Christ Jesus but if you are in Christ Jesus then it doesn't become dos and don'ts for you it becomes freedom in Christ Christ paid it all he took the price he did it for me and I just have to rest in his word because he is the Sabbath right praise the Lord now I apologize I'm going quickly it's just time you know 25 minutes is just it's hard and it's hard when you're when you're a preacher too so Jesus continues in in that scripture and he says or have ye not read so he gives him another example he says or have ye not read in the law so he takes the Pharisees back again to the word he says okay you're sitting here condemning my disciples for taking for taking the ears of corn and feeding them elves when there is a need he understands what the law what the law says Jesus wrote the law he gave the law he is the law but he's also Mercy amen and he understands and so he says okay have you not looked at the law how that on the Sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless amen and so in you can read in Exodus 20: 8-11 the where he talks about God gives the strict command about keeping the Sabbath holy amen no work of any kind could be done at all and it included not doing any form of of work from these following categories and I don't know if you could see that but they could not there was no there was no carrying they could not do any burning extinguishing finishing writing erasing no cooking no washing no sewing no tearing no nodding no untying so you couldn't tie your shoe or untie your shoe if they had shoelaces at the time shaping no plowing no planting no reaping yet that is what the disciples were doing there with Jesus when they were plucking the ears of corn with Jesus amen such such activities as plucking of flower and plucking of fruit from a tree came under the is heading amen the same is true of of mowing a lawn it was also legislated that we that they did not handle any growing flowers or plants it was also forbidden to climb a tree or smell a growing flower a uh a a fruit which falls from a tree on the Sabbath may not be used on the same day the use of animals as well as plants is forbidden since there is the concern that one might forget and inadvertently pluck a branch to use as a switch you know for the donkey or for the horse so they could they they they were very strict on this but yet the disciples were doing this and Jesus was standing right there doing it with them and the disciples and and the Pharisees all they could do was condemn and not look at the need or the human aspect of it at the moment right how how many sometimes we're like that amen we forget that there's a need at the moment instead we look at the law more and think that we're going to change someone by the law or some rule or some regulation and you forget that there's human emotions human humanity is attached to some of the things that we do now we're going to look at a story here in just a moment and I I believe we have time of something that happened with Aaron the high priest and Leviticus chap 10 and and that Moses was caught up with that and he realized that he was not doing the right thing now you can read I can give you this list there they the 39 different things but we'll be here for a while reading that so Jesus says but I say unto you that in this place is one greater than the temple so he continues to tell him that in this place there's one greater than than than the temple there's one greater than than than than than what the high priest did in the temple or did not do in the temple I am that Temple amen and that Temple is in you now praise God Jesus Christ you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord so you are Mercy you are Grace you are forgiveness you are compassion you are all these things that he was amen you are ones that that that that can Overlook things amen for the for for the benefit amen of of of of for the whole picture amen sometimes you know the Bible says that a multi that that love covers a multitude of sins am right you see right so we're not always out trying to get somebody pointing them out or or saying you know don't do this don't do that amen and publicly shame people amen but we're out covering amen covering amen and and and and and and and making sure amen that that that they can continue continue on in their walk with Christ amen there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so Jesus continues saying here so after he said but I say unto you I say unto you that in this place is one greater than the temple and then he continues and saying but if ye have known what this meth this is where I got the title I will have mercy and not sacrifice in other words to Lord to the Jesus Christ to him to God is to him is better to show Mercy than to even what is written in his in his in his commandment when the need is there and everything has met the the requirements amen right the requirements were met by the disciples were not sinning but there was a need the David was not sinning but there was a need a human need and so Jesus could set aside God could set aside amen what he had written and look at the humanity aspect of it and it's hard for us to do that because see us as humans we like to if it says it then it we no matter what happens no matter what the human aspect part of it is no matter how hard you are no matter how what you're going through you've got to do it cuz it says it and that was what the Pharisees believed but that's what Jesus was trying trying to take them away from and it's easy for us humans to do that for us because we love law but law never never gave anybody the Holy Ghost law never never never gave love to anybody never gave Grace and law always puts you in jail rules and regulations always condemn you but love amen brings somebody in love always amen trains them in amen if they did wrong amen set them aside and say okay maybe we should have done it this way amen or things should have been done this way set them aside praise God but law never never never brings anything good praise God and so Jesus says but if you have know if you had known what this mean I will have mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the Guiltless in the New Living Translation it says but you would not have condemn my innocent disciples talking to the Pharisees if you knew the meaning of this scripture I I want you to show Mercy not offer sacrifices right you know there's a way to do things sometimes amen where you can show love compassion amen praise God and sometimes we just think we're right he because you know it's the rules and we forget the human aspect of things amen we forget that there's people that have feelings we forget that people amen uh we forget that because we just like sternness and we like law but how about how about when they treat you that way you don't like it then oh you like to do it to other people but you don't like it when you're done when you're done that way you see so so Jesus here in that in verse 7 he was directly quoting Hosea 66 for I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more more than burnt offerings as good as those burnt offerings were and as needful as they were because God had commanded them God preferred the heart of the person more than those burnt offerings God preferred more a a desire from the heart something genuine from the heart than following rules and regulations because God said so but if you're not doing it from your heart what is what what does that matter and if you have a nasty attitude about it what does it matter amen God said it the the rules and regulations say it the laws say it but if it's not from the heart doesn't matter it actually causes more confusion y amen it says for the son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day so it didn't matter what those Pharisees who were who knew the law back and forth amen they knew and nobody could knew the law better than they did it didn't matter what they said the law the one who wrote the law the author of the law was standing right there and he was the one who made the final judgment then right and what was his final judgment there in front of those of those Pharisees he cared more about the need at the moment of the disciples than what the law said right isn't that what happened that's right even though he was that law he cared more about feelings compassion amen and about about the need at the moment than what the law said amen Jesus is that Temple amen how many you believe that Jesus is that Tabernacle amen where the high priests were work were in their working in and out in and out he he was a representation that Tabernacle represented him right amen Jesus is that Sabbath he is our rest amen he is our rest that we can rest from our burdens amen and be in Christ Jesus and rest in him him praise God Amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the soul now in the soul now we are that Temple now we are that Tabernacle now we are not just experiencing an eternal Sabbath but we are the Sabbath for others amen we're not just a Sabbath amen for ourselves but we are a Sabbath or a rest for others as well amen we we we receive peace and we give out peace amen so we should know when to uh we should have wisdom on how to deal with certain things amen and not think that every time you have to just be Stern obey the rules or else no amen look at the compassion aspect of it now let's let's let's look at let's look at Leviticus chapter 10 real quick we got 10 minutes we're looking at Leviticus 10 now in Leviticus 10 you can read there how the discip uh not the disciples but the um Aaron and and and his sons amen uh his sons his two oldest Sons they they they uh they offered Strange Fire in other words there was a fire that they were supposed to offer to to as as you know for the uh for the Lord but they offered Strange Fire what that fire was I don't know but the Bible says that they offered Strange Fire in other words it was fire that was not that that was not approved by God or or or it would didn't come from God Amen it was their own thing right they felt like maybe in their position they felt big they felt that they could do whatever they wanted to so they went ahead and just offered Strange Fire and God Amen they offered Strange Fire god with the fire that they were supposed to offer came down and killed them in front of Aaron and in front of his two other Sons youngest sons who were also priests and if you read the whole chapter Aaron can continues in the work there after he sees his two sons dead right in front of him in front of the congregation in in front of his family is seeing this God has just killed his two his two sons for not having their their heart in the right place and here is Aaron still continuing to do what he was supposed to do to finish that that that service I guess you could say you can read it yourself in Leviticus chap 10 Moses was there behind the scenes pushing it on and saying we've got to finish this we got to do this it's about the law it's about what God said it's about what God Said Amen so they finish the the the the Aaron and his youngest two sons they were supposed to take the goat that was offered for the sin offering of the people they were supposed to take it back and eat it and that was according to the law that God had given Moses but when Aaron gets when Moses goes back in there and says and asks his two sons where is the goat did you all eat the goat that you were supposed to Aaron tells uh his son no they they said no we went ahead and burnt the the goat they were not supposed to do that according to the law of Moses they were not supposed to burn that they were supposed to be eat that goat because that goat belonged to them as a gift from the people for for offering for their sacrifices right and so they went back in there and Moses he got upset angry at them I'm just paraphrasing this because of the time he got angry at them all right and then Moses asks them why did you not eat the goat why now he had to write to because Moses was representation of the law the sternness fulfill the law right and so in and in in Leviticus chapter 10 here's Moses he's he's angry where's that goat at right in Leviticus chapter 10 uh verse 16- 20 it says this Moses then asked them what had happened to the goat of the sin offering when he discovered it it had been burned up he became very angry with elzer and aamar which was Aaron's others remaining Sons why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sacred area he had a right to ask that that was part of the word he demanded it is a holy offering the Lord has given it to you to remove the guilt of the community and to purify the people making them right with the Lord this is the law since the animal's blood was not brought into the holy place you should have eaten the meat in the sacred a area as I ordered you now remember last week we talked about that Moses was the word to the people right as I ordered you but watch what Aaron's response then Aaron answered Moses today my sons presented both their sin offering and they burnt offering to the Lord and yet this tragedy has happened to me his two sons got killed if I had eaten the people's sin offering on such a tragic day as this is would the Lord have been pleased in other words if I had eaten this this this being that I'm I'm suffering I just lost my two sons Moses understand please this is why he's trying to to to make him understand Aaron explains that after the tragic deaths of his sons naav and Abu he felt that eating the sin offering while in a state of mourning would not have been appropriate in other words he was not doing it with his heart he would not have been eaten that that that goat offering with with with with the right mind how could you do something how it's hard to pray sometimes when you're when you're mourning it's hard to pray sometimes or or read the word or pick up the word amen when you're in a state of of shock in a state of mourning amen amen but that's the part that Moses was not looking at he was not looking at the human aspect of things he was just looking at the law right all right and then uh the sudden and tragic deaths of naav and Abu had likely left Aaron a State of Shock sorrow and mourning and when Moses heard this he was satisfied verse 20 amen so the musicians can come up so by accepting Aaron's response Moses shows he can empathize with others respect their feelings and find a good balance between following religious duties and understanding human emotions that's so important it's so key that we do that amen don't don't live your life amen by just what a law says or what a rule and regulation says understand use empathy and use wisdom amen use empathy you you use look at somebody's amen of the outcome of what happens if I do this or act in this way amen the human aspect of it as well empathy understanding and compassion is more important in the eyes of God than keeping rules and regulations when the hearts of individuals who made the mistake is in the right place and and Aaron's heart was in the right place he he wasn't doing he was not eating the the the the the meat or the thing just because he didn't want to he wanted to disobey no he was hurting he had just had a tragic event happen in his in his life his two sons had just lost their brothers and yet Moses he understands this amen now I'll just read this here and we'll finish with this brother brand says this now I said to my brother schism to and brother Ness to answer your question I said now I do not take either sides with you Brethren and I know as long as you fuss you are both wrong see because I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart than to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my heart see I said after all it's your heart's condition praise God I'd rather be right I'd rather I'd rather have a right heart than to know everything in the word and not have the right spirit know every single every single Doctrine and every single thing amen and not have a right Spirit I'd rather have the right spirit cuz God can take care of the other other stuff if I have the right Spirit now that's was a quote from brother Brandon God bless y'all love yall
