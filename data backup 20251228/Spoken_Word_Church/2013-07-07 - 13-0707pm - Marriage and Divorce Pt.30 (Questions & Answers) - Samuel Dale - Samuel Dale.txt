we thank you be with the sick here because we hold them up continually before you and we believe that by your stripes we are healed and we are delivered by Your Word because the word revealed is the greatest thing could ever be have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us Lord in your grace and love in Jesus name amen Romans 7. no you're not bred in for I speak to them that know the law how that the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth where the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man or for my brethren you are all ye also are become dead to the law how now by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God or when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead we're in we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter now let's go over to John 8. 31 30 while you're getting there and he spake these words and words as he spake these words many believed on him then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continued my word then you are my disciples indeed you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man what about being in they were in natural bondage to the Romans right ruling over them at that time but yet they didn't account that because they believed they were the people of God and no matter what was going on they weren't in bondage to no man so look at him and they answered we'd be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man houses thou ye shall be free Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the server divide us not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word right and you shall know the truth the truth will make you free I thank God for the truth but you know a lot of times it hurts right I mean there's no need of worrying about it or thinking about it you say well it didn't hurt me yes it did when you first heard it it hurt because it cuts it's a sharp two-edged sword and it cuts going both ways and it does hurt a lot of times but you know I'm doing but I hope you've enjoyed this series that I've tried to bring forth on marriage and divorce and then getting on over into me the greater things as the prophet said in the invisible Union that Romans 7 referred to a greater portion of marriage and divorce now a greater portion he said of marriage and divorce in other words something greater than marriage and divorce because you wouldn't speak on a greater portion unless as you were talking about something greater all right and it's like I said this morning the new birth is the most important thing to you and I right now to get that straight well we want to get our marital situation straight give us some kind of a rabbit hat trick you know or or tell us something that we can get these things straightened out by uh I'm sorry I don't have any you know all I have is to believe the word and I leave it up strictly to you because you and God Alone can can work out your sins uh I cannot be your uh Pope uh you know to tell you that uh you're okay because what good would that be it might wind up and be like the lady you remember brother Branham referred to that come down to the dying hour and then she started telling the preachers that you lied to me you know well I don't want to get in that situation and so the best thing for you to do is to you to seek God that's reason I can't tell you if you have the new birth the only person today that I know has got the new birth is me right he said well well that's putting it down now that's just what it is you got to say that I thought you believe the prophet you want the quote he said if there's anyone going I'm the only ones going wasn't that the way he said it you got to believe you're the one because it's not for a group this is not an organizational situation it's an organism around the world of the body of Jesus Christ all right then in doing that we must each one personally have our own experience right you must have the new the new birth because if you don't have the new bird then you're not even in line of anything because we are not natural Jews of any form they would even be in line for the Covenant but yet even in this day the natural Jew has no line to go Paul said it's not a Jew that says you outwardly but a Jew that's a Jew inwardly by the new birth all right so if we can see it though we can really believe it that that old husband of our natural adamic nature that's the best way to say it because it means the way we came the way we were born this whole world is an adamic nature because of the Fall In the Garden it is the domain of Satan and in doing that it is through the basis it has to be dealt with now I'm going to comment for a little while and then we're going to have questions and answers all right now I don't mind some like sister Susan likes to ask in the Bible study I want to ask this for a friend of mine I don't mind that either if you want to say it that away but she will do that sometimes she said A friend of mine wants to know we'll go that away whatever you ask I'll do the best I can to tell you that whatever I can tell you but then it don't bother me to say I don't know right so you know as people ask me questions and I'll just say I don't know the Aaron back there the first time he called me he thought I was such an intellectual years ago he'd heard so much about me how great intellect I was and and everything else and he was amazed because he asked me a question and I couldn't answer it well he went around telling everybody he said brother Dale couldn't answer that question well there was no need of playing around I didn't know the answer because it's just the truth you know let's be what we are all right but now write your questions down your thoughts comments and all like that because I'd like to hear from you see I don't believe the new birth sets you free from your marital situations of the natural part because it did why would the prophet have to preach it it wouldn't be the binding force of waiting until the end time and he could not preach it until the seals broke that's what he said it was revealed there in the seals all right now then you know we don't have to worry about that we're going into the rest and just be concerned I believe the new birth sets your soul free makes you a born-again Christian and the old nature of that Soul had to die not just a white washed our doings you know when you see a lot of the world doing that that they make a confession but yet you see I'm still just going on living just like they was living before you know and you know they they join a church they're doing little things and you have to go on well you know right real quick that old husband's Not Dead now I have to admit it because it is truth that that old adamic nature whether you believe it or not that's to use because I believe it I believe that old adamic nature is always trying to raise up yeah and you got to keep killing him he said I've killed him a long time ago well why is he keep raising up living I wrote myself a note down you know that people spend more time talking about the past now see if you think I'm right people spend more time talking about the past about what they've done yes then speaking of even what they're doing or even what do we'll do the biggest portion of our conversation is a priced event right we talk about what went on for the week we talk about how long brother Cauley I remember years ago we were coming down the road and it's just a roof she was you just never talked very much and me and my wife was following them back out of Tennessee and I said look look and Peggy said what what what happened I said look brother calling sister Ruth is talking his sister Ruth is coming to the house and said they only take he said what you've been doing so when you make dress she just wasn't one to spend a lot of conversational piece like that in a contrary to most people was thinking that's the way I am you know you know I'm a quiet person on a lot of things but anyhow but we do we spend more time talking about the past than we do about even the Present part of us or even the future because that's kind of the way we're made well see I believe the new birth makes that Soul free and God had to let that old nature die now the point I want you to see is how does he do it then we'll get to the questions and answers how does God let it die see we can go through the uh uh explanation of how the red true red you see white uh we could go through the different things but I still want to know how does God forget that's just my point how does God forget a god that is omniscient which means he knows all things omnipotent even omnipresent in the fact that he's omnipotent or knows to be there now how does he forget what we've done they had to do that or we would not have got the new birth the prophet said invisible Union he said if that old husband wouldn't dead you're not going to get the new birth because you see you just hanging him up there and go back and get him and do it now God won't dwell the Bible says in an unclean vessel so then he wasn't he won't come into your soul in the new birth and birth that soul to that individual well Satan was still living there so he has to go through the process of driving him out cleansing it you know boiling out everything and then the Holy Ghost itself being the fire of God to come in cleanse so then you know God then some way he is able to forget amen and that would be a great ability to be able to forget right because I can't I you know we all have our memories and you can't do it but to get the new birth you've got to you've got to believe that he forgot it and then those things that goes with it of explaining it you know of the red through red you see white those things are the things that come to us to be able to help us understand but see red through red you see white is not a revelation now listen to one word that's a scientific fact all right see then if you can see it it's not a revelation Revelation has to be something that is far greater than any uh scientific fact that you have amen right so then the New Birth has to have God some way let that die right so the best we can say about it is the scripture they're over in Psalms 103 verse 12. he said that he would put the remembrance or our sins that would be our transgressions would be removed as far as the East is to the West all right see then there's no calculations you can go north and south and you have a calculation but if you're going east to west either way you go you just keep going because once you get over here you're East you get over there West it's always going to be the same you know no matter what you're stationing on you're going to still be talking of east and west so it just means that it's it's totally gone in the bases that God can put our sins as the prophet would call it then in the sea of his forgetfulness now I like the way he says that in the sea of his forgetfulness right because you and I cannot forget all right the best we try we can't forget but he can he has that ability to seal away something that we have asked him to forgive us see that way then he can let it die and you can receive the new birth all right see then we went in through the marriage and divorce situation of natural things of life and seeing that I believe when that Prophet made that statement that day when he said go on As You Are I believe God put that in to see if his forgetfulness right now if you want to quote for the other parts you can say well it was just a statement that he made but he said that God saw it in the days of Moses in the days of Paul and counted at righteousness now how do you look at a filthiness of mankind and call it righteousness you definitely got to be looking Beyond on the act or the thought that's right if you're going to count it righteousness righteousness means if you look it up righteousness means right right that's where it starts from right being right r-i-g-h-t right then you put the righteousness to it as being a you know way of doing things all right so then he could put that in the sea of his forgetfulness and never to be remembered anymore because it's even though you take uh the scientific side and you would take red and look through red you see white Still You Got The Two Reds to deal with right you understand me you see he don't see any of it that's right it's gone now that's marvelous to me I love it that way I don't have to have all the mechanical understanding I just believe it I believe it's done all right see then I believe that in our in our situation of us now that we're talking about the fact of organized religion and how that organized religion is the cause of all things the reason we needed a new birth was organized religion he said no no no well Eve trying to organize it in the garden messed it up man has always tried to find a way to save himself right is that what the prophet said the reason they chose it in Exodus 19. did not say we're trying to figure it out by giving Hagar to Abraham that's right has not had always been somebody trying to figure out something instead of believing What God Says see then we came up and taking on and speaking about organized religion being man's ideas got a good comment from somebody on a note about it you know enjoyed it's our ideas that are contrary to God's word that's what organized religion is it don't have to be a whole group of people it's just us ourselves and see as long as we doubt the word of God then you know as we're talking about it life's not about the Rapture everybody's wondering about the rapture I told him I said first we got to deal with one thing this is the first got to be a resurrection right then there's got to be a change and then a rapture yeah and we got to deal with it in that order that's right of the first the resurrection because it can't be a change until the dead erase all right then dealing with a change and that's brother Randall said what is that great mystery of the translation he says what he said just to change now what about you asked Amana I um a question that the world would be concerned about and he says just to change then he proceeds to explain his explanation oh he's like a mother with a baby and her come into the place of desire and things at the end and that means something's close there getting ready it's easiest to change you thank them theologians sitting there for we worried about that all of our life in all of our school we studied it at War and this man says it's just a challenge that's what it was that's what it'll be it'd just be a change all right we got to go through the order to come to that all right but now get it see we've got to see for the new birth that old husband did we got to reckon that or count that in our thinking all right now we've got to reckon or count within our marital life the the things that we are problems brought on by organized religion and see that those things are white slate clean by the prophet you said the prophet no no it was the words of the man of a firm believer and wrote around him speaking the word I believe it like this when he got into the Rapture message if you'll notice it he said it has been spoken now let it come to pass you realize nobody even the Apostle Paul with even the prophecy that he made of it but yet he never explained those things I don't believe it'd ever be a Rapture if his Prophet hadn't to come to speak the word unto us that's my dependence is upon that all right now then I believe that when he spoke of the marriage and divorce he spoke in the first person all done it Moses done it spoke in the first person to bring God's word to you and I but we must believe that that's why it's not for everybody all right then we got down to organized religion and that's the thing that we're going to deal have to deal with in our life that old husband of organized religion which is our ideas and thoughts God will have to let it die amen all right now if it's right what we read this morning and I believe it in the Feast of the trumpets where the prophet of God said the Holy Ghost had been bound for almost two thousand years at the door of Creeds and dogmas but was promised to be loosed by the end time message I like it that way not even by the man but the end time message to take his message and walked her in all right now if that's true how does God let that old husband die or makes him where he has no more uh control over us how does he do that this is just a comment now and then we'll open up for questions and answers I believe the key is in each thing must tie together uh remember we put a couple of messages on the um prophecy that a prophecy p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y the Rope actually s y means someone is speaking the prophets went out and spoke that was the prophecy Sy but the when you put it p r o p h e c y that means all of those prophets had could be brought together and summed up in showing God in human flesh because the prophets gave birth to Jesus Christ so then the whole Bible would be a prophecy p r o p h e s y c y brought To Us by a prophet that would be speaking it with the s y all right but yet it would be a compiling of the entire Bible right a tying together of all of the Loose Ends is that the words of the prophet what this end time messenger was to do and to bring to you and I the revealed word of God now I believe the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ the prophet said Christ The Mystery of God reveal what is the new birth he says it's Revelation Jesus Christ personally to you all right what did he say um it's about I can't remember the page number but I'll be led this he said you can't be saved without a revelation there's no way to be saved without a revelation because that's what it is that's what a revelation is a revelation is God speaking personally to you amen now not a revelation about something you can have a revelation of being healed and get healed and be lost but when you come to the soul of that individual I believe the new birth is the birth of the word no matter then what age you would be in it would be the birth of the word in Luther's age it was not a birth of the end time message it was a birth of the just you live by faith all right so then every age would have a portion of the word and that would make that whole bringing together to be that you and I would receive the revelation of the entire word all right I believe it's a revelation that you're birthed by I believe it's like the prophet said on marriage and divorce he said I believe it's that our invisible union he said if you get a revelation that's your wife he said that's your wife for life now somebody married four or five times could tell you I got a revelation each one of these is mine right I don't work too much we're not stupid maybe a little dumb not stupid huh see he said when you get a revelation some of the things brother said would sometimes it's hard to understand but yet it takes a revelation Julia Birth by revelation you shall know the truth that word no look it up it doesn't mean like I know it means like job said job said I know my redeemer lives all right it was revealed unto him yes I know it's a revelation when you say it's been revealed to you all right then nobody can talk you out of it that's right if they can it's not a revelation that's right that's sensual amen amen so then the new birth is based upon whether or not you can receive a revelation remember the man told around me said I can't receive it no matter what God would do he said it wasn't for you Upon This Rock Jesus said upon this revelation I'll build my church all right so the new birth is a revelation unto you all right now marriage of divorce of Grace would be a revelation unto you that God has revealed to you that you're free it would require revelation but see that Revelation as we were talking about last night that Revelation could not come forth in the days of Luther Wesley or it didn't even come forth for you and I in the days of the Apostle Paul it came forth for those in the days of Paul all right but see then I believe as much as God spoke through Paul to say not I with the Lord and then they say but not the Lord but I say I believe that was God speaking through a man I believe brother Branham God done that come down and spoke through a man's lips to tell you and I about God and then I believe just as much as I believe in one true and living God you know I mean as much as I believe in one true and living God I also believe that his words brought unto us the revelation to set us free if we can believe it no then a pardon is not a pardon unless received is one that's right amen even though you could turn the story around and say the man sitting in jail could sit there with the papers in his hand and he could say I've got a pardon not a pardon this is my paperwork is signed by the president if he didn't walk out on that then they're just leaving sitting in jail right see because he you've got to do something with it all right so you tell me he said Lord revealed me and that's what I've always said you know this statement I've said this no but I don't know how many hundreds of time you show me somebody that comes out of organized religion just because they find out to organize religion is wrong you watch that person they will go back to an organized religion situation or form one of their own think about who you've directed and led and shown the message those that screamed and hollered about the religions being wrong where they at they formed their own religion but those who come out by the revelation of Jesus Christ you'll see them maybe stumbling and bothered a lot but you'll see them walking yes because it can never be taken away from you that is the new birth see then organized religion man's ideas how in the world could you and I get rid of man's ideas now come on it would be just like telling you this is my right hand I hope he got it on the internet system where anybody okay I raised my left hand up and you could say this is my right hand I want you to know that we've been wrong for 6 000 years we've been turned around well now how many is going to believe that you've been taught this is your right hand you've been taught certain things in your life that still controls you right right and that's wonderful to some degrees because it's good things but then when it finally opens up like I said this morning that even the prophet was deceived by organized religion I know people don't like that statement but yet it was true because he said and taught the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit so he was deceived by it but one day the truth came and he was set free right that way you and I could be set free right right and even though Clarence Larkin before brother Branham said the white horse rider was the Antichrist but he wasn't the prophet just as in the days of Martin Luther there were many many people protested the Catholic Church Luther was not the only one he was just but he was the one chosen of God to bring the message now the message then was the important thing not for you to realize organized religion was wrong why is it wrong why is organized religion wrong well you show me one in this message or out of this message that will ever try to lead you to the truth of one true and living God you got the trinities you got the onenesses you got the brand amounts what have you got they don't keep it on one God they're always swaying it some way if nothing else they're hitting the River Jordan one of the latest doctrines that Jesus wasn't God until the River Jordan when the Bible said he was born to Emmanuel well I don't care what you got to say of quotes from then on you can't solve that scripture or annihilate that scripture it doesn't say he would become Emmanuel born this day in the city of David is the savior of Christ the lord and they say one of these days you'll be born you know let's see organized religion then being manned ideas what's going to destroy our ideas all right it used to be said that every tub would sit on its own bottom it's almost older one to hurt them things well let's say you said well it's not in the Bible you know this my grandmother read that you mean my grandmother's wrong no she heard it from Grandma too it's not in the Bible you'll never know never never it's just seasoned except for the shedding of the leaves and the button of the trees my wife had that idea when we him in this message she had heard that you could swear by it because you somebody told you it's not in the Bible that is the way you know the season you know the sadness but better put your seat in the bed of a than to put it in on the ground there's no scripture in the Bible that would justify prostitution but yet people swear by it will you devil said well come on show me where's the time to read the whole Bible I'm just going to tell you what happily you ever heard this one my mama was a Baptist that's my mother that's what she said you know and I'm going to be a Baptist I'll die Baptist because my mama was a Baptist come on the point I'm trying to get is if a man tells me the Bible don't say something and he can prove it I better start changing what I used to believe right right yeah I've had a lot of people tell me say brother run say it so and so unsequently now come and show me where he said it right well I heard it wasn't Brother Ray did Brother Brown said not to go down there and see that movie uh Ten Commandments I said I've searched the message and he has to I can't find it I said but I did find where he said go see Sodom and that's a whole lot worse than ten commandments he said if you want to know what's going on today go see the movie saw them would you see it's our ideas our thoughts but the word of God is Not man's ideas it's not man's ideas about a god is God using man to speak his word and to bring It Forward but yeah we'll fight if I were a quote that we can't produce dinner exclusive but I don't have enough time to search you but I know he said it now you see how blinded we are yes all right how is God going to let our old denominational husband of ideas and thoughts die now to illustrate what I'm talking about the computer is a very damaging product can be used in many ways it's a very valuable product too because you can take that they can take the Bible and put it in the computer and then you can ask that computer for any word in there and if that word's in there the computer will bring it up but if it's not in there the computer gives you zero right see now you can prove if anybody with any sense see sensible people all right now I say the Bible says every trouble sit on what's wrong bottom you go and it says zero that it doesn't exist now if you got no sense you ought to realize you got yourself against the wall when brother moat told me that how many millions of times you heard it and what do you believe me I said I believe in one true and living God he said explain it I said well on the way I can explain it it's gone in three persons Blessed Trinity he said your Justice Trinity as everybody else I didn't get mad storm out bless God I prove it to you he said a person to personality personality is an individual individual is a person your Trinity as well as anybody else I looked dead at him and said it I said don't believe that no more I knew the man had me whooped but what I hate is a third grade education person to explain theology and I'm not meaning theology is good I've just been in a third grade education you can't tell me that four plus four equaled eight all I know is three plus three equals six and see they got no sense to add the rest of it and that's the way we are we will take our thoughts of what we believe about God's word even over what a prophet has to say what do you think all these doctrines or the messages come from come on how many of the people this message believe that brother Brown was God and yet he said if you do that you make me an antichrist Lord is that his statement do you think that corrected anybody no he done that to deceive you I said you've done a good job because I'm deceived enough to believe he didn't know that you understand the point I believe the revealed word is the thing that saves you I believe the revealed word is what sets you free on your marital situation I believe the reveal word is the only thing that can kill them old husbands the revealed word not just somebody's idea I believe it means this well I don't have nothing to do with it that's right I stood before a theologian in this message one day that a man and I'm talking I'm not bragging just telling the truth the man has quoted a scripture and it's in Deuteronomy 24. where it says if a man put away his wife for and he called whatever and said she and she can go be another man's wife may go be another man's wife you see that was going to be the topic that day of marriage and divorce in this old building right over that corner we met before we knew because we knew we were going through that meeting to have the meeting and we had been challenged about marriage and divorce and uh we met and prayed on Friday night before we left on Saturday to go to the meeting and God dropped down that day they're in the corner because see I didn't know what the answer was either and he dropped down in the corner and said just read the rest of the scripture and it'll explain it and when I got there the brother they made their statement and things and I was called to get up I got up went up I said brothers that scripture ain't right the way you're saying it well it's there I said yeah but that ain't what it's saying I said because that would that would be incorrect if he puts her away for any reason how could she go be another man's wife you know and be okay and then I gave him the rest of the scripture where it shows that she can't if she goes to marry that man if that man dies she can't go back to her first husband that's what it says in Deuteronomy let's see I was just enough to do one thing it's called his name I said brother you are a theologian none of that he was a Greek scholar of all kinds and I said which one's right them or me he finally shook his head very fine it's on the tape so we still have and I said let it be known on that Tate that the brother said I was right why because it's the word it's not what we think about it is what God says about it if he can't keep his word straight then he's not god let's eat drink and be merry or tomorrow we die gonna be much of glorified monkeys rolling off of a tree somewhere but you see what I'm getting now yeah if God hadn't spoke to me that day I would have been just like everybody else sitting in that building I wouldn't know this answer but once he spoke it to me I had no fear of who I was facing the man told me later he said I can tear you apart with a word I said you're right never bothered me for him to say it but he never did attempt because I made the challenge you get three months to explain marriage and divorce we'll meet you anywhere in the United States but I said I want one meeting to speak on marriage and divorce we never had another meeting after them see when you know where you're right by Revelation you have no worries about what anybody said now let me ask you a simple question here has been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ yeah you know the biggest fortune in the building is any way I could talk you out of that and go back to father son the Holy Ghost why just because you went and done it no it was revealed to you it's about to have three no that don't work does it can anybody talk you out of a revelation if they can't it's not around that's sensible yes man asked me one time my last brother brother is there any question we can ask you you should change your mind I said no no question you can ask me to get me to change my mind I suppose it's revealed Hilton a revelation is the only thing that can make that old husband die I hope you get what I'm saying the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you right and that is the word alive that's why he dies the alive word can eradicate would you agree the live word the reveal word can eradicate yes you know do away until there is nothing left even whatsoever the revealed word put a random on Christ the mystery he said is this great Revelation been revealed to you a three-fold revelation he said when all God was he poured into Christ all Christ into church and take her back to the Garden of Eden he said has it been revealed to you is there any way that they can deprogram you are you worried about being captured one day and DMD program you then you ain't programmed there's no way to take a revelation out of a person's heart Martin Luther when it comes down to it you know they said Luther said the world would be against you he said let the world know I'm against being oh he put his life on the line what about those six of those in the millions that were killed down through time you talk about Jews I'm talking about Christians that were killed folks in the book of Martyrs that they would offer them to recant or either throw them into a lion's den and they just walked right into the lion's den yeah we can't even make it to church don't worry about the lines then right now come on Lee the revealed word ye shall know the truth it doesn't say you shall know about it knowing about this message doesn't set you free it really scares you to death and binds you because you're scared to go that way and you're scared to go that way how many remembers it come on but they'll walk out of the Baptist Church I knew I had to keep going that way or he do go back in there and cry and beg them to forgive me I had my choice did you see Church there's a time we've got to make a stand that old husband can't be dead if the word can't be revealed to you and I because it takes a reveal word to kill it now get just a minute and then your question see then when brother Branham explains one God then we don't care what the theologians say right it doesn't matter about all of their things if you notice isn't it odd that the world now the world they don't attack what brother Branham taught oh yeah they said we don't believe it you know we've been they know what he taught at least come out of the word of God but the people of the message that claims to be them to be a prophet is the ones that attacks what he taught isn't that odd that the world would think more of the man and praise him more than the people of the message that's all I didn't but see the reveal word is the only thing that can kill that old husband you understand what I'm saying so when the prophet taught one God that killed that old husband of the trinity are you listening you know no problem with you when the reveal word said hell is not eternal we don't worry about the theologians and what to say do we when the prophet through the reveal word would say that oh mother of Revelation 17 is the Catholic Church and the Harlot daughters are the Protestants do we have any trouble with that no because we believe it what has brought you to where you are today the old word and does it come because of who we are or what we're doing is it sovereign he said Revelation is Sovereign God give it to who he wants to so then only the reveal word considers free now you see why that I've been the way that I've been I've never just left you alone as to little six and seven sermons you know being good going to church and believe the prophet I've tried to hold before you the word of God and preach to you when I could see as I brought as I you know studied it and then stood to this church stands at the bases that there's never been a Doctrine came in that broke it up some have left because he didn't believe right that's that's fine but never a Doctrine at least you come in like it is in these other churches and just split them wide open why because we tried to stay with the truth when believing that we needed to understand one true and living God I tried my best to preach here 40 something years when I believed it we needed to understand Daniel 70 weeks even though I went contrary to 99 of the ministers the message and still contrary to them I still stand for it and still believe it even though we were told to stay out of the seals and the things you know by the people in their early Parks when they came into the message I've proceeded to try to study that and preach to you what I could see what the prophet had to say I've tried to hold before you an opportunity for it to be revealed you say are you exalting yourself that's no problem nobody got no concern about what's going on I'm just saying that I've tried you know what every other preacher every other Pulpit around the world today I tried right they got polygamies right but yet they tried is that right you ever heard a preacher say he didn't try you ever heard a preacher say he's wrong come on you ain't been around very long if you think you have but I thought the Bible said You shall know the truth well if we haven't had an opportunity to hear the truth how can you know where it's truth or not if we haven't studied the things that the prophet brought unto us which I thought that was supposed to be what we read this morning that the Holy Ghost would be loosed by the end time message see it's the end time message then it's preached the Holy Ghost is being loose how do you get the verchers well I need patience well we're just getting to some kind of tribulation we'll figure it out no no reveal word is the only way those virtues can come into the individual see that way we can stay away from organized religion and we can buy it and try to believe that we're part around the world because I believe it I believe around the world there is a bride of Christ that is striving to understand the end time message and preachers that are preaching it to the best that they understand I just want to be a part of that organism and see that away then we can say the truth has set us free either hath the son at life is that scripture what about it I'm about to comments questions now who's got any this flick is known him okay get a microphone can I quote the rest of that scripture hang on with it silver and little John I believe it is and he said he would have some half life he who has not the son has not liked me so he says these things I've written to you that you may know that you have eternal life now we have Sands and butts about it only by the revealed work right well you know we'll have a question anybody got a question anybody got a comment surely after all the dirty sermon 29 somebody ought to have some okay Susan's got one for a friend of hers elf seriously a friend of mine asked me would my pastor rather preach to a church full of Sinners or church full of saints so I'm asking you would you rather a bridge to the spiritual centers for church full of science I answered the question for him but I want to know what your answer is no I'd rather preach the church full of sinners the original Church full of science you know what after a while we're going to be made Saints all right sin is America was based send me your orphans sometimes this church was based on them send me your messed up people right let's see what the word of God can do it's always been mine that's right then I don't compromise with anybody or tell anybody they're okay right I tell you what the word says right and it will be a church full of science one day who's next you got a friend that needs your help with a friend are these just marriage and divorce questions or any questions anything any questions any questions related into the marriage and divorce situation life all right I got a page for okay that battery's only 30 minutes we're all human sisters so don't worry about determinologies or the thoughts okay how does the sold at how does the soul die but God letting it die it dies through justification sanctification cleansing it out and that lets that old part of you die out of the way and God takes the word just like he did with the disciples it took three and a half years for them to get to New Birth they were being justified as they walked with the Lord forgiven they come in Saint John 17 until they become sanctified but they still did not have the new birth until the the day of Pentecost so that died out by just want to say it the word is what tells you you're lost right the word is what sanctifies you and the Bible says about those disciples that in one account it says they took the word and held it all right Jesus was seen of over 500 Brethren after the resurrection they called from that but only 120 might be Upper Room where's the other 380. they've even seen him after his resurrection the Bible says they never took the word in hell that's right those disciples had a wonderful position to be able to walk with him for three and a half years and question him about what he was just saying whereas the others they can only take his message or whatever they heard but it's a revealed word unless that old husband died washing of the Water by the word Paul brother Brandon said what Billy Graham had thirty thousand come back now Thirty Paul have Thirty come back and have one he said or whatever how many would say he said Paul took his convert home to the baptism of the Holy Ghost see we think well no I just got the Holy Ghost to walk up and believe that's a good old Baptist though and I hope it's right none for everybody okay number two how do you send from the cell how do you send from the soul now you're talking about you you're talking about before a Christian or after Christian okay okay all right we'll take it before because the nature of your soul is the devil so that's where you Sin from right that's where your unbelief is at is in your soul but see then once you're born again you cannot Sin from that Soul because John says the little John says seeds remaineth in you and you cannot sin but yet in this body and spirit that we are Realm we can still do wrong but it's not in the soul there is no sin in the soul of a born-again Christian okay this is the last one okay did did brother Brandon he did did he see us beyond the curtain of timing or we when he went beyond the quickness time I like to think so but I couldn't say I can only say what he said he made your statement one time he said I saw you there all right but remember he's been inhaled and been in heaven I mean I'm just a honest you ask the question I'm just honest to answer the I believe he did see the end time bride those that had already gone unnecessarily it could be you and I that he saw because when you get into the soul the theophany the new birth you're getting into very Heavenly Realms and atmospheres he saw his first wife there in a dream or Vision or something later he saw a judgment coming that media and hope both were with him one of them was alive the other ones passed on so you're dealing in religious I mean in very high spiritual realms I really can't answer that I just say I hope so okay all right behind you just turn it back with the last one I spoke with the last one whether he saw us there I'd be considerate the way when he went beyond the curtain of time he saw his body laying on the bed I don't know what kind of order you hit it but he was on the other side now how does a soul die I I liked how you towards the end of the service today you said you see one thing say one thing is revealed to you and you won't believe like say baptism in Jesus name when you that's revealed to you you will not see father son Holy Ghost again that kind of dies dies and I think the soul guys by being born again all the time you just have to keep the word has to be revealed to you you can't put a full stop you have to keep going so just continue dying and so what is revealed to you and maybe one day we'll reach affection somewhere changes Maybe you see we are the scripture says he ain't born again that's the statue of perfect man you burst into this verse into this it's the prophet's word all right in doing it see then the new birth there's one New Birth but there's many feelings of the holy spirit that were filled in the book of Acts many times through many feelings but there was one New Birth but then in the growth development there's many you know you're birthed into this you're birthed into this you burnt into this you're not getting all new births you're just being birthings are coming forth into so you're coming forth into another stage of development you know and see once that soul is eternal Satan can't dwell there it's you and God it's not you and the devil and God it's you and God together the prophet said it's persons all right so then there's no way Satan can get back into that soul so then if a Christian does wrong it's body and spirit that's right that's sensible body and spirit does wrong run around them do you sin he said every day now did Brother Branham have the big letter word sin that meant unbelief I don't think so I think he's believing but see there is a word of sin that is not to say unbelief it is a word of sin has to be as we gave it this morning brother Brown had it on there he said talk about your sins you know in fact and then he said you know you're bound by your Creed sometimes the Creeds we have is the worst sin we could ever have believing there is no God that's just believing it but to try to straighten out that God are to bring him down to human things and get into a lot of unbelief anybody else sister Trudy thinking on base the questions on the soul dying I'm taught what I would they ask like to ask a question about is the death of the soul that second death do you have you ever thought about that how that would happen how it will happen then it's the second death yes God will have to let it be annihilated because that is the difference that's what the scripture says you know the second death and he says it's the death of the Soul all right just because a sinner dies doesn't mean his soul is destroyed it's no more than you he has a place to go to that's right he has a body to live in you know when the prophet will call it a theophany because it's a body a position a place to go to remain until the Judgment day will come but then death and hell is both cast into the Lake of Fire the Bible says that is the second death so when you get death and hell and everything combined together throw it into a lake of fire to be burned up completely and it's all annihilated that is the death of the soul of that individual because only God can kill a soul the Bible says don't worry about you that can destroy the flesh but to worry about he that can destroy the body and spirit right soul and spiritually but you know both of them in hell because that's we don't believe in eternal hell you'd have to have eternal life to live there we believe hell then we'll finally be a knowledge and death and Hell one day will be cashed into the Lake of Fire and that person as the soul will be totally annihilated because that would have to be spiritual then because no fire can burn up the soul of an individual right so it would have to be a spiritual condition that God would have to finally annihilate that dying in the flesh let me go back over there now I said you kind of wonder whether that would feel dying and the soul is that it's kind of a morbid thought it's a dining place would be horrible for a sinner but what about you know that's why I love the way brother random would explain things he said hell's not burning he said a burning hell would be a pleasure how about that he said there's an endless falling because you see hell has no Foundation to it would be an endless falling remember the first sermon he preached there was no mama in hell there was no Daddy in hell there was no God in hell you know that I'd like to hear that sermon because he had a lot of Truth to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord right that scripture but what about a sinner he's absent from the body he can't be present with the Lord be a horrible time it wouldn't be nobody there that could take your place anything else anybody up anybody else got a comment or call her I got one more question one more question okay we can always depend on the freedom without questions um you said several times that we can accept God but then that is true Prophet said you say you saw God he said the Bible says and it does it says no man saw God all right now when the prophet is expressing that he does not mean I don't think that you didn't try in some way to find God when it says no man sought God it doesn't mean you didn't pray cry seek God and do those things because the Bible says the goodness of God is what leadeth you to repentance so then way we done we went through life and seeking God that wasn't wrong it wasn't wrong to seek God that's the human part so it's not meaning then I don't think he's expressing that that we never sought God right we come in contact he said with a god and he said once doing that you'll never be the same why because you've been in the presence of an eternal being you'll never be the same you'll never stop seeking him all right now when it says that you must accept him because God the prophet says will not override your free moral agency he will not save you when you do not want to be saved so you accept him as your personal savior you see then he must accept you and that's what I think is wrong with the basics of the world today a lot of people comes to the Altar and they accept Jesus Christ as their Savior and themselves you see God knows what they're going to do he knows whether they're going to continue on so maybe a hundreds in the order maybe one gets truly saved well you can really say that that was the only one that God accepted right right because he got saved that's right so you can accept God every day your life will still be lost but if he accepts you see then that doesn't do away it places all of it because he can't override you free more agency right he can only is the man in prison he can only offer to pardon and when he offers you the pardon if you don't accept it it won't work but when you accept that pardon remember it's not you walking out of the jail that's right that pardon is what's going to take you out right right that's when he accepted you because if not he's going to leave you sitting in jail with a paperwork game I mean that's just the carnal comparison so then when it says no man sought God at any time that doesn't do away with your fasting and crying and praying for God to save you like I've always said about Abraham why did God choose Abraham what was any good about him what was anything right God could see the future of Abraham and he knew Abraham would believe him he could see your future see he knows whether you're honest or not if you're not honest with him you can just keep accepting all you want to but he don't have to accept you because he knows that's not God choosing one over the other that's the point of straight through that he knows whether or not we will accept him correctly he knows whether or not that accepting him is right or are we just accepting him getting out of go to you know to get out of going to hell are we just accepting him because of the the young people in the church accepted him are we just accepting him because and that's why brother random was against it of all their calls right but yet he gave them till he died but what was the form of altar call he was against coming to the altar when he called him to the altar no he said it's going out there and talking to those people and trying to get them to come to God I can say personally I witnessed that right my sister would come and talk to me in the church when all the call was there that was the greatest hinders I had because I didn't like her ways and I didn't want what she had right I don't desire for that I knew more about God than she did and I don't mean that wrong but see she was a cause of me not coming a lot of times he said but I've been letting like her talk to you now Lord led me to there's a lot of difference in leading in a good thought a good thought is we need to save everybody right let's go talk to them you need to come to the altar because your mama is going to be in heaven don't you want to be in heaven with your mama is that right away you know what the prophet had to say now this is his words I'll find it maybe paragraph paraphrase it but he said you'll make him a two-fold child of hell he said cause it to be harder to get them to alter the next time so I've told you don't scare your kids don't tell your kids go God's mad at you the kid's gonna look around and see he's been mad at you a long time right don't do it but for you to tell you not to seek God that would be the wrong thing I got in trouble in that church that time when I encouraged people to seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost the preacher said I had them based on the word I said I apologize for teaching anything in your church you don't agree with but I will never apologize for the basins of trying to get people to seek God so it's not when the prophet would say you didn't see God God sought you what do you think he was he doing he was his goodness was leading you to the altar but then if you don't accept it everything's off well that makes a conditional Covenant no it don't because a covenant's no good until you accept it come on come on it's no good until you accept the contract so it doesn't and all uh unconditional Covenant are you going to say an unconditional Covenant is he going to say who he wants to and the rest of me is going to send them to hell no will work unconditional Covenant is when he offers it to you unconditionally all you got to do is accept it right that's right that's it and you accept it and see we want it to be screaming hollering crying sneaking in tongue shouting and off but you remember the man it looked in his spot looked at her track one day and said where will you spend eternity he put the track in his pocket and he started searching for God he went everywhere went to all the Pentecostals and everything else going to brother Randleman another one said you remember when you put that in your pocket he said you mean I was saved all the time he evidently was a lot of difference all right sister Gail all right were you asking what would be your evidence that God had accepted you you got seven people along the floor and they've all accepted the Lord and you said but the Lord only accepted one what was that person's evidence that he had been accepted but the others had not been is would it be the life lived afterwards that's the only evidence you have yeah what you were asking well not really everything right now I mean when he was ministering several times he said you can accept God but brother random said he has to accept you I would you know I mean so you were saying that the other people down there even though they thought that they had accepted Christ and he hadn't accepted them that they were not sincere it would not continue on with the doing see that's scriptural okay they got it on the board okay good and then just by accepting it won't only do God's got to vindicate back that he has accepted you that's the thing you can accept him and then if he accepts you stay right there until he does except you and then when he does he seals you into the kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Spirit What's the title of the message God's provided way priests in 1953 1201 would be paragraph E9 I like them brothers back there that way ahead of me a long time I appreciate it I can make statements make him pull them up but see this God knows whether or not your sins here and I said you come to the altar because of somebody begging you to come somebody pleading you to come we'll see that won't work it's when God speaks to your heart and you come and you accept him and if he don't do if he don't let you know right then don't quit two years after coming in this message before I receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I had him to pray for me everywhere in the world everywhere I went I had him to pray for me and you see one day I had to realize he had accepted me you say well what it was a knowledge now we're going back to where we was talking about a while ago what is the new birth of Revelation seek God until you get an answer I've told you what 8 432 times I guess I'd rather go through life seeking God get it to end and find out that I had it all alone than to not seek him at all and go to the end of it and find out I don't have it no but we're we're not supposed to if I deny that's trinitarian drive if I deny the father I deny the son you ever talk to trinitarian about salvation you talked to him about one God and that's what he'll tell you if I deny the father I deny the son well we believe they're all one anymore anybody else sister okay no they asked me the other day and I didn't know how to answer it he said if Jesus Is God if Jesus Is God then why did he say don't pray to me pray to my father and I wanted to sure I tried to answer it but I think I confused you more than because you're simply say in this places you're looking at is not what you think it is it's only a body for God to inhabit it is not God it is the body for God to inhabit then one day that body was made Eternal and that's fine because it went back to being and see he was telling the ride and he said when he said it's my father in it is doing it that's true you've got to divide between the Flesh and the Sun the Flesh and the father when the Son and the father thing and and I didn't really know how to elaborate on it and without confusing him more than he was already confused and it was something that that he's been confused about for years and he wanted to kind of Bible Study last night asking and he had a family member that I had to go to the hospital so he couldn't make it so what else because I believe that Jesus was almighty God Amen amen but that body out there was a creation it had a beginning and had to be made eternal that's why he would say I and my father are one see I and my father are one because the same genes it was in my father is in me that's just natural carnal but it's true me and that's when he was standing there he said if you've seen me you've seen the father why because the father was dwelling inside that flesh not meaning if you've seen this because as I said 500 seen him raised but it didn't do 380 of them any good because he didn't know him I don't think the best answer he could get is to come to church and hear it right I mean regularly enough that he's going to be comfortable with and he's got the more he comes and the more he hears he's going to learn like we all have get in church a book jump start on page one I'll do that it's our first hundred pages serpent seat and all kind of thing that's the best book to me to introduce the message is the church age book anybody else before we go sister Trudy wait now y'all speak up a little bit in other words speak to me like he's going to speak to your husband at home when he's in the bedroom and you're in the kitchen my wife knows how to get me in a hurry she ought to Sam y'all go ahead it's something that I've always been having a problem with his is into attached free this situation I feel and I hope I'm right in it now to know that God accepts you is when you realize your true desire is to hear more there's a true interest to get to hear more word you want to keep learning you want to do it and that's the only thing I can base it on because I never get any so I'm hoping that he's accepted me because I enjoy being here I am hearing what I hear you I'd rather have it based upon what he said in the word than any manifestation as it could ever be thought of he says in years if you believe he that believeth not believes and just stops he didn't believeth in his baptized shall be saved Keep On Believing two years I saw God that's right after coming in the message a deacon at 23 years of age but yet I realized I was lost I didn't have I didn't think I was lost to be a hell-bound uh blasphemer I didn't believe that but I didn't believe I was born again because when Road around started talking about God being a person you better listen to what he's saying God is not a spirit that's what we think he's a person he's real anybody else before we go yeah we got to go into the communion I forgot to forget that I know other places I go I just swear off talking the Bible a lot of times but I found out it does me more good to do that than anything else you need to you need to talk to people that don't understand what you're talking about and I think when you do that you'll come to a greater understanding of what you're talking about well we talked about the 380 it didn't go to the upper room and of course I'm not supposed to think but my thought on them they was around for the fishes and the lows you know and then the 120 it went to the upper room when he come back down they asked Peter you know they said they were pricked in their heart and uh I believe uh I I believe this I because it happened to me if you're not pricked in your heart it ain't gonna work it ain't gonna happen right you're gonna be efficient in those but and you say well Lord how do I know I've been pricked in my heart were you just asking ask him to take you to that place yeah you're here today it's pretty good evidence that sometime or another that you've been breaking your heart right and uh if you've been pricking your heart and you've done what he told you to do uh he's he's obligated to fulfill what he promised to do in your life oh we need to find somebody else to follow right right um will that help anybody about it that's what I can hear the questions of people that people have and my desire for you is to have eternal life exactly you know my song well God bless you all right then a second before we get ready to go what is prepped in your heart you're walking up and you look at something and you realize I'm lost that's just a realization you've made a contact with an eternal being and then he can just work on that heart brother said if you can get that soul to agree with him souls in prison he said that nature will die if you just get him stand still long enough and everybody wants to shout and scream and Gloria Hallelujah I believe the new birth is the birth of the word I don't believe there's any person ever been born again in the Bible that didn't hear the word Now give me the Bible no no way because you got to hear first Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word and to be a message declared before you could be saved an opportunity had to be made on the day of Pentecost before they could be saved they had three and a half years of hearing the word took one Split Second you said when were they pricked in their heart maybe many times but maybe one of them was one thing that he took a prophet to express that right all right he said one of them said let's get up and go out we got it somebody said we don't have it my Point's always been one time you're sitting there you're scared to death that they're going to break in the door and kill you any minute it was not not the problem because they were for fear they were pulled out in Upper Room all right and a man get up and tell me said let's go we got it I'm going to look at him and say you go first it's these people you know that want all of you to line up and take a bomb and go get killed give it to him and let him go first oh it ain't gonna be that you see somebody said we don't have it right because they're still scared to death when that Holy Ghost fail every one of them in there went outside because they had something in their heart amen let's stand together we get to talk and get forget about the communion the brothers will get everything ready we go into First Corinthians 11 chapter 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also undelivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks you break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also we took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this new year as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoot the Lord's death till he come whosoever of course we're for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup or eat it eateth and drinketh unworthily eatest and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged I love this but when we are judged but it's not Cast Away we're even chastened of the Lord why that we should not be condemned with the world we're for my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation the rest was set in order when I come the Bible says they took time and They Carried for a moment let's just take a few moments and just pray one for another silently before the Lord father we just thank you for the day that we've had in the time here we ask you now as we continue on with the service that you'd be with each and every one of us forgive our sins and lead us by thy Grace goddess in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread has been made for this purpose today now we come to the time of partaking it was well and good for it to be made in all from an honest heart to make it but yet Lord if we don't partake of it then we don't have any part to do with it so now let us each one in our own self examine ourselves and let us be like the clay that would be the port of Potter's hands that we may be molded into what you would want us to be forgive our sins make us worthy to be able to take this bread and Lord sanctify the bread we know that it is not your body but it is representation of that so we ask you to just have your way now in Jesus name thank you they're bringing up these new ones to make bread and break it and we even had to the ministers to come forth and serve the communion to you and had the deacons to come and do their part because that was what we're supposed to do and you know because we want everybody ready against the day because we don't know what the day will bring but we know who holds the day and we just rest in that but see we've had a good time I've enjoyed letting these brothers you know serve the communion because I believe that's what the purpose and the things is directed for each one to be set aside to do you know in our doings and in that way we're we're not just one person we are one body in Christ father we thank you for this wine it's gone through the time of process of aging and gets better each day we know that it represents thy blood that was shed for each one of us we ask you now to sanctify the wine enter partakers that we may be all together as one in you in Jesus name come morning oh by the river I'll rest thee the evergreen tree
