========================================

Let's uh start for a minute here and uh we were on the Statue of a perfect man still art like 54 or 55 somewhere in there so I hope it's not boring you but remember you don't go up the statue of a perfect man in a day a week a month or even a year it takes time and you know what God's gracious I said we saw in there where he was long suffering give me he gives man time to repent gives man time to grow up but there's going to come a time though if you read in there there's a time that God don't do that he comes to a point he says I said all right I mean he chives along but he's he's not going he and he's long-suffering right but there is going to come an end to everything it was an end to all things all right so he's going to coming into where he's not going to be so long suffering in this virtues of the Statue of a perfect man so we've come down to brotherly kindness we've been talking about brotherly kindness really kindness is one of the hardest ones it's one of the most complex ones because you can say well you got to be so nice to your brother and then you got to look over here and see where Jesus drove the people out of the temple where brother Branham would be sweet and humbled or certain and then he would call him just like Jesus did Snakes in the Grass vipers and all those things so there's a fine line in there that you know and don't get me wrong but let's just put it this way I can't take somebody that's got this meat lowly everybody you know you see preachers they walk up and they go oh bless your heart you know it's like a condo priest I don't be that way I don't believe Peter was that way I don't believe Paul was that way I don't believe James is that way I don't believe John was that way and I sure don't believe Jesus was that way you didn't never hear him um well I told you what I do next time I go you need to slow down then if you don't think you're the one that's supposed to be Christian right what to put you there for all men go up here one day and go well you know I think Barnabas ought to be preaching this sermon today and all he got up there and he said I speak this with boldness right I speak this with assurance and uh and I you know everybody I was thinking about it last night talking about the thing about brotherly kindness I thought well you know some people think that uh you know they quote that scripture that quote the quote where brother Brown says I'd rather be wrong in my doctor and write my spirit and then write my you know Doctrine wrong in my spirit well that's okay but but if you're riding both exactly what if you're writing both Paul was writing both in there you know I mean I believe people hated Paul they killed him didn't they they hated Jesus they killed him didn't they that's right hey and that's what I was thinking I thought well Lord if if everybody loves you it's like that always said and I agree if everybody loves you and everybody is in love with you and everybody thinks you're the greatest you're a hypocrite right right and that's like these preachers in the message I you know I was looking at them the you see some that'll preach anything just to compromise so they can go get In a Pulpit somewhere right well then then most of your popular preachers are are the ones that are kind of off a little bit in their Doctrine because they can go preach the same thing hear the same thing here but you know what about Paul brother Brown brother Brown come up to the end of his ministry and this man was preaching before tens of hundreds of thousands of people and then he was in a room about the size of this with about 20 something people when he preached one of the greatest messages he ever preached and that was a token a Rapture message and a token message out in out in Arizona so you know where is it if you're popular then I kind of question what's going on in your you know in your uh that's it your ministry or in your life if you're just a popular person I I and like I told I was telling a preacher the same one that said he didn't want people to nobody believed I talked to him the thing Friday night but it's just like this you remember the great uh the great thing we did on the Daniel 70-week series you know we did that and we did it to the minute for the minister we weren't at the last ministers meeting in the last ministers meeting they got discussing it and he said well he said we went on and and decided it was three and a half years you weren't there so we decided it was three and a half years yeah I looked at brother and I said you're still wrong I don't care whether I'm there or not right you're still wrong what's that matter they're making a difference but you think well that brother don't have brotherly kindness are you talking about me well maybe everybody needs a little correction every once in a while I'm trying to get people to get out of that old thing that brother Brown was wrong here and right here and right didn't get this right but he got this right that's not true people that's a spirit right that's a spirit that I'm against so bad and the preachers of this message don't see that they don't see that and that's the problem I think brother Brandon preached sternly because the brotherly kindness he he wanted those people to change their ways and accept truth and be safe right well that's what she is around here she's right here it says we read it before my brother sinned against me shall I forgive him 70 times seven now watch him he said somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things you do and still go to assembly God one is all the rest then put zebra over the kindness hoping someday patience with him see Temperance with him but now remember brother Brown will never compromised with them right he never compromised with their doctor when he preached his Doctrine he preached his Doctrine he didn't back up one iota that's right but he was trying like sister Trudy is he was she he was trying to get them to see that something has covered their eyes and that they're in a deception there is that it wasn't and true brotherly kindness is something that we've got to have love for the brother and I have love for all those Brothers but to come to a point in time to where right right wrong wrong and in this message two people can't be right and have two different doctrines right that's what I was thinking about this morning brother Brandon didn't have 17 different doctrines he had one Doctrine and it was the truth and if we preach that truth then our Doctrine is right but it's like it's like said you know you you got two opinions either one's right and one's wrong or either both wrong but you both can't be right so you know there's the contention in the church today but I I told Brother Quinn last night we were talking about a little bit and it kind of It kind of took him back a little bit something there but I said look one word got us out of the garden being one word off is not going to get us back in that's right now brother Raymond said Daddy south that's it one word just one word got us out of the garden so being off you say well this ain't important but you know damn same ways this ain't it's all important yeah right if you don't have it all lined up I promise you one thing The Headstone will not come down on a piece of stone that's turned a different ways than the rest of them okay that's right it won't fit brother Brown will not read it today but we'll read it next week he talks about the honing but what does that do when you got a piece of something it won't fit what do you do you take a piece of sandpaper and oh man it hurts if that was your flesh you'd really hurt but that's what we're talking about this is not a stone that we're building we're building a stature a flesh so you have to take that little rubbing that little rubbing compound and you got to rub it to where that Cap's going to fit down on there because if there's a burr sticking out anybody knows even shooting guns and stuff that if there's a burr one little bird that you can't see with your with your normal life one bird is in that Barrel it can affect that bullet one bird not the whole thing just one little bird that's why you have to keep your Barrel cleaned and all that stuff that's my brother round was talking about keeping our Barrel clean you got to keep everything clean but there is a truth I don't think Paul has a true right Paul had me trip right and Paul comes up and says you'll be judged by my gospel and people hated him for it I'm sure but you know what there was a group of people that believed this gospel and went in and so there's a people that believes the prophet's message and they're going to go in not that brother Branham had a message right that's what they're saying I'm seeing in the message world that they think brother Brown just brought a message no he brought the message if you're an unadulterated and if you get out of that then that don't make me no person bigger than you but if you're wrong you're wrong like I was talking about Abram and Abraham I hope you understood that Abram was okay but Abram was not the promise Abram did we're not the we're not the Abram was not the father of our faith Abraham was the father of our faith so but we have to move through the Abram part to get to the Abraham Park all right so and it's okay to be Abram because Abram got a promise Abram was my father Abram got the things that he was supposed to get but there was a promise of a son being born not to Abram but to Abraham and not to Sarah which was a contentious woman but she moved up into being a princess and then what happened God brought the problems right same way with brotherly kindness brotherly kindness is not being a meat mild kind of Little Priest I'm sorry that's just the way I do not see brotherly kindness is that right I don't see that I believe in being bold I believe in being resolved or resilient in what you believe and if somebody can knock you off of it you didn't have it to start with right whether you're a doctor I mean whether your attitude is right or wrong Paul didn't worry about it that day when he come up and he said if an angel from heaven come and preach any other gospel besides what you heard from me let him be a curse now when can we say that that's right when can we say that you saw you're being boastful no I'm quoting scripture I'm quoting what Paul said there was a man walked on this Earth named Paul that didn't have the Revelation you have if the seals have been revealed to you they weren't revealed to Paul if you had the seals revealed to you not just that you read the books a lot of people think well the seals program brought the seals and we read the book that's right I'm not kidding you there's a lot of people say well brother Brown brought to seals and we were at the book and we got it no you ain't I can just look at you in the face and tell you no you ain't not unless you got a revelation right of what he said all right because most people take the seals as being destruction and all these things I thought it was for a Redemption right I thought it was justification sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost I thought it was for the Redemption of this body well no well most people don't have a revelation they have a revelation that like Daddy said they have a revelation that brother Randall had a revelation secondhand Revelations don't get you anywhere you know what a second-hand Revelation to do read Acts 19. that was once that was one man that had seven sons of skeva Paul we know Jesus we know but you guys we don't know because they endured that demon in the name of Paul right or in the name of Jesus then Paul preached that's right that's a second hand Revelation now what happened to the seven sons of Cuba that devil jumped on them because they didn't have nothing strong enough to counteract that in other words they should have walked up said in the name of Jesus Christ did I preach right or that I have come out of her but no that devil says hey I don't know you I know Jesus and I know Paul you I've never heard of why because it's a secondhand Revolution brother any Brian didn't he say you know they could feel alive that's right that's right problem with the problem with all of us is that we look at this and there is a balance to everything but when you come to brotherly kindness it's not a when it says brotherly kindness or brotherly love God loved those I was trying to get this right the other day so it doesn't sound so bad God loved those um Philistine children so much till he told David to go kill them all now a God that says Thou shalt not kill because somebody asked me that question I was down there was a guy um that was putting some lime out on our food plots this weekend or actually Thursday and I went down there to uh or Friday and I went down there with him and we are talking about religion a little bit and he said well now what how can God say thou shalt not kill anything commandment and then him walk up and or then him come to David come to all the kings and say wipe them all out women children animals not just the men I said well I said to me that shows the love of God and you know you kind of look people look at you like the love of God to kill them all I said yeah them little bitty babies are going to be in heaven but if they had grown up they'd have been big Philistines and they would have been against Israel same way with the amorites and all those people God was doing them a favor same thing with down through the Dark Ages God allowed that to happen sure for example but those people they gave their life for what they believed and they have a portion of Heaven waiting for her so what so what part I mean why don't we just sit here and go well well God shouldn't have done that well they're in heaven what does it matter what what is it us to go well he shouldn't have killed this one and he should have killed him God knows which ones are going which ones are not that's right and Saul got in trouble remember when Samuel told him said Saul kill everything in that City Saul took he saved kings in the lowing of the sheep and the bellowing of the cattle and Saul kept a little bit for himself he didn't do what God Said Samuel walks in now what about a prophet now this is a real nice kind brotherly kindness prophet Samuel walks in and cuts the head off of those remember he brings the kings in he said Saul you were supposed to kill them all he took Saul's sword and cut the heads off of those two candies what a nice Prophet but but you know what God told him to do that and if he didn't do it then he was that meant so much to God though that Saul remember this the Kingdom right then Samuel said Saul the kingdom will no more be yours you disobeyed God you're you're you're a spiritual man listen you're a spiritual man you're a prophet you're anointed but you will not be king anymore you will not be successful anymore now remember Saul's going to be there right right it's always going to be there buddy the kingdom was rent from Saul because what Saul didn't do what we would think would not be brotherly kindness to where you'd go out and kill the whole group of people but I explained to them to the man I said look you got to see the Providence from God I had rather like Hezekiah if today's my day I'd rather go along and be right with God than to be 15 more years and then just mess everything up and and be wrong with God so God knows the time and once he decides that that's it then we ought to say that's it oh we don't hold life and death in our hand we surely don't hold the future so God does so to see brotherly kindness deceive brotherly kindness is not the lovey-dovey attitude that most people think really kind of said when you come to brotherly kindness you shouldn't speak harsh to nobody now that's not what brother Brown said and that's not what the Bible said sure there's ways to get you know there's ways to do things but still Jesus wasn't too uh let's just put a scene here and then I'll always answer that's a question let's put a scene here Jesus walks in the temple one day it's not very popular to start with he walks in the temple one day and he hears the high priest I mean the dude the spokes to have the goods as brother Tom Fall both you say the guy the guy that you're supposed to look up to the guy that's supposed to be your mediator to God he's standing there preaching all right what's the invasion at today he's standing there preaching here come Jesus walking in sits down in the back row remember he don't sit on the front he said from the back row because God will put him on the front row so when the preacher gets finished Jesus stands up you think Church order was out but he stands up and he says you Generation of Vipers you bunch of Snakes in the Grass Hypocrites he called them I mean he goes through a dissertation one time and he goes hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite in the Bible so does that your brotherly kindness yeah she was brotherly kind correct that's correction of Brotherly kindness all right and if we don't take it we're bastard children anyway so he's he knew they were of their father now what about somebody standing up now he they knew what he was talking about he said my father and your father is not the same person and being spiritual they knew what he was talking about that's what made him mad because he said in other words if I'm with the son of God and my daddy ain't the same as yours it don't take a lot of you don't have to draw a picture on a wall to uh to get that point across but that's what Jesus said he said my dad is not your day yeah now buddy that hurt if somebody walks in and told the preacher in a message said look your daddy and my daddy that's your brother no question I was just gonna say brother said what happened to the Jews the Holocaust with the defender mercies that Jehovah sure absolutely we know what it done those people listen to me those people were not saved they were Jews there's no salvation in that at all but because God blinded the eyes of their ancestors right right God blinded the eyes of their ancestors so that the Gentiles could come in he said that's why that you know you look at the in the seals there's the fifth seal right there that's an example there's your fifth cell Jew that Jew never what they don't even think Jesus Christ was the son of God I think I just think it was just a good person right right good profit or something deny he was the son of God but yet those people because they said we are Jews we are God's people God's gonna give him eternal life there's your field Shield you there's your white rose right given to them who to avenge our blood brother Ryan said that can't be a born-again believer because we don't cry out for Avengers we cry out for Mercy for the person right so that's where the mystery in that fifth seal is is Grace look at the grace of that fifth seal that's the best great the biggest to me that's the best showing of Grace there is to take a person who don't even care about God really because they said Jesus is not God they're waiting on the Messiah to come and God's going to give me eternal life for their stand of them being Jews and God having the respect for that because remember when they said let his blood be on us and our children well there's your children standing there when they were standing in front of Jesus and and the pilot said I don't find no fault for this man and the Jews cried out let his blood be on us and our children well they were prophesying that that's going to happen and look what happened to the Jews from them forward man it's just been a dispersed group of people they've been shot out they've been people from been trying to kill them for thousands of years but they're not going to because they were the original bride of Christ they were the original right they were the original they were God's children they haven't left from being God's children because once you're going to college you can't be can't do away with it right but they were blinded by God so that me and you could come in well in blinding them God give Grace to that group of people the Holocaust used the six and a half Millions Jews that were killed now I don't know that all of them but the greater portion of them will be so that's your fifth sealed Jew how long how long to avenge our blood what's he doing they're crying from the that Dimension they're crying out to the ones that are alive now to abandon the blood of those people well see that's not that's not a Christian so brother around near right then that wasn't the critical seat he is calling Christian but it's not Christians under the altar crying how long to avenge our blood that's your fifth sealed Jew because remember that Jew is still wanting something to avenge something you know how long how long good beans our blood well he's waiting on they're waiting on us to get out of here so that the 144 000 they're representative here can be killed as they were reading scripture be killed as they were and then they all going to rapture okay and then official Jew is going to come back here in the Millennium and and what a great thing I've always said then they don't know anything about salvation but boy they're going to get up they're going to get an absolute teaching for a thousand years from a group of people that did get salvation you're gonna be able to walk them in that Temple and say look this first court was justification yeah because see they know about the they know about all that they know about justifications they don't know about justification but they know about the outer Court the inner Court the holy holies because remember Jews and Jews they're waiting for God to come into that holy of holies in that physical Temple and show themselves that's why they're waiting for the Messiah to come right but once we get to Glory and their mind is opened up you know not from all the hatred I mean from I get all the hatred out of the way and then us to go into Millennium and the Jews build the temple and then we're able to sit there and say look this is the real Temple that he was talking about we made it because of that blood of that man that you said let his blood be on us and our children we made it and God blinded your eyes so that you couldn't see me I mean you can't see Jesus and then now Jesus came and got us and now we're turning around telling you about him so that's what we're going to do for a thousand years we're not going to sit around and do nothing no I'm praying Lord okay we're not gonna sit around and do anything we're going to say we're going to talk and we're gonna talk about these people but let's get back to brother Connor so brother the kindness watch now he goes through about a doctrine of the of the pyramids which we won't read that it's about the dollar bill I'm about to serpent on a pole and then remember the pyramid the pyramid doesn't have a top on it the real pyramid is is stopped right here right overseas but the pyramid's not there's not a cap or a cop on it okay because he was rejected because remember the Cornerstone to take this Cornerstone it fits right here anybody see that you take the Cornerstone right here the Cornerstone fits just like that in an angle well that's just a little bitty pyramid yeah top up here okay so there's the Cornerstone so the corner has now been made the head but he had to start down here at fade corner and face what's going to put it up here okay and this and this is a little pyramid in itself right this is the full pyramid but this is a pyramid in itself because everything culminates right here everybody see that you got it yeah but you understand about that you see right here it'll probably see or not but this Cornerstone this Cornerstone when they built it it's corn it's a corner and what does it look just like okay right there the foundation of Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone right because he wants to grow up in you Jesus is all this he don't need these he is that we're the ones that need it right he is all this he doesn't need to he doesn't need the Cornerstone because he is the Cornerstone he don't need the headstone cause that's what he is but you and I need to start a faith down here at the foundation because remember this pyramid is not a three-sided pyramid it's a four-sided pyramid so that Pyramid has four sides not three yeah four sides so you got a corner over here corner over here corner here and corner here every one of those stones you can take them out and put them in the other corner and they'll fit isn't it wonderful they all fit and the and the Cornerstone becomes the head because you can't if you're down here and you don't have the foundation there's no way you can build this there's no way you can put that down on top of that you ever got that kind of good when you when you listen get a little teaching it helps you when you well when you say cheese Cornerstone everybody goes what's he talking about well right there there's your Chief Cornerstone right there that corner that pyramid right there becomes this whole thing yep all right so the Cornerstone is I mean the bottom Cornerstone always start his face so faith is a revelation that's right revelation of the word God and God is that Divine love so that all is kind of like well it all comes from here that's why I told you I don't like those lines but those lines are for reference points everybody understand that those lines going this way are for reference points because you don't get you would think that would be like a tank and you fill it up to Virtue and then well that's all you get and you can't get it because of the lines there no no I wish it was done away with and they were just like Freda said I just wish they were kind of words all in here godliness has to start down here and go all the way up but there is a time where brother Branham now somewhere I had it in here where he said Peter gave us the way the road so it's a road map so it's a road map to know that when you got virtue the next thing you need to work on is knowledge okay not just that I'm going to get all the virtue I need and then like I said my Tank's full of virtue and then I'm gonna switch over to my tank of knowledge and fill it up no it just it's all like I said this this Cornerstone is the head so it just fills every bit of this up listen when God birthed you into the body he gave you divine love the new birth is the Divine love of God it's the very soul of God you got that so when you get the new bird you get Divine love but you only get it in a very small portion in other words listen you don't know how to handle it and I got to get out of here because I got to hook up a plan up you don't know how to handle God listen we're babies babies don't know how to handle mature things right right but we are a son and daughter have died right now here with Divine love which is Jesus Christ but we have it in a baby form then we have to say Okay God help me with virtue help me with knowledge help me with temperatures help me patience okay all right we didn't get any word today I'm sorry but maybe we did help a little bit and um next let's see uh we're going to be gone the 31st so 31st of August you got it Day weekend if not you need to talk a crime or else no okay we'll figure it out okay all right Lord bless you
