========================================

record okay put it right down here okay now there okay so what we're talking about uh wednesday night was that the three processes of grace is justification sanctification and the baptism of holy ghost now if you don't know those three stages by now you're way behind because that's really the foundation and really if you're born again i want to make this strong if you're born again you know that you went through those three stages if you don't know that you went through those three stages you're in one of those three stages somewhere if you're a christian at all all right uh i think we all can uh can relate to justification because you ask god to forgive your sins god does that all the time he forgives millions of people their sins they you know he's just if you believe in the lord jesus christ you'd be saved saved is not the same things filled with the holy ghost that's why they get confused where brother brown says the holy ghost and the new birth is two different things or the or the getting saved in heaven the holy ghost is two different things and it really is because you can be saved and not be bright never understand that you can be saved god will be just to forgive you of your past sins and if you pass away right then or anytime during that justification process you will be given eternal life but you got to go stand at the white throne judgment and do as it says in revelation 22 you're gonna have to be judged by your works and remember what the bible says about our works they're filthy rags so if there's any account against you you're gonna have to give an account for it right then all right actual white throne judgment you will not be a judge you will be judged because the judgment when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost your judgment goes on jesus christ when you when you get the holy ghost your judgment goes to jesus christ and he's already stood your judgment so you don't have to be judged anymore he's already went to hell took you down there with him so you don't have to go to hell anymore he's paid the price that's why i said the the new birth is one of the most ill-taught things and brother brown said i don't see that we're getting them to the new birth in other words we're just getting them to church because number one if you got the new birth you'll not turn the word down you'll do what the word says that's right okay uh above all cost you'll do what the word says okay whether it hurts your family members or whether it hurts you or whether it hurts your wife or your children or whoever jesus said for sake father mother sister brother follow me and that's the way we have to be uh you know if you see all these people that are moving away from the message the holy ghost can't move away from the message now look you can get you can be and it's like dad and i were talking the other day you can be you can be deceived because satan still works in your memories and conservation imagination so he's down there playing in that realm and you can be deceived but you won't stay in deception once a truth has been shown you see let's just take for example a preacher up in tennessee or whatever and he's preaching the word he's got it off a little bit but that's all he knows he hasn't heard it but he his interpretation of what brother brown said was wrong let's just say on a seed doctrine or whatever on two souls and if he continues on that he can have the holy ghost but he's gonna have to die yes okay he can't take the body change with error but now once that man has been exposed to the truth and explain the truth there's the difference if he rejects the truth he never had the holy ghost to start with it's pretty simple because brother man said word rejecters go to hell so that's just pretty plain if you reject the word that's given to you you reject that word then you're a word rejecter and an unbeliever and you go to hell but you can have a false doctrine but have the holy ghost now look let me let me give you a prime example f f bosworth was brother branham's right-hand man he was the old oak tree he was a faith believer he was a trinitarian he never really accepted the message that brother brown preached as far as the message of the hour for this day but he had the holy ghost say that's why i can say that billy graham has the holy ghost he has the holy ghost for his time and for his way he was a prophet i mean he's he's spoken of in the bible to go down to sodom to blind the sodomizer all right but he didn't progress on because it's like martin luther same thing with martin luther martin luther had to just show him by faith god quickened that just y'all lived by faith and that's where he was born again okay but now in this born-again experience here it's a little bit different than here but it is the same holy ghost right okay and it's like we were talking about using the example wednesday night of one cup now let's continue on with that cup and you'll see what this is talking about brown said god picks the glass up one glass right it's dirty okay now what god what's god going to do he's going to use this for a purpose that's why he picked it up all right so he's going to use it because he knows it's going to be a good glass all right he's the only one that knows it you don't he knows it's going to be a good glass so he takes this glass this dirty on outside and inside he cleans it out on the inside your brother don't talk about the inside all right he cleans it out washes it up a little bit cleans it out really good on the inside that's justification he picks it up but the cup's still dirty he's going to put it in use he picks it up but the cup's still dirty right that's justification all right sanctification he goes in there and cleans out the inside of the cup right cleans it out it's it's not in service it's set aside for service right but now still you can have fingerprints and all kind of stuff on the outside but when he fills it with water of the word there's the holy ghost now this these to me these are a culmination in this but these start washing the outside of the cup when you were talking to me on the phone daddy was telling me that that's why i was carrying on two conversations with him tonight i was listening to you and listening to him but it's true the cup is then washed on the outside sure that comes from the inside but where does it manifest outside manifest the out on the outside it manifests on the outside so that's what this is this is cleaning up the whole cup outside bottom rim the whole thing that's what the statue of a perfect man is then you have a perfect cup because remember it got marred down here and somebody throwed it in a satan you know throw it in the in the mud hole well god's cleaning it out because he's going to start from the inside out but the stack of the perfect man cleans the outside of the cup up cleans all the fingerprints and the smudge and the stuff and what it's been sitting in and all that that's what this is and that's what this comes to do it comes to wash all this out because remember brother brown says right in here right in here you see i got in between in between all these works now these are the words here these little waves come so he's got waves so what's this doing it's up here the whole time doing the washing remember the man poured the water in the top you know this wasn't on it on the sister shepard's dream that's what the headstone wasn't on it it was a flat top like a box he said man was pouring water in the box the stuff was coming out and running down the side so that's what this holy ghost does this one right here puts you in service and to make you a son and daughter of god this puts you more in service for adoption okay this is the spirit of adoption this you receive adoption not crying daddy daddy but here you him coming on up here okay so that's what this does if this don't finish the work sure you're born again sure your son and daughter are god but like i was saying wednesday night you're a spirit babe you really don't know your position you really don't know your place you don't know you don't know if you can you know god knows whether you can handle things or not right but he's got to let you know whether you can or not okay because he knows all things and you don't so we have to go through a journey him knowing who's going to get here and who's not but he put provisions in all these places uh you can call them bus stops you know you can you can bus stop at faith or bus stop and virtue and you can stop and get off that's right or you can get back on and he'll take you to knowledge temperance you understand so you have the choice still your fremont agency goes all the way to the day you draw your last breath you're a free mortal agent right yes and i love that you know why because that's why god gave you a soul so you could choose that's what we talk about wednesday night god gave you a soul so you could choose and that soul is faith or doubt not faith and doubt what god's trying to do is he's trying to work on the inside man first he knows if he can get the control tower clean then it'll start working its way out to the outside all right all right look right in here right in here you see i got in between these works here these little waves come what is it the holy ghost coming down through christ see holy spirit christ coming down the holy spirit is above all this welding this together remember you got to have two things which is you and god to weld you got you can't weld one item right you got to have two items to weld all right so it's you and god together as persons working this thing out but you know what he is he's the he's the gentleman he's the one that stands over here and you're the one that controls you say no no the holy ghost yeah the holy ghost is controlled but he's timid and a gentleman that's what the prophet of god said i love the way he explained that he's a gentleman in other words he doesn't say i'm going through that door he says no if you want me to go in that door i'll go in the door if you don't i'll stand out here and i'll give you all the blessings that i can give you in this room but if you don't let me in that room i'm not going to force my way in okay and that you know why there goes back to your free choice that goes back to your free moral agency to accept or to reject the holy spirit above all this welding this together building on what a perfect church for the capstone to cap it off you can't have imperfection down through here and have this come on top of that all right then we know that it's been manifested down through seven church ages seven messengers we read that last week let's skip on through it talks about remembering the bride tree that would be a good one for everybody to read or redo or listen to over again would be restoration of the bride tree how god restores and the way god is expecting us paragraph 340 as individual to grow say you can't depend on brother dale to make you grow know you can listen and be available for the word to help you grow but you're going to have to do the one to grow in yourself that's why we have provisions in the word remember brother dale talks about the promises we got promises god said if you'll do this i'll do this if you'll do this i'll do this all right you pay your tithes i'll pour out the win to the heaven you come to church you'll receive a blessing you don't come to church you won't get a blessing you don't pay your time you won't get a blessing you see it so it's just really it's not rocket science it's really not if the most illiterate person you're a little an illiterate person can't put together numbers and and and can't even read somebody have to read it for him that's an illiterate person brother brown said an illiterate person could receive the holy ghost that goes to the believing of the intelligence inside here okay you got enough human intelligence whether that man can read or not he can speak and he can see and he can hear and if he hears the word of god god quickens that to his heart being as simple even as he is god is still giving the holy ghost but you know what god will do then the bible says i'll lead you and guide you into all truth so he'll take somebody illiterate and he'll either do like you know brother gilfordie was illiterate you heard his testimony brother george he said i opened that bible up when i was about 17 years old you dropped out of school and real tough testimony but you know god brought him through all that look at him now but he said god he said if you save me and you want me to read this thing you're going to teach me how to read he said god came down just like a teacher in his brain and taught him those words he never went nowhere to learn how to read god taught that man i read he heard the words when it was being spoken when he was reading when he was looking at the word that word's hand and the way god and god was teaching him because you know he had to work for him he had to be able to read the bible and i think he reads it very well now so so god you know but see god saw the desire of his heart he when god changed his when god changed his heart to a different direction he said well i can use that man to get to some of these people that maybe i can't get to all right he can relate to him so that's what god done so if an illiterate person can receive the holy ghost and it's not rocket scientist and it's not a it is a mystery in the bible it is a mystery hidden from the wise and prudent but revealed unto babes yes such as we'll learn see there's the there's the uh fremont agency park such as we'll learn if you don't want to learn god's not going to teach you that's right but if you want to learn do what the bible says god will be he's just to teach you these things and in paragraph 341 these fellows wasn't required what these fellows are somebody each one wasn't required they were required for their age period 3 42 when a man possesses these kind of things then the holy ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak to tongues you might impersonate any gift that god has got you might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of faith but when these virtues go in and you add that to that then you are a living monument you're living moving idle but these talk about the heathen they prostrate themselves to an imaginary god they prostrate themselves before an idol imaginary god and in an imaginary way they believe that that imaginary god speaks back to them see all that imaginary that's hedonism that's romanism they bow before all kind of saints and everything else and they have saints cecilia a houseguard and so many different things like that they battle that and actually believe that in an imaginary way what a type of it is of the true living god but when we not in an imaginary way but prostrate ourself before a living god a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience living godliness living power coming from a living god makes a living man a living image in the stature of god what's he doing the same things that jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not imaginary things there's a reality that proves it and that's your walk see what i mean how these virtues these building materials type in with the church messengers with the church ages now one of these days gonna take jesus words and study them out so that proved it i think he left that for us to do that is the house of god that is the house that god dwells in not a building with a big bale and a high steeple but a body has now prepared me a body that god can dwell in walk in see in talk in work in amen living instrumentality of god god walking on two feet in you glory the footsteps of the righteous the lord of god god walking in you for your written epistles read of all men and if the life that's in christ be in you you'll bear the life that christ bore amen i mean we've come to this spot that i don't want to move away from it until we know that where we are in our walk right because god listen if we're wondering about these things god can't seal it in that's right he's got to take a solid piece and weld it to a solid piece that's right not not a not us him he is he is you know super steel right he is uh harder than anything all right so now here you come up with a little with some clay or some mud okay is that gonna weld no no here you come out with some brass baby no not going well you got to come up with that same super steel that he's got that's right the two wells have got to be the same kind of material so what does he do he puts that material in you after you burp yes then you work on it working on the building right working on the building then when you get up to here it's iron and iron or steel and steel or whatever you want to call it it's not iron and clay iron and clay don't mix but down here we start out with clay that's what we are right but we're building a building so that god can work through not that not that you can be listen not that you can be when you come to this place right here you're not going to be popular number one that's true you're not going to be some great person that the world is going to put you on a pedestal no they didn't put jesus on one did they no okay so we got to go back to the characteristics of jesus right now jesus was accused of being around sinners and prostitutes and you know some people of a little shady character but he was there to seek and save those that were lost okay that doesn't mean for us to go down to the prostitute house or go to the gambling houses and try to win souls no no but we do need to have enough character to if somebody does have those problems can come to you and you can have enough of this bankrolled virtue enough bankrolling you know like brother brown said you you go out there to cash to check and and sufficient funds god says you don't have enough virtue you can't give it to this person but if you've got enough virtues you can give it out to the person then you know peter i think peter it didn't pump him up when he said silver and gold have i none he wasn't bragging he was honest he said man i ain't got it down to my name i can't pay for your hospital bill i can't even take you to the doctor but i got something that you need silver and gold have i none but such as i have what do you have yeah virtue he had the virtue of god not the virtue of peter the virtue of peter peter before his conversion would have said look dude sorry you know peter was just that way he said sorry man you just you just got bad luck you know but what come inside peter was compassionate just like the lord jesus with bartimaeus and all the ones that he had healed he stopped and you know jesus was actually jesus was saying the same thing because jesus didn't have a dime yes he was telling the woman at the well silver and gold how about none he was telling bartimaeus silver and gold how about none he was telling them that you know i don't have anything but what i have you know even the woman that touched him of his garment virtue went out of him but he had a virtue in him for her to reach and get a hold of him say hey if i could put touch to him of his garment i was telling him coming down the road you know that's not the only time that happened in the bible she's the first one but if you look in the book of matthew right toward the end of one of the chapters in matthew many touched to him of his garment and were made whole so she's not the only one that she was the first one recorded to touch to him of his government so she must have went and testified what i'm trying to say she went and testified she had a testimony service she said if you can just get to that man you ain't gotta talk to him you just gotta reach and get his clothes that he's wearing and you'll be made whole so you see how what it done it took her and it made her a witness so same thing with you if god heals you a certain way be a witness say hey god give me this prayer clothing he's healed me of this why don't you get one or i've got one i'll give you or let's you know let's pray right here let's do this and then the other that's what god wants us to be he wants to be some super spiritual that's right some way up where nobody can understand you and he don't want you to be where you walk around and you know kick centers off in the ditch that's not what this is you see what that says brotherly kindness godliness patience temperance all these things work in our life if we'll let it work in our life but it's not our knowledge it's god's knowledge amen all right so remember it's not something you can produce you just make yourself available by female agency you just move yourself over get yourself out of the way move yourself over and say god you know when a minister is preaching he does not have to preach the statue of a perfect man for you to gain these virtues that's right so i understand that you don't have to preach on the statue of a perfect man to get the knowledge of god no if brother dale's preaching on what he's talking about perfection now he's preaching on profession then you can gain godly knowledge god will show you all these things how to work if you'll just let him if you'll just listen not just sit there and let it be a commentary but we all gotta listen not to refute or listen and just say i don't understand say look god one word just give me one word a lot of times that's the way i get my sermon one word preacher be preaching he'll say one word that word will just and it's happened to you yes one word would just it's like a volume goes up a little bit higher you'll hear that word over all that other that you've heard you'll hear that one word predestination and boy when you do something clicks and it just it takes off but he may just be commenting on predestination he might not be preaching the sermon on predestination but what you're going to have to do is you're going to have to take and you've got to have that in there see how that and knowledge is important it's right down here close to the bottom right here in your baby journey you've got to have the knowledge of god not the knowledge of man sure sure it comes to the knowledge of man but it turns into the knowledge of god once you run it through that filter and but if you've never heard what's he gonna quicken he's not gonna quicken if you can if you've not ever heard it he can't quicken it but if you once you hear it then that key turns on and that starts the process of god i don't understand that then you need this you need some knowledge you need some holy ghost knowledge you know what you need to study a little bit bob says study to show yourself approved you study not brother dale right we we we've turned this message into almost like catholicism brother dale you do our praying you save our children now you live the life in front of them brother devil now i don't have to but you live life in front of him and you pray for him and sure we depend on brother dale for things like that because he's our pastor but go to work six days a week and you ain't even open your bible you haven't even listened to a sermon or you haven't even read you know a book or or even even just thought on something then you come in here sunday morning and you sat down and you go well i didn't get a thing out of that well you did you didn't it's because you didn't have anything you didn't put anything into it right this knowledge is not going to come remember these are overcoming that's right these are overcomings if you're going to be a christian you know if you're a if you're a um a doctor you study a long time to be a doctor right because you don't want to make mistakes you want you want to know what you're doing well same thing with the word of god i mean i may not physically ever open a message book like one week not even just not open a book but i'll sit and read quotes or i'll get a thought in my mind see that's my process because i'm trying to give it to you your process is you're trying to learn more about god because you know you don't know what brother dale's going to exactly preach on this morning right but you know the line up because he's in a line of being in other words be there for perfect even as you're probably in heaven is perfect so it's a positive attitude so you can kind of lean toward that but still you can read a book or listen to a tape and something will quicken to you if you're in line with god now if you're not if you just sit and don't do anything then then how's god going to talk to you and i know we live 80 percent of our life we live in the flesh we have to worry about bills and kids and family and cars and life and you know you name it but you need to give that 20 percent at least give 20 to god he only asked for 10. really i mean 10 of your time figure that out for a week and see how long i mean that's just it's a few hours you'd have to sit down and study to get 10 percent you know what i do is that i have a question when i'm reading books or listening to textbooks i have trust i ask questions about certain issues what i do i start praying and then i know i come to the sanctuary knowing that brother they're going to assume that some of them i've had it so many times sure that uh you know you get to talk to brother tell everybody right but you so many times right once you read and you have questions and concerns you take it to the holy spirit you don't know when he's gonna answer but every time any guy in my basement in new york i didn't have questions and sure the answers come okay and you just said oh my god yeah brother dale we are such a blessed congregation we have a shepherd like brother dale can i answer questions without you even answering and earlier three weeks ago i had questionnaire experts that had a list of things right but what happened is when i got to before i uh asked a question he did all the answers oh yeah and that's what i'm saying that's how you do you don't have to worry about reading the books he because you know from experience back back in the days we have history back together when you're talking to brother dale i have it takes a long time if ever i did that he would never get anything to study no study another to do so i decided up in there i was going to start talking to the holy spirit and tell him they put the question on my heart and then give it to brother dale in the pulpit and it comes forward and that's how you don't have to uh worry about what brother dale's going to preach about something going to cover something that see to me that's what happened in the first three church ages let me let me get this point we need to go because i don't want to hold them up sing so many songs upstairs okay when you start coming up through here we we we need to lean toward god more than anything because we're babies and god like he you know you got a question in your mind you can write it down if you want to and that's okay but like you said now what if what if what if you just asked me that question i just answer it well if this is not the holy ghost working on both ends if media if it's just me answering the question you're still going to have that question but if you've got a question and god answers that question see remember i do things amiss you understand what i mean i have a plan and it changed tomorrow or i have a thought in my mind and it changed in the night in two minutes but when god brings something it don't ever change so you you know and have confidence that when he brings something to you like that that he has brought you the truth and he's brought you the answer not some answer see i can give you some answers right you understand what i'm saying i'll give you some answer to a question yes right but when god answers that and that plops down in your heart and you say well man that's the only way it could be see that that's the only answer that you could have for eternity god can't change his mind about that answer so if he get he doesn't answer a myth so when god answers your question that's why brother branham and when when that angel told him said you get the people to believe you nothing will stand in your way man what kind of confidence would that be if an angel come and told you that and said nothing will stand in front of you not even cancer so what are you scared of right i mean sure our human inability is scary but when god comes and gives you an answer or god comes and gives you something people that's eternal you got a bank on that you it doesn't matter what circumstance goes here and there all that stuff that goes here is external and it just flows out and you know what it does it just washes away we don't let's go we don't let it go y'all don't yeah right we don't let it go we make little pockets right here and we stop and say oh well maybe not no we need to let it go yeah that's right absolutely he's gonna marry a wife not a baby you're exactly
