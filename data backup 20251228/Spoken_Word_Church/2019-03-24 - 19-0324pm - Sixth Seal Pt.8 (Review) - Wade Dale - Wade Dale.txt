hours y'all we're all sleeping so we were talking about you while you were sleeping but that's okay okay so we weren't I want to thank everybody for their support mostly your prayer and the gifts that you gave the monetary gifts I I did not come back with anything so it was used to forward the gospel to one brother that if you'll remember three years ago he and we'll do this next Sunday because I'm not gonna do it this Sunday but next Sunday I'll show you his picture he's built six message churches and all he needs is nails so we just give him all kind of money for kilos of nails that's all he needed since that's what he needed to build the churches with he they didn't have a nail gun he used the one God give him okay so he's built six churches now he's trying to build his own so we're thankful for that and he's real good brother so we left them money for that but I just want to tell you that real quick but thanks again for your support appreciate your prayers like I said appreciate your your support and gifts and offerings would appreciate that revelation 6 verse 12 then we're going to review a little bit today and then go a little bit further and then let's then next Sunday Lord with an O I'll give you a report we're trying to get to get the pictures ready and get a few videos snippets some of you some of you already watched some of the services some of you stayed up and watch them online and they had them available and I think brother Joe is gonna put them on our website so we can you can watch those if you if you wish so revelation 6 verse 12 let's pray before we get started wait a minute April 6 Bible study April the 13th we have our I'm giving you all of April here from Saturday Saturday the sixties Bible study 13th is the Spring Fling April the 24th is Easter oh did everybody read the paper this morning Trump did something he recognized Israel when they took over the Golan Heights back in the 67 war there was a few presidents that agreed that Israel should own them but all the past few presidents especially Obama he hated Israel but he did not recognize that well Trump came out today and said we recognize as the United States of America we recognize the Golan Heights as being part of Israel and the Golan Heights is part of Israel so we just thank God that everything's moving in the right way we know we know what's gonna what's gonna happen and it's moving in the right direction that was one of the most asked questions besides Bible questions in the Philippines people asked me said what you think about Trump I said well he's the man we voted in so I guess he's the one who gonna get us out of here so you know what that's okay with me I really don't I told him I said I really don't care I really don't care but still he's in there you know and he's little pieces of thing he's president I believe does little pieces of thing that God puts them in there for Trump's real strong in the military so we've got to be a military might to be able to speak for the beast and everybody knows that that the you know the prophet of God told us United States would had to be have would be the voice are the power behind the beast so we have to be backup into into political power and into into military power so we thank God that we read the newspaper a long time ago through a prophet he told us exactly what was gonna happen so we're not surprised we know we they may not have been names put in there but that we know that the system is going to take us down it's going to go speak for the Beast the Beast is gonna come in and pay everything off and everything is gonna be really happy except for us when we were talking you know last time about persecution and that's when I believe that they're gonna tell us say hey you either believe this or you shut door you either believe this or you don't even get to go to the grocery store you know so one but you know what that's okay how in the world like brother Dale said how in the world are we going to not trust a God that stood there one day and said let there be in this all this stolen kiss came to being and we can't trust him to take care of his own kids no I trust him completely to take care of all our needs he knows the end from the beginning he knows what's gonna happen he knows it already so and he we're in this part of that that where God's opened the word so that we can see these things and see them plainly not to look to a glass darkly so we thank God for those things so let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you today Lord that you've given us already a good day Lord it was good weather and good fellowship and friendship song service and everything else Lord we pray now that you just take active participation in this part of the service Lord of it that we've come to now that without you Lord with just a meeting of minds but with you Lord we we know that one thing for sure we will make a mistake as human beings but you have never in your eternal existence that ever committed a mistake so father we lay all these things in your hands Lord that you would take care of us be with the ones that are sick we were the ones that are not with us today for whatever reason Lord just bless each one Lord is on highways traveling on vacation and different things thank you lord basically for getting brother John and sister Alicia and the children back safe Lord and ourselves we thank you for those things Lord many things could happen there's a lot of things goes on when you travel but Lord you're the one that's got it all in your hand and in your control Lord we pray that you'd just be with us now take care of us bless us in Jesus name Amen 60o part a our review and I'll beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great the rich man the chief captain than the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid himself in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains you don't thank God none of that I just read included you none of that none of that included you we're gone over in another dimension and we're not part of this but we know what's going to happen and we see what's gonna happen and that way God can show us that hey maybe we we need to work on ourselves to make sure we don't get included in this scripture here and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand well there's no one gonna be able to stand in front of all that so you may be seated in Lord adders blessing reading the word no we were talking about last Sunday or Wednesday before we left about the persecution and how we would not go through the wrath of God tribulation but this sick seal is the tribulation seal now we must see as we read the first quote today on the sixth seal the first quote says this sixth seal is the tribulation period that's what takes place the bride has gone I'm telling you I every time I read this I really rejoice in myself that I know that a prophet told me that if I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and what he said in the Bible I do not have to go to tribulation Amen because like I've said before and I want you to just ask somebody in the denominational world they'll tell you they are expecting to go through some sort of tribulation Eve whether it be three and a half years whether it be seven years but everybody is expecting to go through all that wrath that we're talking about but you know well that's one thing that God taught us through a prophet that the Bible never said that the Bible never said the bride was going through the tribulation thank God it took a profit to separate that to bring a bride into view to bring a church into view to bring foolish virgins interview and to separate them by the Word of God he separated those groups out so that we can see this one doesn't go through this this one does go through that and the reasons why because the reason why we don't go through the tribulation period is we have received Christ who's already went through the tribulation period and then he took our wrath upon him courting Isaiah 53 that he would bore our iniquity he bore all of our sin he bore everything for us so that we can see that not only during you know even in baby form justification you do see that God done a work in your life he he forgive you about your past sins what a great thing but remember you kept on sinning and you kept on doing the things that you were doing because hey girls just keep movin on up just keep doing this playing for we're good to see you with us today but we see that those things are separated though that the bride doesn't have to go through that so we can take us completely out of any equation of even it says here it says and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us that us is not us that is another group of people that's not received God there's not received what the grace or the justification the real justification the one to where the real you never did it amen we're going to try to speak on that just for a second to try to bring everybody back up to speed and thank God brother brother Bob where's my bucket he's in the back he did a good job that Wednesday night baby I'm telling you he did a good job he did a real good job on hitting on those feast days because I'm gonna hit on them a little bit today and show you how that they were separated out but and it does can go into this thick steel because remember all trumpets sound under the sixth seal and then those feast days are in that sixth seal the day of atonement the day of the Feast of Tabernacles the feast the Feast of Trumpets that all that's the Israel but you and I get the spiritual application to that alright so same thing with this sixth seal we get the spiritual application of everything that's going on in this sixth seal where we see that everything every part of nature I want you to think as we go along because what happens is we're going to suffer some part of persecution but persecution and tribulation are two different things tribulation prophet of God said was the wrath of God now that wrath of God was already poured out on Christ on the cross it was all laid on him and he took it all and when he took it he didn't just hide it he did away with it that's why the prophet of God said never forget what happened at the cross because at that cross everything that you need even we were talking about this morning in the Bible study or in a Sunday School class your body when Jesus stepped out of that tomb and said all power in heaven has been given unto me and he was changed back to a twenty year old man potentially you were changed with him potentially all 2,000 years of church age members were changed at that moment because we have to look back to that son of man to get our body change so that's where it had to come from it originates that I know if Christ came out of a tomb with a glorified body that whoever is in the grave is gonna come out of the tomb with a glorified body and then we which are alive and remain to be changed in a moment in twenty number nine amen all right so this six seal then those separate to me it separates everything out and we were talking last time I spoke against that this was in a three-fold manner we'll get into that in just a second because thank God that brother Branham was so gracious that God brought him to me and you to bring these things and like I said it's that the the word separated everything out where he could put the pieces together and he could make where to me it's a plain picture it's a plain picture everybody thinks the seals and all these things are so deep and so mysterious it's the plan of redemption it's how you got from zero to a hero a man that's just the plan of redemption it's not some I mean it's all in the Bible there's not a different Bible we got to read brother Brown it bring us another Bible to have to read it's same Bible the same Bible that everybody reads we read it but we read it with the eyes of understanding that God has brought us in this endtime me and you us that's us we're the ones were the recipients of this alright so now let's read finish this quote that's what takes place the Brian has gone there's no living creature nothing there to say it in other words the Holy Ghost has left the building the Holy Ghost has left the earth it's only in two prophets then 144,000 over there and Israel it's not all around worldwide we're already gone all everybody around the world the Brian's already left the earth we're there's no Holy Ghost left they said what goes to those Jews over into Israel they're by all right with that God is not dealing with the church no more it's been it's been gone he's dealing with Israel this is the other side this is when Israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two prophets and we know they come in during this time of the Tribulation Period remember Israel is a nation God's servant nation and when Israel is brought in it'll be a national affair Israel the kingdom ages where David the son of David sits on a throne so Israel has to have their that's why I was so when I was reading that this morning I was rejoicing that they're getting their land back even Palestine Palestine is theirs but Palestine has kind of separated their self off but one day all that's got to come together because that's the Land of Israel they've got to be in their homeland to be able to receive the message alright so we see that they're getting bits and pieces back no I don't we that they came back mama they came back in the wind brother Brown tells 50s and 60s they started flying back in saying that this is our land but they only have a little bitty spot because by that time this one had to own this one and this one it tried to own this one the Palestinians own this over just a little bitty piece that's why the six-day war in 1967 was so important where they started getting some of their land back that was theirs because all the other nations had squeezed down trying to scale listen they want Israel gone the whole world basically wants Israel completely wiped off the map and they think that'll solved their problem we know that's for sure it will not solve their problem it'll just make it worse all right so let's number two here quote we'll get through this review a little bit and then we'll make some comments at the end try not to hold you too much today y'all be proud of me I didn't I don't think I preached over an hour and ten minutes over there in the Philippines so it can be done for we know that okay where we know that the sixth seal is the judgement seal I was telling him downstairs I bet you when I was over there I didn't read four quotes the whole time I was over in the Philippines no I think I read four quotes the rest was Bible and I would quote what brother Brown said but the people or the people are picking up the people are understanding more now that it's not just quotes cuz they're fighting they're they're fighting I'll tell you something next Sunday they're fighting Fox doctrine just like we are the only problem with it I told them I said I apologized as an American because all you two sold to Lord's seven thunders 14 sales all come from America it all originated over here this great country that we've got all the prophets message and we've got all this ready available information that has got into the minds of a lot of message preachers and they've took it over there and and and of course they're fighting it because they have the Holy Ghost like we did they have the Holy Ghost just like we do in there they're doing a real good job of it I was really impressed with a lot of them in their reception of the words so it was really wonderful but we know that this sixth seal is the judgment seal it is the judgment seal exactly what it is now see we've had the Antichrist right seeing the church go now it's finished goes up then we see the martyrs of them Jews back there under the altar now here's the breaking fourth of the judgment upon the people we're out of this tribulation judgment will come forth 144,000 redeem Jews I'll prove it to you they're Jews and we know they are they have nothing to do with the bride and not a thing see there was I caught her brother royal for a few minutes they was also something going on in Philippines that had come from the United States that somebody from the United States was gonna go be one of them two prophets and they were gonna try to go over there and be you know take the message to the I said no brother said it was to Jews so it's to Jews weird listen weird dogs to Israel I don't carefully they shake hands with Trump Netanyahu's going he's a Gentile we'll just smile and shake his hand cuz he's a dog cuz we're just all dogs according to his rule we're just we're all Gentiles you know which is fine with me that's okay because remember Gentile lady looked up at the Lord one day and said Lord cannot this dog have crumbs from the master's table so I believe we got the crumbs from the master's table and we're able to to feast on that so if this is just crumbs just way too what's going on when we get over there if this is just crumbs oh my what a feast Amen they want nothing to do with the bride not a thing you see that they have nothing to do with the bride not a thing so the bride has nothing to do with Israel Israel has nothing to do with the bride when you when you go into this context the sixth seal separates and shows that we don't go to Israel and I don't know that you can say you can sit here and debate all day whether whether the two prophets take the seal book over to the Israel or taste the church age book to Israel but they will preach the message of the hour and they won't have to say brother Branham said My heavens they're two prophets they're self they're moses and elijah the spirit of moses and elijah so it's not going to be that they're gonna be over there quote quote israel's not going to take quotes they're gonna want to see something live something alive in those two prophets amen so we just don't need to spend a lot of time on whether they were this or that or the other because we're gonna be gone we're gonna be enjoying a wedding supper that we're going to not be in this dimension and we're not gonna worry about it but we do have to take this sick seal though and continue to go over it because see this seal if you've caught it we'll talk about it at the end this seal is a sanctification seal even though it being the tribulation what does it do it cleanses three groups of people well now the hidden mystery is is that it cleans one group of the without the three it cleans one group that I'm looking at now before any of this can ever take place amen so you and I have to go to a sick Seal purging to purge this we'll get into letting him got into that yeah we're just trying to stay on the natural seal and what that natural seal does to this earth because it does it to three different sets of people all right so we'll read it in just a second so the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word so when you read the sixth seal you must see judgment but you almost all should always see sanctification all right number three let's read this real quick get some of these and some of these quote sounds now we're into the age of the eagle the revelation to be revealed the whole thing now compare this with revelations 10 verse 1 to 7 and we'll see in here in this revelations here 10 1 through 7 in the days of the sounding of the seventh angels message was to finish up all the mysteries of God now we find out also in this that the sixth seal now being opened it was for a three-fold purpose now here was the purpose the first thing was that the sleeping virgins had to go through the tribulation for what for purification which is sanctification sanctification is what cleaned and set aside for service now remember they can't be put in service or they would be bribed you and I are justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost we justified God picks up the glass sanctification he cleans the glass the baptism the Holy Ghost he uses the glass fills it up and uses the glass we'll see that's where those foolish virgin didn't get to that point they got to the point of God picking them remember the remnant we've come back a remnant of Israel being the remnant of the same cloth that you and I are cut out of all right but they don't get the Holy Ghost the the foolish virgin doesn't the foolish virgin gets a sanctification but they have to get it through the tribulation period right here all right there buddy got that say man now here was the purpose the first thing was that the sleeping virgins had to go through the tribulation period for purification she to be purse of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in Revelation 7 between 6th and 7th chapter that she had been purged and she had been given her robes now she's not the bride but it's the church they're pure people that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way that they were blinded by these false prophets just like I was saying a minute ago and they didn't get a chance yet they're really sincere in heart in other words they're sincere they went through justification and went through sanctification and know God knows their heart and here's their purge during this time you notice that another purging time it's for Israel when she gathers that's the second fold now let's see under the second fold what is it it's during the Tribulation Period why does he purge them during the Tribulation Period because they turned him down in AD 30 let his blood be on us and our children that's what they're having to pay for now the 144,000 is going to receive the Holy Ghost but they're gonna have to pay for all that back part that came up from let his blood be on us and our children because that's what brother Bram talks about when we were typing the other day with the six fold purpose the six fold purpose is what make an end of sin reconciliation for iniquity and all those things that was bringing doing away with Israel's past because they rejected the Messiah see we accepted the Messiah they haven't accepted this Messiah they're waiting on to accept the Messiah but they're going to do it on their Day of Atonement not on their day of Pentecost Israel has not had their Pentecostal feast yet Israel the 144,000 they've never had it before you and I had our Pentecost feast the day that we came right here not a day in the on the calendar but the day you received the Holy Ghost you began your Pentecostal feast and then and you've been in that Pentecostal feast like baubles come back for the whole seven church ages we've been in a Pentecostal feast all right and that's your first four feast and then you've got three more later on but we'll get to that in just a sec that's the second folk god purges Israel in the Tribulation Period out of the millions that will gather there there'll be a select 144,000 and they'll be purged also because remember they got to be killed they have to be killed the two prophets and 144,000 have to be killed God's purging Israel now there is a whole earth to be purged now it's brother Dale talked about the other day when either when you read the future home see he bring remember when you read that future home you're looking at the sixth seal because you're looking brother branham takes them from coming out of the Tribulation Period into the millennium into the future home all right so - that all begins with this sixth seal purging of the earth because there is a whole earth to be purged finish the reading here there will be such a thing that the moon stars and all nature will be purged you see what it is the earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium the millenniums coming up and see everything that's got any filth in it is to be purged during the sixth seal so now if the earth has to be purged and all the fields has to be purged during the sixth seal that has to happen to a group of people before any of these three can happen it's got to happen to us because the sixth seal must open to you and I in a spiritual form to show that our nature now we know our nature was changed when we received the baptism of Holy Ghost amen God interrupted our nature because that old nature that we had is dead like we were talking another day about you know the things I used to do I do them no more but the things I did when I did them I did them I did them and didn't bother me one bit there was no condemnation but now you know you you don't even hey that's what I was telling them I'll tell you this little story for just a second I won't have to tell it next Sunday I the last motel they put me up in was in the casino literally in a casino so but brother Vernon had set up all the security so he knew everybody man I thought I was they thought I was president they had to they had to FBI agent looking guys with him things sticking in their ears they escorted me out of a car they escorted me up to the up to the desk they escorted me up to the room and stood both by the doors till I put all my stuff in and then they left and then they come back picked me up and took me for supper so I guess everybody thought I was to be up here but I told them I said you know you see that and you it's just it's just it it humanly it draws you to it because you think man there's money in there and they're having fun you understand what I'm saying just humanely you look at that I told him I submitted I said if I just took one peso which is worthless in the United States one peso and put it in a machine I'd win ten minute not win ten million dollars and everybody ain't know it but now I would do that if I weren't a Christian not just because man the place was full of people that were in there playing you know so it didn't bother them what I'm saying is that old nature they were born with that they have nurtured all through their life it didn't bother them one bit to walk in and they were putting hundreds of pesos in those things pulling the machines and having all kind of fun but you know what that's what they fed on and I know you think about that you gonna boy you were in a bad situation no I thought it was pretty neat that I could stand there and have no no I didn't even want I no desire I was just saying it'd be my luck if I just win and put one little peso in you know and you'd win all this money but you know I never did I could have y'all would have never knew it I had the two security guys that they could have cleared the building for me but the desire was gone the desire of all the things that we used to do you know they're gone so that's where God started purging you from the inside out but there has to be a sixth seal purging though that comes to the outside guy and we'll talk to talk about it a little bit later but the earth listen if the earth has got to be purged then you and I have got to be purged first our purging because this six sealed once you see this six seal and how that it opens you'll know that you were purged you'll know when the sixth seal opens on this earth you have been purged and you are in another dimension in a glorified body and never to have to die again or never have to have any trouble you're in a protected place so when you see these things happening know one thing's for sure you're in a place that you are totally eternal body spirit and soul are you all wait today nobody's even saying Amen I listen I just came back from Philippines I need some reaction because they sure did I guess it doesn't mean as much to you as it does to them but this whole earth is purged there'll be such a thing that the moon the stars in nature will be too peepers you see what it is the earth is renewing itself and that's what God is doing because remember the fall caused all this but the renewing is coming but listen the renewing is not coming in rocks and bricks and moons and stars it's coming to me and you that's where the rest where the restoration is coming back it's coming back inside of a group of people whether you believe it or not somebody's gonna believe it and they're gonna be changed let's go to 2nd Timothy 3 but thou has fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came into me at Antioch you see what Paul is telling you Paul's telling you he's went through a a certain kind of tribulation I mean my who has been how many times was he whipped several times at least 39 stripes minus one because 40 they say you die he's been whipped so many times his back had sores on top of stores but persecution afflictions which came into me in Antioch Iconium Lystra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution don't worry it will come of its own accord you will not have to hunt persecution it will come but the property God told us that the bride does better under persecution why because like now we're full bellies we got plenty of money we got food we got what we need God for what we need God for Matthew 13 but he that receiveth seed in stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth how many times have you seen this yet hath not yet hath he not root in himself but dureth are endure for a while you see them they come and they endure for a little while but when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word because of the word by and by is offended they they leave they leave the church or leave the message or leave whatever you want to say they come to a place that went a little bit of tribulation because listen what tribulation and persecution you and I guess supposed to draw us closer to God it will never now if you're a bride it will never take you away from God persecution and tribulation will only drive you closer to Christ it will not if it draws you away if you think oh I'm going through persecution so I'll leave the church or I'm going through persecution I'll just that's not God that's you doing that but when we tighten up our belt and we come together and say hey let's get rid of this and we maybe we've been doing a little too much of this so we've not done a lot of that or we've not prayed enough we've not read to buy no we I know we're all covered under that one we don't pray enough and we don't read her Bible enough but if we do that don't be like this person he had no root but endure it for a while but when tribulation and persecution arises because of the word by and by his offended something inside of him offends him or her and they leave well they really didn't have anything rooted and grounded to start with or they would say thank God for the persecution and thank God for the tribulation all right now not the tribulation period just tribulation that you and I have to go through Paul went through tribulation that's what he was talking about how'd you like to be strapped to a pole and take your shirt off and hit you 39 times with a whip 39 times with the whip I think you had that done two or three times in his life plus they threw things at it five times brother al said thank you where the hell you read the Bible more than I am and that's the trick I'm just being serious he knew what I was talking about they meant five times the man's back was just like hamburger meat but that was the tribulation and persecution he went through to get this gospel so that you and I can hear it so what are we doing to further that gospel we we don't have somebody whipping us oh yeah we have persecution but most of ours is spiritual persecution amen so we have to be careful with that Matthew 24:22 this is the seal for then shall be Great Tribulation such as not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh save for the elects sake those days shall be shortened and we know that they have been man have you always not realize when you get older the year a year only lasts about 20 days maybe 30 Rebekah's over there going it was just taxis in a couple of weeks ago but really I mean you see the day's shortening the days are shortening in ourselves to where we we realize that God's doing something and I believe that what I was talking to him in some of them in the over season they see an urgency more than they used to be but it's just in a few it's not an urgency in an overall crowd it's just in a few people and you see that it just pops up in a few people that the days will be shortened we know something's coming and we know as the brides what we got to do to get to that place because brother Graham told us what to do to get to this place amen so getting to that place is not so bad it's just we've been here a long time and then not like I said before you know you I love that scripture those who endure to the end shall be saved so you've got to endure to the end not enduring inquit endure to the end I want to see this thing complete I want to see this thing finished mmm it may be horrible in one way but it's the most glorious thing that ever happened on the face of the earth is that a group of people comes to a body change that there is a resurrection of the Dead Saints from 2,000 years ago two thousand years of bride coming out of the grave and then we're going into rapture what a wonderful time except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh save for the elects sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders so you can't put it all on that and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before now what is this barely barely I say unto you behold I've told you before wherefore if you shall stand and if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not now how are you gonna know that cuz you know he's here you don't have to go to the desert to find Christ he's inside of you and if you know that you know that you know you can just stand right there because your roots are grounded in God amen and you don't go to and fro and that's for travel after every wind of doctrine that comes along because look wherefore if ye shall say unto you behold his in the desert go not forth behold he's in the secret chamber believe it not for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shine it into the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be so what is the coming son of man me and you are the coming of the Son of man so it says as the Lightning comes from the east to the west so shall the coming of the Son of man be for were so ever the carcass is there were the Eagles be gathered together and managed to what a promise now let's look at number four and get down to my to my point here and then we'll cut it off let's read them down and I'm so sorry really they I've held you like this this is Shalom 1964 but just to get a tape of this now when if the Lord willing this is one of them to speak at Phoenix Sunday then Monday I'm going a little short meeting so forth I purposed in my heart this year the Lord willing I just could tour from side to side see he had a lot tribulation in the South listen that guy was 56 years old when he died and he looked way older than 56 years old because of the ministry that brother Branham had it really told on his body and we all know that's the identification we know what the third pole is we all understand that now you got you'll have the tape see and I think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution comes on that's when it be it will it'll speak it will be manifested just like the five straight signs without fail you're perfect now think just now think just wait see see - what what it's done now I'm going back the same again through and through to find out short the third pole we were talking about it last last week the third pole it is the opening of the word and it's not something when you say it you say well brother dealt with at least laying dormant then God's laid it upon the shelf somewhere no it's not in its full power yet because under the third pole ministry I was thinking about this this morning under the third pole ministry things were created not healed created from nothing like if you need gas like if you need oil there was nothing and then there's oil all in the car if you don't have anything to eat that will be food provided for you that's what the third pole is but it's not just the third pole that we're waiting on something to happen or or you know like most people to return ministry they're waiting on brother Branham come back to tell us we got the third pole well they'll be too late then way too late and then you'll be in that foolish virgin part that's gonna have to be purged in in the tribulation so you believe that whatever you want to or they don't bother me I'm just gonna be ready before I put all my dependency on what brother I'm said yes but I put on dependency that Jesus Christ is one it's gonna take us over he's one that done it for us and he's the one that's gonna take it to it all right he's the one that's gonna take it to us we know what the third Pole is and we are third pool people because third pole is the opening of the world we've got now the opening of the word of God more than any age since Jesus was standing here himself no one understood him while he was here but now by the grace of God if we had Jesus Christ standing here today speaking to us like he did 2000 years ago we could understand what he said that don't make you excited cuz you know what he was very lonesome because nobody understood him he said you don't understand me you don't understand my speech hear me listen to what I'm saying they didn't listen to nothing but now being under the ministry of the son of man we've got all the prophets every prophet lain another prophet to come to us not another prophet to come to the Gentiles we've had all of them the Bible has been open this is a sick sealed book that's been open the you and I can see this so yes if Christ was standing here today and speaking to us we could say Amen to every word every word it'd not be going without what are you talking about you know that's what this message is all about it restored back that same three-and-a-half-year message that Christ preached while he was on earth with no question he was not wrong never it was Jesus Christ wrong and what he said so if we can say Amen to it and make it live then that's the purpose Jesus came for so the third poll was labeled dormant for a little while so the great hour persecution comes on that's when it be it'll speak what's the it it'll speak it'll speak in me and you and then it'll speak through us it'll speak through the bride of Jesus Christ we've seen a lot of pieces and parts of it even through brother branham's and even through the ministry here in the church we've seen things being called and brought in but when full manifestation comes brother Brown said it's just gonna be like popcorn is just gonna be popcorn popping all right so that's what I'm looking toward but but that's not just a place that we got to get to we got to start now because the opening of the word just keeps going and it keeps going remember God never stops he keeps going and going all right now look at number five the northern ones to the M times 1965 now the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message now watch brother I'm saying not when he first and brother Graham said many times not in the healing campaign that wasn't brother branham's message the healing campaign was not his message that was the bait on the hook to get the people to come to hear the message which started there in 63 in the seals or 62 63 not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see first Paul healing second Paul prophesying third pull the opening of the word the mysteries reveal no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets well folks we've had them we've had brought we've had them we're standing now in a prophetic age not being prophesying we're not under this prophesy in part we're under the opening of the word the mysteries revealed we had to go through the prophesied part where brother Branham would prophesy and he would tell us the things to come well those things are come they're happening now all right so the third pull open the other words mysteries revealing no more there's no more higher order revealed the words and prophets but the only way the Prophet can be vindicated is by the word and we know brother Branham was definitely a vindicated word prophet and the third poll was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth and what was the hidden truth the hidden truth wasn't that the plow horse rider was Antichrist sure that was part of the mystery had to be made known but when that seal tore off brother Graham said the whole he didn't say revelations chapter 6 became a brand-new chapter he said the whole Bible became a brand new book he saw the seals from beginning to end he's and there's only one thing to see from beginning the end is the plan of redemption the Bible is the only book that shows the complete plan of redemption they men it is and it was sealed up with those seals until today all right so you and I get the complete listen we get everything and it's not coming it's here what we need for what we have of what we need is here now it's in two people it's not on a tape recorder it's in people God never wanted to be plastic he didn't he wanted to be flesh your flesh of my flesh he wants to work through our flesh to me folks that's the mystery the mystery the greatest mystery of God is that you and I have been plopped into the worst age on the since the beginning of time the worst age and where God made manifest in another form called the bride and we walk through this world a total mystery a mystery to the world mine can you imagine all the things that the world does that we don't do anymore that to them is just normal and it's becoming more and more normal to do the uh normal for the world but you and I are not part of that thank god we've been brought out of all that thank god we've been separated to where yes we walk right down through the smutty pits of hell every day and we're this chosen bride of Jesus Christ Aaron if I don't stir you you bow you what is it your spell by your bow that don't stir you up thank you it was something like that but really I mean if it don't stir your heart I was thinking coming by I guess it's coming back from the Philippines I can't remember how many flights I was on but that how you can there you are and it would not just be me if a brother John's sister Alicia and the children sitting on an airplane probably I say probably the only people that believed in God on the whole plane and to be the chosen bride of Jesus Christ and us just sitting there having a happy time and thinking about God and thinking about the things that we've done and then you know we're coming back home and and you know we running through the things our mind the things we wanted to do in the Philippines and the things we wanted to get accomplished and we're sitting on an airplane and we're flying it you know 600 miles an hour 35,000 feet and that's what God chose God chose you to do what you do it shows me to do what I do but you know what he chose us to do that and here we are sitting on this airplane and you know what I'll guarantee you the devil wants to throw that thing into the ground because he definitely wants to get rid of us but when that thing comes around in taxis and I feel like power in that engine I'm thinking man get me home I always say God you be the pilot you be the mechanic and you be the wind underneath them wings and get me home he's never failed to get me home never has he failed to get me home hey man but see that's us and that's a mystery but now if I were to stand up in that plane and say hey y'all 300 people I'm God made manifest that work y'all would see me like this and I'd have the thing on the I mean really so your mystery in the world but you're telling the exact truth you stand up in the plane and say I am God made manifest in another form called the bride think about it think about all them healings and you know good people I'm not saying anything about it but I'm just saying they're not at the level of spiritual understanding that you're at they're just going through life I'm gonna die that and that's all they're doing i watch people I'm like sister Lisa's this place to have a good time in some of them airports don't use the people watch her but you watch people and you think where did they come from and they definitely don't know where they're going I mean you know me I saw this one somewhere but this girl had stuff she had so many holes in her body if if the wind blew she'd whistle like a wind chime I mean she had like here and here and here and here them great big old ring I mean really look at what their mentality is look what God took us from sitting there the other day getting gas at the door waiting on take Deana somewhere we were rabbit town and they're set to rabbit town liquor store and I'm sitting over looking at them people and they go in they buy their beer and they go put it in your car and you go home and you don't know what nowhere I mean they some cars you couldn't hardly the car couldn't hardly make it to the parking lot and then you had some Mercedes that were sitting there so it takes all Pete it takes out all the people the devil is the same devil he just gets to all of them but they all have the same purpose what I'm gonna go buy me some beer and I'm going to drink my sorrows away I'm gonna have a social drink you know I mean I have a social drink too every day I drink from a fountain that never will run dry and if you want to get drunk on this go ahead cuz I'll promise you when they give you a sobriety test out of a car you'll be drunk on the holy ghost but I'll guarantee you you'll pass the sobriety test the ones that the world gives amen but you see what we've been took from this sick seal takes us and purges us from all that stuff it takes care of that little man from Kentucky brought us a message and now you and I are the final voice to the final age under that message and it's gonna take us home it's gonna get us out of here let the world do what they do but you're walking through the world but you're not of the world like I said before all the great things that even when Jesus stood up he said I am the resurrection and the life well they want to kill him and they did you see what he said the many things he said upset the religion of the day and so will you and I if we have the same message of Jesus Christ the exact same things gonna happen you're gonna almost walk alone in this world that's why I love my church family your real family don't understand you but your church family understands you and it's an eternal family it's a family you're gonna live an eternity with all right everybody okay maybe you got woke up just to film a few minutes we'll close in just a second all right look right here let's go to the next one is we'll go to the seals now remember we went through the first four seals and the first four seals we type justification sanctification about ten and Holy Ghost and the opening of the word the four seals four first four seals then we show where five six and seven we know the fifth seal is to the Jew the six seals to the Jew and the seven seals to the Jew under that part you understand one under that part because the seventh seal to them is the same as the seventh trumpet to them the same as the seventh seal does alright so what happens is when when Israel receives their justification and sanctification because I believe they're gonna get the Holy Ghost like we did I think they're gonna have to go through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then what's going to happen Christ is going to come on the scene the seventh seal is going to be revealed to them in a part you're what I said in a part like it is to us in a part because the seventh seal to me and you the true seventh seal to me and you is when we are changed without death when we're changed without seeing death that is the seventh seal opening to you and I now that there is a seventh seal opening because it is the Holy Ghost I put the Holy Ghost in fire because that's what it's got to be the fires got to burn everything out but that's what it's got to happen to Israel but now under our fifth seal we saw a group of people give an eternal life just because they were a certain group of people right they were Jews so somewhere they have to be in God's eyes they have to be justified because they're just going to be given he's heard of life they're not bribed they're not 244,000 but the fifth sealed Jew has got to come under such a justification that the real them didn't do it because God didn't hold anything if they're given white robes folks they can't be one spot against you so I want us to see that because this is God this is for our body change we've got to see we've got to we don't have to stand up in the middle of a plane but what if you stood up in the middle of a plane and say I'm perfect you would get one of them they'd probably want to throw you out the cargo hold I mean really stand up and say I'm perfect cuz what's the first thing a nominal person will tell you when you start talking about the Lord I'll promise you you can quote it like I'm quoting it well we're not all perfect and I look at them and I say that's not what God said what do you mean wait nobody perfect I said the Bible told me be therefore perfect and through his eyes I have to be perfect through God's eyes I am perfect I'm not going to be or I'm not born again if I'm born again in the eyes of God I'm perfect my sins and has not just been hid they've been put so far away he can't even remember amen so we got to deal them with justification being that the real you didn't do it we already covered this I'm just laughing back over to get into the sixth seal because this sixth seal is the seal of so much this is sanctification to its highest power remember God has cleaned the earth off in times of Noah with water but remember what step back on earth with him he began sinning again man began sinning again all the different things God has done wars have wiped people out different things man has tried to why Hitler tried to wipe the Jews out you've had you've had many purges of people trying to get this thing fixed back right don't tell Hitler what's worst man ever lived on the face of the earth I believe but still he was trying to do something he was trying to get rid of an inferior race to raise a better race didn't know what we're doing oh you know what we're doing we're getting rid of an inferior gene problem to bring in a better one hey man aren't you a better person because you're a Christian well the old you swap now listen there's no record of that there's no record no we're in heaven hell on earth of your past if you're truly born again there's no record so it has cleaned this race of people up listen there's not gonna be sinners in the new future home it's not gonna be what you know make the list they're not gonna be there so there has been a race cleansing but what Hitler done is he took it and perverted it because he wasn't a Christian number one number two he let the devil get on him and he tried to get rid of one certain race which we know that you know what that was the hand of God God already told him he was going to release those two hundred thousand thousand demons brother Brown said to drive Israel to their homeland just like he hardened Pharaoh's heart all these different things now God didn't make them do it I can't make them do anything but he allowed Hitler to do what he did to the Jews to drive them back to the homeland so God's allowing the devil to do what he's doing to me and you to drive us back to our homeland which is not a piece of property it's the Word of God hey ma'am it's just pretty simple but I wrote down here she is him now that's what we kind of the whole point we were when we're in the Philippines we stayed on the I am but we also stayed on the Shia's him whatever whatever he gets she gets Jesus Christ got a body changed we get a body changed amen all the different things that we see that that we're not that second person that that we've kind of not maybe a name we've said we were a second person but we've always maybe separated it but but watch what brother Branham says let's read this in the rising of the Sun so let's let's just run through real quick those fifth seal justification the real you never did it sixth seal sanctification now this sanctification when we come to this think the vacation going into the Millennium it's going to take the entire earth and clean it but now remember remember you got to leave a point there it will not clean it as it will before the future home the devil is going to still be here and so where is his little imps because remember the millennium is still in time he's not going to be able to work but he's still going to be here but now when we walk into that future home that is a total purging because remember the future home is a type of your body change the millenniums really not it's still in the seventh day it's typing your new birth yeah you're born to get in you're into the glorious time of your of your Christian experience but until you get in the future home in the eighth day we know that in our soul we're that but until we step into that future home there's always going to be something else but buddy when that future home because God's gonna clean this earth off with his fire before we go into the future home it will not be atomic fire like the Millennium where things will be left here no because remember we're gonna build things in the Millennium we're gonna build houses and inhabit them that's what the Bible says but now in the future home that that's already build that's that's an eternal place amen but now you got to back all that up 1,000 years and every what you want to and stand right here today and stand up in that airplane and say you remember that city that come down out of heaven in revelation 22 I'm that City they might throw you completely out of the airplane but you know what we're only saying what God said about us it may be strange to them and some of them probably don't even know what revelation 20-something 22 is but still that's what we are that's the recipients of this messages you know who you are and you know what you're doing here and you know where you're going so the Holy Ghost in fire that fire that burns us on the day that we receive a body change to me is that same fire that cleanses the earth before we walk into the millennium the end of the future home think about it because you got the baptism the Holy Ghost in your soul but you don't have it your spirit in your body at this point today but when you take a body change your whole being is eternal your whole being has been changed amen that's God's fire that's not any kind of atomic fire that man did that's the fire of God that's the Holy Ghost and fire that burns you out and changes your body because it's literally going to change this earth when we step on in future home everything is going to be right back up shape again everything is gonna be right where it needs to be and it's going to be perfect go see after that there's no more change when you're getting when you get in the future home there's no changing going on now in the Millennium there's changes there's things changing then you got a white throne judgment things change their eternal destinations are changed but when you get in the future home it's settled it's done there's no more changing or put you know well I'm gonna get a better house in Louisa's God you know I'm gonna get one higher up here you know you two better you're gonna live with him but really it's not it's all done but so that's what the Holy Ghost in fire does is make us him it's rising of the Sun let's read this that's what he proved hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ look cold stiff and dead in the grave Jesus is literal body on Saturday was cold and stiff and dead laying in the grave amen while he was off doing the other work before he came back but watch that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave shaking to life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead til the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the world has to recognize that he's alive again now that's not it's a future home that's right now he's talking about right then 1965 4:18 he's alive again he was not only mechanic's God's Word he was the dynamics to prove it and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoken of the bride it can only be you an hour the manifestation of everything that's been said about the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics until the church or the people then they stopped here to interject all these Easter bunnies and ceremonies big churches and fineries will fail and pass away until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he had owned 16 cylinders so will the bride a man for he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it what causes the Tribulation Period the literal Tribulation Period what causes the literal tribulation period me and you are not here it's the wrath of God poured out when we leave when the Holy Ghost has come off the earth that creates the tribulation period that's what he said right here that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again at the last day that's the Easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do any good they men don't do any good you're just cranking around the Pistons got the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire by it'll only only work as they come together amen so one will sit still and the other one will go up that's the only thing there is to it yet they both might look alike both claimed to be churches both claimed to be brought but one has mechanics and dynamics it brings it the pass of what he said is the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for here's the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection you won't know what the resurrection is I just read it I just read you what the resurrection is it's the mechanics and dynamics together that fire is made to connect with that octane in the gas and when that explodes it causes the combustion and that combustion moves every motion you know what it's going to do it's going to blow a hole in that six dimension and when it blows a hole in that sixth dimension they're gonna walk in this one man he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanics with the dynamics notice it's the spirits that quickens it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas amen is to fire that sparks the gas now let's read number seven it still is rising of the Sun that's that divine revelation of the Word made flesh now listen if it was flesh in that day by the Sun the groom it's the flesh today by the bride hmm you don't even have to stand up and say that in the airplane you say that in a message Church you probably get thrown out thank you it's the flesh in that day by the Sun if it was flesh in that day by the Sun the groom it's the flesh today by the bride who soever sins you remit to them their remitted now what he was doing I cut that part out but remember he had just got finished preaching marriage and divorce after he preached this and this woman went up to him and said hey you made yourself God you forgive those people their sins that's what she said what is that well that's what he's quoting them right here that's what he's quoting them right here who soever sins you remit to them they are remitted and whosoever sins you retain to them they are retained now the Catholic Church picked that up and takes it to their priest but that's carnal watch it's the spiritual revealed word that did it that's the reason he told him to baptize in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost he knowed they knew who he was you and I know who he is and we know what we're doing here but it was the spiritual reveal word that did what remitted those people their sins wasn't William Branham he didn't do that a a sinner can't you know born in sin can't do that but God had but listened but still we have to say what God said about us he just told us this to flesh today by the bride that's the divine revelation of the Word made flesh if it was flesh in that day by the Sun the groom is too flesh today by the bride whoso sends you remit their remit hey listen that's exactly what's happening all the time like I told you walking through the world you walk through Wall Martin and you know somebody does something for you opens the door for you or somebody changes your tire on the road what are you doing now you didn't save those people but because of you in your flesh because of you standing there in your flesh with God inside at the white throne judgment their sins are going to be remitted just by you but it's Christ in you but if you're connected to that flesh if Christ is in your flesh finding me crushed pull him out and show him to me you can't he's in your flesh he's in your very being that's why you got to see that we are have already been changed we just got to start believing it we've already went through the change you started changing on a daily or day of Pentecost but but you know you say that like that woman said said well who are you to remit that well my heavens it's in the Bible a cup of water in my name will not be forgotten in this world of the world to come and now what are you doing your remitting their sin it doesn't matter if he's a a ten-time murderer if he helps you out one day and you get to the white throne judgment and you say hey you I've done this many times and you say hey Lord you said you wouldn't forget what they would do to us even the little things cup of water he changed my tire well now watch God gonna do God is gonna say because of that person and point to you say because of that person being me made manifest in flesh whosoever sins he retains retained who soever sins Hyrum it will be remitted what do you say I say remit go that's what you're gonna say how in the world can you say anything else because you were a recipient of that one day and man you were a recipient that maybe a long time ago when God came to you he remitted your sin did he so now by being the bride it's the flesh today that's the mystery is that we can walk through airports and we walk through Walmart why do we use Walmart all the time we want to target we're just promoting the devil I guess I'll promise you I told them the other day at Walmart is probably used in the pulpit more than word then the Lord's name because everybody says I was in Walmart the other day or we got to go through Walmart or we're going through Walmart I guess it's just a place we go a lot but no you but now what a great mystery and I'm gonna finish right here that's the greatest mystery to me is that God is now in human flesh your flesh working through you to retain sins because you know that can work the other way some up behind somebody come up and curse you out about something and it's really not a problem and they didn't you know what they're gonna get they're gonna get theirs retained because God knows not gonna go to remit those sins they're gonna be retained but like the Bible says whosoever sins you remit they remit retained they retain but on a sixth Hill purging to me that's what God's showing us he's showing us that he's already remitted my sin he's remitted your sin they're gone that you don't have to go to a white throne judgment you don't have to go to a tribulation they're done today sitting in your seat likes it when you get up and go to target your God in human flesh walking in target you ever thought about that you are God you're the only God that ever walked inner Target or Walmart believers go to Walmart I guess maybe that's why we need to start of doctor and believe him no I don't think so but have you ever thought about that way though you sittin you set an airport of in Atlanta there's I think there's like 50,000 people a day 50,000 people a day go through that Airport and probably just you can count them on your hand how many people that really are born-again believers of God and you look and see what you're walking through that's the world that you and I've been put in but that's the world that you're not being put in to overcome remember it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it not be a part of the world you have to be in the world but that Holy Ghost goes wherever you go you don't you know I hope you don't think you can leave it in the closet and then go do what you want to out there in the world and then come back pick it back up on Sunday and bring it in here you gonna bring something in here and it won't be that Amen we must be sensitive though that the Holy Ghost a light how many times you hear brother Branham um when me to shut the door slammed the door on brother branham you know and she got in trouble why because the Lord was real near trying to tell brother Branham something I believe and I don't believe it was just because brother Branham who he was but still though that that spirit was so sensitive till she had to apologize you know and and then you know what happened with the with the other part but that's and we know he said well that was brother Branham well I got the same Holy Ghost he does he did he's still got it it's just in another dimension he's still God I didn't lose it I don't like the quote where people say brother Branham was a prophet that constitutes that he's not one now no he's as much a problem now the air will be so brother branham is a prophet with the Holy Ghost but now remember you and I are trying to get this thing together without separating it that's what the sixth seal shows me that our purging goes on here we don't have to go to another place or go to another spot it's happening right now you're purging is happening now walking through the mall thank you here we were at them up at the mall oh yeah yeah oh that's right he was at a mall when he saw hell right okay that's true it was at the mall so well maybe that was a precursor of Walmart he did have a dream he did have a vision at the mall didn't he stay away from the mall but you know we were in the Mall of Asia do you get to go to the Mall of Asia John no big smile in the world and this thing's seven stories tall and you cannot literally see the end of it it's that big and but we as believers we walked in there we said at a coffee shop and we had coffee and we talked about the Lord we talked about the things we were gonna do in the Philippines and you know what if you could see with spiritual eyes there was just angels all around us the glory of the Lord was shining you know they always make these little pictures of Jesus with the halo over his head I don't believe that Jesus he was a secret and so are you you're a secret you're a secret now one day we are gonna be displayed to the world but right now as you walk through the world you don't have this glow coming off your shoulders it's all from within but if you were to look in a supernatural realm you could see things so it's the same way I want you to think about all the things you do in your life when you're going to you know get your car done and you anything you want to don't think well you know gods I left him at the house no he's there I just read you he's in fleshing out God's in your flesh of my flesh and he wants to less tender fee he wants to make us in that sixth seal purging he wants to finish the mystery he will finish the mystery with the Gentile dispensation in flesh he started it in flesh and he will end it in flesh hey man they weren't so great of people on the day of Pentecost but God came down into 120 human flesh and started this work called redemption of the Gentile Church and you and I are at the other end of it and we are recipients of the same thing but we have now the seven seals open so that you and I can see that it's not going to happen to another group of people it's going to happen to this group or it's not going to happen to you at all we're either in or out see to me that's that's to me that started all two started tribulation inside of you that ought to start in motion something to make sure everything's good make sure everything's right make sure everything's going good musicians y'all come on but remember this sixth seal that we're on which we'll get into Sunday afternoons we'll bring it to us but that's what finishes I had a quote here from Feast of the trumpets I've already read it before the sixth seal finishes the mystery six seals finishes the mystery just before the seventh is opening because remember the seventh seal when it opens there's nothing going on there's no symbol there's no angel there's no light there's nothing goes on having this silence everything's finished he just steps on the scene and a bride and takes us out of here three seventy six in the spiral boat the original life you got one huh please do you know this was written for us this is written for us so let's see them works it for just a man if you haven't need god bless you we likes it we love you with love of the lord thanks for being back thanks for your prayers and your monetary donations like I said we used it it's all used for the glory of the Lord so thank you very much God got a mightily bless you but I hope he mildly blesses you in the word because money can't buy them money cannot buy that boots were manifested to his bride in this last date we have caught the revelation by the last prophets message and we know we are and one arranged the floor Braves along are they original the original line the original see the original word it's what I believe the start of my reveal Seventh Seal is unveiled original line the original say we are the word made flesh today this is what the scriptures say and our names are same within redeemed and perfect without sin yes we are anointed by our God the original Isaiah times the original line the original seed the original it's what I believe the Son of Man is revealed seventh seal in some way of the original life the original scene our eyes have understanding he has opened up at last and sweet victory is ours who were chained down in the past true to believe her sounded responded to our God Thursday original line [Music] they original it's what I believe it's revealed by seven seals at all the original statelessness we are called unto a dog gentle or a teen pile sleeping st. for we can join us for translation in this out Gentile day Sammy over who you are God say it time to the original the original one [Music] the original world [Music] son of mine it's a what seal isn't they all the original line the original scene who watched the son of man asada man was the word made flesh what are you what are you you're the word made flesh verse 14 and John is talking about you and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we know it was talking about the firstfruits but remember if the firstfruits is the firstfruits there's more fruit behind it hey man can I start I wrote the feast down let me get this to you real quick we'll talk about it maybe later on you got four feast as Bob was talking about you got Passover unleavened bread firstfruits and feast of Pentecost then there's a gap then you've got the feast of trumpets atonement and the feast of tabernacles Israel has not been through those feast days yet as far as trumpets automa tabernacle and even the day of Pentecost will they've not had their day of Pentecost yet all right so they got to go through these but there's a gap between four and five there's a 2000 year gap of church ages the feast of Pentecost happened on the day of Pentecost a literal day of the feast of Pentecost is the day the Holy Ghost fell the literal day all right and to be real it's kind of strange I forgot to mention this but the day that Trump signed the acknowledgment that Israel could reclaim the Golan Heights as theirs was the day of Purim remember what that is that's when Esther that's when extra they have the day of Purim every year to show that Esther had went into the King and got the decree not changed but a decree that they could fight for their own land and fight for their own self what about that I don't think that was a coincidence I think that that was the hand of Almighty God but you look at the feast of trumpets and atonement tabernacle that's your fall feast if you take five six and seven I think we may parallel them with the seals here pretty quick but those feast days meaning a lot because God told them he said you do this till I come back and they're still doing it I mean they they're doing it do it over there in Israel all the time then like I said the feast of Purim which is not one of the seven feasts but it is one of their feast happened on that day that Trump decreed that was their land so they have what what was the decree the decree was you can defend your property remember remember the king couldn't change it and say well we can't fight but we can put it to where you can defend yourself and you can defend your own property that's what the day of Purim is so that's what Israel doing they're fighting for their land so that land means a lot to them and it does because you know what Abraham everywhere the soul your feet walk that's what I'm gonna give you so they believe in that so it's a wonderful hour we see these things coming and you know what we're recipients of it we can walk through Walmart we can walk through the different places and know that God's right there not a second person that we got a my even Moses said why are we looking for God over the sea why are we looking for him up in the air he's naughty even in thy mouth why he's in your heart if you're born again here's your heart you have no other heart not this heart but you have no other heart but God amen let's bow our heads gently father thank you for this day Lord that we did you give us the for a few moments Lord to expound a little more on on what we see of you father I pray Lord as we go out into this world we make our little comments and quotes and quips but Lord we know one thing's for sure Satan would love to destroy some time we walked out this door but Lord you're protecting angels Lord the anointing that you have given us in this endtime has given us supernatural protection and Lord we let us not deny it and let us not hide from it but Lord let us walk through this world and know that we're the only God the people will ever see Lord we didn't see you hanging at Calvary but we know you did and we're the recipients of that and Lord we can give it out to other people but it's a total secret to the world father we pray this should be with us now Lord purchase in coming into this sixth seal that we look at for the bride we know it's for the land and we know it or the world and we know it's for the foolish virgin and we know it's for Israel the Lord will not 6dl opens it shows a complete disruption of our human nature to change us into your image and to your likeness father we must believe that you are truly in our flesh just as the flesh walked on the earth as the groom then the bride now as we came forth from his side are now walking flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone by the forgiveness of our sins and mistakes we make Lord we truly are perfect than you lord but we do have human things that we are sorry that we have these crazy thoughts and different things that we do and we sure make mistakes because we are human but lord thank God you don't look at those you look through the blood Lord and you see us asking forgiveness lord I pray that you'd forgive us now Lord of our sins and mistakes that we made give us our daily bread today Lord let us chew on this a little while as we go our separate ways to come back a lens then hear from you father just bless each one be with a bride around the world be with the Filipinos Lord and the ones there in Palau and we told them we would try to think of them often we pray that you just be with him Lord and give them fruit for their labor down there Lord we pray that you just touch us now deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom we're standing right in it the power and the glory Lord forever and ever amen have a good week see you on Wednesday god bless you on your way home you
