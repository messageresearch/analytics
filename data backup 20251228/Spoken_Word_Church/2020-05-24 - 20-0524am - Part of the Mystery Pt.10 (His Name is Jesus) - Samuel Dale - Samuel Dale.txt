while until everything gets settled out and done we still will be seating parts you know not getting together in too close to the communion as far as that part and too we will have communion next Sunday but we will not have any foot washing because we'll just back away from that part of course we're trying to do everything to keep everything running in an order that can be an orderly thing you

his dad so remember that and just keep him in in your prayers it over take care of him talk to brother Colley this week they have determined that he does have prostate cancer but they said that they thought it was treatable that there was not any problems with that and he so wants to be in church but you know how it is sister Johnny can't drive and brother Doherty can't drive because like he said about brother Doherty said the devil just working on him said brother Colley said he said every time he tries to go get something done for his I said he gets worse so let's just keep praying harder and harder because somebody's stirring up the devil in that line so pray that the Lord would take care of him you know one you'd ever where they can get a traffic you know get a way to drive backwards and forth because um know that there are a lot of there okay brother Louise is off ministering today remember him and pray to Lord we bless and our Lord willing he'll be ministering this coming Wednesday for us here to church okay any other announcements that's very close to where we're going so if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turning revelations 19 and we'll begin reading in verse 7 through 16 and try to continue our thought from last Sunday's message of you know the name of God and then we'll try to pick up today to get on over into the New Testament to pick up the name Jesus and have a better understanding I'm gonna pray that the Lord would would open our understanding to that father we thank you for your grace and your love and to us we thank you for Calvary and we praise your great name we ask you to just be with us now and let's your love be there and just help us all to walk in the light of your love and you be with us Lord in this day and time across the land and the whole world and all of these problems with the viruses and things but yet you promised to be with your little bride and to take care of us so we're not we're not depending upon ourselves we're depending upon you and there's no way that the enemy can come in and bring these things upon us the word says your prophet taught it to us you that you would take care of us and there's no way the enemy can come unless you allow it so Lord we just put everything into your hands and believing you and trusting you in the day in the hour that we're living forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and guide us and keep us in your love in Jesus name I hope we get to this scripture today that will cease all right we're going to verse 7 revelations 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her it was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he said he does judge and make war his eyes were his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself he was clothed with a vessel dipped in blood and his name is called the Word of God the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nation's and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and thread of the winepress of the fierceness or the wrath of Almighty God he says and he has on his vesture and on his thigh a name written watch all of this about a named king of kings and Lord of lords is that name all right you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word I want to try to continue the thought from last Sunday's message that you know to bring it to a point to where that we can follow God's Word I'd like to see something over here and the word and bring it through and bring it out to an end or whatever you want to call it and come to that point now what was our thoughts that we were talking about last Sunday all right it says in Genesis 1 and that's 32 or three times that in Genesis 1 it says in God and it's g.o.d all right now and that is used all the way through into the all the way through there I read it and it says that God created the world God created yes God created that alright but then when you get over to chapter 2 and especially chapter 3 you'll find a word added in there and it'll say the Lord God all right now that continues then throughout the Old Testament all the way up through in true and we'll follow into the New Testament - to see but my point was why would it be staying in one section of the Old Testament before do you've watch that or read it and what do it well read it real careful because it has drastic meanings to it that you read here of God will see God is not a name we saw what's the name of God his name is God we'll see that's that's not you make a God out of anything see God is not a name God is a title to a night and back they're the best they could do came out with the word Elohim for God our God for Elohim using that an Elohim means the self existing or he that exists throughout eternity you know and it tells it out but it doesn't give a name alright then you come up we did to Lord God we're done second chapter third coming to come all the way through as I said to the Old Testament and you find Lord God and you see in that that it's trying to describe and what they were doing what they read in trying to put over into a readable language for us and for translating it and they put down our Lord God all right see now God being self-existing why would it pick up some another title because that's what it is God is a title to a name it is not a name it's a title to a night well I've been told all of my life God's name is God well in heaven help us if that's as far as we can go I had enough of that knowledge when I was in the Baptist Church that I knew that God was not a name it was a title to a name all right now then you go - Lord God Lord is not a name it's a title alright and that title is picked up or derived from the wording the best they could do to come out with the word Jehovah alright so now when you go from Genesis one of understanding it opens up in Genesis 2 to describe this one in Genesis 1 that's doing this God created God crea then in Genesis 2 you'll find that the Lord God created well it must be the same person there's only one creator alright and that's the word alright see the word is the Creator so then you come up to Lord God which is Jehovah Elohim Jehovah means like a father with his family that's the best basics you can come up with a name there and using that point that to understand it means like a father with his family so as you come on over from Genesis 1 in the creation and then all at once you find God becoming a creator of human beings and then he picks up the title of Jehovah and it becomes Jehovah Elohim alright now you can come all the way through your Old Testament bringing it to the basis of Jehovah Jireh the 7 compound names of Jehovah and all the way through the Old Testament using that when you run across it and you'll see the Lord God go back and read those things it's very valuable to us you said well I've dropped just I'm just simple well that's what I thought I was I've never found out yet it I wasn't simple because that's what I am is very simple it just to take the terminologies and follow it and especially in the day that we live see we have the prophets message to describe it so all of this that I'm describing to you has been taught by your prophet when you get into the Godhead into the things of understanding he's the one that came up with these things and see Elohim is not a name Jehovah is not a name God's not a name then when you get into all of those titles and things you know of Yahweh and in a dawna ever how you pronounce that part all of that is titles to a name because God's name could never be pronounced alright it is actually if you've got them laying right here where the Prophet said it it's jvh you all right and the best they could do was to come up with Jehovah but I'm not nothing major than anything I'll just make just kind of have a little common sense see if you can't pronounce a name then there's something hidden within that name there is a great thing that you need to be able to follow that all right see so then back in the Old Testament when he was known as Jehovah the that was a title to a name of the person or being of Almighty God all right and in doing that then you come up to the point of trying to find his name well we'll call him this we'll call him that what is his name well he said well his name was got nothing on God and his name wasn't L of him that's still a title to a name his name wasn't Jehovah that's still a title to a name there was no name there to be able to do and they couldn't as I said go back and read you I'll give you what the prophet has said there was no way to pronounce the name it's j vh v aj vh u excuse me all right now you English major sometimes you you get into it and and help me out a little bit but remember there is only one vowel you got to have vowels everybody gonna knows what daddy that's the AEIOU that is that all of them that's the vowels okay we'll get a little English today ae oh you all right so you have one letter in the jvh you because I see you you have one vowel so there's no way to pronounce the name you've got to have the vowels to be able to comprehend the pronunciation are what you're doing with that name so there was no way to do it so they just put the best that could do and they wrote Jehovah but it's in Isaiah or I wrote it down yesterday I was gonna bring it in the RM sleeping but but see God said in the Old Testament their sin in Isaiah or one of them he said by my name Jehovah was I never known you run upon as your hover witness and they start talking to you about his name being Java so what okay here answer this scripture here he said by my name Jove I've never known the he couldn't be not be known but the jvh you and I said the best they could do was come up to Jehovah but those are titles to a name and he was known of Jehovah the Old Testament okay now that's where we like to the prophet to get her understanding to the point he said to Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the new okay see now we can find the name and that's what we were trying to do with that was to find his name because the name of God all right and see when it comes through the Old Testament all the way through you have no way to comprehend that to understand it okay now as you do then you wind up in a position to work I said go ahead number uh I'm jumping so okay go ahead and number four bring up number four now remember the point there was no way to pronounce the name so they don't the best they could do and they put it to jvh you but there's no way to pronounce that so they got to come down to something so they tried it by using jehovah all right but now that still doesn't give you the understanding what is his name but I remember and we'll read this here that when you come to Moses at the burning bush that's where this is then Moses was told I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I make it plain so it's sensible to human language Moses was standing there and he says I know the God of Abraham I've studied about him I've heard about him I know about the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob etc but now when I go down there they're gonna ask me your name and says what is your name you know let's carry this out over into what we're talking about so let's start reading a little bit Exodus 3 6 through 8 this is Moses at the burning bush remember what happened he comes up he finds a bush burning and he said I'll turn aside to see why the bush is not burning up all right when he does God says take off your shoes because the ground is holy and all like that all right but look moreover he said now this is God speaking to Moses I am the God of thy father now forgive me for putting in without injecting on anything but let me read it this way moreover he said I am the God of thy father I am the God of Abraham I am the god of Isaac and I also am the God of Jacob no I didn't inject anything I was just reading it bringing it to a point to where you were see that the same one was speaking okay and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said little dogs go back to that big capital Lord and things that we had understanded with when you see the capital Lord it4s up in phrases meaning God of glory when you see it in a lowercase L Ord you'll find it can be many things that can be brother Donnie in the Old English can i can say my lord my lord come in the house my lord urgency its difference in languages but when it's got that big capital it's only speaking of the one yeah I am well now watch what I'm saying the I am that spoke to the father's the I am that was speaking to Abraham of Isaac to Jacob him and to Israel all right and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters where I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land with a large and unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and i'ma rights in the purchase eyes and the hive eyes and the Jimmy sobs all right now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression were with the Egyptians oppress them come now therefore and I will send thee he's won't his name and he's gonna send him those are gonna see they're gonna send Moses God said come on now Moses I'm gonna send you that thou must bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God Who am I you're the I am Who am I you're trying to determine it you're trying to describe to me something but I'm asking you who am i he said I'm not worthy come on read it all I'm not worthy I can't do this I can't speak I can't do this and all like that right constantly complaining but look what happened Who am I that I should go into Pharaoh that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee now what's the token look what it is when that has brought forth the people out of Egypt you shall serve God upon this mountain that's exactly where he went when he brought them out of Egypt straight to that mountain right okay and Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them now watch the god of your father's has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them now you're gonna read this part in here if you look at it he's saying to Moses he said I'm the God of Abraham I'm the god of Isaac I'm the God of Jacob I'm all right Moses said all of them I know about I've heard about studied about because they kept personal records up through there they didn't just throw it out and and and do nothing they they had records and things they knew and he could say yeah you was with Abraham you was with Isaac he was with Jacob and you say you're going with me but said I need a name because if you're going with me now I believe you was personal day Brian use personal dies it gives personal with Jacob right there with him doing all of the things taking care of him but sitting now who's gonna watch the name I'm gonna tell him right what is that names he and God said unto Moses okay back up what she always say to them God the God of your father's has sent me to you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses right back where we started all titles and no name now I got one in here where the Prophet said God never had a name until Moses then we'll get to that in a minute if we can hold it what is his name what's your Los Angeles and God said unto Moses I am that I am now this his name that's what he just said what's his name I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you I don't know 15 and God said moreover unto Moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel the Lord God all of these Jehovah love him all of this coming in from the beginning over - which would cover what a little over 2000 years right because you got a thousand years before the flood and then I mean in in that period of time and then you got coming on over so you down over a thousand years so you got a lot of time that Lord God was used the Lord God of your father's the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob has sent me unto you this is my name forever okay are you gonna get back inside of what we're talking about what does el ahem mean el ahem means self existing he said I am the self existing Almighty God but I've come down now to dwell with you I've heard my people their cries are good and they're their taskmasters and what they're doing but sit down coming down but I won't send you he says I don't even know your name and you're gonna tell me to go he said I need a little bit more does that plain enough to be human about it Moses was just plainly saying I need a little bit more would you please clarify yourself would you bring this to an understanding to her that I can follow you you and when they say what is your name then I have no trouble saying I am that I am because that's what his name is gonna stay I am that I am it ain't gonna never change come on is Hebrews 13:8 I was gonna read that in the scriptures but I didn't but Hebrews 13:8 is right he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what he is he has always been and there always will be he's always the same he said I'll always be there that is my name right this is my name forever go and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them the Lord God all of these you know about you your parents your understanding you know you you know about Abraham and how happen that were in bondage but he's saying you know what about all of these things you know about Isaac we know about Jacob you know about all these things okay going gather the elders of Israel saying to them the Lord God Jehovah Elohim the self-existing Almighty God dwelling with his family the fathers of Israel and now we're going to get a little bit more we'll get this right the Lord God saying Lord God of Genesis to Genesis 3 4 5 6 10 12 all the way up to where we're at I don't know what exact number which comes into Moses but it's a very short one the Lord God of your father's the God of Abraham and of Isaac of Jacob appeared unto me saying I how surely visited you and seeing that which is done to you and Egypt and I have said I will bring you up out of the afflictions of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites into the Hittites and my rights and the prettiest sights and highlights and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey they shall hearken unto thy voice the ones they shall hearken to that voice that shall come thou and the elders of Israel unto the king of Egypt and ye shall say unto Him the Lord God of the Hebrews has met with us now let us go and we see see three days you know sacrificing the Lord our God now according to my understanding of the way things happens I don't know about that word and I can never pronounce it but what you call the hieroglyphics Herrig lippies which was the Egyptians writings and they wrote everything and kept records on their walls and drawed it all out and you remember in the story of Moses which was made up by them but it happened that Moses finally went back in there and looked on the wall and seen the child and knew who he was and where he come from because they kept records all of those nations kept records all right all of those the Egyptians note about the children of Israel that's my point they wouldn't if they just come up with a sum now he says you go to him now and tell them until the king he can go look on his wall and find out about Abraham Isaac and Jacob you said well you mean they can yeah they kept up with all of those things records was made the writing's on the walls of Egypt they're still there today as far as I didn't assume there would be whatever wasn't destroyed but look he's adding a point that whether you never thought of it or not I don't know but he said the Lord God Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph you've heard about these guys now let me ask you a simple question don't you ever think I mean I do every once in a while well you just think get a scene in your mind the children of Israel are down in Egypt the king is there they keep up with all the records and know all about it he walks into the king and says let my people go why didn't that King say cut his throat you don't think I mean a king of Egypt and two guys walk in Moses and Aaron they've done any other their own points yet that comes on in when they come walking in and says the Lord God of the Hebrews met with us why didn't I came to say here evidently he must have had a little bit of understanding somewhere right because that's what Moses saying he said the God of Abraham you heard about him hadn't you the King says y'all heard about the god of Isaac you heard about him yo yo are heroglyph except how you pronounce those big old words we got it on our walls what happened in these countries in our country and what took place why was that King I mean come on let me live in here make a story out of it all right sister Freda in the morning somebody knocks on the door and you get up and you lo yeah well I'm in charge of this whole community around here and I'm coming in your house and look it over you say no no no no no no no no no this is my house don't you think that King was sitting there thinking who is this guy but he had heard about him his granddaddy was the what was his name city come from get all of those names back there and you run them and do you know the guy that brought Moses up to thinking that Moses was his grandson I guess he's water you understand he knows all about these things get a still get it right or your understanding the Egyptians knew all about Moses and Moses said now you let the people go Pharaoh said well who don't take them out Moses says what I am you understand you don't think like that that king was afraid of him he knew about Moses and the things that had happened he knew about the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob come on be sensible in your thinking the Lord God I'll put this in while we're thinking on it give you a time for that to float in it I was trying to illustrate what is that what is the Hebrew Abraham was called a Hebrew he crossed the river to our one day and come walking up he says my name is Abraham and the guy said that's right you're a Hebrew so from then on he's known as a Hebrew and the children of Israel known as Hebrews because they were descendants of coming down from Abraham right but your individual that was in bondage you needyou with the children of their two row of Hebrews coming down from Abraham but listen Abraham came from the other side the river are beyond as the original says he came from beyond he's a Hebrew that word Hebrew means that he's coming from beyond you know where the Bible says they were him come from he said I brought your father Abraham from the other side of the flood a little bit more than just saying he come across that River down there and we'll call him a Hebrew come on that's what the Bible says now be glad to find it for you so you know you can look at them and give it to me I can tell it if not then this go read your Bible and you'll find it it says I brought your father Abraham from the other side of the flood here's a little predestination to some of this isn't it right little understand in a free destination appears in our thoughts this will be in a hebrew these in that word Hebrew means not from one beyond our coming from the river over and there the scripture said I brought in from the other side the flood well there's no record that Abraham come over in the boat right they did only knowing his children what's he talking about the promised Abraham is a Hebrew the children of Israel Hebrews that's what he's talking about the Lord God of the Hebrews he's talking about the children of Israel that start at that moment down in Egypt God said I brought him the other side the flood how did he get over there he got over there from the lineages that come down okay this gives a little point let you think about it Hebrews but listen he keeps referring back that he's the Lord God the Lord God all right now let's go to list a hundred words we get to we got the eighteen but I want you to back up with me and think back up into that to verse 13 and bring them out so what we're gonna do Moses said unto God well when I come into the children of Israel they shall say unto them the god of your father's your Hebrews God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob sent me unto you they shall say to me what it is name what shall I say unto them then God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you remember where I Illustrated it while ago I am the God of Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am the God of Jacob I am the God of Israel I am the God of the Hebrews my name is to stay that perpetually throughout eternity can you find the name of God right there what would you say that I am that I am what about it what is his name well we know his name is Jesus well how did we learn his name with Jesus now listen we knew his Baptist his name was Jesus we had Jesus as we knew Jesus we knew about the name Jesus we we had understanding of the nine Jesus okay we could quote you scriptures doc I come in my father's name so what is the name of the Father Jesus so it is what is the name of the son Jesus but what is the name of God mean to you remember what I was illustrating Moses said I know about the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob the God of Israel I know about all of that but I ain't going until you give me something that is related to me do you see the name of Jesus as being related to you are you to see Jesus as what is the Hispanic name for jeshu or what is it come on y'all for now it's okay my brother branham said he said there's plenty of Jesus's he said that was jesus is back in that time but he said they wouldn't but one Lord Jesus Christ right wouldn't but one Lord Jesus Christ they wouldn't but one I am that I am so he advances in understanding of the god of a God of our fathers Abraham Isaac the Lord God of Israel and Annika as Jehovah ellingham now you're picking up something to get a little better understanding that I am that I am which means ever-present for eternity do you need the quotes from the Prophet which means ever present now if he is Hebrews 13:8 then whatever was dar is here now and whatever is here now will always be there every which way you go right Hebrews 13:8 shields it up what is Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever thought that's what we're trying to come to an understanding on how to come out for the name Jesus when it was not pronounced back there there was no way to pronounce it you had to jvh you let's see the way to pronounce God's name is Jesus well that's how we know now is he something personal to you you get the illustration of what I'm saying Moses said I know about these I know about the I am and what happened in the days of Abraham I've read the stories of behind it or halted because basically what they've done back then was just word of mouth and curtain or lineage it's true it's like they do now there's I remember reading up one time about this certain tribe in Africa and they have people that all they do is they just memorize they memorize everyday know who's who's a who's who give you one a brother motion brother Ezra Georgia them not they must be downstairs or whatever but you know for certain that that guy had a brain brother mole had one but Ezra had a brain now brain to remember he had a brain to remember people and names and who was who and who done what and we were standing talking one day and he asked me what it was I said well we come down through the cranes we come over he said we better stop he said we're somewhere in the category of fifth cousins already because the heaters and that was brother moat knowing it yes for some of you grinnin life and you know about Ezra he he had a memory because that's what they doing back there they handed it down one to the other one generation another whereas the Egyptians wrote it on the walls and there's other than done this away another way but whatever it is they kept records see they could follow those records and the record came up to what from God in Genesis 1 Genesis 2 Lord God then Lord God coming on through and God the Lord in different things I gave it to you there the other day trying to get you to see about the name and here you come up to winding up to where Moses is standing at the burning bush and he so he knows something supernatural isn't is involved in things and he knows for certainly that takes somebody here talking to him that's different than all the others and that was the Lord God and he said I am never that's where we started reading I am spoke to Moses then Moses began to realize hey this is something great going on what's taking place I am I can remember the God of Abraham I remember the god of Isaac I remember the God of Jacob I know all about those things and I know that we are the Hebrews that we are the children of Israel and we're down here in bondage Moses knew all the whole story because he was able to read all of that you remember he was raised up a little boy in the king's palace and he knew all the whole stories oh we go to movies and they make a version of what they can do about it but when they come to that you go to the Ten Commandments and then it follows real good it makes a good layout and all but field watch it every once in a while it'll flick there's a little catch in earth that they don't exactly get I mean how did Pharaoh's daughter wind up not letting Pharaoh know all about what was going on well hey they made a picture out of it they made a movie out of it I met her this that was to sell Martin buy you know what to do forget what I'm talking about but the time you come to Moses you still have no name you don't like he's wording but that's all right you can't wind up with a guard with no name cuz you can't pronounce his name there was no way they were locked in under that basis but they had come to a place that it added to in the Moses in his account because before then it was I am I am the God of Abraham I am the god of Isaac I'm the God of Jacob I am Moses said I know all about that but tell me something personal he said I am that I am I'm dead I am I'm the one that spoke to Moses I mean to Abraham and Isaac to Jacob and all these things I am that I am you remember over in the scripture where it talks about when you say that stuff like it he said I am that voice in the wilderness you can get a lot of capital letters out of the Bible if you'll read it correctly and the right understand it but give what I'm talking about so you're adding an understanding to bring a clarity to the name so you adding what I am that I am Moses it okay I don't know what's going on but I'm going to eat you that's the best way to say cuz you think he knows all about that I don't I think he just decided about that time he said hey I know who I'm talking to I know who's talking to me and I don't know what's gonna do but he said for me to go and I'm gonna do what he says I'm going down there because if he's over here telling me what to do he's going to be down there to make sure it works right he's going to come along with me alright he gets down to pharaoh and pharaoh says huh you know they set up a point 'ln you know what I mean I mean did he just walk in the Kings walk in the palace and if moles in there and just walk in you we come and take over now I'll get the story sensible in your mind they get an appointment with Pharaoh Pharaoh says Moses I thought we got rid of that old boy doesn't know technically there's an argument over the setting that comes up second or third now if you ever read your scriptures and followed it you'll find a little little gap in there and I remember this and the Baptist Church we're studying about that Pharaoh you know they called each other called Pharaoh Pharaoh Pharaoh SETI even times they had names and you got a little argument over whether this guy is this guy or this guy this guy one of them was supposed to bend if Moses would have stayed where one of them was supposed to bend Moses his brother or at least his half-brother or whatever you want to call him some of them guys died off because it took quite a ha you've got Moses for 40 years out there and you got in 40 years and already come over here so he's 80 years old how old was that other guy and then this goes out and back I'm just saying it that way this leaving the point where you see we think we know all about it we don't study the story but set to ever what his name is that faces Moses wasn't Pharaoh because that was only I was his granddaddy but he'd have been glad to see Moses come back we just remember as Moses had studied those walls and led read those hieroglyphics so had Pharaoh and so had settee and so did all of them know what was going on and here comes up Moses said - he says hmm I thought we got rid of this little boy I thought we've run him out into the wilderness I better walk a little soft today you remember what the trouble was were the two SETI and Moses you know what I mean this user network said - he ever what the name comes up to be you know what it was that guy wanted to be in charge of Israel I'm in of Egypt but he wasn't because granddaddy had already made up his mind to make Moses the guy in charge right Moses was already in in charge called Moses was the one that conquered Moses wanted led to people they were afraid of that said he was afraid of Moses bringing an insurrection to when Moses comes walking back in the guy said who you say that Moses and says he's got a guy with him called his prophets that he's Aaron but didn't sit he just say boys do your job go get rid of them that was afraid of him hey this guy caused trouble before we better walk soft so Pharaoh says okay tell them come on in you know sit here what isn't I wonder don't come over there and Moses could stand there and look at him and say listen you studied in hieroglyphics as well a tire you know what took place he said I don't believe you you may not believe me but you know you know there's writing on them walls that declared it was a man come up here and what he was to do and said you had the children killed you're your daddy or a granddaddy which one it was said you had the children kill from two years of age and under to try to get rid of that Moses well you didn't get rid of him I'm here now what are you going to all I'm asking you is one thing let my people go and really it was a little bit deceiving when he first said because the first encounter was with said he was from Moses and said let us go three days out in the wilderness and worship garden we'll come back they went in didn't come back but I guess he was just human no why didn't have said he said okay that's taken going out there because God had already hardened that man's heart that there was no way that that man was gonna let him get away he had let him go ahead and let him get away back before then but he wasn't gonna do it now you understand but to Moses they had been added I am that I am Moses tender and says I'll go because I know about the I am and he says that I am I've got something more sure now but that's still not his name that's not his name it still titles to a name more understanding more of the story but not know add at night cuz still ain't got a night I am that I am that's still don't name we still JV h dr j vh you we're still hung you got a fast time between Moses and the coming of Jesus Christ upon the earth to where that he would come forth as being the Lord Jesus Christ you still need a night that's what gets me I'm sorry but it gets me of all the people of this message because they they've been at it ever since we've been in the message 50 years what do you know the new name of Jesus you know the new name of Jesus you can take over you can do I hadn't done away with a name yet I ain't got that finished yet I ain't even got to his name yet rah I'm still don't titles I've still got much by that somewhere around two to three thousand years before that can come into being about the name of Jesus they only mentioned I don't mean only but one of their only mentions of him through there between Moses and coming forth and coming up to Israel is in what is it Isaiah where he's talking about and I shall call his name Emmanuel what didn't they call his name that they were told over there any angel I'll get to if I don't know get it next time they get to that an angel told Mary called his name Jesus but he'd been told the fulfillment of the scripture would have been to call his name Emmanuel because the scripture had told him in there and is in Isaiah where he says his name shall be Emmanuel God with us so you still not know named Emmanuelle's not an item because it's not related to a person remember you got to have a person for a name to be important they say the most wonderful the words that anyone can ever hear is their name being called because it has a relation to the body of the human part of you thinking and you're standing in a crowd and on understanding and I say Tony don't you well because that's his name he knows his name and he knows I'm calling his name and if he knows my voice he knows especially as I'm calling his night he's looking for me to be calling all over the building to get all kind of Kony's but listen just getting a little dollop his name shall be called Emmanuel alright now we're getting just a little further you come over over into the new testament and iris marry and you get her down at the water pot that day and an angel appears into her there's Mary said you're chosen and said you've read the story get it all read it all read it in your understanding Mary it wasn't married you marry you haven't yet not know get the whole story Mary you've been chosen you've been chosen of all of the women of the world to do a specific job she talks with the angel maybe four hours discussing the matter we think he's different no she knew the whole story and she was told said you'll call his name Emmanuel no you call his name Jesus yes you can still use the manual because she knows what it means Emmanuelle they knew what he Manuel meant they could read Isaiah that his name would be Emmanuel you could say what will be that what will be the Messiah that will become one of these days and as you would quickly say his name shall be Emmanuel we see when it came forth it didn't come forth his name it would remain you well you come forth telling you that his name shall be called Emmanuel but the real waiter said is Jesus how do you pronounce the Emmanuel Jes us Jesus you'll call his name Jesus because he'll save now watch it not just any Jesus not just any person out there with the name Jesus because it gives us specifics to what it says because he'll be them a savior of his people right you've called his name Jesus because he'll be the savior he'll be the Redeemer he'll be the one his name is Jesus now you remember what I've asked you to are the other day for you to look it up and see they capitalized those the letter Jesus when I was talking about it in Matthew they bold it when they put Jesus after it had been directed what to do and they used his name twice there and they bold or italicized it read what you want to call it upper cases whatever you want to bring it and you'll call his name Jesus brother Brennan said the first time spoken by a human being a baby comes to life read your story first time spoken by human being was to a human being about a human being you'll call his name Jesus John didn't even because that was the angel talking so Mary goes and she leaves and runs over to her Elizabeth her kin folks you know and Elizabeth had been pregnant for about six months you know but baby was now removed or nothing Mary goes in and she says you know Hail Mary and as you greet her you know salutations army and they get through and they talking in and Elizabeth said Mary I'm worried that dog I know I'm pregnant but said the baby hasn't moved it's about six months that's not right and that mood very says well I'm expecting a child to Liz but oh you and Joseph got married Noah didn't you know the problems right Elizabeth said oh come on now say something going wrong here because you mean you're pregnant and you ain't married new is what's going on she gives the Bible calls it her salutation she said the angel of the Lord met me and said I would be found with a child of the Holy Ghost that child shall be his name shall be Emmanuel God with us to fulfil isin hell we said I was told by the angel to call his name Jesus right there was a human being speaking that word first the prophets right the others of the angels talking and descriptions are this to do with that and this goes with that we hear a person called the name Jesus John leaps in the moon comes alive now you've got the name now you've went from I am the creator I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I am all of these things my name is i am that i am no I ain't got time to finish that I'll take it next week with it go we're gonna get into me and you oh you remember me I'm just that away everything I've got and it relates to me and you okay so just hold on but just get the point his name is Jesus No was told over there was Simeon you called his name Jesus notice that you're reading all of those things in relating to Jesus it allows some references like I said it'll say something like who will save his people who will give his life for his people and every time the name is Jesus is mentioned a little baby Jehovah crying in a cradle Jehovah with no teeth now I'm quoting brother Branham right that you hope with the Old Testament is now known that's what the Jesus of the new now we can come back to what they will end it on this thought we would come back to Hebrews 13:8 there's never been but one person in the world could ever Akkad I'll ever be to that title it was a title but it had a name replied what Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever fulfillment of all the scriptures anything that'll ever be in the future will have to come from that come on or else you're wrong because when he told him to say I am that I am he said that will be my name for eternity I am mean self-existing and says whatever his name is it will stay that away he said yeah but brother Dale wait a minute now you're running I'm not running off you say well well we don't know the new name brother Branham was looking for a new name great so am i but I've also found where he said this he said maybe it'll be made known when we get there okay because what's going to happen somebody comes in here let's get her at illustration according to the Bible if a prophet gives a sign and it comes to pass you're supposed to believe that prophet right the Bible also says if a prophet comes and speaks it come on what is it if a prophet give us signing it come to fight but what about the one word if a prophet comes among you and gives a sign and it comes to Pais what are you to do and God says I sent him among you to try you to see whether or not you're gonna stay with the word is that true come on you in the scriptures you know what I'm talking about God sent are allowed to come an antichrist and their life's data to deceive the biggest portion of the world he permitted it to happen he didn't make it happen he permitted it to come into being he permits a prophet to give you a false shine as an antichrist what if he was standing here and they would come rolling our dead body in right here they've been dead proven for so long and then he said I'm gonna prove to you that I'm right he's gonna raise from the dead you reach over and he raises from the dead what are you gonna do but the Bible said if he takes you to another God if he takes you to another God or another doctrine or another idea or another faith that's why I can't be looking for another prophet to come I have no hope whatsoever never based it on anything of another prophet to come to take over it's always been the way he is run around and brought the message we believe his message we stay with that and we walk in the light of the word in the hour that we're living but now we're learning that his name is Jesus because he will save his people from their sins but I don't I don't like you using them prophets like it you don't like me using the Bible did I use the Bible the Bible says if a prophet give you a son and it come to vice you got to believe that prophet but then he said if a prophet come gives you a sign and it comes to PI's but he leads you to another God don't follow him there's your Antichrist look at the people of this message the way they're doing now when we come 50 years from the to souls to Lords Peruzzi is Parthia all kind of river Jordan all kind of doctrines that the people of this message you're running a hog wild after and going off and leaving the name of Jesus you think this thing is doing now I told you when this started this is only the day of the temptations to work that it'll be through you volunteering for what's taking place be careful what you volunteer now because we're in the last days but you see you understand what I'm talking about Moses could not pronounce that name Jesus they couldn't pronounce it it couldn't be pronounced it couldn't be understood it's not what I mean pronounced they could help they could make a stab at it and call him Jesus you understand what I'm getting at it it's not to just pronounce it it's to understand it I hope you fathered me of what I was saying because we if your doctrine will come out because remember Hebrews 13:8 has gotta something in it okay you mind if I read it just see if I can find it okay Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but what's verse 7 that's verse 8 if you can brothers pull up Hebrews 13:7 easy to get 13:8 do that and roll it backwards can you get it ok I'll just go ahead and maybe they'll pick it up Hebrews 13:7 says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the Word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation what is the end of a person's conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever right remember them which how the rule over you who have spoken unto you the Word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation what is the end of your conversation if it leads you to a false god or a false doctrine it is not Hebrews 13:8 if you understand what I'm trying my best to bring I had it written in here to bring it over and over when it comes forth what I am that's Hebrews 13:8 when it come forth with I am that I am that's Hebrews 13:8 when it come forth with his name Emmanuel that's Hebrews 13:8 when it comes forth to the name is Jesus that's Hebrews 13:8 the book of Acts 7:35 or something in there you realize it says Jesus was the angel that spoke to Moses from the burning bush are you with me you have read that Jesus is the angel that spoke to Moses from the burning bush can we get that let me see if I can find it all right come on musician well I'm picking up something come on did you get where every number number nine brothers in Murray's belief what is it what is the pillar of fire it's the angel of the Lord what is the angel of the Lord the same was one was in the burning bush the same one that was in Jesus Christ the same one that's in you tonight is the same one that was in the burning bush the same one here the same great Lord Jesus both the paradox he says angel of the Lord pillar of fire led the children of Israel through the wilderness that was a paradox that talked to Moses there in the burning bush that was a paradox and he goes down to explain what it was in a journey all day that here Jesus said before Abraham was I am I am was in the burning bush I am was the one that talked to Moses the Lord Jesus spoke to Moses from the burning bush the Prophet in the last days recognized who was speaking the Lord Jesus right come on let's tan Bank on these things can you see his name there not another nine given whereby men must be saved or can be say in the name of Jesus right they couldn't pronounce it back there they couldn't pronounce jvh you but we can call now we know what it is his name is Jesus but he had to come into human flesh the angels had to speak those things to bring it forth and clarity before the name could be pronounced on earth and human beings it's not just Jesus because that can be any named of Spanish or whatever you want but if Lord Jesus Christ the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I am that I am he would say in one of these days you'll understand my name is Jesus I come in my father's name now how many of you hear coming to your father tonight right your father is huh well right your father was a Jones oh no no no no no you got the wrong one my name is Gabriel why because that was my daddy's name it wasn't a name given to me it was a name blood inherited making you part of him like anything what we got brother [Music] ah [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] you love it common name Emmanuel all right we'll call him Jesus to make sure that fulfill their Jesus is the only nine that Hebrews 13:8 will match they're not another name in the world that can match Hebrews 13:8 but the name of Jesus [Music] that's why I believe what I try to preach because that's my conversation to you then he's the same yesterday today and forever run around said the same burn one at the burning bush is one living in your heart by the new birth same one to walk the shores of Galilee is the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] the I am that I am anybody having a diol doors open [Music] the world I love [Music] you know I have trouble with this clock up here I always have trouble with digits it goes because that means I've got account numbers in my mind instead of looking at places for the hand or stick you don't do that I have trouble looking at the letters and saying that it's level 47 [Music] what a day and what a time [Music] [Applause] [Music] the heads here he's the same yesterday today and forever anybody else anything before we go remember Wade Minister in this afternoon approaches Lord of the bless and remember brother Louisa and him traveling back home today and all that the Lord would be with them give him a safe journey remember one row at a time everything still stays in order that's why we've got to take we got everything we'll follow these because that has nothing to do with what we believe that's just plain common sense less contact it can be even if you're just talking about a sniffily bad cold the less contact is the last contact is better so we do that right all right father we thank you we ask you to just be with us now and go with us to either natural meal bring us back
