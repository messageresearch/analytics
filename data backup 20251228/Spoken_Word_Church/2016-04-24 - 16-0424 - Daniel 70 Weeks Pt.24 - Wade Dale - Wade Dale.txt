alright today a new sister today now what what I want you to do is I want you to turn that so i can see that show to see them can I say this okay once he system that once he says now just kind of twisted around push it around just to write on an Indian all right because what happened there a lot of people a lot of other scholars and he'll show you it goes into the 5 30 s and the five we went to all that ok I'm going through it again you want to listen to you can go back unless approved it for about three or four sermon or three or four sermonette did it was for 45 bc and then we come to hear the fourteenth day of march maybe put it down hebrew you'll find it's called nissen which means March March April we know that right it's March able not just March there's March April because if you look at your when I told you this was very important here to over here listen which is the springtime God told them to start their year on this and one or they call it a tit you know nissen one and then the Passover is 14 days later on this and 14 all right the Bible remember we went back into Exodus when they got ready to leave he said today you start your year so these are God's you know God put these down we didn't just come take them out of the air you don't want to remind you something I my brother Bob Wednesday night if you're scared about these days if you're scared of the raptures on plate to take place in 2019 you don't believe it what you gonna miss it if you don't believe it then you don't believe it I believe it you say 2019 I said well it'll be close if it's not it will be reversed I according to what about 50 Robinson we can know the year in two months he said that right knee to right ear is your weekend oh the week yes but we don't know the better out okay alright so if you scared you need to go the altar like bottom good about to blend I'm you're scared about these days you didn't go Albert yes right do you want to stay here longer than that go-ahead home got here I'm good that's a good dog late you have a choice yeah you got cause the issue was given on the four think they have marched bc 4 45 thats when to build rebuild the temple remember Ezra gotta edit from one of them remember Israel was in captivity right I'm just refresh your memory room was in captivity they couldn't do anything in their own country unless a king told him they could so Ezra went to whoever it was Cyrus or 10 you uncle in and put the names in but he went to one of the Kings and they said okay go ahead well as we went down there started building the city and stop the devil did just what he did before he started he sent people from other nations down in there started getting them getting their mind off what they were doing so they quit for so many years all right then another one goes back and gets them edit an addy is a contract saying you can go build your your city pertinent per man right it was a permit because if not a king that was closer to Israel could say hey you can't be able to have no destroyed but if Cyrus would you love me Persian and all that Darius and although if they say that they need to say hey they told us we can build it through they were safe to degree all right so then we come down to the very end of it the Bible says that the walls were built even in trouble its times dad was 445 be seen near my in your Bible tells you that they built the wall the wall was finished in 52 days 52 days they finished that wall right and that was in bc 4 45 remember the dates from bc goes small as it gets closer to us right goodbye okay 55 something bc is not five hundred more years no it's fine really 4 45 b c is less years to pc or 81 there's no bc zero and go from bc 1 281 wait why Christ could be born in AV and beaten for and crucify maybe 30 MB 34 year ago all right did you think you'd be 34 but you don't need to take that year out that 0 a year now all right bc 4 45 they will issue a fourth to rebuild the temple all right the 49 years we read all that anybody remember that we read all that okay because the fair season is 46 years it took 46 years but it took 49-year years for the inside at 49 years to build that to build a temple all right everybody got that it would be built in trouble sometimes so now the first smart then we know now for sure right here on this mark could right underneath here or right above it I don't care you put it wherever you want to cook for 45 bc right here this month like 445 bc we know by the Bible and the prophets message docks one to seventy weeks of Daniel begin 445 bc alright yeah ok because remember we'll go back to this next quote which is right here we'll get to this in a minute too because this is where he brings in AV 30 and now from bc 4 45 280 30 stop right there don't try to do anything because 445 is our mark now anybody right there well 45 bc that's when Daniel 70 weeks begins all right now then you've got a seven-week period this is according to the Bible right we covered it it's on your other chart I just put that line there because the 49 years and four hundred thirty-four years makes 483 years ever got that one more time good Kim all right hold on nothing scripted let's get no let's get the Bible my screen just the number let's read angle night I'll get something on here what I want show you them hurry up to it i've been into to meet them hmm it's after a victim all right here we go Daniel 9 24 all right seventy weeks are determined upon on people going on holy city to finish the transgression six things right where's 25 know that point understand it from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild ruse until allah tala print chubby seven weeks one period seven weeks seven times seven is what all right you put 49 right down to that if you wish okay that's one period brother brown said talks about three periods this thing's actually what I'm going to show you today okay all right shall be seven weeks and threescore and two now what's three score 60 what 62 x 7 to see nothin well no 61 62 x 70 is 434 years my blood hmm yep got that 49 years to drive back yeah okay audience ago all right 400 so now and for 34 and 49 183 but remember Daniel saving two weeks is 490 year okay all right so they must be one week left or seven years to go according to the Bible in the province message all right so watch now if you want to you can put right here this is I got the cross hook cross watch here's what we're going to get to a t30 from brother round now what he's going to say a t-33 a good many times now you can say what you want to but I divide the Bible says he hid it from the wise and prudent right he's got in his mind that Jesus is 33 years old and if it's a slip of the tongue that's okay but watch it only fits at a be 30 right okay and you'll see in a minute we're going to read all that he said about 80 30 hang on this man I'll get it out of my heart come from here cuz there's six times he says it all right here we all right here this is the first one now what is Palm Sunday the way before the resurrection no get not your time to make accomplice no I'm not going to treat you because I don't want you to get your mind or nothing else but these time this time period here okay Jesus rode into Jerusalem on back of a white donkey remember he's fulfilling scripture on Palm Sunday sandy before the sunny he resurrected April the second 8030 Jesus runner in Jerusalem Palm Sunday 8030 now from BC 455 baby 30 it's 475 here but now remember you got to get for an 83 is that's where you got to convert it to the member we converted it to the 30-day 360 day year 93 on see 2,000 for it comes out as I could born 84 years all right now let's go to next one hang on the old one now look on the seal they stand it in the seals he changed that he was wrong in the day this is what people in the message say they were wrong and damn selling the weeds and he got correct him in sealed well this is the sixth seal by this time they auto corrected him pretty much I don't understand that they went now look he's talking about now if you'll back up a minute remember when he takes Matthew 24 24 and shows that Jesus preached the seals already in Matthew 24 breaks it down and shows all six seals were priests in Matthew 24 he's telling you the date that he preached them but watch these three verses it took place actually on Tuesday afternoon they rode into Jerusalem on Sunday Monday Tuesday April the fort look come how the man knows what he's talking about because he said he wrote into Palm Sunday on April the second Sunday Monday Tuesday 34 April the 480 30 and the first two person took place on the afternoon of april of 480 30 so he changed I don't see where right ok right now watch questions and answers 1963 now we know that Jesus was slain about 80 30 then I okay over there that we got a t30 all right now right there with that cross he is around 1830 doctor with a cross here is about 80 30 that's another what I want to do it don't you get these these are benchmark go and give us these little benchmarks to find the consummation got it all right now that's that's two days that we for sure know that 445 bc 280 3483 years according to the 360 day count ok and then Jesus fulfilled the first four of these feast days right here he he pull field all these for Passover 20 was killed he killed when unleavened bread next day firstfruits he resurrected the next day Pentecost is when he came back in the believer but he has not come and fulfill the Feast of the trumpets Day of Atonement a decent hour angle literally that has not fulfilled it to Israel they teeth they keep them you understand every year they keep these dates okay guy but you and I brother ground says that now we'll give it little later brother brad says work we we Gentiles are now feasting on the feast contractors absolutely God tabernacle e in human flesh now God's not tabernacle to human flesh in Israel yet right I said yeah don't remember that's when they get an understanding right into it dormilona unclean bus alright alright so now if I got that so we got these other three feast days that we're going to have to deal with right here for the return of Jesus now to us this is happening but to the Jews that has not happened yet okay please fulfilled all these so this is going to be important when we get back to this week right here where he's cut off it worth it the sacrifice an oblation will cease in the middle of the month of the middle middle of the week you're going to find out where these dates go forward and backward and when you find the month alright so now if I got that you got a t30 now in the original chart brother Brian put 87 years when cottage destroy to see that's this person right here and after three scoring two weeks on the side be cut off after 62 week right but not from cell of course it was for us and the people of the press that shall come shall destroy the city now that was ties right cuz remember Daniel 70 weeks covers the people and the city kite has had it Troy that city and take that temple worship away because remember they were still doing temple worship after Jesus died bed resurrecting this ended they were still doing sacrificing right remember they sowed they saw the curtain by God right so you know they were they were literally making stuff you know still thinking that no Messiah's coming but in 87 he's when Tyler's destroyed the whole thing got rid of it there's been no temple worship sure they've been pieces hearing pieces there and they're trying to now but it's going to come together we're reading the damn seven weeks book it's going to come together they're going to be able to go by it doing temple worship that's worth that treaty is going to be signed right here for seven years to let them do their sacrifices let them be Israel legal alone but in the middle of that week he's going to step in that temple who the Antichrist and don't step in that temple and say look I've had enough of this I'm going that's going to make a man but watch after pitchfork a week and Tyson come up and help him sell the people trench to come shall destroy seen sanctuary and the end thereof shall be able to play and to the end of the war desolations of return and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one we know up that has nothing to do with this that's the time of the Gentiles got it we've been over this but I just want to know you know mark it down so we can we can really see what's going on time of the Gentiles now got this little mark right here and just leave it alone for a minute see this little hard for him leave it alone for a minute okay just leave her alone all right so now and he shall confirm the covenant with many for how long one week there's 483 years already finished so there's one week left to the Jews and to get us into millennium and them into the Millennium building of the temple after the rapture takes a lot longer loaning in seven years that the people in the message say that there's only three and a half you left and that's not true according to the Bible toward the prophets message guidance miss 483 years already finished there's exactly seven years left now that's how much that's 2520 days you need to keep that in mind okay that's 25 120 days not 365 and a fourth day that's 360 days to the Year seven years equals 2520 so now look with Nathan one week and in the midst of the week what's in the master middle right here Grand Ave what's up there that little bead mark I put their last year that's when he's gonna cut the Covenant off in the middle the wait right here that will mark my thing he shall confirm to go to me for one way right hook you going to convert a covenant with many for one week now we're in this week that's correct well no that's the government to clean that line and that line really is a seven year it's a seven-year covenant he shall confirm the covenant million for one week he's going to make a seven-year deal with Israel but and in the midst of the week 3 after three and a half years why does that coincide that's gonna coincide with the 1260 days at the prophets prophesied to get out to get out the 144,000 all right he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation decision for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation that's what brother Brennan saying he said we plane so we find out when that consummation is he said we'll know because you know what the bride knows that when they can find that consummation oh you got a difficult back seven years are 2520 now Pete when the message can't fit that in there because they said they saying that the 70 weeks today will end right here it in there okay sorry cam ok now let's go if you want to you got a t30 you got time of the hen house you got your 1260 days 1260 days you got your seven-year coming up right here at the end right which is this week this is what this is the last week got it right now let's go one more to 1977 run around any time to use in 1977 okay now the first one he predicts is in 1960 all right then in nineteen sixty again in conferences the week after I predict these things will take place honey Ephesian Church age don't know when a city and I don't know when it will end but I'll predict it'll be done by 1977 all right I predict not the Lord told me but I protected according to vision right so now the Laodicean Church age he's talking about it ending by 1977 and the church will completely go into pasta since you'll be after that the mouth of God I think that's always been happening all right but what he comes in the 70th week of Daniel we just read it Amanda gonna watch now counting the time this is what we read last last week we find that we have exactly 17 years left we have the same span of time given to us as gone dealing with us in the power of the Holy Spirit sensei d30 don't get confused for 1977 all right now mark down in your book a little scripture here Leviticus 25 8 now take that little piece right there that you see inside the Gentile age and put 1977 so that is a benchmark to me that's to be I think that's what he's telling us why would he bring it up and down 72 h 1 2 3 4 4 if it was okay so put 1977 in that world marker wizard Gentile eggs that's 1977 so put that down because it's important all right now now mark down your book this is what we was that last week now maybe I lost somebody but we're going to do it again mark down in your book a little scripture Leviticus 25 8 now we went to leviticus twenty five eight one does Leviticus 25 08 say number the Sabbath of days seven sabbaths Sabbath happens over seven years a sabbatical for the resting of the land seven times seven is what now remember the Jubilee is on the 50th year if I got there the Jubilee is on the 50th year or the first year of the next 49 year cycle there is no 50 year than one when they come up to the 49-year the priest said this is the Jubilee the next year is the Jubilee here it's the first year of the next 49 dives your overlap all right now here's what brother L said God called the Jubilee every 49 years the fiftieth year was the Jubilee okay the fiftieth year was the Jubilee we know that we understand that from the first jubilee of Leviticus 25 a in 1977 will be the 70th jibley what seventy times seven 490 he's telling us something that we really just didn't understand making exactly three thousand four hundred thirty years do you believe that going up to release all right did you get that from kitchen says day man God is dealt with less exact the same amount of time they dealt with the juice don't tell once they went went Leviticus 25 8 he goes way back little bit at this 25 8 10 8 30 a 33-30 dirty right here is 1954 year and now I can fit four years from here to the 1977 square he's getting his number okay all right we have about 1937 years we got 17 years left of 77 will be the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of you believe now Daniel 70 weeks we have our Jubilee now if you're born again you're in your Jubilee year right we understand them but remember Israel is little Israel it literally is in a jubilate they have a jubilee right the Jubilee to Israel is what the millennium now all right so now this isn't this is 11 you to see from last week if you take all right now you take 1977 is the 70s you believe now that cannot be a 71st Jubilee KBS 71st 1977 was our Jubilee of the message of the hour coming into clarity and the old Pentecostal aids going out twombly Brown shawl that he saw ad he saw in 1977 that something was going out and something was coming in the going out to the Gentile Church and return of Christ of the Jews will reinvent when they go out of bondage well then I'm gonna buy the bondage until they start preaching this message over there I decide when guys started revealing The ministers in the message Greg that's when they got out of that old well and I think 77 all the old ones that felt 77 was going to be the Raptor they left got rid of them telling them old father's brother ground safely in the wilderness God had to wait till all those old people that came out of Egypt died in a new generation spring up to go over in the from fling same way today so this is the promised land to Israel remember we read it well you should read Ezekiel 45 to 48 it tells about their millennium right huh oh well we may old in in Revelation we rolled in Revelation okay cuz he think what 77 was it now lick don't hear ya think yeah yeah those the ones that came up the word line believers and they died all right hello oh brother watch close now I don't miss it it will be the Jubilee of the going up of the Gentile bride and the return of Christ to the Jew he didn't stop there common when they go out of bondage he said go over together gay he talks about all the time they saw what they saw my brother branham spoke about it in look the tape still playing brother going to look takes to a plan I don't want anyone who misunderstand don't misunderstand now saying brother Monson Jesus will come in 1977 I never said such thing Jesus make hell today but I predicted that between 980 30 but now watch then I remember he had his vision in 1933 right the seven visions came in 1933 so he stands between 33 and 77 something would take place and it did okay but watch now if the 70 in 1977 was the 70th Jubilee all right if you count now look he said according to Leviticus 25 8 so at 1977 and 49 it's already a twenty20 26 write that on your chart very laughs mark on the chart very last mark on your chart okay 2026 why because in 22 if we go to 20 27 now look I mean I'm not predicting or profit sighing I'm just telling you the dates fit and we may be off a few months or a few weeks or even maybe you got remember if you say you know brother i was killed in 1965 but it was in December he lived a whole year of 1965 before he was killed and you'll watch and see when we get into this that one of the Jubilees happens at the end of our year and that is hanukkah around Christmastime around December feast of dedication all right not our faith not our pagan face that we have over here no all right so you take 1977 and act 49 years because if we go to 20 27 or beyond I believe we're breaking scripture because that makes you the 71st Jubilee all right that makes it a 71 there's this no 71 Jubilee but gosh way go on this long to get rid of the check you know shape the old people out and get rid of the ones that don't believe that's what happened in Israel I mean really by the way and then yep there is no 71 do with it because from the time that Israel from 445 to Christ that was less rice I've certain a 70 people to release their no no 70 70 Jubilees okay from the whole from the whole thing yeah back a little bit of his 25 8 all right guys all right so now no it could be 1954 years from 445 a seat across collects four and A three years but you gotta go back to Leviticus and a real good that's my life Schofield because outfits a couple of days he tells you about what time that riddle sit in Daniels time bc 538 it will tell you but so if you go back to leviticus bc 14 9 you're going to have a lap back up together 499 54 years all right now we're one 1977 plus 49 is 2026 so the year 20 27 or 28 whatever you want to save doesn't matter to me if we go past that then we're in our 71st you believe there is no safety first qubit there's only one 490 years seventy times seven so if we know though now if we know what time then it ends remember I said we could the consummation this is the consummation everything is destroyed the cities built we come back right in the Millennium these days are going on sure time continues but right here is the consummation that that Daniels talking about it Daniel 9 27 all right right here even until the consummation okay all right the reason you're saying 20-26 is because our 490 years is run average that's great you're 490 years of Daniel Stephanie week we're run out in 20 26 are some wear their clothes and I'm saying some wear their clothes all right got it but there was 490 years from the time to the tenth the temple started being built to cry that's great from the town yeah it's not on here it's on your on your chart from right here see because look this whole thing of Daniel 70 week can only be four hundred and ninety years now take this out look you got to take Gentile lay down but brother branham the prophet of the hour left us a mark so this is the conservation and if we see according and will show it later on but the reason that that struck me is you know Roosevelt 1974 he showed that we could go to your 20 26 and not break my brother upset well that number 20.6 kept coming up even in people of denominational ideas and views that number keeps coming up and there's two years told you there's two years and we'll look at it next Sunday two years that match remember you gotta have so many moon cycles eighty five or six or something like that twenty-five hundred twenty days x 30 it only happens in two in three years it was not it was a 2014 we know obviously that didn't happen it's this year 2016 and 2019 well 20 this one won't fit here because that's nine years or ten years basically that one don't fit the Lord offense that one is he got good seven years 1260 plus 11 safety 25 in 20 days so that's where we got that number by later other way uh-huh you go back to 445 subtract for a 3 comes up to 38 maybe shouldn't be a t-34 45pc to a t-34 anything here well it's not remember we look back over and you got it that's the same thing you got to watch were you year ends in fall and remember he was changed the calendar was changed that's one God hit all this what I'm say it is is we got close as we could get all right we got close as we could get all right but I believe when you come over here and now we've had a profit come on the scene look back and see that time period and he used for 45 Big C so I'm going to have to make it fit that's what he said right we've read that ok 44 45 283 alright so now you got to remember though he was crucified um April though they put forth was on Tuesday 5671 crews five and eight 17 30 30 hey now that 445 bc i don't know what time of the year the tech was finished are done you got to remember watch like sent my brother around he got killed 1965 well if he was killing game where the first 1965 that was a whole year short but he died in december 26 and that's a whole nother year where you still not in 1965 you see how much time we got to look at in them there's a lot of time that's what i'm saying it it's not exactly that's close we're going to get real close in here I believe real close cousin one brother Brown said so let's nobody is you believe if I understand that 27 if you believe since the beginning of do you believe with in 1977 so there's a mark we have to go by that nineteen seventy seven is a mark that we have go by alright we go by that mark and if we're right here 1977 was about a run over in there right in the seventh church a all right so now if we put 49 years own to that we get 20 26 ad if I got 10 but we got that 1977 plus 49 if you go to 50 that's another new delay you can't help saying first you believe so that would be 71 x 7 and that's not for her name 480 is seventy times seven if I got that there many times that one you've only got that's why I said about that i'm saving the week we know one thing's for sure God is going to deal with em just like 144,000 they know it will be hundred forty-four thousand now there's nobody hundred forty-four thousand into but that's the two prophets calling out 144,000 is gonna be twelve thousand from this tribe don't tell me how God knows that but I know I know that cuz he knows everything there's 12,000 exactly from this tribe in twelve thousand exactly from this traveling 12,000 exactly from this tribe okay now the question came up one time was what about the women and the children diagnosed it four thousand of a tribe of twelve tribes is going to be better if they got cheering that's under eight of them cheering going with it okay guarding only belong to me that's too specific it's really nothing to us but that's how we got our numbers all right so you got your chart look back on a chart look at the numbers that's where we got our numbers then if you take 20 26 and back it up seven years when you go to have a seven years left out for the Raptor to finish up all this this gotta happen to Israel you got 20 19 and we're going to look and see that if he breaks the coated in the midst of the week let's say it was Passover go back three and a half years you got October so we're honing in on a loner on a month now okay what if we don't have enjoy nothing oh I'll still come yeah okay yeah whooping because remember we all here time really do the gym is one gets the time but that last week's got start somewhere it starts when we leave so we can't start until we're gone we're holding up this whole one week demq profits can't prophesied listen let me be real specific if them two prophets have the Holy Ghost when we go in the rapture they might go in rapture somehow they don't have to get to all those after we leave cuz they got the Holy Ghost Eric brother Brown said all holy those believers go interactor now he may make an exception for two prophets but there's somewhere right after we leave they're going to get the Holy Ghost cuz God is going to withdraw from the Gentiles and go over there the Jews they're going to hear a message just like to know that pen cops they're gonna hear a message could be brother branham could be brother Dale could be brother Bob brother Louie weeks any of here a message and say we missed it and God strike that revelation in their heart and they got 1260 days off any day right here Thank before that could be studying they can be trainable I can't get to hold you yeah but I mean that could be studying how to save it yes how that can travel life stuff and get active lately right right right again let's go what about when they come back come on do I know then the strings they don't get the Holy Ghost and down no they probably that guy is dreams after the plumbers Academy breaks they can't get you the Holy Ghost that they all happen so you gotta get I gotta give 44544 now he gets okay alright cool that's that problem after the day and then going around my god good look yeah
