========================================

can you be seated also I'm teaching Sunday school so be in prayer for me let's see here this is kind of a last minute scripture that I thought of put in here um because I wanted to open with a scripture and so I didn't put in my lesson so y'all can either read along or just listen to me read a little bit out of First Peter 4 it's kind of appr with the lesson 1 Peter 4:3 for the time pass our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lust excess of wine revelings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of right speaking evil of you let's skip on down and above all things this is verse eight Above All Things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins and you remember I've been on this lesson of love and talking about love lessons and falling in love with the Lord and and putting you know love in marriage and and that marriage itself is an opportunity to learn these lessons about love but all these other relationships in life teach us something about love filo love but also as being a type of agape love on down verse 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy all right I'm going to uh open in prayer for this lesson and I actually have to Sid step a little bit I'm probably not even going to get into the actual love lesson today because something been bearing on my heart that I want want to share doesn't even really tie into the love lesson so I may not even get to that part but it's really uh burdening me so I want to do that okay Heavenly Father we pray you just bless this little lesson Lord and just help me to just calm down and just and just teach it slowly in a way that could be understood and just let it be a blessing to your children I pray and help us to understand more about this Divine Healing and um and the things you've done in our midst Lord in this time of this interval that brother Way's been preaching on Lord we know you're in our midst we know you're doing Mighty things here and and just help us to be awake and alert and see exactly what's happening in this our day we love you and thank you in Jesus name amen so brother Boyd I had an episode here recently of Divine Healing or you could say a miracle I really I would call it a miracle because he testified up here that you know um that God healed him from diabetes and I I've known quite a few people uh I don't know much about diabetes but I've always heard of people being diagnosed with diabetes and it's one of those things that as I understand you're basically stuck with outside of a miracle outside of Divine Healing it's not something that medicine can cure or whatever and so it's a it's an out of the it's an unusual thing for somebody say God deliver me from diabetes but if you um just from my perspective okay I don't know all the little nitty-gritty details specifically about brother Boyd and his situation but I know he's at church all the time and he's always up here his post to dut he always singing praise to God even if he don't feel like it and then besides that he's not not confessing the negative things not always talking about his symptoms and he got up here a while back and read this long diagnosis of problems that he had been diagnosed with and then said now the Lord healed me from all those things and his own wife as I understand didn't even know he had all that so I'm making a point that there's a lot of examples of you that I could name that have done that same thing that you stood and been diagnosed with something you're hurting and you act like you're healed you confess you're healed and you don't talk about the symptoms you don't go around confessing the negative things and that's what I want to emphasize and kind of put and kind of highlight is uh in this little part of this lesson because it goes over look we say Well thank the Lord Brother Bo brother Boyd was delivered from an incurable disease thank God and we go on it then we forget about it but I don't want us to forget about it I want to really put emphasis on that and say that was God and he's not over the sea I mean he is over at these uh other churches the big name preachers the big churches but he's here in Lula and this little church you know and amongst each of you in your lives if you just don't overlook the God in your life and meditate on the things he's done for you and don't belittle these little healings and things that take place Divine Healing is a process it takes time and Faith to uh to keep believing God the new birth is a process it takes time and Faith to keep believing God so we know God hides himself and reveals himself in Simplicity and that's why I'm saying we'll Overlook these little things where God is moving in Lula because Ah that's just brother Boyd ah it's just that's just brother Wade that's just whoever and we're familiar with each other and we'll Overlook the God in your life and I like to look at it like this God's big in my life but I like to know about the God in your life that's why I'm so big about y'all's testimonies even of those little things it seems like where God did something for you and he was in those little things he's always in the little things we leave unlooked so he hides himself and reals himself and simplicity maintain brother boy I was just talking about you by the way maintain a positive confession at all times refrain from a negative confession at all times okay this applies to healing and salvation um a lot of the reasons why I'm saying this is this does tighten to my love lesson in one sense because in my love lessons I've been talking about reading the Bible and praying as a way of falling in love with the Lord and some people might say well I don't feel worthy to read the Bible I don't feel worthy to come to church I've done a lot of bad things that's why I read in First Peter 4 there about the things that we have done in our past we all have that dark past that we're ashamed of and even maybe today still struggle with that root of evil if you're still starting in the early part of your journey in sanctification you still have that root of evil that's normal you're nothing abnormal okay if you go on and and still struggle with sin because you're still starting on as a baby in Christ you've been born by the spirit of God you started your journey you you're believing you've been Justified now you got to go through this sanctification process and in that you're still going to mess up you still might look at pornography you still might cuss you still might drink or smoke don't care I'm an open-minded person I've got a deep dark past too I will not condemn you and if I find out about any of those things that you've done I'm not going to look down on you CU I know what I was I know what I was tempted to do I had a struggle with pornography from 1996 when I gave my heart to the Lord all the way up till 2000 somewhere in there and it was a hard struggle and also profanity so dealing with looking at bad things and and using bad words but I kept going on with God kept believing God and begging God to forgive me and begging God to take it out of me in the Baptist Church where I was at that time I was told you can't help what you do you just plead the blood I was not taught sanctification nonetheless God was faithful to lead me to sanctification I started reading my Bible every day in 200 and sorry in 1999 started reading my Bible every day I was 15 years old and it was about probably 6 months after that when pornography left me forever that's been 24 years I think that Devil's dead if a if something is gone for 24 years you can pretty well say it's dead I like when people get up here and testify and say well Lord deliver me from cussing it's been two weeks now I'm like that's good but keep on going I like to hear about somebody that's been delivered for something for a year or two four five years cuz you know you're not suppressing it then it's dead same thing with profanity I said my last cuss word when I was 16 and in um probably I guess it was the year 2000 and haven't you know let haven't slept up since that was not me I had tried to stop I had tried to suppress those things for years leading up to that point from 12 to 15 and 16 years old I tried I hated that demon I hated doing those things yet not knowing how to overcome it and I said God there's got to be some way he's so faithful to bring me to a place where I could learn about sanctification but it was already taking place and I didn't know it act like you're healed even when symptoms persist act like you're saved even when Temptations abound and even when you may be fall into those Temptations and when you fall down you get up you brush yourself back off say Lord I'm sorry ask forgiveness for those of you've offended and ask God to forgive you and just keep right on going just don't stop no matter what every time I hear of somebody coming to the Lord I say to them just don't stop I'm glad you came to Lord congratulations welcome now don't ever quit don't ever stop reading your Bible don't ever stop praying and come to church no matter what you do no matter how you sin no matter how you mess up you're not too far gone from God and I sure won't look down on you I know what I was so just to name a few examples brother Dell he's the one that's always been telling us you know make a positive confession you would never hear him talk about what's hurting him in his body he could have terrible back pain you would never hear of it positive confession refraining from a negative confession I said brother boy a w go make an example of him uh sister Monica I remember her mom was she was passing she sister Monica's testimony was always positive her mom passed anyway and I was surprised but then again you look at brother white preached recently that God is Sovereign it's our job to pray and believe and confess all right when somebody dies anyway or goes on it's just the Lord's will but but she kept a positive testimony all the way throughout that so many of these widows here I can make examples of you believe for your husbands they passed and you just kept right on serving the lord kept right on coming to church the very next service I love that I really I really honor y'all I mean y'all are amazing to me um Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever this is Brother Bam's personal testimony about that terrible stomach problem he have that I think we often forget about how bad our Prophet struggled himself with illness and his little battle he had to overcome he said I had to believe either the doctor or what God said they had doctored me for 2 years and done nothing for me sorry about this little part I'm trying to cram a lot in I know you can't really read that but anyway uh he had corn beans and onions he basically he forced himself to eat food he came to the point where he said I don't care if it kills me the doctor said it was going to kill him I want eat solid food I don't care if it kills me and he ate it it came back up he ate swallowed it back down came back up he swallowed it back down people say how you doing he said mom said how you feel I said wonderful went down the street and I was going down the street singing I can I will I do believe I can I will I do believe someone say how you feeling Riv said wonderful I can I will I do believe Jesus heals me now and yet he was regurg you know the stuff the food he had eaten was come back up and you just swallow back down and keep on going that's what you have to do sometimes this is a real needy greedy battle and times it's not supposed to be easy I know it's kind of silly cuz I'm a scrawny little guy but I'll demonstrate for my girls some of my girls are getting to the age now where they're having real battles in life and I'll tell them girls you have to get down like this you know I I I just illustrate it but like a you know football hold or something like you're fixing to just tackle the devil and say come on boy I'm not stopping at nothing and the way you do that there's no physical fighting in it the way you actually carry that out is get up every day read the Bible pray those little foxes that spoil the vine those little things you leave undone are the things that'll spoil your experience you know you get down every day it's not really fighting with the devil it's more like get behind me Satan I want to read the Bible today anyway get behind me say I'm going to pray today anyway I'm going to listen to sermons anyway even I don't feel like it when I was going through depression and lust and um and profanity the devil sit there as a teenager sit on my shoulder and say hypocrite hypocrite i' flick him off and I say shut up I know I am I'm going to read the Bible anyway shut up and I wanted to die I was coming to church here even in like the later on experience 2002 2003 I was depressed and wanted to die constantly want to kill myself come here put on a smile act happy none of y'all knew it and I go home and I want to die and I'd have suicidal thoughts and think of how I'd carry it out and then I'd read the Bible and through my tears sit there and read the Bible that's getting down with the devil and saying come here boy I'm not stopping I won't stop do what you want to do I ain't going to stop so act like you're healed even when you when your symptoms persist right we're on a long journey I might make it just a quick illustration of this if you were going say from California and you had to go all the way to New York it's a long journey but the main point is if you're going to make that long of a trip first of all head in the right direction we're on a journey in life you just in general when you want to head from California to New York Head East if you do nothing else just head east I don't care if you're on foot start walking if you don't have any M of Transportation just walk and maybe you stay faithful in that little walk it seems impossible to get there maybe the Lord will give you a bicycle but you just keep on going now you're riding a bike and you're going across the country it's going to take forever looks like an endless Journey looks like it's impossible for you to get there and yet maybe the Lord if you stay faithful he'll just give you a car one of these days and now you drive maybe he'll give you a GPS and he'll and now you start to hone down your navigation skills and you're getting more and more headed in the right direction and you're getting uh getting picking up the pace accelerating as you go this is just exactly like your Christian Journey you start off so far from God so buried deep in sin such a terrible Dark Life you've lived and yet you say I'm not gonna stop I'm gonna serve Christ for the rest of my life no matter what and I still remember when I was 12 gave my heart to the Lord in the Baptist Church and I said if I live to be 80 I'll be serving Jesus Christ I'm not going to stop no matter what he's the one that's been faithful to come along when I didn't know the message and brought me into the message he gave me my Bible reading at age 15 he inspired me to do that and then the message when I was 17 and every time I needed more for my journey to accelerate my growth he was faithful to put it right there in my path he's always faithful you just keep on the journey keep going keep headed east you know what I'm saying just keep going in the right direction at least we're all in a journey here uh continue on brother B's testimony mama called the doctor she said well he said why it'll kill him as sure as the world then brother said I did in other words I died to my unbelief now I got alive and in faith and now with Christ Jesus that's right he said I weigh 165 lb now but he weighed he said I weighed 118 lbs and take him at his word believe it confess it no matter how you feel believe it anyway he said so Abraham believed God and it was appeared to him for righteousness let's skip on down to paragraph 37 he's the high priest of your confession see they are making intercession your confession what you believe all of you in here that's saved tonight just get in your head that you're not saved and go around saying no I'm I'm I'm not saved no more you're not saved that's a big word for a Baptist isn't it that's true you're backslid whenever you do that that's right I believe you can backslide all right but you see you've got to have your testimony and your confession positive not according to my feelings but according to what he said that's it accept God's Gift then if you accept it on those basis and believe keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying it I'm Healed I'm Healed say it until you actually believe it and when you believe it then it's going to take place don't have a negative testimony every time you confess well I still feel bad today I guess you I you go right straight back to the same rut you was in in the beginning okay you'll never live above your confession so this is again getting down to the nitty-gritty fighting with the devil in 2005 I was diagnosed with uler of colitis I simply came up here to the altar whoever was here it was brother Dell I don't remember who was hear that service ministering but I came up and said I'm just having a stomach problem please pray for me I didn't tell them now I'm bleeding my guts out I'm hurting I'm borderline anemic the nurse said I'm anemic can we please you know I'm having this awful time I can barely stand up I'm doubled over at pain all the time and I'm screaming my head off in pain I didn't say all that I just said having a stomach problem can you pray for me well he did and I put that devil right here he's still here if you come up here and look from 2005 I laid him down right there amen okay now as far as I recall I never went back to the altar no matter it lasted six months that time it was gone for seven years I never thought I'd see that demon again he brought that box of rattles stinks back to my doorstep in 2012 and say I'm I'm back I looked at the package and I said I see it says Dell Bonnet that's my grandpa he died with that same thing says Brook me my sister she's had a Worse episode of it than I've ever had but they don't say Ryan that's that's not my pack package so I I print out a return shipping label and I said and I sent it back to him said you can have that back I want to give it back and paid the actually Christ already paid the return shipping but signed the check said you have that back Satan it's not mine which means I didn't tell anybody I didn't confess I was having a problem again even worse than the last time I didn't confess it didn't say word to anybody Gabby's the only one that knew and there's reasons why she had to know but anyway I didn't tell anybody here kept posi confession and didn't come back to the Altar for prayer he was still right there still dead dead demon dead dumb devil still sitting up here at the altar still dead he just showed up again and I said mm it's not mine so lasted me six months whatever syptoms went away again I said I'm Healed the whole time do you understand I was in agonizing pain at times and at work driving a tractor trailer having to go to the bathroom a dozen times a day you read between the lines there's some humiliation there's some problems that face and yet I said right in the middle of all that I'm Healed that's right thank you Lord for healing me right in the middle of all that that's what brother bam did here he just fought it out that's what brother Dell did so many times just fought it out and that's what a lot of you have done just fought it out just don't stop fighting said I'm saved because I have met the conditions that Jesus Christ required for me I'm saved according to the Bible is that right see and not because I feel like I'm saved and you kept with your confession after a while worked righteousness and all your neighbors and everybody knows you're sa now because you believed it you confessed it see we're talking about healing and salvation back and forth here but why what happened what changed you he's the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father making good what you're confessing you accept him as your healer renounce your feelings is not by Feelings by faith say you're healed believe you're healed act like you're healed associate with those who believe in healing and God will bring you right out of a perfect and to a perfect soundness of Health he will not fail don't never look at symptoms I think uhhuh yes yeah amen amen if you can hear that she was saying she listened to that sermon this morning and so thank the Lord so this is a part about that I have to interject about um this also ties into my love lesson which I'm not going to get to but maybe next time about being a temporary hypocrite this is me okay this is you when you starting your journey you're a sinner have all your problems and you're coming on a journey like I said to uh a saint okay from a sinner to a saint there's a transition it's not just one time come to the Altar and all of a sudden slam bam thank you ma'am you're a holy Sanctified life and and pure and walking with the Lord no you still have a battle to go through you still have maybe pornography profanity I don't care just keep keep serving Christ with all your heart keep believing keep confessing keep reading the Bible keep praying keep come to church no matter what but you're going to be a temporary hypocrite I don't know how else to word that hypocrisy means the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs you're claiming meaning you're confessing okay you're telling everybody you're a Christian and you're starting to into a new way of life that you haven't come to before so claiming to have moral standard beliefs which one's own behavior does not conform a pretense so in a sense because you're still looking at pornography or still drinking cussing smoking don't care what you're doing maybe using drugs whatever I don't care there's a part of your life that's still having to die that root of evil has to die out okay just keep going or in 20 years if you don't keep going you'll still be right there you'll still have pornography you'll still have profanity you'll still have all those other things 1 Corinthians 6 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be you not deceive neither fornicators nor idolators idolators nor adulterers nor feminite nor abusers of themselves mankind nor thieves Covetous drunkers revilers or extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you we all had our time that in our time past but you are washed sanctified justified in the name of our Lord Jesus by the spirit of our God okay um this is something I'll just kind of skip over this right quick brother bam talked about that Indian Chief and me as a white dog black dog he said how do you get along he said pretty good pretty bad well since me received the Holy Ghost he said there's been two dogs one of them a white a black dog one of them a white dog and they argue all the time the ground of fighting and uh said Chief which one of them wins the fight he said it depends on which one Chief feeds the most you've got got to feed that white dog and starve that black dog to death starve him to death don't feed him nothing he will die but it takes some time there's a dying resist the devil and he will flee Bible didn't say right away resist the devil and he will flee I I would resist him I'd flick him on my shoulder he'd sit right there and linger and I read the Bible anyway he'd say hypocrite hypocrite I didn't read the Bible anyway I'd cry crocodile tears want to die um look at pornography and and use cuss words they sit there and say hypocrite hypocrite say shut up I'm going to read it anyway I'm starving him that's what I was doing he's gone okay um feed the white dog starve the black dog I want to read over my notes to make sure I leave something out so as again I said why I'm talking about all this is because I know so many people feel unworthy to read the Bible and come to church and and you um it's just hard to stay going because of what the devil tells you you are and he might be right and you might be a hypocrite for the moment that's not permanent you're just in a transition and just keep going said I'm also not giving you license to continue in sin that Grace May abound as Paul said I'm not saying just stay right there you know don't just keep you know intentionally you should try to stop looking at pornography try to to abstain from things of evil but at the same time know that you're going to slip up from time to time in that sanctification you're going to slip up don't let that hinder you don't let that be a cause for you to just give up all together Romans 6 what shall we say then shall we continue sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer there in okay I'm going to see if I can skip on ahead Romans 10 that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in th heart God raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation 1 Corinthians 10 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted Beyond which you are able but with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you can bear it don't let the devil tell you your uh odity you're just you're a little bit too far gone from God you've messed up too much you're doing some sin that's just a little bit out of the way pornography actually opens up this gate it kind of breaks down your walls if you will like a castle it kind of breaks down any kind of fortification you have and lets in all manner of other sick all manner of other perverted Spirits because in the time after the Lord delivered me from it I'd be reading my Bible and I thought i' I'd find all the Terrible Things the children of Israel did and I said I either did that or was tempted to because of pornography it looks so innocent but then it lets in all these other things that just totally just breaks down your character and lets in all kind of things you musicians can go ahead and come please so let's see if that's about it here so it winds up that we have this uh um Armor of God the scripture talks about let having your loins GED about with truth and the breastplate of righteousness and all that it kind of Paints the picture of this great big Warrior but if you want to see The Greatest Warrior that's ever been look at the bottom picture there of Christ in Gethsemane great fighting the greatest battle that's ever fought and dying to the human will and saying father not my will but thy will be done let this cup pass from me my will is that this cup would pass but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done and he gave his himself to the will of the father that's this putting on the whole armor of God that's this toughening up and fighting in the devil it's not really physical fight it's a spiritual fight and it's a it's a mind battle this greatest battle ever fought it's just getting down and reading the Bible every day no matter what come to church every service and listen to sermons as much as you can just keep on this Christian way and doing everything you can for the Lord constantly every moment God bless [Applause] you
