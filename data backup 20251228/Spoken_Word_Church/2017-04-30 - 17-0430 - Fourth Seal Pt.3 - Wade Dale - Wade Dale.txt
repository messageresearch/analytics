========================================

but I did we're going to be um going to be getting out of here but 15 after so we'll uh go and get started so everybody have a good week I hope all rejuvenated and ready to go [Applause] yesterday welcome to Georgia Georgia weather supposed to be 70 tomorrow I think so it's not going to be too bad thunder showers thank the Lord for the rain we've been getting everything green and growing which is a lot better than was last year all right let's um let's go and get started I said last Sunday when we finished that we would start now this is the fourth seal part three and keeping our mind that the Rapture takes place when this seal breaks the Rapture takes place okay when you when you break when the four seal breaks you go into the fifth seal then the bride in between that time is gone right cuz she's not here she's it's what you got to see we're not here when any of the physical seals open physical okay but we are here spiritually we're in that lap over time right the seals have a lap over too they sure one abruptly ends but you got to remember though that that the white horse rider the Antichrist started riding back in the first church age and they continue riding right on through and it's manifested in a crowned Pope Antichrist at the end so so they don't stop it just continue going but there is a there is an ending but remember the ending of one is the beginning of another right and then you take the Seven Seals which has to happen in time because seven is completion but seven is also a Time number we have to see that and see that's why this the way the Bible is like brother Chris was talking about last Sunday it's just you know we think we're getting all the Revelation now we're just getting right we're just getting enough to squeeze us into a body change and squeeze us into the into the future home but after that the full the full opening of the word okay cuz I mean this is all we have base this is what we base an eternity off of I was thinking about that um last night for this afternoon but what we get here is just it's just we're just watering what we got here because we have a limited listen you know as well as I do like I said 15 minutes worth of sermon is all you get don't tell me your mind don't wander most of you fall asleep and you cannot listen while you're sleeping so but but what you do is you get your 10 or 15 minutes you get something from God and you go on well see what when we get to the Future home your your mind is unlimited right you're a God yourself that's true brother Brown said you got enough in you now to go create a world and go live on it which means time tra you can travel through time to this um world that you created and you can go live on it so we think we're and we are we are at the Apex of Revelation time that's right okay right I was thinking the reason I was thinking I'm going to go back and do a series on the fall because before the fall before the fall listen now Adam the Bible says Adam was the son of God right that's right and that Eve was not another creation she's a continuation aren't we brother Brown said we are the continuation of that creation Eve was the continue if if Eve had not come into being Adam would not in full because remember when God took a rib out put it in the put it in the or made Eve what was their name no it was not their name was Adam Adam so she was a continuation listen if we're the Omega Eve we got Alpha Eve and Omega Eve which you got Alpha and om got the beginning when you come to Eve now remember that was done before the fall amen so we're a continuation of that creation Now Well Eve was absolutely a continuation of the creation of Adam remember God didn't take another piece of dirt that's what I like what brother Chris he didn't take another piece of dirt we've heard that 100 times but then you get that and you get that Revelation that she was a continuation of the creation she wasn't another form individual that's right right she was Adam that's right until to fall she was Adam she was Adam made manifest in another form okay and then she got the name Eve all right so so here we are in the end time and we're Another We're Not Another yeah we are another creation she was another creation but she wasn't God didn't take a lump of dirt and make her out of it right it was a continuation of the creation of Adam everybody understand that i' never seen it that well until till last Sunday she's a and he never say anything about that but you get to thinking when you start thinking about those things yes she's a continuation of the creation of God right amen all right so that's what we're looking at here we're looking at these seals and we're you're there's certain things that we get certain things we don't get that's true um there's time elements that we are going to get some of this and some of this we're not going to get you got a natural happening natural this is a natural happening right cuz look false Christ shall rise and shall deceive many that's a natural happening that's happening now right right the white horse rider is riding now through the church ages as a false anointing all the way up to the end time all right so same thing here now but we have to get to go back and get the spiritual aspect of the whole thing like I said about the fifth you're going to see this more in the fifth sixth and seventh seal because in the fifth and sixth seal we definitely are not here when that happens physically and and spiritually we're not here when the fifth and sixth seal opens right but we have to have the understanding of Revelation of that seal five and six we have to have that revelation of that before we can continue on to a body change okay but the natural happening is in the future right most of Revelation now if Revelations 41 excuse me context flipping over Revelations 4:1 to Revelations 19 is not to us and we're not here when it happens okay that's what the prophet of God said that's right then the greatest part of re or the biggest part of Revelation is happening when we're not here but we have to get the spiritual part of that the spiritual Revelation you can't te brother didn't say take Revelations five cuz man why take Revelations 5 out of the Bible that's the most Sublime scripture in the Bible he said you can't take five out of the Bible but you have to have understanding that we're not here during that period of time this is not here yes cuz remember in back what we're going to talk about the fall back before back before the fall look brother B said Adam LED or rule the world just like the Holy Ghost now does the Holy Ghost have limitation So Adam had no limitation that's what I mean there's two people in the Bible that to me is a I don't know if I could live that way would have been Adam and Noah Noah was before the flood right he saw All That civilization Before the Flood he lived 120 something year or more than that couple hundred years before the flood he walks out of that boat and everything's destroyed right he's got to start all over again Adam the same way Adam tree mooved this you know go here do that move this push this over here animals you do this now look God doesn't have to do it and Adam didn't have to stand there and go now elephant I want you to eat I want you to eat right over there I want you no it was led by the spirit of God Amen it was led by the spirit of God and Adam was led by the spirit of God to do the things he did and then all of a sudden when he comes down to the other side of the Fall he loses he loses all that power now I don't think he lost it abruptly I think he gradually lost it but how do you think Adam had to be a doctor cuz remember there was nothing nothing to be sick before the fall that's but there was something in Adam now he wasn't the Healer he wasn't God allight Amen but he was close he was a Son of God to and when he comes over into the fall and he starts having to deliver the babies take care of the sick bury the dead now he never had to do that all them ever how many millions or hundreds of thousands of years that was before that so he had a a culture shock right he had eat and never got sick now I can't say Adam wasn't sick forever how long he lives 900 and something years he wasn't you can't say he wasn't sick he had to become sick cuz he died right right so you see what I'm saying about Adam you know he's standing there controlling the whole world and then all of a sudden that leaves him you know Jesus on the cross you know he had that anointing on and then when the anointing left him he said my God my God why has Thou forsaken me amen if he was the second Adam then the first Adam didn't get crucified but he did take on what the sin of Eve that's right amen not the natural act but he took the the type is he took Eve to keep God from killing her cuz basically that's the way you and I are to keep God from killing me and you we had to have an advocate we had to have a husband that stood in our place right not some sex sexual act that's a bunch of garbage right I mean that's just really perverted really so anyway but it was the act of him not going Destroyer I'll get me another one right no why he knew where she came from Christ knows where we came from there's your predestination he knew where Eve came from and he knew Eve was an extension of him and without Eve he couldn't be complete without remember without Christ but brother Brown said Christ Miss gville he said without Eve or without the bride God is not complete that's all right so you see the two parallels uh here at the end time we're coming back to a place of uh in that know the three-fold purpose of the of the pull is is number one is the number three take her back to the Garden of eeden why cuz there was no sickness back then there was no sorrow there was no pain you know I believe Adam could travel like a thought why was why you going to put limitation on somebody that's that that come from that Genesis 126 man and had no limitation amen so you see now y'all don't have to come next Sunday so that's what we're going to talk about so now let's talk about the four seal but you got to remember the four seal when when we make a statement even when brother Dale makes a statement you have to take that statement and you have to analyze it right you have to analyze what's being said because if you don't just like I told y'all a couple of Sundays ago Paul got up and said we are resurrected right now think about that I'm I'm trying to put myself in Paul's Place he's in Athens and he's preaching to this big Coliseum of people and he's excited because God has given him a revelation that he has resurrected from within s already sitting in Heavenly places he has been caught up out of the age that he's in and he's preaching it so strong that two people in the back two preachers get their own Revelation that the r that the well the resurrection already happened well now that's totally impossible and Paul goes back and tries to explain he don't try he does he puts in the Bible he explains that but he turns Phil to I reckon they just keep preaching it and they don't pay him many attention cuz he turns them over to the devil remember for the destruction of the flesh so that's the way we must in this end time with so much l of Revelation and I mean layers of Revelation because you you if you apply it brother Brown just like brother Chris said good point I enjoyed his his preaching really enjoyed it but we got the picture right and I believe we're now getting the cow out of the tree that's right right putting him down here on the grass but now you've got all the elements that's right you got the grass right you got the seal that's right you got the tree okay you got the cow it's just somebody put the cow says Resurrection already happened they put the cow up in the top of the tree and Paul's trying to go no no no no no no we're resurrected s in Heavenly places cow goes down here where he eats grass all right so that's the same way I believe that the that the five-fold ministry is what is for the perfecting of the Saints what not to perfect you physically you got to be perfected spiritually and then that wer into the Physical Realm cuz remember your body cannot sin that's you sin in your spirit and your soul so why know always people would understand people um well I won't say anything online but but you get questions you know you got to go back to the basis are you born again or not if you're not born again you're in a whole different just like I said about the layer if you're not born again why worry about marriag and the that's right why worry about you know somebody watching this or not paying attention to me not do are you born again well no so you're just doing what the devil's told you to do that's true amen so that's the same way with these seals you're not going to understand your part unless you have the new birth that's true you're not going to understand and it's not your own Revelation but you do have to have your own Revelation amen CU that the sermon that brother Dale preaches the serm brother Chris preaches you're going to get your part and I may get another part that's true right all right and for those of you that are looking for Daddy's sermon on Wednesday night it's not there you you didn't get the email oh yeah YouTube pulled it off the oh yeah I did get that yeah okay YouTube pulled it off you have to watch your titles now when the title was examining yourself right well take that in a worldly sense so they took it in a worldly sense and pulled the sermon off the internet so if you're looking for it it's not there yet uh Joseph is disputing it but they put everything else on there but right the word of God they can't put on it's almost laughable but it's the devil I knew he'd get in there somewhere and cuz YouTube you know as well as I do YouTube is a Melting Pot of junk it's on our it will be on our website but it's not going to be on YouTube no we archive our stuff through YouTube right no it won't be on is right no but J is working on it so huh there's a raw file of it I'm sure yeah he's got the audio not yeah you get the audio but not the video but you see what we're coming up against we're coming up against demons in all different places you use a you use something and and Satan shuts it off so anyway so we have to watch our titles maybe a little bit word them a little a little bit different so that the world won't think we're talking about something else that's the same thing well that was the same thing what those two philus and hus they interpreted what they heard and you know what they must have preached lengthy sermons about it because Paul told them quit then he had to turn them over to the devil the Bible said so they must have not listen to Paul and it was absolutely just like Martin Luther was protesting the Catholic church and they were going down burning the churches and throwing the priest out in the yard you know you're we're doing what you said he said no that's not exactly what I said you know he said I want you to come out of that thing he said but don't burn the church down right you know the doctrine needs to be burned right not the building the doctrine needed to be burned I'd have looked better on them if they had to beat the priest instead of the building but that's where the doctrine came from but you see what we're doing with these seals though this is this why I'm stopping at number four because we must at at least get the part that you say that's for me because look you're not going to be hated of all Nations you personally cuz Russia don't know you that's true Canada all you see all Nation but what it is is when you come under the umbrella of the message of the hour the truth they hate the truth and if you're under that umbrella they're going to hate you too okay all right it's not going to be that all Syria hates me all Syria hates the word of God the syrians the one now we got some Believers in Syria they're under that same umbrella we are okay so we've got bride in every nation that God's going to that God's going to give a revelation and take in a Rapture but they're also going to be persecuted by their own Nation but now [Applause] look but you're going to be hated now remember Nations is not buildings Nations is people the people you going to be hated by this nation that's right okay you're going to be hated by this nation but you're not it's not going to be there's not a United States devil that's right there's a there may be in the United States demon right but they ain't the United States devil there's one devil and he wants this whole world to fall under his rule right cuz in that who then shall that's what I was thinking when then shall they who's they the riter of this for Feld okay okay cuz remember the Pale Horse is all the doctrines mixed together okay it's going to be now brother Brown said when the World Council of churches comes together the only thing I I was talking to a Baptist lady yesterday and she was she was saying how this Evangel IST was dating her cousin and I know her cousin's divorced I said now Lisa I said Baptist used to not put up with that she said well my preacher's not divorced and he's he's you know he's right I said well what about these and I and I brought another instance in the family that we are all aware of that somebody married somebody that was divorced she said well I guess that's okay and now I said it wasn't okay in the beginning why is it okay now see what I'm saying so they're softening up what I'm saying is they're sof and not the person she just hears it from the blit right the softening up of the people is going to take the Catholics and Protestants and put them back together for a short period of time but now I I believe though that when they get sucked into that the World Council of churches get sucked into that romanism remember that Pope's going to pop up in that six seal Pope's going to pop up and he's going to when we're gone he's going to what sign a treaty and then what's going to happen I believe at that time I believe that's when all the Protestants are going to realize what they' done cuz remember you got foolish virgins that's going to be through this three and 1/2 years of Ministry of the of the two prophets right that the Pope's going to Reign that or the Antichrist is going to rain but the battle of Armageddon brother Brown said was Protestants and Catholics so what happens is you're going to have a hierarchy of Catholicism and then you're going to have these people that have separated just like they did in Martin Luther's time but in Martin Luther's time there was other Church ages to come so God couldn't destroy everything then but now since the church ages are over since the Bible's been you know Jesus can't come back to the Jews listen to me Jesus can't come back to the Jews until Moses and Elijah preached 3 and 1/2 years okay there's no way he can come back to the Jews before then right so there's got to be that half year Ministry of the two prophets preaching Jesus Christ to the two w to the through the two witnesses to the 144,000 and then Christ can destroy the Earth he cannot destroy the Earth before then now sure we can get this pre-tribulation and all this stuff earthquakes in diverse places that's what it's telling us here and want hate each other and kill them and all this stuff many false prophets but you can't have that battle of Armageddon until that 144,000 God promised them 144,000 there's going to go home right okay so that's you know like I said the resurrection is what's is what's barring us we we've come to a place I hope y'all see that we've come to a place to where the the Revelation has come to a place to to Resurrection is the next thing okay and you know what right in that little time there's going to be the third pool you know brother B said it's laying dormant now but right about the time they they come in and start clamping down on us then we'll need the third pool which will be the speaking of the word we'll need that little bit right before Christ comes and picks us up that's right but remember when he picks us up time's going to continue on brother Brown said people going think they're getting saved with all this horribleness going on they're still going to think they're getting saved during that time so it's going to be so secret till we're just going to vanish a such a small group we're just going to vanish but listen we're going to know that we're getting ready to go because when those dead when Robert Tatum walked through that door and and and brother Tom and and Gary and and Rich Marlo when they all start coming back into here we know that we fixing to go home we're fixing well actually we're not going home I'm telling you you got to remember our home is the future home this Earth is not our home in the Millennium that's right remember we're here on honeymoon now do you got a honeymoon on your at your house now some of you may have did after you got married but me and June we went to Gat P Forge okay we went some else for our honeymoon you know what we did we came home after the wedding was over after the honeymoon was over we came back home so that's what we're going to do we're not home home is the future home that's where our home is and that's after like I'm telling you we're a thousand and something years from that anybody got that so what I'm trying to say this whole thing is watch your layers of Revelation when somebody says something analyze it see whether it's for your time yes because look uh we're going to speak this afternoon on former lat rain you've got to get you've got to get under the water before you can get wet that's the rain won't do you any good if you're under a shed right take some of your plants and put them under the put them under your porch now you do before the frost but now if you got a real good spring rain and you just planted something you got them in pots is the first thing you do when it starts raining is run out there and put them under a shelter no you leave them out there let them get wet let the seed rot let it what blow up it's got to die when something dies remember when something dies like the prophet of God said it blows up okay so that's what we got to do in form a latter rain so we'll talk about that this afternoon but that's the same thing brother Brown taught us this the seal preached you know seven or eight nights a sermon okay then he he put it in bits and pieces all the way through till he went home like brother Dale said you watch you know you you see that brother Ram has come up to a place where he sees things more clear so he preaches these different things that he didn't preach the fullness of before the seals open why he had come to a level that he knew that number one he knew that God was working in his life yes I believe that I believe God he knew God was working in his life so much to what he said was going to come to pass he was a prophet he was prophesying right that's right so let's read this right here and then we'll we got to go upstairs in a minute then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another now look at this this is going to happen right before the Rapture CU remember the Rapture happens on the for Cale then shall many be offended and shall betray one another is that not what's happening now yes in the ranks of the message that's right and hate one another listen there people in this message that hate me for one brother Dale they'll hate you they hate us why they hate somebody je us they just don't have a true Revelation okay I'm not saying that they're not born again but I don't think Hate's over here in the pyramid anywhere that's okay then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and look at what the people are doing the people now the message preachers it's not the people either people left and come look at this church even since I've been back since 1998 these people come and left come and left come and left but look at all the preachers now that are coming and leaving and leaving and leaving and leaving and just leaving congregations right we know know that just leaving congregation just I'm not preaching no more I'm leaving well you're betraying the people that's right you're betraying your office number one but you're betraying the people you think you're going to get hurt no the people are going to get hurt and then that's going to cause people to hate each other yes many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many you look now now I of course like I said I don't I don't watch preachers on the internet I used to a long time ago I don't anymore but if you look now that things have kind of been quiet there's not a lot of false Doctrine now we know it's still out there but they're not pounding it hard like they used to pound it that's right like the the son of man and like the River Jordan and all you know the one preacher that kept preaching it it's kind of laying a little bit but what's happening they're leaving they're going completely away from the message not just keeping their false Doctrine they're just completely cuz they're being deceived and you know they tell me that somebody that's really depressed just can't see tomorrow right you can't see a positive tomorrow can't see why even live tomorrow to me that's when you get deep dark depression it say a misy is when you know it ain't going to get no better and tomorrow ain't going to get no better and the next day ain't going to get no better so I'm not going to get no better well that's what the people in this message the the poor people in this message the problem is is they're not sitting under a progressive now some are sitting under a progressive to where that everything kind of and you know what it may not go but I was thinking the another day that right there by itself is real thin you can't hardly that wouldn't that wouldn't bother you I mean you know see how thin that [Music] is but you put 50 of these together together and it's about that tall M you put a 100 of these together it's about that tall so it's really not the it's the once it PP starts piling up you got what I'm saying we know it's the little foxes that spil the vine but what do them little foxes do they grow up to be big boxes that's right so what what I'm saying is that people are letting false Doctrine intimidate them and say well if this is all the messages is I don't want any if this is all they got you know don't see an end but but I in this in the excuse me in the seals I see an end yes brother R said the Seven Seals the end of the struggling world right the end of all those things that's the end right if the Seven Seals Reve to you then then the struggling end of the struggling world you're done with this struggling world that's right sure we're in this world we have things we have to do but yes but if it bothers you so bad you will go crazy that's right but if you just say you know you're in the hands of God right make sure you're Mak sure you're born again sitting where you can hear the word of God and then apply the word of God to me other than that I don't get involved in the little frivolous things but we need a revelation of this seal because we got to come to this ceiling and we going home that's true okay so just think about that till next Sunday
