sorry brother bob's not here today but um he has uh quarantined himself and his family so they're doing okay we talked to him this afternoon and i said we me and brother terrence talk to him this

we're going to start again with uh back with the two spirits um we're finished with the uh uh speaking on the why does the heathen rage but i want you to i want you to understand one thing they're not gonna stop raging this is the beginning as brother dale said this is the beginning of the end everything's getting in place everything's getting in position i was talking to brother claude a few minutes ago and you know he having the virus and all people want if listen if you don't have a desire this virus or this or your tummy ache or your big toe hurts keeps you out of church that's what me and brother claw were talking about god's gonna find out and i'm not god god knows but you're gonna find out if you got like your daddy always said if you got the stuff he always talked about having the stuff and it ain't until it ain't at the picnic you find out if you got the stuff it's that the battle is when you find out if you got the stuff he's talking about having the baptism of the holy ghost to keep you and to get you from point a to point b b didn't he say i will lead you and guide you into all truth all right so it's this is a shaken time it's going to tell whether we got it or not and then you're going to be one of these two seeds that we're talking about are the two spirits two seeds but tonight we're going to speak on the four horse riders because remember brother branham tells us in the seals he said thank god for the opening of these seals for the many different doctrines he preached why am i against organized religion in 1959 but he said in the seals was revealed he said i know now why i hate that thing the denominational spirit why he saw it in those horse riders but we're going to see if we can uh pick him out a little bit in the book of genesis and still continue on with the two twins but we're going to um background just a little bit since we hadn't been been speaking on this in a couple weeks so just bear with me first john 4 verse 1 and let's bow our heads just for a moment remember pastor appreciation bring your cards bring your gifts whatever you got next sunday for pastor appreciation sunday i'll be speaking so he can relax a little bit more and truly remember brother bob remember brother aaron will be in mobile this weekend and brother luis will be in jacksonville this weekend right brother okay just remember them as they travel and go and minister the gospel to these places thank goodness we can still go not like brother george quinn that they can only go two miles in ireland two miles think how you would be if you only could go two miles i couldn't hardly get gas yeah couldn't go walmart goodness what'd you bring that up for but you know what we we don't know what's coming we don't know with this next thing coming up we'll just just pray god will do for his bride i promise you but i'm telling you we're going to find out who's got it and who don't i was thinking today i was reading in the book of luke about ananias and sapphira brother ram said there'd be an anonymous in sapphira in the end time which meant it's not the people just going to drop dead could but they're going to spiritually die right in the middle of a church service and never be able to recover again never be able to recover again that's what that to me the anonymous fire experience is is that you bring iniquity into they brought iniquity in they knew they shouldn't have done that and they did it anyway so we just need to keep our minds clear keep our hearts clear keep our keep our conversation clear keep everything clear like i said brother louise was talking to other the other night you know you you just can't you need to keep it clean keep it clear if you got something against somebody you better go talk to him somebody got something against you go talk to him do something don't just let it fester because you know what it doesn't get any better until you confess never will it get any better until you confess your sins or confess your faults the bible says one to another amen so let's bow our heads thank you lord for this evening that you give us i pray lord that you would take the words that we have put together on this paper and lord just weave it through the heart of your bride lord may it never leave us may it lord be something that even if we come to a place we can't meet that lord will have enough as you told the prophet to store up the food well now lord these buildings are not store houses but we are the storehouse of the living god and lord we need to pack that food in as much as we can as the time approaches lord that we don't know what's going on but we know you hold tomorrow lord you're the one that orchestrated this from the foundation of the world you knew before knowledge what would go on and you made a way for your little bride father we thank you for that be with the sick ones that are among us here also be with brother bob and his family the different ones that are struggling with the virus the the list coming from brother dutch it's getting so long of different ones lord we pray that you would just minister to each one father and we'll have faith and it'll rise up lord that we'll not have to worry about this virus in your little bride but father we have to go through these things we pray that you would sanctify us for this journey you've already pressurized us now i pray that you'll sanctify us in the name of jesus christ amen all right so now let's first john 4 verse 1 and if you've not if you've not been here for a while um and i'm not i mean in the service i mean in the church for a while brother dale preached on the seals way back in the 80s but he also preached in 95 and the different times about matching pieces but he also preached about the seals in genesis so we're just kind of redoing and renewing um and and not redoing you can't redo something that's so good you can't redo the word of god but we're going to bring it back to our attention because i feel that that's why the seals opened the seals open to break those two seeds apart because they were so close brother brown all many times thank god for the opening of the seals why he could see then because remember he preached the white horse rider was the holy ghost in his earlier ministry mighty conqueror i was just reading it just a few minutes ago even in the seals he said i'd have made a horrible mistake if i went by my notes what the notes were that that white horse rider must have been white so it must have been the holy ghost no that was that deceiver that had slid in under the garden of eden and hid himself in religion and in us okay so let's just let's go through this real quick first john four verse one beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god that's what's happening now i believe because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god i really appreciate brother branham as many times as i hear brother brown preach on one god and line it up correct i like to hear him just continue to tell us about one god what he said you know when we were sitting here you know watch listening i believe that was very that kind of got us in the mind that jesus christ is almighty god but he had positions that he had to fulfill not one like your finger but not three like your finger he he said he pulled them two together and planted that tree and it became a great tree which is a revelation of one true and living god and you know what you're a part of that don't forget you're a part of all that you're part of the father son holy ghost you are part of jesus christ not a separate person a part of jesus christ amen so every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist where have you ever heard that it should come and even now is already in the world year of god little children have overcome them because greater is he this in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god hereth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you may be seated in the lord address blessing to the reading of word let's go through the two quotes that we've been uh quoting now for some time and let's get our hearts and minds back together on the two seeds the two seeds that are not like this they've grown up together right man they've grown up together brother brown said they've intertwined right we'll read that in a little bit so let's bring up the first quote in the exposition of the church ages now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless now what did it do in the church ages that's where your horse riders were riding in those church ages hello they were there in the they were in the garden of eden this is not something new they were just exposed or brought to the forefront when brother branham broke when the seals broke to the prophet he could see where that rider came from and where it was going right so making it lukewarm formal and powerless do you read a few minutes did you hear what brother brown said remember a father son holy ghost is not it has no power right titles have no power right names have power but he gave them a little wink or a little nod to the church agents because what did brother brown say remember he was saying there i i wish we'd re do it over again he said why does that woman act the way she does she hadn't been taught so down to the church ages yes there was a true bride there was a true holy ghost filled bride but they had no idea that they were actually working part of the way in satan's domain because remember father son holy ghost baptism never ever came out of the mind of god never was a part of god that came from the pits of hell the prophet of god said but he allowed men because of the teaching that's why brother man had to come brother brown had to come and teach us and it separated the two seeds amen it exposes satan see he hasn't been exposed like he's been exposed now that's right this is the hour he's going to be so exposed what's he going to do he's going to be driven out of us and go into the beast and the world system and all the different things that you see coming up now with all this new all this new stuff coming up it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word now what did satan do to eve he describe he didn't say it's not right right he didn't say naive god's a liar he added one word to what god had already said that was it one word and the discrediting of god's word to discredit god's word is to be off one word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what is she she's the sinless spotless no wrinkle bride of jesus christ amen we got to start realizing that that's not what we're coming to that's what we are amen and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church now where did he see when that white horse rider came up that day when the revelation came brother branham was in the room and the rebel he was getting ready to preach his old notes that the white horse rider was the holy ghost and what would that have done that would have exalted satan just like it did in the garden of eden it would exalted satan to a position that he that he wanted but god wouldn't let the prophet do it amen thank god he wouldn't let the prophet do it so what did that do it exposed satan to being the while horse rider so we're going to see that in a little bit because remember it's a spirit it's a spirit of antichrist we read that right here in first john 4. it's the spirit of truth and the spirit of error like i said before don't try to put stamp names on people it's spirits we're fighting against not people okay so if you hear a certain brother preach error pray for the brother because he has been what he has been anointed by a wrong spirit right not that and he may not be wrong he may not be wrong he may have the actual baptism of the holy ghost that's what in the end time that the problem is is that you can have the baptism of the holy ghost and preach error but you won't continue to do it if you're exposed to the truth that's why brother brown had to preach those seals it exposed the truth and the error amen everybody okay with that so keep in your mind now that the four horse riders are what the white horse the black horse of the red horse the black horse and the pale horse everybody got that saying ma'am and then there were four combat beasts lion ox man and eagle that combated those four horses everybody got that same man because listen that's what we got to combat because remember when those four horse riders disappear that means you and i have also disappeared right right we're gone we're not on the earth anymore after that that's why the rapture takes place there on the fourth seal we've been in that we may get into it later on if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her let's read number two did you get that now get it now there are those twins again we were speaking on twins which is cain and abel we're going right back to them again there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same earth what earth is he talking about this earth right here oh no the devil ain't nowhere you're a liar because he still plays with this thing right here all the time can't get your soul if you're born again but those two trees are right there in your garden of eden that's right that's right working in your spirit realm telling you right now that somebody is doing something wrong and this one's saying something this you don't understand what i mean this is his playground why because that's the first womb his brother dale was talking about sunday that's the first wound that he entered in the garden of eden was this womb right here all right so now look so but god you know god chose the heart i know that but brother brown said it's got to come in here first then drop down because we all are feminist brothers and sisters so we have a spiritual womb which is right here your soul your heart the heart of you there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment do you know satan is partaking of the same nourishment when he walks in here he is a worship angel he is not some evil something but yes he is but he's so slick that he can come in and he can sit right here with you and just whisper things in your ear oh let's just worship god but forget about the preaching let's worship god and let's just let's then let's let's talk no he didn't say that right he's he's wrong here and he's wrong there you understand what i mean if he doesn't do you that way please pray for me please pray for me i mean really it's a battle amen drinking in the same rain what is rain the washing of the water the word right but remember it doesn't go in the people that don't have the baptism of the holy ghost but you that have the baptism the holy ghost that water goes inside of you you're washed by the water of the word you're you're what you're clean and set aside for service even being sanctified even with the baptism of the holy ghost there's a day that sanctification we know that amen and benefit by the same s-o-n oh s-u-s-o-n hmm i was reading in luke if you're reading the loop remember judas iscariot had a part of the ministry of jesus christ he was counted peter stood up and said he was counted as one of us preachers as brothers right until he did what he did so he preached the word of god he preached the message of the hour heal the sick raise the dead but remember he never went to pentecost so what did he do his reign was falling on the outside the anointing was falling on judas that never had a chance to go in judas because he went and hung himself before he could get to pentecost now watch that's the same spirit that came off a cane right but cain turns around and kills abel judas turns around and kills jesus you understand we'll get to that in just a second okay but they came from different seeds one tree is for the word of god exactly as god given and loves it and what obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of god and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own crews and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did who came who ended up killing abel listen cain didn't kill abel because he didn't like him he didn't he didn't agree with cain's doctrine we'll get to that in just a few minutes but fear not little flocks stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of satan the depths of the darkness of satan this is the darkest hour that's ever been why is it the darkest hour we've got the greatest message that ever hit the face of the earth why is it dark because god's blinded the eyes one word off right not all this denomination we'll get to that in just a second when we get into the horse riders the law of reproduction let's let's continue on i just want to get your mind back in the back into the furrow of the ground that we've been plowing in let me tell you something i have felt horrible for a month not covered horrible but i have had just problems after problems last sunday i had to hold on to the pulpit or stun wings turn into before last to hold on to the pulpit just keep from falling over i've had these real dizzy spells and i have all these different weaknesses spells and all stuff like that but i feel good today you got to go through this man you got to push your way through this you can lay down if you want to right right but i choose to keep going you choose to keep going quit don't don't don't quit well i'm telling you i couldn't hardly turn my head without grabbing a hold of something but my blood pressure was fine and everything else is good it's just the old diablo right louis just the diablo the devil but i feel good tonight law of reproduction now remember god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself so every seed has to bring forth of its kind and yes when i was doing your mother's funeral also i couldn't hardly stand up on that pulpit but you know what we went through it we got through it just fine and you need to still pray for the family there the beautiful family man i learned i learned i learned enough about her mom to know who what kind of person she was and never met her day in my life but as i said before it took god breaking that ointment of of um that alabaster box so that we could smell the fragrance of sister barbara and i see it through the kids see you you see it through your kids and it was wonderful the funeral was one yes it's a wonderful time when you can see somebody that's that's went from death to life in their soul and they ain't gonna die no more but you can still smell the fragrance of her as she walked through as she walks through the earth and their children and the grandchildren they all did a real good job speaking of their of their grandma so i thank god for that that i was a part of it and i appreciate that and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seeds so every seed must bring forth of its kind satan knew that so he knew if he could get into the mind of eve then get into the womb of eve that god would have to make that seed come to life a human and human makes a human right okay it was just that satan couldn't use adam so he used the second best thing he used the beast which could coincide with eve and they could produce a cane now genesis 1 26 is the same law of reproduction and god said let us make man in our image and in our likeness but remember in genesis 1 26-28 even verse 28 go down to 28 says be fruitful multiply replenish the earth and subdue it you think man these it's just never was it sexual never was it sexual it was it was always going to be spoken word seed children because how did jesus come even though he came through a womb it was spoken word seed children amen so you and i now because of our first birth we're dying but by our second birth which has nothing to do with humanity it's all the spoken word of god one day god spoke the word and it materialized inside of you right how simple is that but so profound that the world can't see that that was god bringing his children into being all right total part of god not a not a different substance that's god in another form we know now called the bride it took a prophet to tell us that that was a bride not every because you know what all denominations because of their teaching thinks this is all mankind and god said let us make man our own image well well that must be all mankind you hear you read a lot of commentaries well they said that is all mankind that is not all mankind that's his own self being made manifest in another form called the bride then we see in genesis 2 verse 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostril the breath of life and he became a living soul and working towards something here and the lord god planted a garden eastward of eden there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground he made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant now remember in genesis 2 7 what did he do he then formed the human part of man and put the genesis 1 26 man into the man named adam that's right everybody got that say amen all right so what is jesus christ he is the second adam that doesn't need a woman hold on hold on he does but he doesn't need to plant a seed in a woman to reproduce you by the new birth it's by man we live by a woman we die amen my brother my answer quote brother brown tells us that but remember that woman was deceived but remember right here look he's he brings the separation colon this is his thought sure he brought every trees over adam and eve because there was fruit in the garden they were eating eating food okay but now this these two are not trees to eat off of as we know how to eat it's spiritually eating the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil they were right there in the garden side by side which was if you want to say it i'll say it if you don't want to say it then it was jesus christ or christ standing there and satan standing there and at one point brother brown says it was eve yeah was the tree of knowledge of good and evil why because that's what she partook of and once she partook of that tree of knowledge of good and evil then what they died we we all died right everybody got that say amen first timothy 2 verse 12. i know i'm getting i'm i'm treading water here but i'm trying to get something but i suffered not a woman to teach her ears up authority over a man but to be in silence for adam was formed first form then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression now look at this deception though the reason i'm still bringing this out that deception continues on till today because brother brown said eve still thinks she's right so it's the same spirit the same horse riders that are riding through the denominational world right you say oh that's meth is that that's me and you if we have our own creeds different from the word of god so don't just let's just don't push it outside remember brother braham said in the framework of the church he's talking about in this building right here this building right here and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression now look the word deceived their deception means to cause to accept is true and valid what is false and invalid remember what i said before at nicaea satan was there and god was there and i see it rome 300 excuse me 300 a.d they had a meeting satan was there and god was there doesn't matter how many men you like i said we're not talking about men brother brown said the prophets were there pr them old prophets the people they had the bride that had the word of god they brought the word of god to nicaea and satan was already there now look who won satan's creeds won over gods because man decided it right right and god's not gonna he's not gonna go over your free moral agency i'm telling you he's a gentleman right so the deception was though they accept it as true and valid what is false or invalid god literally had to wink at the ignorance of all of us because of the water baptism we were brought under and the eternal hells and all the different and even the things in the message the two souls and the seven thunder all the different doctrines that's rode through not here but written through our mind there's a deception there because you know what there's only one truth and there's one error there's only one truth that's the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ one true and living god no eternal hell all the doctrines that the first church had but by 300 a.d it all went away sure i'm sure there was a few that held on but remember even luther and wesley were trinitarians they held on to those doctrines from nicaea that was so strong that horse rider was riding so close till it almost deceived the very elect through those church ages so don't think it's going to be any different now folks it is not going to be any different now it's just going to be at a higher level because we have the major doctrines you can have all the major doctrines lined up even paul tells us he said you can have all the revelation oh you have all that lined up and still not have the baptism of the holy ghost amen because i'll promise you i'll prove it to you when i was 14 years old i did not have the baptism of the holy ghost but if you asked some of these that were around me i could explain what happened in the garden i could explain there was only one true living god i could explain why that water baptism was in the name of the lord jesus christ but i didn't have god in my soul to quicken any of that to make it alive and make me where i make make me where i can use it and put it with other scriptures how many times have you done that you know you you've been in a boy come from methodist you read the bible and then all of a sudden you come into messing you read the same bible and you go why didn't i see that before it's written the same listen i was reading in the book of luke yesterday morning and i thought i had found another bible come on i read two or three scriptures and i'm like man i never see that and i've read luke 150 000 comes so have you why it wasn't time for the revelation yet a lot of things you just read over a lot of things you read over because you know what satan don't want you to know it number one but god you know what god will do because he's a good daddy he'll bring you right back to that place and he'll show you that he'll say it was right there all along it just wasn't time for you to get it but now in your journey you need it what a mighty god we serve matthew 6 22 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single the whole body shall be full of light but if thine i be evil now remember we're looking at the two we're looking at the the true and the and the false but if not i be evil thy whole body whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness there's your deception they thought listen kaiphas reading there in the book of luke confidence prophesied one man should die for the whole nation he prophesied he prophesied what was said in the old testament and god honored that but caiaphas was one that wanted him hung up on the cross look at the deception that's why jesus kept telling them he said if you'd have known abraham if you'd have known moses you keep quoting all these different quotes if you'd have known them you would have known me look at number three position of believer in christ let's just read the red part eve actually thought she was right but satan deceived her but he didn't deceive adam he knew it was wrong but because of the love for his wife he represented himself with sin and was condemned by the same now didn't jesus christ do the same thing sinless jesus christ took on your sin and cast and then now let me re-quote and cast out of the garden of eden look at number four why does it take to make what does it take to make a christian life the woman was actually deceived down at the bottom adam was not he knew what he was doing eve actually thought she was right she was getting some what new light now that light was darkness that wasn't light that wasn't the true light as in john says the true light that came into the world was jesus christ some new light that satan was giving her he's still giving her new light right now i didn't bring this quote but i remember brother brown said they had a holy ghost veil over their eyes to be naked and not be able to have any kind of sensation or emotion but when eve stepped out from under that she still thought she was doing right but she stepped into a lust veil to where you know what happened she had relations with the beast and therefore she had relations also with adam so she had two literal human seeds inside of her you understand what i mean when i said human seeds i know one of them was a beast but she had two literal seeds inside of her so watch this in genesis 3 14 says the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shall tell you all the days of thy life and i will put enmity or division or or put a separation between thee and the woman in between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel number five and oneness now notice the woman was not a seed remember a woman doesn't have a seed i will put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed telling her what he was going himself to give her a seed not through intercourse sexually he's going to create in her a seed glory well you say would that be his seed yes it would belong to mary then after he give it to her this is my eye god give me this it's my eye god give it to me this is my hand he gave it to me this is my voice but he gave it to me see the seed was the mary had nothing to do with nothing to do with mary it was something god did himself so the seed that was in her now this is he's talking about eve now he switches a little bit here so the seed that was in her then was a union of an unlawful act which was death she was already pregnant with the serpent seed because she had lived with the and she turned and said herself the serpent beguiled me that's right and immediately came come on all we know she said she got a child from god certainly every child that's born remember she still thought she was right illegitimate and anything else has to come from an act of god satan knew that he knew god had to honor his word see satan is not a dummy he's a very very good adversary but remember brother brown said don't ever go on his ground without the baptism of the holy ghost amen because he will trap you all right so the seed that was in her then was the union of unlawful act which was death she was already pregnated with a serpent seed because she had lived with her in other words she lived with the beast and she turned and said the serpent began me that's right and immediately came come up all we know she had to get a child from god certainly every child that's born illegitimate or anything else has to come by an act of god he's the only one who can make life glory see she was already to be mother and that never only what it did was clear up the thing of the serpent seed the seed that's in you now is by concept this is god when he says i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman this is what he's saying as brother braham's talking here the seed that's in you now is by conception in other words an unlawful act against my word with this thing here talking about the beast and you're you now got the serpent seed but i'll give you a seed by immaculate conception and his seed shall bruise the serpent's head and his head shall bruise the heel amen just let god have it if it's his word he'll bring it to pass all right so that the seed that was in we he knew that god knew she took that on and then she also took adam's natural seed but remember that didn't save her again let me warn you that that actually killed them both and every other person from the foundation of the world literally kane killed abel but if you want to put to blame you got to go back to playing on adam because when he did what he did that killed the whole human race right anything by sexual desire from then on had to die of natural death right all right everybody got that say amen all right now let's get down to the four horse riders here look genesis 4 verse 1. i brought my old bible brother donny because i got all my my cheat my cheat sheets in here genesis 4 chapter one is everybody okay it's eight o'clock we'll be done in about 30 minutes is that okay okay all right 30 minutes then we got 802 be 8 32. here we go genesis 4 verse 1 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord now look there there's your she never changed her doctrine right she still thinks she's right even as you come on across you look now i want you to understand when we preached this a long time ago we had a chart and i i couldn't find it i know brother joe could find it i preached on the ride where satan started his riding and god started his ride but if you'll go to james it says when lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin is finished it brings forth death so let's look at the four horse riders because look when lust is conceived look what just happened it brings forth sin which was cain and abel doesn't matter right i know abel's righteous but he was born in sin right i'm sorry he's born in sin started and started wrong first to begin with when lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sins finished what did cain do to abel cain actually physically killed abel so let's read this now and go through it real quick everybody all right and adam knew his wife eve she conceived now we know there was two there was two acts we know that cain and abel were set of twins and we we not know that we do know that one was from the beast seed and when he was born he probably was a big hairy guy like his daddy was but he didn't ever see his daddy because god took that daddy out of the way so adam had to raise him and eve just the way it was and he didn't look like abel so see that's the first thing he didn't even look like his brother right because that was his half brother because i you know you you kind of giggle a little bit when people ask that well it said that he that um cain took his wife down to the land of nod and then the question came up with brother branham said well who was that said well it had to be a sister well well technically it was his half sister because remember when when when the serpent did what he did with eve there was no more conception of anything of that line he turned it into a snake so there was no more conception there was no more brothers or sisters that was born by the beast and eve that was done away with then it was all just adam and eve well then it was his sister that he took to to the land of nod which some of y'all are going to right now and she again bear his brother abel and abel was the keeper of the sheep but so look at the two look at the two here but cain was a tiller of the ground who would you have took like brother dale always says about we're going to see all we're going to head down through the we're going to head down through the bible and talk about esau and jacob and all the different ones and i i was thinking the other day and i think i may may do a sermon on the unsung hero you know you got your you got your ones of faith hebrews 11. you got all that great those great warriors of faith but what about those people that slide in and do something for god and you never hear no more because i was reading there in in luke and somewhere where that the disciples go there's a guy over here and he's preaching your he's preaching our message in other words shouldn't we shut him up the lord said no let him go we need more like that well that's an unsung hero what about the 3000 downstairs that were from ethiopia they were from babylon they were from all those different places when they received the holy ghost the bible said the three thousand received the holy ghost they didn't stay in jerusalem because they weren't jerusalem people they didn't sound right they weren't jews thank you jerusalem people christine's wanted she shakes her head every time we do something like that she's so precise but what have those three thousand unsung heroes because you know what they fulfilled what jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel there was three thousand little jesus or three thousand with a message that you never heard another word of about them but there's your unsung hero that took it to their nation that woman that went to where the woman from the well she went and sold what she went back to her country and said come see a man well that changed that woman for the rest of her life she testified many many many times those unsung heroes is the ones i want to talk to the ones that appear in the bible but you never hear any more and they just keep continuing on you know they took the gospel to the world hey man i like those kind of people i like the great heroes but i like those little ones that kind of pop up and like salmon you never hear nothing of salmon he's a great general you know and he's a great fighter in in joshua's army and then all of a sudden he marries rahab and buddy here goes obed jesse david solomon and all down the line and he just pops up one day and meets this prostitute what about god what a mighty god we serve how he orchestrates all that so we can talk about it and make our tops and shadows but let's continue on and the process of time look it came to pass they weren't children when they were talking they were kind of an adult because remember adulthood in that period of time you could be three or four hundred years old and still be a kid everybody all right with that if you live to be 900 years old read your bible there were several people there was like 140 before they had their first kid right 140 you think they get it right by then but here's cain and abel though and you look at cain you look at abel cain's out here sweating in the field like esau bringing his produce in and bringing all the different things and he's making this beautiful altar abel's probably up there on the hill just got probably not uh not a million sheep ain't got many because it's the beginning of time he's got sheep up there but he's sitting back there you know and he's got his arms crossed and a straw sticking in his mouth a straw of of wheat in his mouth and just watching and then all of a sudden he gets up and he takes one of the animals he walks over there he sets it up on a rock doesn't matter i don't think he makes anything he just puts it on the flattest rock he can find and he don't have mom he didn't have no chicago cutlery mama likes chicago cutlery knives because they cut real good no he had a stick he had a probably a stick or a flint or something you know and he's over whacking this thing up and the blood's going everywhere and cain's probably rolling his eyes because cain has got a different attitude but you got to remember though there's going to come a point in time to where god is going to do the separating you and i can't separate because we look at cain and we look at esau and we look at even judas all the different ones in the bible that turned out wrong we thought he's the man of the hour this guy's a boy scout but he was the evil one but let's let god separate him for us so here we go let's read you ready and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering them to the lord what was he doing he was going to church he was offering his fruit he wasn't off somewhere in the bar room do you understand what i mean he wasn't already down in a nod doing things he wasn't supposed to do no he was worshiping doing what he thought was right and abel he also brought us the firstling of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering now right then and there we see that the doctrine of abel was correct because god accepted it right the offering of cain was wrong there's where your split starts but remember cain still thinks he's right right his mama thinks he's right cain thinks he's right now watch this here because now we're looking look in verse 5 and i've got myself a note it takes christ to separate so see because cain and abel can't separate this even adam and eve and even know where to be found in this story the adam and eve is not anywhere so god is dealing with the twins because god said look in the bible capital l-o-r-d in verse four so the lord had respect to abel and his offering but in decaying unto his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell now what did the lord do the lord here comes the separation but what does he give him first wake up what does he give him first he gives him grace god gives you grace first if thou and the lord said unto cain capital l-o-r-d so that's god speaking straight to cain amen why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen if see look this is the lion the boldness of the lion god is bringing grace to cain but now what is this also this is that white righteous man fixing to do something because cain still thinks he's right and he's getting angry about it and he's going to tell god as like brother brown said i've got it written in my bible brother brown said cain looked at god and said take it or leave it right this is all i got man that's kind of bold isn't it but unto cain and his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the lord said unto the cain why don't thy wrath and why is i counting this fallen if thou do us well right if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted amen and if thou doest not well sin lies at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him what there was iniquity found in cain there was iniquity found in his daddy satan knowing to do right and not doing it don't you think god tried to tell he didn't he didn't just let satan go i believe he tried to tell satan don't do that or lucifer don't do this don't do that but he got mad just like this this guy's doing the same thing it's characteristic so now you see the white horse because cain thinks he's right he thinks he's righteous he's got some righteous indignation he's sitting on his white horse he says lord i'm doing what you told me to do i'm offering an offering but if you don't like it i ain't doing nothing else that's basically what cain said now watch so now that white horse is going to he's going to get off of that white horse and then he's going to do what he's going to get on a red horse everybody got that saying man white red black pale got it white horse brother branham said that white righteous church came thought he was right but he was the devil himself had anointed him everybody got there okay if thou do us well though here's grace here's the lion of the tribe of judah here is the lion the word is speaking telling you me satan the whole denominational world if you'll do what i say everything will be fine amen accept the word of god and do what he says if not then you're riding that white horse or he's riding in you which is a false doctrine to begin with so what happens here and cain talked with abel now he didn't just talk to him about stock market and what his new chevrolet looked like i said chevrolet and all those different things ford's work well they weren't invented back then but cain talked with abel about what went on cain talked with abel about what god just did cain talked with abel about why did he accept your sacrifice and why didn't he accept mine why did he consume your sacrifice brother brown even says that god came down and consumed abel's sacrifice in other words he burned it up and took it away but he had no respect to cain and cain's going why what is your problem cain never thought it was his satan ever thinks is his problem it's always your problem and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him not because he didn't like him he hated his doctrine he hated that god had respect to him so he got off his white righteous horse and got on the red horse which is blood abel the bible says abel's blood cried out from the ground everybody all right so here's your four horse riders right here in the right here in the first part of the book of genesis because remember when lust is conceived there's your conception because that's two things coming together satan brings it to abel and abel says it was blood it was blood kane says no it's the fruit of the ground mama told me she ate an apple denominational mama you understand what i mean because she listen even knew it wasn't an apple jesus wanted to partook amen see how slick the devil is but he got off his white horse his white righteous horse and what happened is is just like in the you look in the seals where he gets off the white horse the white horse continues to ride amen because it's that same white righteous church that rides through esau that rides through all those different down through the old testament uh and i mean um oh come on brain moses and dayton and court thank you nathan and cora i do need help every once in a while nathan and cora that thing just keeps riding because they think they're right caiaphas got on his white horse right he said that man ain't gonna tell me what to do i'm god's servant i'm the man of the hour you know what he was if he'd have done it right that's why i said yeah that's why i said cain if he would have accepted what god said right you wouldn't have had that problem right there same way with me and you as that white horse writes through me and you if you don't kill it it's going to kill you it's going to manifest or conception is going to come forth when lust is conceived cain got so lustful not lustful than like we're talking about but you can lust for things cain was lusting for power he was actually lusting for somebody to say you're right cain you're right you're right see that's why they couldn't stand brother branham because they wanted brother branham to say you're right or i'm talking about the nomination or can you just compromise just a little bit over here can you hear that and there stands that line of the tribe of judah inside brother branham and he says no no compromise i will not compromise because the holy ghost had come to a place to where he was not going to compromise anymore he compromised in the church ages sorry he accepted water baptism like it was because of what the teaching of people just because that right there cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him it had built up so much rage into him until he killed him what killed abel though his doctrine is what killed him what kills us if we preach a true doctrine and then somebody turns us down brother brown said you kill the man's doctrine you kill the man but this was physical killing even in the dark ages we see that the red horse brother brown said that red horse rode through the blood of the saints because it was literal killing but remember this was a literal killing also this is the red horse riding through cain's doctrine every it's a die it's not a person he gets in the doctrine and that doctrine gets into people beware of that that it doesn't get into us so let's continue on real quick so we've got the white horse we've got the red horse and the lord said in the cane where's abel thy brother and he lied straight to god see how when lust is conceived now listen hold on a minute lust is not bad hold on a minute when lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin is finished it brings forth death you and i were all born under that lust veil that eve took off for knowledge we were all born under that but god made a provision for you and i not to stay underneath that because he wants to put that holy ghost veil back on you because there's your protection adam and eve were protected when they had that that holy ghost veil over him but when she stepped out from it and put a lust veil on look what happened he said i know not am i my brother's keeper oh my saying it directly to god lord look capital l-o-r-d this wasn't from a second person or this wasn't from a prophet god was speaking straight to cain god's speaking to me and you same way amen all right let's continue on am i my brother's keeper and he said what has now done and the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground the voice of all those martyrs remember when you go in the book of revelations where she has a cup that's full of the blood of martyrs where satan through the doctrine the doctrine in the dark ages the doctrine that began with even with what they call the crusade you know the crusade was nothing more than just if you don't agree with me i'm going to kill you well that's the same thing cain did it's the same devil he never dies until the very end thank god now watch thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and now watch now this is this is um white horse red horse now we're heading to the black horse because what is the black horse now look the black we know is death right but it's not called death until number four right remember the one that's on the horse is now called death in the fourth stage not the third stage third stage is black and now art thou cursed from the earth you're cursed when lust is conceived brings forth sin when sin is finished we're going to read in a minute that this really simple subject tonight is going to come down to where the bible says and cain walked away from the presence of the lord there's your death right not your black horse we know that's coming to death but it's not called death until the fourth stage and now art thou curse now what see now look god didn't kill cain he actually puts a mark on cain and tells people not to kill him why because he wants that witness to go into other parts of the world because god's got to have a witness good and bad and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tillest the ground remember lion ox man i didn't cover the ox but we don't have time man he's talking to cain the man he's talking to the man cain and cain right now is a murderer but remember show me where cain repented he never repented cain said unto the lord oh no when thou tillest the ground it shall not hand forth yield unto thee her strength and a fugitive and a vagabond shall be in the earth and cain said unto the lord and speaking straight to god my punishment is greater than i can bear why the world are you putting all this on me he's not repenting a bit about just killing his brother with his own bare hands cause remember this is not a long length of time god's coming down and saying where's your brother i don't know where he's at ain't none of my business he says but cain now talks back to the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid i shall be a fugitive in the vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me in other words shall want to slay me wow and look it's all about him no repentance no sorrowfulness no nothing no he really don't care right right he's just worried about himself now what is that look at that and i don't want to say this too loud but isn't that what a denomination is that's my brother brandon when no seals broke and he saw them white horse riders riding through them denominations he looked at that right there have you ever heard a baptist repent of being a baptist no that's their life have you heard a methodist ever say i'm sorry for being a methodist now we did when we come into the light of the message okay we did because we had a repentant attitude we're not we're the able side now on the south side we're not we're not the king side but if you stayed in now how many people have you you know you tell i've been changed that baptism is wrong you're baptized oh don't tell them that cain will rise up right can't that cane spirit will rise up and say what do you mean i'm wrong what do you mean i'm wrong see that attitude there's the black horse if that light and thee be darkness how great is that dark horse that's riding through us now how great is that dark horses riding through the world how great is that dark horse that's riding right through the denominations that's why when the seals broke brother brown saw where the devil was at number one he saw he was close to really close to him but he also knew he said i wondered why i didn't like them denominations why because it's the seed of satan sorry the people are good remember i'm not talking about people i'm talking about the spirit that they're under but now remember remember when lust is conceived bring forth sin when sin is finished it brings forth death so if they continue in that there's nothing you can do for same way with cain remember he continued in his doctrine never changed his doctrine one bit right never repented never said i'm sorry never said let me back in the garden he's saying right now scroll back down to here the next one thinking behold thou has driven me out this day he's thinking about me his own self what do you mean by doctrine of the baptist and methodist and pentecostal and half the people in the message hello listen them horse riders are right here they ain't out there they're right here behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be healed now god didn't tell him that he did the devil is pronounced earth sorry cain is pronouncing his own judgment right isn't that what we're going to do sure we're going to pronounce our own judgment and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord said a mark upon cain now remember this was brought up in the in the message and they asked a question and they thought the mark that was put on cain was black folks black people that's not true that has never been true i don't care i don't care what you think the mark in me and you is black all of us i'm talking about the blackness of the devil i don't care what your skin color is there's not a mark put upon nobody except you was born wrong i don't care who you are we were all born wrong and if you're not born again you're still born wrong cain is still wrong he's still wrong he thinks he's right the horse riders are still riding through all the way to today cause nobody's gonna kill him god's gonna let that doctrine ride all the way to the end time and head up into this right here right death and cain that's what killed cain not physically killed cain because he lived hundreds and hundreds and hundreds hundreds of years what killed cain was is he left the presence of god exactly right that's right so when lust is conceived brings forth sin when sin is finished right here cain's sin is finished he's sealed but he's not sealed with the holy ghost he's sealed with the seal of satan all the way to the end time because he god never said one time i'm gonna drive you out of the garden no cain says you i gotta leave the guard he's telling god what he's gonna do god never says anywhere i'm going to get you did he he never even said cain you're doomed cain decided to leave the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of god on the east of eden when lust is conceived brings forth sin when sins finished brings forth not listen natural death is not even close to spiritual death amen spiritual death now look there is no eternal hell but there is an eternal judgment everybody got that because once you seal yourself out you're going in that direction so there's an eternal judgment the bible even tells us there's an eternal judgment but cain decided it right here because you never hear now you know there's a lineage of cain and you know there's different things but cain's never mentioned again except the bad parts right he's never mentioned again he just kind of goes off but remember though his doctrine lives till today his doctrine lives to right now in that pale horse of spiritual death all the white the red the black mixed together that whole journey that cain took from the time he was born until the time when he killed his brother up until the time that he rejected god and then he left from the presence that's all wrapped up in that pale horse and that pale horse is death but guess what folks there's also a line ops a man and an eagle and the and the eagle brings us back into the presence of the lord this this pale horse drives you away from the presence of the lord but thank god for the eagle anointing in this end time that brought us a prophet that brought us a message that took us out come out of her my people not come out of her and leave me the presence of the lord no walk back into the presence of the lord cain could have done the same thing he could have stayed and god would have blessed him but he decided to leave nicea decided to leave the word of god because satan was there in those people anointing them and they were the religious people of the world do you know it literally took them 300 extra years to get that doctrine started from 300 to 606. 306 years they had another nice sea of council them people been dead for a long time but that new group come up that new king member that same doctrine walks right back in there 300 years later and says okay we're adopting this now we're going to have father-son holy ghost baptism jesus was a separate person from god hell is eternal there's now a purgatory in between there you see what i'm saying satan just upped his game satan just upped his game he upped his game when he went into esau and all these different ones but here is that ride that he took but when you come to the very end satan left of his own accord and there's your twins but remember it's not musicians come it is not an exact people it's not a seed line it's not a natural seed line i don't care where you came from i don't care who your mama and your daddy is if you're born again you have moved out of that family anyway you have moved out of that cane movement and you've moved into abel where it's got i mean which seth and then begot this one and we got that one and come on down to jesus christ you and i are in that lineage because of the new birth not because of a natural seed the natural seeds what's killing you let's read these last two quotes well i'll just read them you jump together no i'll just read them whenever that's you did what you're supposed to do whenever there is a revival it always produces twins that's a rude remark but it's true when there was a birth out of from isaac and rebecca it produced twins when the world was created it produced twins two trees tree of knowledge of good and evil the tree of life and when cain and abel were born it produced two when ishmael and isaac was born it produced two i forgot about ishmael and when esau and jacob was born it produced two one of them natural one of them of the earth the other one supernatural and one looked at the natural cane intelligence worker of the ground and the other one walked by the spirit it's always been that way power transformation let's stand to our feet number seven there is always twins and that's the reason don't forget this little flock now this is 1965 after the seals were open the church is in the last days the church in the last days is going to be twins so close it will deceive the elected matthew 24 24 the church is going to it's a pentecostal move it's so much like the real thing till it would deceive the very elect if it were possible and a little later on if i get the chance i want to explain what how the election comes see it's going to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing see just two fathers that's all same mother same church same movement same thing but it's two daddies what is the mother's church church is always a woman right that's what he's talking about i'm not this is not his quote now i'm going back to what he's saying the betting ground is the same where the word falls but one of them is perverted you understand say amen see one of them is a perversion because it's the wrong father which i will prove someday if god will let me that denomination is the mark of the beast see it's the wrong father he is stirring people to an organization instead of the word see it's the wrong father it's a cain movement wow why am i against organized religion it's not the people it's that thing that looks so close right it's the white horse don't tell them that people are are filthy i was talking to our neighbor yesterday jerry ferguson good methodist good methodist good methodist good neighbor he said you know what he said i stood up in the church the other day and i was surprised he did that and he said i told them people that there's no way a christian to vote democrat i looked at him you said that to them people and you're still alive because it's true but you see that's the denominational idea because he was looking at the abortion and everything the democratic party stands for and i think it's all of the devil we know that but for him to say that though even in an organization but see he still got the problem sorry the problem though is that the horse rider unless he comes to the truth he's part of that system even being so sincere that he made his point well known he's still part of that system that's how close that thing is good people in those denominations brother branham i i he apologized many times but he never apologized for talking against that organization the system that's got them caught that cane system that is still riding today and you know what it's going to ride brothers and sisters until we take a body change because when we take a body change what's the fourth horse rider right death what's the last thing we got to have destroyed death that red pale or that red black that pale horse is what we got to defeat because there's your death death where's your sting grave where's your victory pale horse you need to ride in that direction because if not he's still riding in us right but death is going to be destroyed by a group of people that understands the two spirits and and you and i can never listen to me never separated we'll be deceived every time eve but remember he proclaimed that the second eve would not be deceived she will see the two spirits and separate the two spirits and know that one is antichrist and one is of christ thank god that that was pronounced on me and you because we have hope now not hope we have an assurity we have an assurity that somebody is going to come to that and those horse riders are going to go away you know what they're just going to stay down here the only thing that's leaving is the line oxman and the eagle the holy ghost is going to lift off the earth and then why horse red horse pale listen when that satan superman stands over there in the temple of god showing himself to be as god fulfilling the scripture he still thinks he's good and the world will bow to him why we worry about president you need to worry about that guy you need to worry about not being able to see him cause you missed something that's it you missed a raptor if you see that right that man and you well you know what that means you got caught up in that system that thing's still riding through you let's get rid of that let's don't worry we love natural healing but let's take the spiritual healing and let's let that spiritual healing just push everything out know that cain movement god sent us a prophet to show us that cain movement showed us where it was at and when the seals broke he said oh the bible became a brand new book why he saw that white horse rider all the way from cain then all the way down riding just like he was going to preach the trail of the serpent same thing that's the trail of the serpent it's a serpent seed in the beginning it's going to be serpents in the end through a beast system but it's going to head up in one person but you know what christ our head is going to head up in the body me and you the only body god has now on earth is me and you right now don't worry about anything that's going to happen god's already pronounced that you and i are going to make it lord doesn't matter she will not fall like eve fell that wasn't william branham talking folks that was god almighty speaking directly to me and you just like if the lord can speak to cain why can't he speak to me and you the capital l-o-r-d god bless you really sing song sorry of anchor in jesus 157. upon lies boundless souls mighty billows wrote i fix my hope in jesus blessed anchor of my soul that would be page 157. [Music] his mercy and trust him more i've anchored in jesus the storms of life i'll brave i'd have anchored in jesus i fear no wind or wave i've anchored in jesus for he have power to save i've anchored in the rock of ages he keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessed peace his voice says still the waters and been there to mote cease my pilot and deliver [Music] for always when i need him he's at my side of anchor [Music] [Applause] [Music] satan can't find it i've anchored in the rock of ages he is my friend and savior and him my anchor cast he drives away my sorrow and shields me from the blast by faith i'm looking upward beyond life's trouble seeing there i behold a haven prepared for me back to the garden of eden all god was he poured into christ all christ poured into the church taking us back into the presence of almighty god [Music] don't ever walk away from the presence of god [Music] amen don't ever walk away from god and he'll never drive you away either he says come unto me [Music] oh if if he'd have been standing in the garden abel would have still made the same choice but when he got down here on the earth and he said come unto me all you that are labored and heavy laden and i'll give you rest oh a group of people took that to heart they said oh lord we don't want to ever get away from your presence he said now i got to go away he said i got to go away he said but i'll come back the world won't see me no more but you'll see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world in other words what i'm going to give you something to live by and all you got to do is believe what i said you can read about all these people in here you know well you can read about cain and abel and all these things but i've sealed the book until the end time and there's one group of people not 960 different denominations there's actually almost 13 000 different denominations now so there's only one god's going to speak to it's going to take christ and his word the rest will be deceived sorry the rest of this world is in a deception except for the bride of jesus christ because that's what he said he said for the elect's sake i'm going to cut this work short but look at it now all this unsettling in the world we're here is it gonna get better no probably not but like i said before don't sit around and say don't be like kane why are you doing this to me lord oh don't ever ask god that don't ever take if you're signing daughter of god it's got to be for your good god will not put anything on you that's not going to help you so if you go through a trial and a tribulation we really don't want to say lord pour it on but whatever it takes to get me in the right direction [Music] because we're sheep sheep have to be led the shepherd sometimes has to break a leg to keep the one little old sheep from jumping over the fence but you know what he's a good god he does it with nail scarred hands he does it with just like he did cain he came down to kane and personally said cain if you'll do well please but remember he couldn't override cain's free moral agency he couldn't override that but he did offer it to cain and cain said nope i'm going in that direction don't do that that is the worst death than just dying a natural death is to be alive but yet be dead the bible says she is dead while she liveth if you're not born again today you're a dead man or a dead woman walking sorry that's just the way it is get born again make sure that god is in your soul make sure that you know that you know that you know [Music] it's good to know that brother dale knows but that's secondhand information you need to know who you're serving today [Music] one way or the other you're serving but jesus told him he said you can't serve two at the same time you gotta serve one or the other amen so you decide which one let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord for this day that you give us thank you for the time that we have lord we appreciate lord the word that we're built on here father that we can preach freely to the people and they understand lord what we're talking about we know it's your holy spirit lord speaking through
