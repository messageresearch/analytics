house of the lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to where let's see no we didn't use this this morning but we've got first timothy 6 and hebrews 12. first timothy 6 hebrews 12. remember the announcements of all of the uh doing richard might order click of some air on over here because if esther is fanning it's bound to be hot out there his choice every fans will fit the building on fire we'll have a bonfire amen this time of the year it's hard to get everything figured out you know with all of it and two if any of you fooling with the the things you know uh don't fool with them without heating air because we try to get it set and then you go food with it because all this whole week the fans were running constant all the whole week because somebody had clicked the fans on so don't don't fool with it you know just uh leave it alone we'll get richard and aaron and them to to do it and take care of it but you know you come in and you find out everything's been changed and you don't know how to change it back so that makes a a bad doing amen but remember now all of those that are away today we i was thinking well ago we got five ministers and three deacons and there's not a one here just this afternoon we're doing pretty good we're back like the old days you know but they're out visiting already taking care of grandbabies and things that has to be done but remember them remember wade in june and bob and monica and them be traveling back and i'm sure those from south carolina brother i think brother aaron and ends up in the carolinas and brother luis was it brother burley's and i think they said brother dean was down at his brothers so then you got all of them scattered out and that's good so remember them on their way back home okay so first timothy i've made all the announcements this morning of all the ministering brethren that are coming in and so remember these and be much in prayer for each one lord jesus we thank you for the day and the time that we're living we thank you for calvary and we just ask you lord to reveal yourself unto us and make known unto us the ways that we need to walk therein because we know that there is a word for every day and every hour that we're living on the earth so help us to find the day that we are to be here to not just be haphazardly waiting for something to take place but to be lord word that you could manifest yourself and father we believe you will because you promised it you said you'd do it so we believe you we ask you to have your way bless those who will be traveling back home today and all of your take care of your people lord we love you in jesus name amen all right first timothy six all right you well you got it up there i'll read verse 14 that thou may keep this commandment without spot unrebukable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ now we know that is in this day right we're in the part of his appearing watch which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting now see that goes all the way into the fact of the eternal god that you know cannot be seen or understood all the way but it has to be in jesus christ or we'll never see nothing all right now we go to hebrews 12 and uh verse 18 for you're not come unto the mount that might be touched that burn with fire nor into blackness and darkness and tempest into the sound of a trumpet talking back back in the days of moses right and the voice of words which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken unto them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and so and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or stressed through the dark and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but now where we come to the jumping from verse 18 we're not come to that back there so here's where we've come to but you're coming to mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem now remember this city of the living god heavenly jerusalem all right and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly that's where you and i are at right now see compassed about with all of these things watch now to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and who god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant into the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel but now remember as we're saying there in verse 22 remember the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem all right and then we'll get to that point you may be seated we'll try to get to that point if we can but i want to just not review but just a higher of what we were covering this morning and then move on into the point i want to get to if you have any questions on this let me know we'll try to cover them wednesday and uh you know but i hope you were following me at least listening this morning because i was telling you the things that i know i know paradise was taken up all right there's a lot i don't understand about some of the things there but uh i believe that it was taken up and i believe jesus was the one that took it up all right and i believe that everywhere he went is where that they went all right now but remember he made a thing he made a he went one step above all things because he went to immortality in the flesh he was almighty god which as i said you can cover that from this from uh timothy he was almighty god that light cannot approach unto you know the great eternal but he condescended downward and as he did you start using the word immortal because you would not use that word immortal or immortality uh you would not use that in referring to uh back before the eternal because you're you know you're getting into a different point immortality is mortal made eternal right all right so then when he came up he went into immortality body spirit soul everything because we know he was almighty god anyway but i'm just making the point that he went up and when he did he then uh he reached that immortality all right and he took the saints with him but did he take him to immortality or where did he take them because then paul would not be saying that you know life and immortality is brought to light through the gospel it would say that immortality was finished it was done always over with there but we know it was not all over with there because we'll get to it in a little bit that we're still dying all right so then there's something wrong in this situation all right and we know then that as he reached that point then he would be able to come back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost and would start the way to make it that life and immortality could come to light now it could only be done through him and what he was doing and that's i just want to hit that from this morning to make you think about it and the question i asked this morning and to me is very clear i think that if we see where jesus went then we know where the the people went you know all right and that way then we can look at it and see uh you know and find ourselves all right then let's just read some quotes about the prophet as to where these old testament saints went right and then you i believe will tie together as to what we were covering this morning of the position i believe they went to would be revelations 4 and 5. all right because that would be covering the 12 apostles and the 12 patriarchs all right and that would bring it to a position that you could could cover all the redemptive plan bringing it right down to one because jesus christ was that one that is the importance of what we're talking about all right so if you have any questions ask me i'll try my best to answer or either tell you i don't know and you know but we do believe in these things as to maybe we don't understand the uh or i don't don't understand the the way that brother branham would talk of the old testament signs raising and seemingly going into immortality and then turn around and say that they're not and that they're waiting on us all right and uh in doing that then you know let's get those couple out of the way before we go because the brothers i work them to death back there now but brother anderson would you drop over to number 27 and let's get this out of the way about the old testament saints depending on us from what the prophet has to say and then we'll drop back to seeing you know what happened in chapter five all right so this is taken from um let me get the glasses melchizedek the great king the great prince and king his prayer is he 69. when we rallied there with abraham isaac and jacob those who were hours of the promise looking forward to us not to fail for without us they cannot be made perfect and how they're depending on us this morning let us not fail all right now see then there's you know if they can get that one in a minute and pull it up going to 28 jehovah jireh paragraph e30 he's talking about thinking about our father abraham and him without the holy spirit and we got the baptism of the holy spirit he was under the sacrifice of a lamb which could never take away sin it just covered sin but we're under a sacrifice that put away sin demolished sin divorced sin and then with the faith that we got but yet they were not made perfect without us they're looking for us to move on all right jehovah gyra paragraph 37 which that's uh that one was uh 5 55 this one is 56. he says the old and the old testament provided that how much better does the new covenant a better thing that we without them now listen to him we without them would not be made perfect or them without us rather would not be made perfect god has provided i trust that you will believe it with all your heart as we pray see us all right e9 perfection number 30. he says then we go to 11 chapter 11 and the wonderful shadows of the faith the heroes of faith how that by faith they did such and such the thing and how without us they could not be made perfect because they are the shadow of this to come this is from hebrews chapter 1 1957 paragraph 100. he said i've wondered in the last chapter of the 11th last part of the 11th chapter of hebrews when he talked about abraham in the great faith chapter and at the end he said they wondered about his sheepskin and goatskin and was made destitute and sought as hundred they wandered about no place to go hated and despised and persecuted whom the world isn't isn't worthy of such then paul stands and said but without us they're not perfect they only look to the cross we look through the cross we have the spirit of christ after it become human flesh and dwelt among us so we have that holy spirit all right so then we just get those points out of the way but i want you to think about this afternoon and we'll just start where we mention that when brother branham he went beyond the curtain of time he wanted to see jesus but he said he's not he's higher all right are we back to where we can pick up now we lost some contact somewhere between us and back there all right and that's all right but he says it in the message the rejected king paragraph 150. he said now he said he wanted to see him he said where is jesus i want to see him so bad he said now he's just a little higher right up that way said someday he'll come to you see you were sent for a leader all right he was not allowed to go into the presence of jesus putting jesus into a higher form but what would be that higher form all right so now let's deal with one thing let's take those some quotes as i was saying this morning about what brother branham has said where these people go to and uh you say well you know well okay let's read and see what he says this is talking taken from the mighty conqueror i'll give the numbers in case i don't know what's wrong wrong back there but we'll get it to going okay we got it to going all right because i want you to read i think we read this this morning but i want you to read it the mighty conqueror in the old testament saints being led by the lord jesus the mighty conqueror the old testament saints when they got close to that great celestial city now do you remember what i asked you to remember the city the heavenly jerusalem because the old testament saints is not going to the future home erase that all right you say well how do you know because jesus hadn't prepared it right is not the prophet saying that jesus has gone now to prepare the future home but there's a heavenly jerusalem right all right so got close to that great celestial city not the future home now all right they said lift up the everlasting gates and be lifted up let the kingdom of glory go in who is this king of glory and watch what he comes down to the old testament saints said the lord of hosts mighty in battle and all coming down through the city of jerusalem come jesus in the forefront with all the old testament saints he let captivity captive he'd give gifts to men uh that captivity cavity sent it on high and give gifts to them walked up in the presence of god the father and said here they are father i have overcome and i've brought them here all right are you listening now everywhere he's at is where they're at i have brought them here so now what happened he said climb up on this strong and set down at my right hand till i make every enemy your footstool all right so now where did the saints go with him and he climbs up on the throne and sits down right and what did we cover this morning revelations 4 shows the throne then one on the throne revelations 5 shows that one on the throne and the lamb that takes the book ties it all together in the plan of redemption climbs up on the throne and sits down and then uh sold in prison he said he climbed up on the throne and sat down and said i'm the one that done it all right so now think about what he's saying climb up on the throne and sit down at my right hand till i make every enemy your footstool all right go ahead with number 13 now they they got back up back there so i laid some notes out i guess i gave them the wrong one but this is from the message of mighty conqueror priest in 58 329 i can hear the father say said set on my throne here son until i make the liest enemy thy footstool and jesus climbed up at the right hand of god of heaven on his strong on high there he stands tonight right so where's he at father strong all right climbed up on the throne chapter five all right sits down look what he says in the next one fourteen but i'm gonna i'm leaving something that i want you to think about but always remember he said the last enemy remember he said it in that quote until i make the list enemy that footstool well it's got to be a last enemy what is that life's enemy you mean with all that happened with the lord jesus and all of the doings that they're still the last enemy right that's right so i just want to get these into your mind to where you think about it look what he said as the eagle stir at their nest he's talking about the only thing different he said that the body is sitting at the right hand of god we all believe he's sitting at the right hand of god on god's strong that's not his throne amen now listen to him he's coming back to reign on his throne it's the throne of david see the the throne of jesus christ is in the millennium but he said you know he that overcomes it with me in my throne as i've overcome and sit with the father in his strong the father's throne is the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit god you know the eternal his throne is on earth in the millennial reign which was promised from david right all right so look at what he's saying it's the throne of david he's to take his throne he's sitting on god strong waiting till the last enemy has made his footstool he will return someday bring in the precious souls with him to take on immortality to live in a glorified body live through the millennium then forever with him all right for him will i accept e52 he's talking about how that you you know here in hammond indiana he's gone up to the father's strong up in glory and he sits there at the right hand of his father tonight on his father's strong to make intercession now remember who was it stephen looked up saw him sitting at the father's right hand all right but now the right hand is not a great big hand remember right right hand means power or authority all right so when he raised up in the old testament saints we read the first one said and i brought them here all right see then he climbs up on the throne chapter five four and five of revelation sitting there at the right hand the corporal body is still there because he left the corporal body and came back to earth to make the father strong manifest in earth which is the baptism of the holy ghost and you and i all right down through seven church ages we can give you all these quotes that he's that seven church ages that was the father strong amen right see then he's got to go come on in from the father's strong in the seventh church age and getting closer to you know because it don't mean anything probably to you about it but it really means a lot to me that it took many many times of listening to to one message the unveiling of god until i really caught what he was saying because remember he comes in three sons name son of man son of god son of david but on that message brother branham puts it son of god excuse the son of man flesh to die son of god down through seven church ages he said and he comes back in the end time as son of man he said then he'll go to the son of david in the millennium all right so as i said this morning what you're seeing in chapter 5 is you're seeing the baptism of the holy ghost it's in our hearts and lives all right but then the lamb comes forth to take the book it's not a lamb it's a man that would be worthy to take the book and that is the son of man now not brother branham and it's not just you and i even though we believe that the bride will be the son of man it means that jesus christ in the bride all right see then you can go to the millennium because he'll be here son of man in the end time all right listen to what he's getting to now and watch all of the points always going down to make your enemy uh this is questions and answers law having a shadow e64 he will come he isn't what he isn't up on his strong now he's sitting on god's throne he that overcometh shall sit with me on my throne as i have overcome and i'm set down on set on my father's trump now he's wanting to come back where is his earthly throne the throne of david god said he gave him the throne of david in the millennium all right he'll sit on david strong and we'll see him the great king of kings sitting there there he is now he's sitting on the father strong in other words he's sitting in god's power in spirit now but when he comes back he'll sit on an earthly set in an earthly body hallelujah on david's throne he's on his father's throne now right hand of majesty all right sitting at the right hand raised up to that place with ours where he's the same old testament saints went they went with him to the father strong but yet where did they wind up chapter 5 tells you there's 24 elders the 12 apostles all right and the 12 patriarchs you say well the 12 apostles never went up back there when they died they did where did you where did the 12 apostles where do all born-again believers go born-again believers christians where do they go chapter five shows you exactly where they go see because we received the father's strong spirit here right the new birth so then the twelve apostles had the baptism of the holy ghost they were able to go up into a sixth dimension right you know what brother brown calls it paradise he calls the sixth dimension where the the where he saw beyond the curtain of time he'll call that paradise because it's just paradise it's it's a word it means a great wonderful place all right but look what he's saying now look where he comes into number 17 the working of the holy spirit and tonight christ is not sitting on his own throne he's setting on who's strong his father's strong he that overcometh shall sit with me in my throne as i have overcome in setting my father's trump all right now so in revelations 4 2 you find the throne and then you find one sitting on the throne but remember whatever happens there it's got to be matched here right whatever happens here let me put it maybe in the correct form where it ought to be whatever happens here has got to be there first right so by the baptism of the holy ghost we come to the new birth the father is strong dwelling in our hearts and our lives that makes it to where that when we pass away can we go right straight into his presence but where's his presence we don't go into the seventh dimension we go to the sixth where brother branham said i want to see jesus he said you can't see him because he's a little higher meaning there's another step to this whole thing that would have to take place someday to connect us together all right but look what he says look what he says here in hebrews chapter 2 1957 if you can pull this one up or be 21 if you can get down to that point follow him now he's talking about coming down and ascend on high and gave gifts unto men and it was an atmosphere above of darkness and gloom and death prayers couldn't go through because the atonement wasn't made he broke through that he opened the way he broke the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin he broke the veil of weary he broke the veil of depressed he broke every veil and made a highway with a wayfiring man walking up the king's highway oh my when he passed the moon and the stars and on and on you remember the king's highway where you sing that song walking up the king's highway all right see he made a way following him come the old testament saints now are you reading it following him from the old testament saints abraham isaac and jacob they went right on up into the heavens of heavens when they were way away from the city remember in timothy the heavenly jerusalem the city so they're going to the city i can see them lift up their eyes abraham said that's the city i longed to see and come here isaac come here jacob oh my we're we were pilgrim and strangers of the earth but there's the city there's the one we've waited on i said don't tie that up to the future home because jesus is under construction of the future home right and the bible said they scream lift up your everlasting gates and be lifted up for the king of glory to come in and the angels behind the gates screamed back to those angels back here and said who is this king of glory and the angels out here the prophets said the lord of hosts the mighty in battle and they pressed the buttons and the big door swung open right down through the middle of the streets he come the conqueror now where is he going triumph with the old testament saints walking behind him sat down on the throne said father here they are they're yours are you with me he said climb up here and sit down until i make your enemies your footstool as we read we find that on here in the scripture all right now where'd he go where'd the old testament sayings go with him up to chapter 5 to the father strong right now off into another great dimensional some situation you got it placed correctly roll it on up watch what he says listen now we're on the eighth verse and we're going to get some of these scriptures today but mainly we'll be on them wednesday okay then has he put all things under subjection under his feet now you know what that scripture's saying he put all things in subjection under his feet he left nothing that is not under him but now we see not all things put under him that's the scripture now we'll get back to it in a minute that's death we don't see death yet because we're still dying we see death see we don't see death destroyed look but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man all right look at your friend don't ever forget this when jesus was going walking up the hill death was buzzing around his head death took him but he conquered death he overcame death he went to the father's throne and overcame death all right but we don't see death destroyed at this moment i said we'll get back to these scriptures wednesday and try to cover them in a lineup we don't see death destroyed right is that what he just said it says in first corinthians 15 20 6 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death but we don't see death destroyed but we see jesus and in this last day remember we were talking in timothy at his appearing which is supposed to be this day life and immortality to be brought to light through the gospel that no man has ever been able to approach unto somebody will in this day somebody will conquer death right so then you see why i say it in what i believe that if those old testament saints went in in glorified bodies death has done been annihilated back there and you've got a long lot of scriptures that should have never even been written because you would just say it was done now but he said even jesus death destroyed him but yet he raised and conquered it but he conquered it only for himself now get that right he conquered it for you and i right we know that but it wasn't applied at that time it was only applied to him and he was the only one who dwelled in immortality but chapter 5 shows him sitting there on the father's throne because we see jesus we don't see death destroyed but we see jesus we see the capability of it being destroyed because it was destroyed as i was ending up this morning he went through death burial resurrection right eternity in flesh raptured up right and see when we go through that then death will be destroyed and see if they went to immortality look what he goes on to say in number 25 the faith of abraham how wonderful good some glorious day the last enemy i have which is death will be trampled right under the feet as was the conqueror we shall march through the city what is that city he said it's the heavenly jerusalem it's a place where god is at right it's a city it's not just a doing but it's not the future home that will come into being because of this city we're we're today compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses saying come on you know you know a great cloud of witnesses that didn't fail they achieved what god had ordained for them to do remember that what god said they would do they done it right but in doing that did not give them eternal life he had to give them eternal life and it was not given as a new birth we use it as that of saying a new birth or something like but it's not it's not correct they know they don't receive the new birth they received an impartation of eternal life because they rejected the right of the new birth right those old testament saints rejected jesus christ now some of them we would talk about abraham and them well and good but just remember the things they went through through in their lives took them to the grave even though they fulfilled what god said about him they went to the grave even the great enoch that walked off the earth where's his body there's no record the great elijah that took a chariot horse ride and went up but where's his body the great moses that the prophet said frankly i don't believe he was buried he just took a trip home you know that moses and elijah appears over in what luke 16 is that whatever matthew 16 which one it is where it says this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell here ye him when he appears with the with the lord jesus all right and brother ryan said that's the second coming of jesus christ and you know even the two witnesses that will have the spirit of elijah and moses they're going to be killed the bible says and lay in the streets for three and a half days the 144 thousand will be killed as their brethren were killed nobody as i ended this morning talking about it nobody outside of the bride of christ can do what jesus done he went through death burial resurrection changed and went up the rapture the bride of jesus christ is the only group of people that can follow that channel and walk into immortality you know what it'll be done right here the dead's going to be raised right here by the voice of the bride of jesus christ right we're going to be made eternal or changed as paul said in a moment a twinkle of an eye and then we'll go meet the lord in the air and paul said having bodies like unto his glorious body and be like him the plan of redemption ties together then with everybody and everybody is dependent upon whether or not we can reach this goal all of those back there remember the quote we read they looked at the cross we look through the cross backwards forward every direction all right we see through the cross jesus christ that life and immortality is brought to light through the gospel and i don't mean this to people but i mean it as straight as i can say it a lot of us come from organized religion right one way or the other sometime or other and what was there talking about back there did they talk about a rapture might have mentioned this did they talk about being changed might have mentioned it but where did anybody back there say the lord himself shall descend from heaven even though it was written in the word the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout now i'll review a lot of this wednesday because i want to stay on this death being destroyed but i want you to think about it i want you to think about that you and i have the opportunity the only people that has that opportunity to be able to be changed in a moment a twinkle of an eye now let's take the great apostle paul and i'll go back to your wednesday but i want this in your mind the great apostle paul in corinthians he talks about mortal chains to immortality how corruptable will put on incorruption he sums it up now watch progressive revelation i know a lot of people don't like that word progressive but deeper meaning or opening to deeper depths all right paul there's talking about death and he comes down to speaking of death he says when death is destroyed he said then it's brought to pass the same then see sometime death where's your sting grave where's your victory i don't know how much longer or whether it was before i'm not worried about it that he wrote to the corinthians about that but when he wrote at the thessalonians he explained how death would be destroyed do you understand what i mean even he himself never attained unto what he said right but yet he's seen it and he's saying in corinthians that there was a possibility of a mortal being changed into immortality and then all that death would be done away he could make that statement death where's your sting great where's your victory we have the victory through jesus christ the same statement he made when he said we don't see all things destroyed but we see jesus the possibility of it being destroyed but when he comes to the thessalonians it strikes him paul how is death going to be destroyed he said that the last you trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the lord in the air gave the complete plan until brother random when he came to that message of the rapture you know in the things of his message he said shout voice of an archangel the trumpet he said we've already heard the shout he said because that's the message what message his message that life and immortality is brought to light by this end time message we could see it and he said then the shout and the voice of the archangel he said the same loud voice that raised lazarus where's he going to be at in the bride and then a trumpet he said a gospel trumpet or something would take place and we'll go meet the lord in the air how much more beautiful could the plan of redemption be laid out in the scriptures for you and i do and i said we'll talk pick back up some wednesday because i want to get in the description just go real slow down through you know and talk about it but i want you to think about it he's already done it it's finished as far as god is concerned but it's not finished as far as we're concerned now you'll see why i've dwelt so much on a positive attitude see martin luther preached no telling how many sermons on the judge shall live by faith and he came forth no telling how many sermons he preached but yet one day he read it one more time and when he did he come off the pages into the man's heart of what god had called him for he saw his day in its message the people when they saw it like luther not the ones that went out and burnt the buildings down protesting the catholic church but the ones who really saw what the man was saying turned the world upside down because they had a positive attitude westley done it pentecost done it brother branham done it has anybody ever been as positive as that man preached that's what caught me i had read the bible and talked of a god that lived i had seen that god that lived i knew he lived there was no way to take it out of me that he lived but i couldn't find anybody to talk to me about the god that i could see that was living you know a lot of people come into this message because they find out organized religion is wrong right well then that's all they fool with no matter why you see them go back where they come from right i guess they found out it wasn't as wrong they thought it was but but that was not what it was when i come in the message i saw a man with a positive attitude that was talking about a god that i believed in never had an experience of salvation of that god but had contact with him believed him and tried to follow him one day when i heard about this brother moak said you know a prophet's been in the land he said i've seen the dead raised the sick healed said that's good i believe you he said you know robert tatum i sure do know him all his life and the family and every club he said well he'll tell you about it i said look brother that's all well and good that's over with i said would you tell me what the man taught i'll know whether he was a prophet or not i'm glad i run into the man i did that i didn't run into these fly-by-nights in the message you gotta believe he was a prophet he believed he's a prophet everything's all right just come in a minute just believe he's a prophet no i run into a man that could quote three quarters of the bible from memory and i thank god for it and i began to study for myself and laid my baptist classes down yeah you know what a lot of people was doing they picked them up in this message call them two souls and seven thunder virtue and all those other things but that's beside the point but i began to see a man talking about a god that lived not back younger we believed in healing we believed in praying you know we believed in those things we were raised up in a period of time that you had to believe you know didn't have all of the social security security's the guarantees we've got today but yet i began to see a god that was real and you know what it brought to me now listen it brought a hope you know because listen to what i'm saying because if he hadn't made something personal to me about this message then i only had a hope and a belief in a doctrine or a man that believed in god and that god could use but you see one day i found that god that god wouldn't william branham that god was the same one that i had followed along all of my life but i had him off let me just say a little bit about this morning i had him off the throne go read and listen to the things where brother around talks about revelations 4 and 5 and see if he doesn't cover it this way we had him dethroned the trinity doctrine dethrones jesus christ totally off of all thrones father whatever you want to talk about and i just ask you has he ever climbed up on your throne in your heart in your life and set down in you by revelation that no matter what comes or goes then no matter what the future holds of what's to be done that he's still hebrews 13 8. have you ever had that personal experience well brother dale i've never had an experience like you everybody don't have the same experience i'm glad of that now let me put it in the right order i believe everybody has the same experience but it's in different ways to have it because i believe only in one experience and that is the new birth and that way it may have come to you with you crying shouting glory hallelujah whatever or a thought or of what point or a word or whatever but it's the same new birth or else hebrews 13 8 is wrong but has he climbed up on your throne and said i am in your heart in your life can you read the bible and see a true understanding of one true and living god and not wonder whether the trinity's right even though brother branham will stand and say i said let's stand and address the third person of the trinity he was a trinitarian he's been that all alone but he just now told it and i'm the only one that called he said that now ain't that real good he said he wouldn't preach on hell until he'd seen what it was because he couldn't understand it he said one time it looked like his eternal enough time it looked like it wasn't and you want me to find you a quote where he said you folks be careful because you could die and burn in hell eternally see there he really believed in eternal hell but he just hid that from everybody else you got the great revelation that's where doctrines get started of a great revelation well let's see how was it he said one time about people that believe the trinity he said i just don't have that much of a revelation something to that degree he said because it just wouldn't work but are you following me because my point of this evening is to one time to get you to realize no matter what we're still dying and if we're still dying then everybody else is still dying but do you realize when this bride walks off of this earth it won't make 144 000 eternal they got to get their own revelation but you know what without us they can't get it because this is the last in morphe to the gentile dispensation is the bride of jesus christ see i believe then that life and has been brought to light through the gospel that you and i what is paul saying there in romans about the the gospel it's the power of god under salvation to everyone that believeth i'm looking for a change of these bodies it's always been my thought well what we need to do is we need to get this get that we'll go right ahead we need to be more emotional brother dale well all right like i told him down atlanta one time that brother roberts he was talking about running and i said well just make sure you don't slow down i might be behind you but you know what we want everybody else to be emotional and when everybody's not emotional like we think it ought to be then we don't think nobody's got nothing right but you see i've always been built on one thing tell me what the word says and i'll know where brother adam was a prophet show me that word revealed in a group of people in their hearts and i'll know that god is real somebody's going to have to stand on this earth and declare that death is destroyed and we'll still be dying still be getting older it's not no shame to die that's in the providence of god but somebody is going to believe it well why can't we believe we're there you know and realize what's going on but you know what most people won't they won't just like i just clicked i said i clicked on i think i told my life now i was just doing something looking for something on the computer yesterday and i clicked on and it said something about something and i clicked on and i thought well it says that man knows what he's talking about said something about the great destruction or the downfall of america and i listened to him for a little while and you know he had some good things he says within a very short amount of years that your grocery bill is going to double and triple he said your gasoline is going to go he said your money in the bank is going to be gone you cannot get it out of the bank because the banks will be closed he said it and listen this is what caught me he said there will be a military takeover in this country and said obama signed the papers a couple of days ago and he gave the bill number 1827 or something and said he signed that and there's your beginning um you know that kind of sounds like brother branham talking don't it then how that there would be a great depression how did they be great times and how we would be physically bereft how that we would lose all and how that we'd be at the mercy of the elements how your money would be gone keep your homes and be of what is it keep your home and be a member of the catholic church or something like that there's a quote something to not paraphrase in it but it's close about keeping your home take the mark of the beast all right listen what do you mean keep my home well be careful what you sign you might be signing your rights away you know i'm not a doomsday i've never been that away because i believe the revealed word is the thing because you know there's not going to be a doomsday if somebody don't raise up in the bride of christ and proclaim that i and my father are one you ain't going to see nothing tiring up and doing we're just going to keep on going and we're going to be fighting around horeb you know 40 something years they went around horrible couldn't have been but just a few miles that they were walking i think after a while i'd say hey look boys that was my footprint i've been here before maybe about 30 years ago you know and that's what i think about you and i are we really is our thoughts thinking about getting out of here or trying to live here what about it come on brothers what about it life and immortality is brought to light to the gospel and if it's brought to light it's a possibility of somebody attaining to that place why can't we believe we're them you know that i've heard people say i believe that i'm in the bride i don't know whether i'm going in rapture or not i thought and don't calculate you know but you believe your bribers don't know where you're going in the rapture or not if you are the bride that is the rapture we see like one brother said he said something like this that that adoption is deep it said that statue of perfect man is simple something like that your people make those statements and you wonder where's their thinking when it's all the same thing is that your perfect man is adoption but how about it do we believe him to be the same in every way outside of the fact of the corporal body being here now that's what brother brown says you say well now i believe in a way brown said there's no such thing as believing in a way he said he's either hebrews 13 8 or not do we have everything based on that or do we have everything based on our social security check you know what you know if you cut off all the social security check you know most people wouldn't be in this building today they wouldn't be able to afford to get here and you know what every day it gets up more and more of us you see folks i've always just tried to be one thing and that's straight and honest and right up the line right around talking about money he said if you knew what you had in your pocket you'd take it out and burn it but you know what he never took his out and burn it he's using it but he knew what it consists of but he knew there's no way for us to operate without money you've got to have a monetary system of some form you know that in a monetary system in the crisis gold is the only thing's tradable how much gold do we have kind of hard to bind it up by the crazy entity that's one of the things that man said he said your money golden things won't be any good why because if you let them know you got it they're gonna come get it you're gonna go out and pay for food brother collie with gold nuggets and they gonna ask you what well you've been digging in there's no way of hiding and doing things we might as well just be straight and honest but be ready every moment right let's stand together the light enemy to be destroyed is death now how are we going to destroy it well we'll just quit dying we'll help yourself i don't think that's the way it is i think it's going to have to be something else don't you no don't know if anybody's interested or not but they were showing on the internet this morning that the moon will turn to blood wednesday night for about an hour i've never seen it so i'm curious if anybody else will be turned into blood wednesday night for about an from a big hour or something something was gonna happen okay oh losing who's in charge we're gonna find number three and anybody have a need just think about it my only thing is to get you to see jesus christ they come from the east and west to see jesus christ that's the only one no hopes outside of jesus christ everybody's gone today so we wouldn't have a few cups i'm not saying anything about people going i'm just saying we're going to well next week or that a lot of people can be here but i want to see these ministers get out and go and preach the gospel spread the good news that's what we believe right anybody have a name this is a mystery needed a redeemer no longer we don't understand everything but we know something darkness for jesus has set me free of that holy place and open by night and day where did those old testament signs go right into the presence of almighty god we're do all born-again believers go today right in the presence of almighty god but yet there's something not done away we're still dying somebody's going to look at that and say jesus you don't get me i'm happy his heart can be passed away that undertaker he said jesus what are y'all just anyway oh jesus said i said sir you won't say anything he looked at me and said what i said i'm a metal baptized i'd hate to have to write that on your death certificate i said i don't intend for you to be able to i mean i want to be changed is your kiss so sweet to me with this black ops 9 but darkness has taken flight now you love his word walking with him i'm going to praise i will reign within just think about him as we dismiss lord jesus we love you we pray that what we said today has been worthy to express our thoughts and our ideas we pray that they've been in your accord tonight because that's what we desire it to be but the one thing we desire lord and that is to come to a place that somebody will be able to look at death and say this move on away from us because that would give a hope and an opportunity to anybody else it's for somebody to be able to do that we know you've done it and we know the only way it'll ever be done is for you to come in us and do it amen because we can't do it ourselves but we believe that the bride is to be the fullness of the godhead bodily the bride is to be the final voice to the final age she is to be the son of man made manifest in a many member body we love you and we thank you take care of everybody on the way home bless all the people that are not here and they're traveling back this afternoon and home and all like that lord just be with them give a safe journey we love you we thank you in jesus name amen you're dismissed b minor down indeed you better go down
