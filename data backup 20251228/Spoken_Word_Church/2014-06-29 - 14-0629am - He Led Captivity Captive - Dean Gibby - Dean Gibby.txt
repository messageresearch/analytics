God showed me it' be fine so y'all pray that that that can happen I just uh I've heard a lot of preaching in my life and a lot of it's been good and most of us been here and uh uh but there's more to go to making this Rapture than just coming to church and going back the way you come come in that's like the statue of the perfect man it's not it it's not as what it seems what you're looking at it's a building of a body it's a building and and this morning by the grace of God I'm going to try through some of the things I read in the scriptures to show you how the statute of perfect man is built now you've had the knowledge of it you've got the knowledge of it then knowledge perfect but the knowledge alone won't do it that's mechanics alone so you got to know how you are built and I would say this this morning if all these things that's coming Upon Us was coming starting tomorrow would you be ready that's would you be ready that's right and I'm going to read a lot of by the grace of God let's pray father in the in the precious name of Jesus Christ we approach our throne of grace and mercy this morning Lord knowing father that we can't do one thing Lord God outside you but my decision Lord God my choice Lord God I pray has been you your leadership and your guiding hand you know what the people needs Lord God and they must see because you have predestinated a church for a certain place and to do a certain thing and we must see this it's once in the old we won't live by bread alone but I have a word that proceed out of the mouth and once in the new somebody has come to this and somebody is coming to this Lord the scripture says all things works together to the good to them that loves the Lord which are called according to your purpose Lord you got a purpose father for each individual in here that has a baptism of the Holy Ghost and I pray Lord God that it's I Endeavor to go on that you will bless it Lord God and let your servant step aside father and you come into this Tabernacle in such a way Lord God that you'll speak in the first person like you did the prophet of God one time when he you come to the congregation say this is not Willam Brandon speaking this is me that's what I want Lord Jesus God help the people now as we read the scriptures Lord God help us to understand stand in Jesus name amen uh if you'd uh like to turn you uh turn with me to the Bible or baby he'll he'll get it up there uh I want to go to uh I didn't lose my glasses this time I'm kind of holding on them things like glue I really enjoyed the singing brother and the and the ones that were singing I like to go to U First 1 Corinthians uh 1 and I've got I got three four five six uh I got uh I got 1 Corinthians 1 uh 146 and 148 and uh 1 Corinthians 14:20 so I'll read them in uh a session now this is Paul speaking and I I want you to by the grace of God there's a purpose in this and I want you to see it oh so bad I was in my outside building yesterday late I I just was cutting some gray trying to just think about things and it started storming on me so I just drove into the outside in this metal you know how rain sounds on metal and it was raining so hard that you couldn't hear and I'm sitting in a chair with my head down thinking about the message and what God has done and what God is doing and God gave me he moved on the scene in me and I started screaming I believe you could hear me over the rain I asked Peg up at the house I said could you hear me I haven't had one like that in a long time and I'm going to tell you what it was now Brethren if I come un you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you now I'm I'm going to have to just just say something now if I come to you speaking with tongues if I come up here speaking a false Doctrine to you what good is it going to do if you don't know it I I could I could do this if I'm really smooth and and I can slide it right by if you ain't grounded and know that thing so you've got to know your position and what you do in that position and do it now Brethren if I come to you speaking with tongues I'm not talking about tongues now that's right what shall I profit you except except I shall speak unto you by Revelation that's what's happened here I'm telling you I know it's true this is wor I got it amen by way of this what shall I if I shall speak to you by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine right we've had it y now do we know this or has somebody told us this right do we know personally in our soul what this is right or are as somebody told you do we know about God do we know about the statute of perfect man or do we see ourself there and how we got in there and what it's done to us we got to have that if we going to make a Rapture here while we're alive amen I'm going to try to show you the way I believe God has shown somebody the way to the Rapture for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to to the battle now a trumpet it has to be a gospel trumpet if you look at the first one I don't want to say spend too much time here but I got to that's just the way I am I'm I'm sorry for if the gospel give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle then I and I I've up here right here said it has to come by Revelation it it come by Revelation by the prophecy and the knowledge that you get you can't come up this statute of perfect man without the knowledge of God but that knowledge of God has got to be revealed to you so likewise ye except you utter by the Tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for you shall speak in through the air there I'm go on there are it may be so many kinds of voices and he could be the one sit next to you he could be uh uh I I could call names but there's no need in it I ain't got no argument with anybody I just want God here GL I just want us this is one he's give us a pure to take us through and by by the grace of God we ought to be able to see it right here and say and go home right if we was at this place amen so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification now listen therefore if I know not the meaning of The Voice right I'm trying to tell you something I shall be unto them that speaketh a barbarian now we not talking about with a club on your back and Claw skins on we talking about somebody that if if I speak the truth and you receive the truth you become the truth and do the truth and if somebody comes and is off just a little bit it's going to be like a barbarian to and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian to you the 1 Corinthians 14:20 this is this is I want I said that to say this Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice be ye children but in understanding be men you can be say that you can say that please am I'm going to read one more here this that I just uh I want to get because this is Paul speaking in Philippians 4:11 I just read I don't know if he can get it up or not but I I I'll read it to you I want you to listen close cuz this has got a lot to do with the statute of perfect man the have you ever thought that at Pentecost when the Holy Ghost come now I'm going to show you something in the writings of the quotes that I got here but now when when they was in the upper room and the Holy Ghost come down and gave them them a revelation anointed them and gave them a revelation the faith of the fathers how much suffering did you think they done had already done I'm I'm serious now how much but I tell you what when they received it they went forth and it all come to pass he even told Peter how he would die God sisters and brothers is want to speak to you mouth to ear he's want to become so Supernatural to you that you can call him and he'll he'll come and speak to you he says that without the supernatural God in the church which is the divine revelation and it it's what good is it he said we don't have faith for divine H let alone rapturing Faith but something will come and I'm declaring it is here if I hear a preacher preach and I don't hear the son of man come out of his mouth I have a problem amen because he say he to come in three times he's to come his son of son of man Son of God Son of David and in the end time he's to come as a son of man again God in human flesh again in me and you he said he come in flesh and then when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost we receive the word in our flesh why is he always talking about mortify the Deeds of the Flesh and all why is he always talking about these things he died in the flesh that we don't have to live in the flesh but oh well I can't help it come on okay not that I speak in respect of want for I for I have learned in whatsoever soever State I am there with to be content Oh What A M fo and this brother God if you would read the scriptures for yourself instead of somebody having to read it for you right and see get it firsthand he been read to you time and time and time and time again and see see I find that that don't resonate it resonates but when you read that comes on the scene right you got to have it yeah for I know both how to be a based and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer needs okay I'm going to read this right here because really if if if if uh this is going to be the last this is in countdown page 19 paragraph 96 and any man we're predestinated to this church sure you and I amen God through listen if we can't see this happening are we predestinated this is I'm asking questions I'm asking questions to try yourself and see if you be in the faith I'm asking questions you qu every time I've ever done this right here people's left me every time I start laying it back he putting it out and making you question yourself yeah you must question yourself you must question daily hourly you question yourself how would you how would you if if if he coming like a thief in the night not a thief but like a thief in the night and he's going to take his out of here cuz he said if 500 left he said would nobody miss them would you be ready right amen would you be ready and there's things before that that's going to happen he said before before God sinks that place out you Christ would see we will still be here sure sure we still be here when he sinks that is a quote on that he said I predict I had preacher tell me but he just predicted I said well we got a difference cuz I believe his predictions I believe everything he says we don't have to prove the prophet right right what are you trying to do debate somebody you don't have to brother Wade we have the truth we don't need to be out here arguing and fussing with people trying to prove a prophet of God that they ain't going to receive anyway if they're if they're open to it talk with them right am I got one sitting right back there that done that I could tell you a story of me and Casey boy he was moving over there right across the street from me and I didn't want him over there I mean I mean you know I don't know why but it was a it was a it was it was a plan of God and he got he got it and he got it and made it and and and buil a house over there and one day I was out in the in the driveway my driveway I got Cyprus trees everywhere and I saw him go down to the end of the street in his truck I busted through I busted through that big old tall saes I got over there and caught him in the street and said let me talk to you and he he says oh God I tell you what listen to God you must be into position that you can hear God and this is all I'm fix to read is uh is part of thata God I don't know how I'm going to do this Lord help me okay it's on page 19 paragraph 96 I got this wrote there 826 06 and any man that ever lives for God will have ha to go beyond these five senses and believe God break away and lay aside and sweep up into the heavens he says we have to right now I had a little inent with Brother Gary me and brother Gary was talking on the phone and uh he was telling me about he was out trying to walk and and hurting legs giving away on him and he started talking to God started talking to God and kept moving forward kept moving forward and a little bit he was going and it went over an hour right now I said hold it right there brother gab I said hold it it's back up a minute I said do you know what happened mhm I said do you know what happened there sure I says you actually was defying Satan and going beyond your sense is what you felt see God will do it and you don't even know it's done right amen God please help us Lord okay praise God now I want to uh I want to say something here just read this is the first is the church age book and I I ask some people uh long ago years ago we was down in the in the basement in there in the fellowship hall and a bunch of Skies was around and I I don't know why I did it but I I do I do know now more so I says when you read the church age book can you see the Thunders sure nobody said a word can I ask you today with all that you read and when you read the church age book can you see them thunders in there that is his coming he is coming the son of man is coming that's what I said about it now a man a preacher can preach on the on the son of man Ministry and maybe never mentioned absolutely the son of man right cuz he's preaching them Thunders see and it's the life he said listen in Christ mystery of God revealed he says now the bride is part of the mystery and must be revealed right and this I I say it's a plan that he had in his mind before there was ever world that he was going to achieve he was going to have a bride down here that wasn't going to take what the first Eve turned down that's right she and she's going to come to where Eve would have come to eternal life in a changed body right here without dying she would eventually came to it cuz brother am said she would have had the child eventually had the child I mean do you understand that that's just simple simple simple simple things now I want to read this because it's the first I just I want you to think of this and maybe he'll go make you go back and read yourself and ask some questions about it and talk to God about it and because there's things coming on us church and we must be ready and if we're not ready maybe we wasn't predestinated yeah we can find out here and know right here right here whether we are gods or or not right right and we can't stay if we had a new birth we can't stay babies cuz he said in first I got it wrote down here somewhere uh he says in 1 Corinthians he says when that which is perfect has come then that which is a part shall be done away it don't mean you do away with the word you receive but it comes in perfect form see he says uh when I was a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I'm back over here where Paul says he says Brethren be not children in understanding but how be it in my children but in understanding be men as though I I would say but when I become a man I put away childish things let's put away childish things our own thinking right what we know and don't know we might not know and we might not know I'm telling you we got to be sure we got to have perfect understanding personally not for somebody else but for you you got to have perfect understanding perfect Revelation I got it all in here my notes I ever get to them okay this is Introduction uh in a church age book through the he starting through this volume though this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as the godhead water baptism found in Revelation 1 through3 his main theme is setting forth of a detailed study of the seven Church ages he's coming he com in he come I'm I'm going to read something here see if if if it it'll grab you yeah now this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the Revelation right for out of the agan J comes to seal us right remember we receive everything that they had all the way from calary you and I are predestinated by almighty God to receive everything and when we receive everything we receive the full combat Beast right amen exactly and they do their work in us that they've never been able to complete in nobody before and we sat here as a small group well it ain't small to me I preach to four or five yeah I'll preach to one I I well it doesn't make it 100 or 200 it doesn't make any difference to me I'm the same kind of Minister out of the ages comes the seals that's see if you understand this and out of the seals come the trumpets and out of the trumpets Comes The Vows like the first burst of a Roman Candle the church ages bring forth would have Mighty and initial illumination without which there could be no further light you see what I'm trying to say I I pray God that he'll let you see what he's letting me see but once the briance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the Revelation opens wide before our wondering eyes that's right amen and and we edified and purified by his Spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our Lord and savior the one true and God Jesus Christ they they said this in the church e right now we know we where we finished it in' 65 okay let's see I had this uh I'm going to have to rear rearrange he's here I give him to Jose they put him back back in the numbers and I had my numbers crooked okay okay let me just read this page seven Joseph um right now page seven uh 153 now this is for very familiar very famili but but there's words in here that needs to be pointed out to the predestinated seat of God oh yeah there's different kinds of Ministries is what I'm trying to tell you Church we're all we're not all the same we all got the same God and we comeing toward the same point but it's different ways of ministering right okay is it on there well I said on page on page seven okay okay now a revelation of Jesus Christ Church age book one now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts can you can you say that right amen can ever I I I would like to ask everybody you you don't have to mention but praise God for the ones that does Amen if you're not sure you better get sure right right amen you better get sure Glory it's time for games it's it's it's it's time for quit playing church it's going to it's it's fixing a hit it's already here I mean no was in the ARK for seven days before the rain came and the third pull was really working in buddy it went it went into it okay now remember this Christ in the church in his continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church yes sir and defile it make it in lukewarm formal and Powerless and most people's minds goes to denominational churches we're not fooling with denominational churches they're dead as door knobs we're talking about the people that says they follow this message and and if if you was not had not been Versed and heard about the doctrine of uh he wasn't god Till The River Jordan you would have went with that thing but God has blessed us and he has G us a word that we can hold to but it can't be just in memory form right amen right it exposes revealing his Works attempting destruction see this you take in Deuteronomy 13 that me and brother D both likes a lot if a dreamer or a prophet brings you to them and tells you that it's going to happen and it happens and takes you to another God right that's and you've got to see the next one he said these are to prove you and see if you going to stay with the Revelation you have and if you don't have no Revelation guess what it can even show you you name was not on the Lamb's Book of Life amen exactly right an attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights it and he fights it but I'm telling you Church God's got a bride on the face of this earth now that's that that St statute of perfect man is so wrapped from the inside to the outside and in the virtues of God until Satan is not going to be able to penetrate that when we stand there before the change I don't mean he ain't going to keep bounding you hitting you but he ain't going to be able to penetrate I don't believe it he said limbs would be restored right amen he cannot stand he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and what she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army and only in I pray God he'll let me get a few of these things out so you can see how that statute of a perfect man is put together it's not just in the teaching of the knowledge of the word there's people that can take that right and and and teach it boy and be a hypocrite you believe that so close to deceive the elected that's right there ain't no hypocrite here though I'll tell you I believe that if I didn't believe it I would say it right if they get a true Revelation the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church can you do that can you say that can I say that right can you can you can you discern the spirits if it's a denomination you don't have no trouble but what about somebody that comes up here so close that it would deceive the elected you need a revelation that you can discern that and withstand that right you got to do it sister losing it's got to happen amen that's right and by God's spirit discern and withand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he would be as definitely toward today as when Christ with stood his his every effort to get pain uh gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates the Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them right now I'm going to read this bottom here Catch My Breath oh I love this Lord I love it God if I had to walk along this is what would be in my hand and it's because it's in my heart but Wade you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message now I could go back that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and in the church and his work is in the future ages I said Through the Ages is his coming cuz he said he said a gospel let me get in here to it oh I ain't forgot then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or will fail to get bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't just take ordinary study thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost if you ain't got Revelation how can you have the oper ation I mean of of the Holy Ghost how can you if you don't even have the Holy Spirit if you're not learning if this is what a new birth is a new birth comes into you it's a birth of the word to bring you it's not being complacent not just coming to church now just listen to to your husband or your wife or whatever and and expect to get it amen exactly it's something listen when they when joshu took them over the river and to place them in the land they fought for every inch of ground they had and they took right it's not easy but without desperation you won't even try right we'll come to church we have a good time we hear a great message but are you did you really receive the message right did if you did you'll go and act on it please God oh Lord it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people he will take one more prophetic Insight it now people say that's a private and it was it would require the ability to hear from God now listen it would require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse to a verse a student now he's done brought us in though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know okay let me let me say this right here this is on uh page four uh Brother Joseph uh 116 D2 what that means do we uh I I ask you do we really know we know what the definition of election is sure we know what Webster said the definition of web brother Brown made a statement one time people was boy they was explaining the words and all he says we got people that thinks they in the room would Webster yeah see sometimes you don't get Revelation from Webster you don't get Revelation from the uh strong concordance sometimes it takes God to break that down and show you what it is and this is what I'm trying to say it takes the Holy Ghost In You And if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you better get desperate CU it could be right up to the door Noah he could be right up to the do door of sodon cuz he'll be here and you won't know it you'll be caught yes right that's right warning then judgment he preached a message on that warning then judgment and it's been a big part of my Ministry I've tried to warn people I've tried to tell them what God Said just like brother Dale Faith come by here I am so grateful to God that God placed a man in my life and now men and my life that spoke a word that went in I accepted it it come down into my soul God give me Revelation and brought it back up and stamp my brain and come out my ears and through my spirit real and into my body and here I stand I'm so grateful to God by election he chooses you see if you see election you going back in the back part of God's mind before there was anything yes sir you'll see how God can create a a people in the world and not make any of them make any decision but he knowed the ones that would make it for him so all these things we come into this world shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies he's seen all that he's he saw even and Adam he's seen it all but he's seen where you was coming right and he was able to make you white so he said many of those that's really been bad yeah he said but not now right brother D brought that out years ago is I've held it in my heart ever since because it was me amen God if if I hadn't if I hadn't when I met my wife I don't know where we would go but God started changing me I mean I I I listen I say and talk to you all day about God pointing things out to me pointing things out to me pointing things out to me and I would obey I would obey I would obey until the day God next to God I love her the most yeah amen sure I mean God Amen I won't get in that when I get to cry go ahead yesterday was our anniversary we 37 years Hallelujah you see this is Smur Church age chapter 4 you see they could not figure out God's love now this is something they could not figure out God's love who is they somebody is figured out God's love brother because they have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Brother Sam somebody knows about God's love and they know that God he said by election through knowledge predestination Destiny so I I have to see that I am elected of God I see this cuz I know the say they could not figure out God love but I figured it out by Revelation I ain't just figured it because you can't figure God but by Revelation he shown me that I am his own elected and he showed me where it come from the baptism of the Holy Ghost me if I found no knowledge in me when our faith come by here and it come in my mind I accepted it went down in there he revealed it it will come back it come back into my spirit real into my body real right I want you to take that one to the bank that's the way it works absolutely they thought that love meant no suffering I'm getting down F to get to it there they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the prove of his love love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly the fact that they were chosen to Salvation because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul exactly and remember Paul wrote 14 books in the New Testament he of course he had to die because he he would have got old and died anyway he may commit you to suffering as he did job right God I his I want to go I I see something I want to go too but that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose so can't nothing happen to a son or daughter of God that it ain't the purpose of God I've heard brother Dale get up here and say that and brother Wade I've heard the ministry see I'm telling you nothing can happen to you and he took me forever to say that some of us has had more see Paul got a quick headcut job had went all the way through with them balls on him brother I just read what brother Brown said them balls he said now he's talking about ezekiah he said he had a boil said it was a cancer now I don't know if job what what he had but I know it was about a year they say I don't know how they know this thing but he stayed true to God testified at the beginning who he was and testified to the end says you you friends of job he says you've been wrong I heard what you say them lying preachers and that's what it was cuz they was deceived they was telling them wrong he said you go have job pray for you and burn to give his sacrifices and job's captivity was still on him but when he prayed right that's it his captivity was taken off of so it was a time like we we need to see these things but it was all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration not a peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect established strength and settled and job said he put strength in US job 23:6 you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered I'm pointing that statute that is not a drawing on a wall that is you that is me that is that is Psalms 23 that is Daniel 9:24 right there there it is right there there is in the finish of it is revelation 10 through 7 and it goes to Revelation 5 right I it's there amen sir if I see it you can see it amen you get desperate before God say if he won't show it to you oh yeah exactly the thing Hebrews 589 though were he were a son yet learn he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation all that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected through suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by faith in God while suffering from him would be coming to a place of Perfection why did he want this James 1 2 2 and 4 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers Temptation knowing this that the TR of your faith worth your patience but let patience have heard perfect word that you may be perfect in entire wanting nothing listen you have to walk in this you have to walk by this I mean you if you going to be in the image of God without a smell of sin on you you are are a different people you are the caliber of Caleb and Joshua am which was a type of what we fulfill right amen okay this is on page five Brother Joseph uh 117 one say why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8:17 and18 and if children then HS with God and join ours with Christ now listen every word is read if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now suffering could be sickness hospitals uh afflictions anything but God himself is here to deliver you and me amen I believe this I believe this we played around long enough right we need to call for god brother BR said I could be in in the back and studying and praying a land before God come out anointing and the people wasn't in the same anointing it wouldn't do no good and I know how much the ministry here has seen that right here right amen say here nonchalant come in here with all kind of spirits on us right expecting to hear from God God don't answer any stuff like that though the word is perfect right he goes right over you remember them two Cadillacs he looks like one right they look just alike but it look like one you there's one he said never congregation Believers make Believers and unbelievers always would be you got to make sure you're not one of those unbelievers in that Cadillac that looks like the real thing you've got to know this thank you Lord you say how can we know this well let's just read the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in usless we suffer with him we cannot reign with with him you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made what I suffer now I know I ain't going to have time to do it right there but see that is a person that's come to God like he said the Lord is my shepherd right he somebody said the Lord is my shepherd He know he had been Justified and Sanctified and he has received his sh the she the shepherd He said he leades me or or let make me lie down in green pasture he put me into this word right right here in green pasture he leades me beside the Still Water he give me the revelation of it oh Lord he said oh God I just I I need to let me see this he maketh me to lie in in Green Pastures he leadth meide the Ste Waters he restores my soul he justified Sanctified fill me with the baptism of Holy Ghost listen he he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake and then he says this yay though I walk through the valley of the shelter of death see but I've got you prepared my child I've got you I've got you I've got you back as they say I've got you I don't know to have your back but I got you insides in front too amen I mean and then look here he he prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemy he give me that that statue of the perfect man he he bring this and bring and made it alive in my soul and it ready out through my body somebody God is dealing with and must know the way to the Rapture or the way to get there right he says he anointed my head with oil right that's your headship yes sir he anoints my my oh just running all over me you go to F of slams with that you wanted to see which was a type he said I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and this is the house of the Lord okay because because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule see I mean it everything fits now and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him right I mean it's a simple talking about Brother D said he's so he's so deep you need a revelation he's just he he's right in his word you you tell me where he ain't been in his word on right you just don't have no Revelation you just come up here and this is what people does they hear a sermon and and absolutely you could ask him outside that door what he preaching most of them won't have a clue no right now if I'm wrong you're right y'all can get me when I get outside he overcame and sat down in his father's Throne see right he come as son of man and he come back as Son of God right position he was taken but he's here now as the son of man amen we V we to vindicate Luke 17:30 when the son of man is being revealed we we are called for this church amen do we see it that's right if we don't it's time to get desperate these altar ought to be full of screaming and Hauling and praying and begging God but if you're all secure in where you're at praise God praise God I'm just give you I'm listen I'm just doing what God's told me to do and if you don't want it right you don't have to take it that's right this is this is how God told me to do it I got it lined up here that I'm doing it then we have to overcome to sit with him and a little temporary suff we go through that not worthy to be compared with tremendous Victory we have with him it's okay than it not strange concerning the Fier trials that are try you this is what Peter said it is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering yeah we don't have suffering just right maybe because a lot of us ain't come through but see some of us has come through things that we can tell others and we are testimony before the people I I I think of myself brother you you up here talking about uh the dead being raised and all see I know it I've had it to happen three times in my life and me involved in you trying to make something no I'm trying to tell you the truth I've got something else if if piggy will warn me and give me time to do it I got some rainbows I want to show you no sir we have trial we all have trials we are all chased a Sons with not one go but goes through that the church is not Serv is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of Hebrews 12:6 for whom the Lord love he chasing and Scourge every son he receiveth but if ye be without chastisement where of all partakers in you are bastards and not son now this is a special condition in Smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no True Believer free from it this is of god this is the will of God it is needful we need to Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it love suffer long is kind Matthew 5 11:12 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall allow all manner of evil against you falsely and for my sake be rejoice and be exceedingly glad for Great Is Your Word in heaven so pers there to Prophet before you we want to fight him yeah we don't want to surrender to God like God surrendered to the Cross he surren there he made his final surrender in Gethsemane and obedient to the cross for you and me am yes sir amen now let me get this out of the way this is on page uh six Brother Joseph the SM Church age 1118 1 chapter 4 the cloudy skies and and we need to see this here and I have to War I have to listen I I you ask my wife I am almost constantly on her about said because she's a woman I mean she's a sister a daughter of God but she women I don't know they different and and and they need and they need a they need a they need a they need a guiding hand see if if if Eve if Eve had a stayed woman and hadn't got away from her husband if she had have stayed with her husband she wouldn't have been in there and they're talking to the Beast and Paul tells us what to do about this but do we see this you need to a husband and a wife needs to stay together yes I mean and and and consult each other in everything right and and if I need correct it she's corrected me and I've took it and I praise God for it I said that's right but she's had a lot of it herself and and and listen it's a I say I will I I will say again I love her next to God more than anything God gave her to me to keep me in line that's right the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval amen God we need to we need we need to know these things we must know these things his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved election election his love is elected which he had for us before the foundation of world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we know because he said so that's right and listen so he said so that's it you don't have to do nothing else you already got it no sir they fall forever inch of ground they took and so made manifest that he did love us for he brought us to himself himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love for him oh yes Lord by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials right if you can keep that in your mind and in your soul when these decisions and choices you have to make make it'll help you amen that he in his wisdom allowed to come to P I know that property see but they are rich there it is again so you have to be careful it's got nice homes you know and got got God's blessed you and gives you you better be careful how you handle that right now the sister there at Blasphemous names brother BR said God accepted her because she helped the Brethren she would bring them in and all that and God accepted her Holy Ghost she was doubting where she had the Holy Ghost she was seeking to know where she had the Holy Ghost see it's in the books and tapes he said rapturing faith lies in these books and tapes amen and and when somebody can bring it out of these books and tapes you better listen it just might be God speaking in the first person and I personally think it is because that that's the way God called he predestinated five-fold Ministry from the beginning he knew us he knew the prophet's brother he predestinated him right and so he know all you right like a father he is looking down upon his family he is the head of his household he a he is a provider yeah he believes see oh how the untutored believer stumbles at this how can God bear to look upon his own in a time of need and not just stop it all just give it and Lish everything every material upon them but because I got to wrote there because God knows what we have need and let us prove we are Sons and Daughters of God we stand upon his Revelation this they're all along see if he he said he wants to heal us more than we want to be healed I said try that one on when you got diabetes for 45 years try it on like brother dick there had had had postrate cancer no more try it on try it on he's able to talk to people about things like this by experience but he has to bring God on the scene not just a natural thing yeah let's move along okay I want to read you something here I've got on on page nine at the bottom just the bottom of then this was my this was my note I want to read this to because I I saw this way way way back y c you you got to have a revelation of Calvary and what Calvary did see Calvary he preached sanctification and was the author of it all okay until the blood was shed the sacrifice couldn't be made okay and and understand this is me if you disagree with me pray for me and and show me show me I appreciate it notes on back resume of the ages single book I had on the back of that Jesus Christ at Calvary is where the six seal was open brother brandham said here just for a moment God was in Plain Sight God now see only God through the through Calvary the shedding of his blood the resurrection could release the life remember the seal was broken what the spirit went into his heart to release the life yeah I got a live up there but y'all have to get on the Peggy about that now watch the prophet said a trumpet this is where I want you a prophet say a trumpet would sand now that's a gospel trumpet a seal would break a mystery is revealed and the age comes down that went to the first church age right to calern when he fell he went to the church age and Paul done a gospel trumpet now let me read it to you again he said now I can go back over here and see out of the seals comes the trumpet and I could just do that it's right on the front of his church hbook remember the seal was broken what the spirit went into his heart to release the life and now watch the prophet said a trumpet with Sam for you me with Sam to let us know cuz we go all the way back with our Revelation and the son of man is only revealed the word right okay now watch the prophet said a trumpet was saying a gospel trumpet was saying a seal breaks it broke under paw right yeah a mystery revealed he put 14 books in New Testament a mystery is revealed right there we got to get that mystery cuz when brother was caught up beond the curtain of time and ask him says uh uh uh would we do this he says Paul will Paul's group make it he said yes he said well I preach that's exactly what Paul preached they all scream Hallelujah the age comes down and this declares war so you're in a war this morning church how long I got Peggy that's she's my watch I got a clock right in front of me God that surprises me when I see o clock and this declares war the pre predestinated listen the predestinated receives it those that don't a plague drops on them so it when Paul come out and preached his message there was a gentile people to receive it and the Mystery of that time and they received it and were sealed away and they were the Grove they rejected it and a PL fell on them and they was sealed up right up right up through the age right through the age right through the age right through the age and we receive the truth and see that that's why we can see when he was crucified and his Soul and Spirit went in went into the pit down there and said I'm the one his third pole that that all my Prophet spoke of I'm him I'm him right and he said you can be they can be saved he went over on the other side and they started talking about whoa come here come here uh Mary come here Ezekiel middle wheel and he said this is the one this is the one this is the one now here I want to show something it's happened already one time if I can get it in my notes if I find out where it's at yes the second I got wrote on the first page I want you to see this God I didn't have that page okay Ephesians 4:8 this has done happened once and it happens again at your new birth okay he says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men do you understand what that means right right do you understand I I mean I know I know you do do you understand what he said he led captivity captive listen your bodies is still impr prison of a sword your soul is Immortal but your spirit I mean your body is is still a product of the fall right and must be set free okay he said this is what brother BR said he said Jesus Christ made the atonement he talking to his he they was he they was they had resurrected and he he says he Jesus said said I have made the atonement for you here I stand I've been the calvary I've made the atonement he atonement for you that's why your bodies has been released from prison yeah from captivity and I the almighty God have captured you you're mine and that's what he does to you sis that's what he does to each of us the Captivity that we were in he released from the soul and he come in and give us eternal life immortality in the soul but our bodies is still working to really because he come in the flesh that when he came into us his word could come in our flesh but it will not be completely totally released from that until the change of the body and then the prisoner house is closed to us it's gone and the dead in Christ arise they come down they are in prison they they stay there they don't come they are in prison right there they they're coming up but they're laying there right now yeah and then at that time when the spirit comes back and picks up to theophany comes down here and picks up the body in a glorified state it's released it's what what Adam and Eve called in there it's over right amen it's over now let me say Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice be Church children but in understanding be men he said to me you you aged Christians yeah you that says that you are and you are yeah you testify that what I've said is the truth he said if an angel from heaven comes and preaches any other gospel then I have preached to you let it be a curse I say again as I said before if anybody comes with any other gospel so I'm going to tell you this I'm going just say I'm going to say this according to this here I've talked about suffering if you don't suffer you ain't going to get this right here I'm going to turn my back cuz y'all can still hear me this right here is a is a human being it's got leav see that's why it's been done this way it's been done this way it's got leev in the world in it and by the last age the last age we receive the entire world the entire word and the full combat Beast is here in us to combat anything that comes at us and it's taking all the world out and putting his own leav in there see it's it's making it's it's a human being like this he's working inside of you he's is is is bringing your head in under his head and that you know the truth and you know what has happened to you and you're able to Captivate that he has absolutely made captivity captive and he's bringing it to an end knowledge this knowled this word knowledge means Revelation you get Revelation to get more faith you get from knowledge you get Revelation to get more you get from knowledge you get to get virtue you get Revelation from knowledge you get Temperance from patience God is brother he and he spreading it's making a vessel a person that God has called for the end time for the moment that we live for the change of the body this is the way that you're going to find it this is the way way somebody is preaching and teaching the way right and showing you the way to the Rapture okay I hate I hate to stop you get me started I hard to stop I don't I don't mean that smart e i i i i realize piggy tells me a lot to listen we we must go beyond our senses right that's it it's already happen I've seen it happen with gabri I saw it happen with my wife yeah what about you brother Mark you keep believing you believe

you to notice right here the the different colors at the top in this ammer see the Amber coming down that's my house yeah that's my house it come right down right down on my house I'm going to give you the story yeah we were uh we St out on the deck a little little while and we piggy come back in I stayed a little longer and I come back out I come back in the house and about that time the neighbor across the street Casey's house come come across she text piggy says God there's there's a rainbow over your house amen I mean I me text it God gave them witness to it yeah and and we walk out he was just right up there he wasn't way up under like we see a lot of rainbow it was just right there and the radiat the Amber was see you can see on the top side the regular sky and then and it come down and and fill the house yeah now I said let me just read this said on June the 19th 2014 at about 8:30 could I I asked Pig what time it was we were sitting in our family room Dean noticed two bright lights in the top of the trees I don't know what to it might have been three because it was a wall in between the two it and the light it was about it was about it was brightest brightest I ever seen I don't now you say what is that I don't know I'm tell you bright lights in the top of the trees and that was in Amber and there was an Amber glue that filled the rooms he started toward the Sund deck door and said come here piggy I want you to see this outside the whole backyard area cluding our house was covered in Ember glow shortly after we went back into the house I received a text from my neighbor across the street the text said that there was a beautiful rainbow over the top of our house and they took pictures of it we rushed out to the front yard we saw only a portion of rainbow I saw I called the neighbor and asked her if she could uh if we could see the pictures she said her husband took them with his cell phone and she would have him forward them to us another neighbor helped me helped me get the pictures on the computer so we could make prints so I just wrote that down but what I'm saying is God is moving amen he's fixing he he's fixing to do something he is doing something now we can we can go to uh uh conduct order and Doctrine book 145 he said give me a church full of the Holy Ghost right God do in a year what theologians fail to do in 2,000 years he said when the last Gentile comes in right God would known the church then but now listen something brought brought that about and I believe that I'm a part of what I've talked about today to bring that to bring us to a place that we are so wrapped in the virtues of God and so wrapped in the whole armor of God that he is not going to be able to penetrate us and we going to take a Rapture or and I say are you ready listen I I had things in there he says are you ready he says we would be physical Perth those that stays true to God we be phys are you ready for that I mean you know listen I'm going tell you something age ain't got nothing to do with the Rapture it ain't got nothing to do with the Rapture sister Brandon you got a right to call for the healing your mama so but nature I mean just we going to got old I can't don't py all time about that I said age ain't got nothing to do with it it's what God says we need to quit play in church and come to church and become the Church of God that's what we need to do that's right and and we bet and we better do it we better do it well I guess I'll just close right now don't talk maybe too much but uh but I appreciate being able to to be back again and uh I don't I I don't understand listen I'm going to tell you something I don't understand and I've thought about it many times for 14 years that I didn't minister in this church and I knew I was supposed to be here brother D brother Dale told me one time and it was and it's he know he's bless him he said Brother D I believe you made a mistake but see I had made a pack if that that I don't know if that's a way to say it but I had asked God something and I had to stay with what I asked him and and and I if if if I had a I'm I'm I'm trying to leave that alone the best I could but I may I asked God to you let this happen Lord if you want me to minister in Lula Georgia again and I said for 14 almost 14 years right there I couldn't move I've had people try to get me to start churches how can you stay I said I hear the word it's a word it's a word I mean I mean I mean preachers preachers tell me that and and I could not God made sure that I didn't have nowhere else to go right and and and in God and at God's appointed time what I asked him 14 years ago I heard it now that's why I'm here right I'm back but I'm sorry for 14 years if if I had not have done that maybe I would have been back many years ago yeah cuz I mean I but when you tell God something you got I said listen when God tell if God tells me to stay I'll stay if he tell me I want you to preach no more you sit right there I said I'm going to do it me my wife will tell you I I said but whatever he says and when he says it I said he has always let me know what to do and when to do it always I said he won't fail me this time he didn't there's a lot of people left this church and I feel sorry for them that's right you walk off from the word that's right you made a bad mistake if you don't receive the word that's preached to you cuz that's God's way of doing it fath comes by hearing if you got any if you got any problems with anything that I've said forgive me and and ask me I I don't have no problem but at least give me a chance to explain to you what I'm talking about I love every one of y'all and I love my pastor and my pastor and my pastors and my pastors and my pastors cuz you're all a hi to me that's he got AE all God bless you brother Dale am you say Amen to the word come ahead Brothers if we don't do what let's see how did Brother R said he said if we don't do what we told the Lord I'm paraphrasing and do it he said then you know we're in bad shape cuz we're changing not only you know we're trying to change his way of making it and so we we do what we say we got to do ourselves and then we move on for that amen just tell our brother how much you appreciate the word so what what do we got brother number 25 in problem number 25 anybody have a need the altar is open

statement isn't it I Surrender Sur you know God can't use someone that won't surrender he said what I've got to be strong I no he can't use you it's when you're weak as Paul says he said when I'm weak then I'm strong greatest intelligent man of the New Testament you could think of a teacher of the teachers was Paul yet he had to discount it all D useless and forget all of his great abilities wind up in jail wind up being beat for what he beli but yet he said whatever state I'm in there I'll just be content wouldn't that something a man that could have been ruler he would have been a lawyer or high priest or something as he was studying but yet he laid it all down for Jesus Christ anybody else that just have a need what about a great man like Moses could have been ruler of Egypt yet he for so call it that seeing Christ raise up a child in the west a go and then when it's old it won't depart remember that go remember Moses all of his life his mother kept telling him you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter you know what that just kept dwelling in the man's heart knocking on the door one day he tried in his own way yet he failed God took him out on the desert beat it all out of him when he come out of there he said let's go statue of a perfect man that's what God wants to see in people anybody else that just have a need just lay it all on the altar put it all on the on the Lord what is our silly little sicknesses and Petty feelings and things can you get right down as low as you can go still raise your hand say Lord I love you I love you Lord I don't know what this is but it'll it'll work out it all come to the right place he'll come to the right place why because he promised him many are the Affliction of the righteous but the Lord leadth out of them all oh yeah we just give up well I'm sick I've got problems that wouldn't fit too good in Jesus Christ he had no thoughts of his own he just wanted to serve he didn't want to be served he wanted to be a servant to mankind God of Glory manifesting the glory of God down on the earth with mankind what a wonderful thoughts and ideas we can have anybody else just have a need I surrender all all to thee surrender to Jes do you just let him have it what ever the problem we've got just let him have it let him have it he promised he'd take care of it but we want to lay it down pick it back up when it ain't going the way we want let him have it and just leave it laying there and see what he'll do surrender all anybody else just come surrender all all the about do you know Jesus Christ is your savior do you do you know him as your savior your lord your ruler you're all in all then when everything goes wrong you don't fall away you don't fall apart you look up and say Lord thank you thank you that I'd be chosen God was very proud of job he was very proud of him look what happened to the man for being right he come out of that with a a great opportunity anybody else just have a need surr am do you just give up everything give it up thank you Lord only in that can we be victorious only in giving it all to him we keep trying to figure it out what help with M anybody else surrender yes I surrender all I surrender all all to J I Surrender you know the hardest thing for mankind to do it's just to say I'm sorry people will give you all kind of gifts try to appease instead of just saying I'm sorry that's just mankind but until we realize how sorry we are it's hard to be sorry I was thinking the other day about you know being a Christian you know we don't have to be good all we got to do is die to ourselves and let him come and live you know we're forgiven he said we were was but I got to thinking about that just kind of sitting around on the bank I got thinking well Lord you don't ask us to be good you ask us to be truthful and admit a wrong and do but the hardest thing is a problem in a human being is you say I'm sorry Lord It's not that we're always having to repent it's the point that I always want to repent that was my thought it's no problem for me to say Lord I'm sorry no problem why because I don't want to do wrong I don't want anything wrong thoughts ideas I just want to let him have it he's not going to send me to hell but you see I love him by loving him that changes everything I don't want to Mar th name of my God I don't want to be a baby Petty crying I want to be what he wants me to be what about you you know what to do that it just takes a total surrender anybody else have a need I to the I surrender all amen you love him tell our brother how much you appreciate the message we believe it we thank God for his word and just walk there in don't we remember the announcements now that next Sunday this be one service morning service and we'll be having our fellowship together the afternoon because it kind of a celebration time we had thought about having uh really thought about having Friday night Saturday and Sunday Services because it's a great thing of the 4th of July here because in 1971 the 4th of July is when we started in this building and it's always a great thing to come to that Independence time you know I said then I said we're not trying to be anything different we just want to be what God wants us to be and just walk on with him amen there is really mean something coming around to the fourth everybody else is poop BL for everything else I'm saying thank you Lord for your word and your love and your guidance unto me it's a wonderful thing father we thank you for the word we've heard this morning and we pray that you would just let it dwell in our hearts because we realize and know for shity that Satan would try in every way to hinder us from becoming what you want us to be but he's already lost it's all over with we've just got to realize that and then they start shouting the Victory and no matter how much it looks like a defeat that we are victorious in you we love you father and we thank you go with the people now and be with each and every one of us bless us together and your love in Jesus name amen you dismissed amen
