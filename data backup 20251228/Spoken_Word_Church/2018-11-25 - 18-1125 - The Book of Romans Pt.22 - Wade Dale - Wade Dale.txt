========================================

all right we got everything taken care of now all right let's get on to Romans we were talking last week about the adoption so we had some oh there they are right there excuse me here now both : we're fighting you didn't mention they'll work I think they're missing their work today either excuse this man sir I got plenty they're always they bless this Maskull well bless this mess so Neil becomes their the seat of a family they call all children and Ivan shall thy seed be called we're talking about the adoption pertaining to Israel that is they once your children of the flesh these are not children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed all right so not all Israel Israel Israel natural is just as rotten as America natural or any other country natural have I got that right by now if you counted for the seed the state of the promise it's not seeds as of many but one seed which is Christ and that seed is the holding up for this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son then that's the promise and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil person according to election might stand not on works but of him the college now remember that was Jacob and Esau Jacob and Esau came from you would say good parents general Isaac and Rebekah but we know what he saw he and Esau sold his birthright and Jacob and as we see he many times in them think about this other day many times in the old tech you know it's the old testament he just take it without revelation then I would have picked a song better God took care of it all he took care of his daddy fed him clothed him everything is they did Jacob was underneath this moment's coattails what brother instead of her dressed up underneath the dress and a little boy so which one would you pick we the Big D saw we depict a lot of the ones in the in the Old Testament but without the Holy Ghost you can't discern that because we got to see today same things happening because Esau to me is the type of the anointed ones at the end time look good and everything was great he did everything he was supposed to do but he just couldn't come to that place to where he really wanted that number one birthright he really didn't care whether that happened to him or not see you're not our birthright it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost right so that's our birthright that is the claim with Jacob learned it more nice obvious all right so he's he's interpolating here but children be not yet born neither haven't done any good or evil obviously before you born you can't be good or evil but when you come into this world you have a choice God knew your choice they're there for Jacob have my love then he saw have I hated according to what foreknowledge right God for a knew what he saw would do he foreknew what Jacob was going to do nice thing about this of the day why doesn't God I've told you all that Sunday why doesn't God step in he knows what's gonna happen why don't he just he can't cuz then he would be making you do something he can't step in now he can step in according to your faith and according to them that you do according to the word but he can't step in and change he couldn't change the song so therefore he could write Jacob have I loved before him was born the same way with you and I if you take this thing let me just vanilla this thing you and I were chosen of God because of foreknowledge not chosen with God because of any other thing he looked down through times so what you would accept to what you would reject there for us all left up to you okay so therefore he could take a piece of the word the seed and put it somewhere but not inside of you like people and for into message preached you can't have you turn a life in a sinful body enters enter person in inner person the other person this thing still was born in sin but you understand what I'm saying once you're born again though like we've been trying to show upstairs now that you're born again this guy right here has a straight line to be glorified it's just gonna happen because what's on the inside but God knew Jacob would continue on Esau would not so there's your predestination by foreknowledge right cuz he couldn't put these all right here in this the art he saw this is what you're gonna do no he saw what he saw we didn't therefore he could come back and predestinate what shall we say then look is there unrighteousness with God in other words did he make it did he hate Esau because of what he wanted he soldered a nobody hated Esau because like Esau did God forbid for he said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it's not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of God that shows mercy know what is the mercy of God that's the grace of God now what's grace for grace for is four things you're gonna do know what you did before you can't ask forgiveness and then go do it that's what the Catholics do they go in and you know forgive me father I'm gonna go murder somebody well your forgive them go on no you can do that no so it's not him that will it nor him that run it but of God that shows mercy because remember the scripture tells us that God is not willing for anybody to perish you know where he came to this earth literally to die for every person but he knew everyone that would and everyone do it but he did it anyway because you can't stand on the day of judgment and say okay these guys right here I come to get them because they're special no I come to get them because I they accepted me you did that's the difference he said no laundry list of how many people you killed it's just you rejected Christ all right bad God showed mercy and there is mercy for the ones he's going to give a cup of water of my name he'll have to excuse me today well even the when we start going like this fifth seal man what you talking about grace to the nth degree we're gonna see that with the with the fifth seal you because God had to show mercy on them because he made them black he blinded them so it's his fault therefore he makes a judgment for that he gives them eternal life get on that rope but I even give a white robes here you give them a white robe laughter they've already passed on well that's really lovely to know that this fifth seal we're going into another dimension no way did he he blind also the ones that actually took of the crucifixion they glided along he blooded all of Israel right I know so so did those get eternal life like the Sanhedrin at that time and all that could if they didn't do like office a conference made his choice right tapas is one and said let's kill him all right but now remember and we'll get into the fifth seal what brother ground talks about let his blood be on us and our children and we'll see that all down through the two thousand years look tell me if it was even now many Israel is being persecuted and without the help of the United States and well God helping them they'd be destroyed in the local country not much bigger than Rhode Island compared to America you know a little beauty country with just several million people yet the whole world worries about Israel while they do that well they know there's something supernatural about them and there is something supernatural is when a scripture said unto Pharaoh even from this same purpose have I raised the up that I might show my power in thee is that my name might be declared on all the earth now what did he do I'm sweating Joss's phrases don't a fire over there yeah Jim sweating and I'm wet so but hopefully it's that demon getting out of devil leaveth you okay out there okay if you get too cold just stand up and start doing some kind of stance or something now look done didn't make Pharaoh do what he did the Bible says God hardened Pharaoh's heart you know what God did God put something before Pharaoh so he can make a choice he didn't make the choice for Pharaoh he put something before Pharaoh and Pharaohs it now you know them do that all right because God didn't put in dick whispering Pharaoh there and a pharaoh I'm done no he didn't do they can't do that he's not a respecter of persons just I mean you he'll weigh something before us to see what we'll do about it knowing what we're going to do with it at the moment yeah but it's a journey time it's a time of of I say judgment of us you know everything being judged all right so very sad to Moses I will have mercy but women Pharaoh even for this same purpose how am i raised in that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth therefore happy mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will hardness because the Bible says God hardened Pharaoh's heart God gave Pharaoh a choice right right yes and he didn't say I won't give you a choice but you need to tell Moses he can't go nobody can do that yeah I can't do that yeah he's a respect your personal if he did he just like I said he laid the plan before Pharaoh and fellowship huh this is what I'm gonna do I think that will say then unto me why does he get fined fall for who has resisted his will nay but o man he gained but o man who art thou that replies against God get the same form say to him that formed it why hast thou made me that's you can't do that now most people are gonna take this and say well this is that line you're talking about brother dick we can't do nothing but that line because the Potter has power over the clay it make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour but for knowledge he can do that cuz it's not then you've got to but listen who and look come on the day of judgment morning what are they gonna say you made me this way no he's gonna say no I didn't mean I'll let you come here for you to make a choice and this is the choice you make and the choice you made it's the judgment cause remember we judge ourselves time God like to plan out we judge ourselves okay after Farrah made the decision I had the choice Pharaoh had the choice God he couldn't turn back turn back just to be able to turn back nothing that's what I mean he was given the choice because Pharaoh said all right Moses go on in at the moment he said the end moments go ahead then what happen later God gets what I'm saying though God didn't come to Moses I mean come to Pharaon sit down and go now if you let them go this is what's gonna happen this was gonna miss them that's him telling him what to do he left Pharaoh in his own life his own spirit realm say hey I made a boo-boo I did something I finally didn't go I got nobody to cut my cut my grass and do my flowers you know what I mean in the modern time right I think I'm ready to do well how am I gonna build these big buildings without all these Israelites and then that's when God hardened his heart cuz the new Pharaoh would never turn back yeah and I'm telling you it this will help you with predestination in foreknowledge brother Branham said one time and I'm paraphrasing God knew if he gives Pharaoh a million years to change his mind he never would if he gave Adolf Hitler ten million years to change his mind he never would so therefore he could judge him by what he did because he knew he'd never changed his mind see that's so sad with people that's why God hardened Pharaoh's heart didn't you never turn around by decode the other way right he knew that he would call these home plagues down on himself and all those things like that have not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor under dishonor that looks like God met a choice he made that choice because of you what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath did say madam he endured with them why he'd give them time to repent every person that ever will come to the wife of judgment he give them a space of time to repent now you remember the girl that that was supposed to die and burn the rounds girls supposed to die God literally off then about six months later everybody pronounced her healed and all that stuff and she says mom I'm going home I read it the other day yes you like the ground the first time this one was and and she they got her back a lot but then we come to the end six more months later we're brother branham they pray for and remember somebody pronounced they want you into another place they pronounced Radel brother Ram Singh no no that's no what happened where the random pronounced or heal that's words thank God he said God you owe me an explanation that's right I'm done he said he said God let me steal on that for about three months nobody three months it's a long time but when God came to and God came to him and said look I should have took her when she drowned but I gave her six more months to get right with God we'll see that was God's mercy knowing that she would do that now if she had never done that he would have in swimming pool remembers you with that unite am I understand that so God is not a respecter person God can't make you do something that you don't want to do that's the sovereign that's the sovereignty of you that's why brother Branham said that you are pretty much a deity yourself your God Bob said to your gods you are a God because you can you can pass judgment on yourself or not yes seek the mercy of God it'll save you that's how close to this cuz man look at Adam here's Adam a son a gun that can move trees move the world move everything herb things on the world speak to me to the storm or whatever nut storm and speak to the wind and all this thing and all of a sudden one day he takes one of eight did / took nobody shouldn't have done it to me I could kill hope up and started over again that's not God God presented it to Adam and Adam doesn't what he took he presented the aive Eve took what she took that was the choice brother Brian said it was free moral agency then it's free money to see now god never done away with free moral agency and what is free moral agency it's what for you to choose which way you gotta go so God knowing we'll get into this with it in the fifth seal God willing willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction he knew what they'd off Hitler was gonna do but those six million Jews they ain't off Hitler killed God's gonna give them eternal life give them a white robe cuz they're part of that blinded group because they died for the testimony they held up the testimony of Jesus Christ we'll get into all that the fifth sale but the testimony they held what was their only testimony we're Jews right where did so he was lung suffering just to show his seat to show his apex of grapes he had to let health ever do what he did the Enderlin I couldn't do what he did he had to let all the people that persecuted the Jews down through the ages do what they did to show his power to show us mercy to me the shores mercy so all contracts brother Brown speaks many times a contrast you have to have dark to make to appreciate life you have to have sinned appreciate you getting getting saved if not then you just go continue on just like your honor then he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy so what's he doing all that this raft fitted to destruction that he might make known the reason to blur on the best of the mercy we can say today God's had mercy on us we accepted his mercy therefore we come under his mercy therefore we come under his grace we she had a for foreknowledge prepared unto glory even the last know what Paul even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentile as he said in a sane or as a ax I will call them my people which were not my people check out and her beloved which was not beloved remember brother Brown said we weren't even looking for the Messiah we're not looking from the side we were looking for none of that all right my beekeepers chatted in okay and I it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them you're not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God didn't have we are now the children of God right yes how great is that that's where you see Paul has went from the Jews over to the Gentiles to take out that two thousand years in the dam seventy weeks that two thousand years of of Gentile age seven Church ages sorry then what's he gonna do he's going to come right back into the talking to the Jews Isaiah also cried concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved if a remnant going to be saying we'll get into the rim with a little bit later because you got talking about the remnant in the fifth seal for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because the short work will the Lord make upon the earth number that work that word work is what brother they've been talking about it's translated as word a short word you say short word well ours has been real sharp but 2,000 years in the schema of the earth it's nothing very short all right but he's not going there's no moon just cut it short he's gonna cut it short in righteousness a group of people is gonna realize what's going on take the word and we're gonna get out of here and inconsequent deal with the Jews because they can't deal with is using us at the same time and I was a said before he said the lord of sabbath had left us a seed we had been in sodom and been made like Gomorrah what's he saying if there had been a seed in that two thousand years when Israel rejected God he coulda ended the world right there he could have because his chosen people rejected it but there's a remnant there's a wild olive branch to have you come in the Gentile bride because remember Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed everything except for lightness two dollars well it's why but she didn't make it all the way out what shall we say then here's this whole summation what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness in other words right up here at the top he's talking about the Jews had the adoption they had the law they had the Torah they had all the promises they had all these things Gentiles didn't have nothing there were dogs they were to be destroyed all of them i'ts in the Old Testament they were Gentiles all those like Hittites all right Jay besides and then we find websites call the night why shall we say then that the Gentiles whose father not after righteousness have obtained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith because really that's why Jesus in his in his mind I'm gonna step into the mind of God from the mouth of Jesus Jesus is sitting there walking through these people they're always needing a son they're always needing a prophecy they're always needing to throw something on them they're always needing their hands laid on Jarius coming lay hands on my child but he talks to a Gentile one day and a Gentile says he's gotta come in you're a man of authority I'm a man of authority I say go I sneak up you know the words he said you say go Damon you say come Damon in other words he knew Jesus had some kind of power they didn't need a connection he said I found a little greater faith in Israel then even the ceremony Chien woman what an example she sits on her David have mercy never paid her any attention yeah ain't no right only she did my lord see that coming Gentile fusion everybody else he turned and he said why do I need to get no words why am I giving you the Old Testament promises when you're a dog your gender you have no lineage you have no nothing she said yes Lord but we'll just take the crumbs they coming off the match September 1 in in Jesus's mind he's like man I I've never seen this kind of faith and what was it all everyone I was Gentile did ever that happen to so that's why God wanted they obtain righteousness by faith the Jews were laying back on when we got the Torah we've got the Ten Commandments we've got the promises we've got though we've got the we've got done that's why Jesus said yeah you got all that and I sent prophets to tell you that and you kill them yeah and now you paint their tunes and say oh oh oh poor lies there when I was able as a young boy with the Prophet they cut him in pieces and barity kill me because of what he's saying I'll say within that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is the faith baby israel c which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness they're still in the Old Testament they're still in the Torah they're still looking for on the side where for question mark because they sought it not by faith that's just the whole thing they started not by faith but as it were by the works of what the law go right back to the law for they stumbled at that stumbling-stone as in the straight and behold their lands on a stumbling stone on a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so they sent God sent the stone to Revelation God sent the man King himself to his people walked in the temple talked with him try to convince them trying to preach to him tell them who he was and they stumbled right over the very man that was standing there they stumbled all over him and called him everything but the thing but he was given it but look it was prophesied already he's gonna come design a stumbling stone a rock of offense why they hated him that you hated Jesus and here's never believeth on him shall not be ashamed now watch policy if you just for a second we'll we'll go upstairs I'd save my voice from the snatching their brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved cuz poke her up with all events from John Paul was a Jew he grew up in the temple with Victoria and with them the law and with them but when he received the Holy Ghost he's like man in other words you know what he's saying why can't y'all see this he said why can't you see this and I'm sure the Lord told him only by the Holy Ghost are you gonna see this that's why he said lo I turn to the Gentiles go to Gentiles to get my baby you and I have to take everything we believe by faith we never saw brother Branham but we know he was there we never saw Jesus Christ we never saw Paula Irenaeus Martin ollie we never saw George all by faith and if it's listen I said let me convince the other day it is hearsay until you until it is a revelation it's all hearsay until it's a revelation when it comes to revelation it's not hearsay anymore you're what you have agrees with what's being said and that's a revelation other than that is hearsay yeah and you can't have hearsay in a court of law you only have a way of true witness it's why the Bible says in Revelations 3:14 the faithful and true witness the beginning the creation of God you and I are the true witness that Christ was here because he said he'd come back he said he'd live inside you brown bear them record that they have a zeal of God hey you will find a very devout than the Orthodox use over there right now they live that torch of the law they live that loss of the law yes but what's he doing them it's not bringing Christ to them that's for sure the only way they're gonna get crises when he comes to us and takes us out of here then he's gonna go to them by the promise in the Bible from bear the record the tamaseel' of God but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness we be Abraham's seed we have Moses I've always said on countless walk them one day just like we did he walked them he said I got Moses go and they didn't have a clue what Moses don't that we walk around saying like out of quote I got a brother Brown quote well if you don't know that's not reveal to you then it's just a quote it's hearsay what does it mean when it says they they have a zeal of God and I would think that that would be with no they have a zeal of God would not according to knowledge holy ghost knowledge Holy Ghost revelation knowledge they have a knowledge of the truth but not according to knowledge you got to see that that's a two-fold meaning ceiling says look for I bear them record that they have a zeal of God , but not according to knowledge he can't be that they don't know what the Torah is the Lincoln reciting word-for-word it's right it's the knowledge that God's already come God was Jesus Christ he's already come he's already Donald come they don't have that knowledge they still think he's coming now they got a knowledge of he's coming oh yeah and they know I come pretending many times before they know what I just got to be here before he can come they just didn't get the forthcoming on the life that they're looking to the fifth coming up Elijah you battle right with that cuz every year that Elijah cup sits on their table and they're waiting on the lies you become and sit down to that table take that cup and drinking and then go messiahs coming yeah cuz they literally go outside their door tradition see there they have a knowledge tradition they open the door they look down the street this win this way they close the door they take the cup set it upon them um shelf and say until next year whatever that is in the Hebrew tongue until next year because they know their lives you've got to come before the grain breads then the Lord they know last mile come forward to them you extend to them that's Malachi 4 but when the two prophets go to Israel and start preaching that Malachi 4 is the fourth coming up Elijah and they missed it and here's his message they're gonna say oh man and then I'm gonna see William Brown they will see Jesus Christ Kalista message is not William Brown this message you struck down all right for they being ignorant of God's righteousness what's God's righteousness he came to her to save him then they turned him down and going about to establish their own righteousness like I said we got Moses you know we wait Abraham's our Father when he talked front at home he said you'd understood Abraham you'd understood me have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God they cook right here's your answer for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that could be the lead bit all right let's go [Music]
