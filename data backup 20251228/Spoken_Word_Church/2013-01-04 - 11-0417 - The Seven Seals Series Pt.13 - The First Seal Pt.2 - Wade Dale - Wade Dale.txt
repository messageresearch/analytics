========================================

matthew 24 don't worry everyone Matthew 24 what we're going to start in now is the first seal want you to keep in mind a few things we're going to go through these seals very slowly may take us all year but that's fine the Lord comp will talk about later but there's a few things I want to cover number one we're going to cover the natural aspect of the seal what's going to happen because the natural feel open that rider really does riding in a what you might say a pogrom I think our Nate Pope when we're gone as far as the seal being open my closet on the mat last Sunday that fifth seal doesn't really opened the sixth seal doesn't really open until of two prophets are standing on the earth and they open the seal preparing so there's a natural happening alright then there's an happening to the jews during that time and then there's a spiritual aspect that you anomalous catch okay so there's three things we're going to cover on each seal some of them more than others because i'll be true full with you out there sum of money other thing as much as i did the other all right there but if you ever have any comments we know this is open for for discussion but the first seal remember Claude read verse 3 last Sunday but let's go ahead into the other three questions work when shall these things be once you'll be the side I'm not coming the end of the world right okay jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you that's the first thing you said all right God in simplicity the first thing brother ground priests with God in simplicity first seal before the first deal before the break he preached God and simplicity take heed that no man deceive you someone comes with our evaluation that's not in the word that compared with the Bible I'm gonna believe one thing he's come to deceive you okay alright so now take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name and say I am Christ and shall deceive many there's your first seal hmm Christ come as Christ saying I am Christ and show the scene many many shall come in my name a lot of things are done in the name of Jesus that are not true they're false meaning shall come in my name so the deception is they're going to come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they're going to say I am Christ but they're going to be deceiver all right see middle for many shall come in my name saying I am price now let's turn it over and expound on that just a little bit to verse 24 4.3 let's go to 22 so this is where we pick it up so I'm going to go another way in this scripture just popped up very very fitting that we read this Matthew 24 22 remember the first seal let's just run through this deal real quick all the seals the first seal is first five going to mark this in your Bible of marking them second seal brother branham read first six third seal is verse seven and eight and they all overlap so don't just say that is all that's going to happen though they all overlap each other all right if I understand about an overlap God doesn't just stop start something to stop it and begin something else he had an overlap in the church edges one age would blend into the other really the church changes should have been drawn like this according to what the Prophet said this is the way the church ages should be drawn okay because there's not a big dot then there's a gap no dude right here is where that quarter comes and they were preaching on that the quarter stands here these people fell away God brings a profit on this thing or messenger on the same page restores back and bring this message I think the gut that so every time writing this lap over its when that Porter comes in was not like this you got a gap now there's leftovers to the agents because some of the people but to me you know what this is right here you know what this will place it grace that's the grace of God to let the people that had the mindset of Luther go right over into Wesley and Wesley be the messenger to the age God should have said that's it if you don't believe Wesley you're dead but no the Lutheran's were still alive they have not denominated all the way yet there was true people in there same way when brother I'm came he said you kind of cost for people when there was at in a constable age and then brother branham brought his message but he had these people in this age were coming on through into the 60s look at that fence Bosworth fffff Bosworth was not a part of the message of the island it's hard to say but Beth haven't been one of the greatest brother I'm said one of the greatest man of healing the old old tree but he was not part of the message of the hour he was back in caught in Pentecostal aids because he never accepted the baptism and they Lord Jesus Christ but he would ever wear brother Brent you know I mean he probably I would say accepted it later but as far as one God they probably still had a Trinitarian idea i know for a fact that Smith Wigglesworth and some of those were not in the name of Jesus Christ they were fought all back in that father son Holy goes baptism right you have to listen to brother around the way he preaches spectacle especially back in the early 50s I'm going to say this online he was a compromiser then because he was trying to bring these people i was reading in nineteen even in 1959 he said i believe in denomination he said I just don't believe in saying this is the only denomination because he was trying to do what Graham this tree on this side of this tree on this side planted together and make one beautiful tree but as he got closer to the revelation of these seals he said now I know why I've always been against organized religion and he preached hard against it you live from 62 to when he passed away he lost all of his influence he preached a raptor message one of the greatest message you'd appreciate preaching in a trailer with a Bible many people are sitting right here what about a man had preached before thousand hundreds of thousand the people and at the end of his ministry he's sitting here talking to 20 some people preaching some of the greatest sermons that man has ever heard since Jesus that's right he sure did how he wondered why he he always he'll tell you in the sea okay so now I know why I was against that thing when he saw that first Hill open and saw that white horse rider and riding through those denominational systems and the father son Holy know about Desmond all that he knew right then he said when that steel broke he knew that all back before that was wrong and for sure when that seal broke when these things broke to that prophet anything from their forward is against organization is against denominationalism right not to people but the place they're stuck in alright so the first day of the fifth verse second seal 6 verse third seal the seventh I mean third seal seven and eight fourth seal 9 15 10 to about 14 then you then you're going to read what we read that's what I'm going to do this and then the six cell basically starts verse 27 28 29 30 31 they got to remember it's actually mostly verse 29 30 and 31 then what does he do Jesus starts into the parable of the fig tree alright and that would be a key later on but let's read right here in verse 21 so that should be Great Tribulation such as not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened now they're saying that they've been shortened by a couple of milliseconds because the earthquake has pushed the world back up to the top of this axis so guess what our days are being shortly all right there shall be no there shall no flesh be saying we're looking for a body tank this is flesh good but for the elects sake those days you'll be short then if any man shall say unto you lo here in Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs one of them is much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect the old I told you before now God remember God mother I said God says something twice he wants you to hear it cuz he don't repeat itself but this must be very important behold I've told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you so they is not a system than people then hmm they is people if they shall say unto you behold he is in the deserts going on for behold his in a secret chamber believe it not and I wrote in my Bible because he's in the bride nowhere else you know you that's hard to say my brother round him started heart started really going hard on denominations and they turned away from him because he realized they realized exactly what Jesus was the same Ministry of Jesus with brother branham same ministry with Jesus here Jesus is in Matthew 24 he's come to the end of his ministry and he's breaking the seal keep reaching six tables right here all right brother branham comes the end of his ministry the same thing that you watched Jesus they kill him because of his doctrine how come he heal the sick and brother drowned by collecting the greatest night the greatest thing that say about him on the internet is the Brent brown was the great faith healer and he started them or not the faith healer but the movement of faith inning and he was a spearhead but when he got the teaching doctrine he started messing up in God took him off the same in other words in 1965 because he was teaching false doctrine when he got into the real opening of the word guess what happened same thing happen is the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes of old and Jesus's time they said we don't we can do it actually we want to kill him you know and I'm sure they sometime if I could've got by with it and let them they'd probably kill for the round even when the great Gordon Lindsey that went to Africa with its all the great things and wrote two books a prophet sent to South Africa turned against him because of dr. and he's one of the big ones that says in that book about God's generals that he had that he really messed up by going into doctrine and I'm standing for God had told him to be but they just didn't understand that brother on his message was progressing just like Jesus's message was progressing Jesus's message progressed he said the kingdom have repent 14 of heaven his hand but what'd he do he starts healing the sick raising the dead casting out Devils all through while he was doing his teaching but when he came up to the very end right here he was with nobody but the disciples on this mountain all right now the Mount of Olives before remember when the Mount of Olives he taught the Beatitudes there was one hundreds of thousands of people there but now what about right now though his disciples came unto him to showing the building the temple and he SAT upon amount of other than the verse 3 and this I post came unto him privately he was getting part of the time now where the disciples did him hardly won't be around and remember when he was crucified there was none of them around him Judas went and hung yourself and the other 11 just scattered like a bunch of chickens but then we're born again so they didn't have nothing to hold him but for many verse 5 shall come in my name and say I am Christ and shall deceive many low hit Christ is in iron movement Christ is in this moment look at the signs and wonders that's what to me that's why it says the mystery of iniquity now just iniquity is the mystery of iniquity all right there's a mystery behind that that we can sit in this age and we're going to read some more scripture let's turn to Psalms 2511 and read their Psalms is full now look what did what was David David was a prophet but David was not a born again Christian like you and I'm with a holy ghost in his soul he was an anointed prophet and the old but his heart was in the right place he wanted to be right with God but there was nothing there that the blood of bulls and goats could not take away his sin it just covered then it Psalms 25 David even in the condition that David within he said in verse 11 for thy name sake o Lord pardon mine iniquity it is great what man is he that feareth the lord himself each in the way that he shall choose his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the earth the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him and he will show them his covenant let's go to John 51 I just kind of put some of these together this is the one we always quote which clip them two scriptures together but watch David on man burst one of 51 now go phils you guys go feel Bible psalm 51 was written when Nathan the Prophet came unto him after he had gone in to the bad about Sheba so he'd already committed adultery with his best friend and he was fixing to have his best friend killed when Nathan the Prophet came in and told David said hey there was a man that had many sheep remember many cows or goats or whatever I said but there was one man only had one and said the man that had many goats killed the man who could go and David said that man I'm sure they won't die and Nathan said you're the man because in other words you had five hundred wives your I had one and you wanted her and you killed him to get hurt but he said David you won't die because God has saw the inside the Inside Man God had grace in that old testament that's pretty bad you know to have your best friend killed no but I've hundred beautiful wives you have a minute at your beck and call five her mother-in-law flan five wives at your beck and call but yet you want this one woman but remember one thing predestination is in work here David had to be with Bathsheba so the Solomon can be born so God saw that line and through permissive well he allowed best sheba to marry your eye but in God's perfect will he had Isaac had become in the Solomon had to come through that as a type of Christ well you know why we were all born in sin I'm gonna read you right here shapen in iniquity should have been divorced should have been thrown away but I want to have something from us right so we come to a permissive well with the word brought us back to perfect the perfect little duck because we stand today within your birth that's what i wanted it was a beautiful time and raise up Solomon which that's what we do we give birth to Jesus Christ okay well that have mercy upon me O God according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of doc tender mercies blot out my transgression wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin fried knowledge David acknowledged watch David all the time he is a very repentant man very pennant even when you know the best Sheba the first child that they had an adultery does it it won't live but still David if you'll read there in in King's David right up until the baby died I mean got cold and babies on that soon Nathan nobody's going to die but he's still he laid on the floor he cried sackcloth and ashes to try to you know to try to get God to turn and turn around with God was going to do it probably knows my transgression in my sin is ever before me David couldn't forget you now don't forget our sin I wish we could because you got somebody nevermind besides yourself the devil people there when you did it to my sin is ever before me against the the only have I sinned and see David understood this is something to you and I've got to understand let me be real plane because we'll talk about our lives about iniquity the things that we did wrong maybe went out come into daughter had affairs whatever it doesn't matter but remember we sinned against God yeah i know we send against our blog or whoever we got to make that right but watch David against thee thee only have I sinned we got to come back with that repentant heart knowing that God didn't wants to do that we got to repent even though we're Christians now let's come up bringing up to two now even being born again ditch the whole things you do wrong will allow you to tell something that you don't you know that you don't do that you should have done or didn't you shouldn't done against the only have I sinned and done this evil in my side then thou mightest be justified we're going to talk and put that first seal we're going to see justification when we talk about the spiritual part all right that thou mightest be justified when thou speaketh and be clear when thou judges behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold our desires truth in the inward park and then the hidden part i shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean washing me and I shall be whiter than snow then he keeps going hi my face made me to hear joy and gladness at the bones which now is broken may rejoice I've got face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart O Lord this is the song that we think every newer right spirit within me cast me all the way from thy presence and take not the Holy Spirit for me restoring to me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with our free spirit then will not teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee watch what David's doing he's not only saying god I'm sorry for what I did but I'm going to teach others why did brother Brian say that Abraham was chosen over anybody else remember I read the quote I very long ago he said because Abraham he knew Abraham would pass that faith on to the next generation into the next generation that he would tell his children what had happened in his journey so God don't want us to keep this thing inside will tell tonight right all right now let's go to Psalm 79 and eight Oh remember not against former iniquities let doc tender mercy speedily prevent us for we are brought very little help with oh god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins for thine name's sake then for some 1033 I put an order so you have to pull them back to switch back and forth to the bottom you there's another song that we wrote on saying a lot here but what's the Lord on my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name first one verse to bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all mine iniquities forgive it I wrote I circled that th forgive it that's an ongoing happening forgiveth believe it all right he'll forgive us all that iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeems the life from destruction to crown it d with loving-kindness and tender mercy all right let's go to Isaiah 6 just keep flipping on three bottles there right after proverb we ever get withdrew with a sealed I think we're gonna take the Book of Isaiah and starting the first chapter in this goes to the prophecy in the book on today at this table because of 66 books in the Bible in there 66 chapters in Isaiah now it's not step by step he skipped around could you see if you think but but still in the first of the Bible you'll see on the first of all there you'll see him building like in Genesis Exodus Leviticus middle of the Bible here comes Jesus in the end of the Bible you'll see the future home so I bad as I complete program today commentary of the Bible in 66 chapters so like I said if we we get prisons with a steel wheel that's what I think we'll do I that six verse 7 but I don't want to dwell on that let's go on this let's go to verse 6 then flew one of the cell phones now this is this is isaiah little young boy he is being he is going to the temple and this is where he says here am I send me ok las leyes got this burning desire to serve God with God just O king uzziah died because what happened with keen use on remember he tried to mess a little bit with with some of the holy things and he was a king he was breached but but Isaiah was a mentor of use I so God had to take his eye off the same solely so that I was there to see this right here in the year the kingdom's I died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne pilot lifted up his train filled the temple go to verse 6 then flew one of the cell phones under me having a live coal in his hand which I take them with the tongs from both the altar elated by my mouth and said load this has touched our lips and thine iniquity is taken away and I sin purged wow you got to know you more again the guy's just being covered by the blood of bulls and goats what God is going to so purge this man called out loud that I was going to write one of the greatest commentaries of the Bible but he's one of the greatest prophets but he was a young boy remember if you're very young I there was a very young man when he began this began his ministry and also i heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me so now let's go to Isaiah 40 we're going to read this and get get some of the scripture first two verses comforts you comfort you my people that your God speak he comfortably to Jerusalem now remember we are spiritual Jerusalem right there could you then crying to her her her her her her bribe her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she has received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins in other words she's paid for her sin in other words this is isaiah them are in captivity and they're getting ready to go out and even the commentary of Schofield says looking beyond the captivity chapter forty to sixty six so he's saying that israel is getting ready to break forth into something but her iniquity had to be pardoned because of her double sin that she had committed before that's why she was in county that's why you and I go into captive you know I captivity for us here backslide if your back slid you're in captivity because Israel would come out with a mighty hand of God got adolescent they would absolutely just prosper for years and then all of a sudden what would happen they'd get a little axe they quit going to church and quit reading their Bible they quit studying they let the cares of the world takeover hello character in the world takeover you know what gotta do gotta throw into captivity one bribe does better under persecution so Israel did better under persecution okay so everything in Israel yes brother instead Israel with God's time Pete well if we taught them then whatever is happening to them is happening does alright God said he would bless Israel never would forget her but here is a point out all this and then we'll then don't stop maybe got any questions I want you to ask questions more than you ever have is I want you leave without you know with a question in your mind but what we've read today is from Psalms a man David and Isaiah two great men of the Old Testament have read anything in the New Testament we're going to look at the three aspects you're going to look at one go back over to Matthew 24 all right what many shall come in my name and say I am Christ and shall deceive many now let's read before we go let's go to revelation 6 and once you put a marker in there because we're going to go back and forth from revelation states Matthew and a lot of lot of other scriptures Revelation chapter 6 verse 1 right and I saw when the lamb opened one of the sealed I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he does that only had a bow and a crown was given I want you to watch this word given power was given unto him that crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so this person that wrote out he didn't just conquer it says and conquering ok see if like Napoleon he went and conquered France or wherever not France but maybe Spain well he went on in Concord other places but there was a time when he stopped right brother Randall said that this horse rides on right on into eternity now the horse and the rider is not eternal okay but he rides on off because he's going into perdition because it's not the good guy this is the bad guy but see it's the mystery because he's here on a wild horse that was the great mystery was the first unfolding because let me let me try to explain something brother Brown said there's a mystery and then there's a supernatural element oh and I'll bring the quote next Sunday there's an element underneath that mystery see so it's like you know everybody so all the climbers right was the Antichrist that's the opening of the first field that's part of it that's part of it but it ain't all it but it actually what it does is it if you roll those things up and put a seal on it when you pump at first seal off its not just one page its many pages you just keep peeling them back because when the Prophet preach the seals he didn't just go off the saint or I his start preaching go by preaching one back then and then Jesus Christ no he broke the revelation that was known for no man underneath that remember he had the vision of the of the pyramid and you got that crowbar and he pulled it off and he said I he said I saw things that man had not seen before but if you were going to read that Sunday he said if I can give it out the way it was given he said it would take a long time he said but I'm just going to hit the high spot well what was he doing him saying there was a group of people that was coming that would feel anything after understand what was going on so I don't think brother branham this is my my thoughts on this brother branham brought the revelation this book was sealed up with seven seals okay but once he popped that seal open to me it revealed the whole Bible but there was still other seals to me open the only thing one thing he did this old one stealing oh well only but that much of the Bible was revealed no because he said the Bible can brand new book alright so that's what I that's just what I see of the field it's not just because listen once brother Brennan spoke that and said the white horse rider was the Antichrist that did not throw the devil in the fifth he knew he was the writer he he knew he was the one that I was talking about he had just had everybody so bamboos without through time when John wrote this Satan remember is right there he's not off somewhere off in the garden somewhere with his feet kicked up he was right there with John on the Isle of Patmos and when he saw that white horse go out same you that was him but he knew that if nobody ever revealed that that he could he could keep deceiving the people into believing that that white horse with a white righteous church that's why in the end time it says I am God not a lot god I'm god i'm going to send temple of God okay so this first seal mystery is not just at the white horse rider I preached it one time in the church and the guy never asked me back I really don't care but that doesn't bother me Liam really bothers being my in my spirit but it doesn't bother me as a person I really you know I think people didn't want anything that's okay but that's not the mystery it was a mystery before now brother Brown said the mystery is history but you just don't say well the white horse rider was was the Antichrist and we know that now boy let's go on to steal number to know there's there's there's little bitty revelations under that that we gotta pull the pages back brother item open that first seal and listen brother Brown picked first seal this is just an illustration this is the first field now not to or seven were sealed nobody's ever looked at they always read that scripture just like I read it and thought that white righteous church was was God and the Holy Ghost even brought round then put my brother Clem brother I'm cooked and broke that seal and open that book he saw there was volume inside that book but he only skimmed over i'll read it to you next Sunday when the first hill he said he said if I hit it he said he'd take months for me just on the first seal but what he done he hit the highlights what we calling this a bullet points everybody I want a bullet point ends they'll go if you do a resume or whatever it'll go bullet point one graduated bullet point to first job for the point three you know 20 years experience but inside that 20 years experience what you do you work for 20 years you get this you did this you this you went to school but you put 20 years experience then when they ask you the question tell me about this 20 years experience well that to me that's the way to say before God came in and said okay double one run around you don't have time to do it on number two the people that are needing this it's not even alive some of them yet so you could put this out because brother I'm cities right here on the books and the tapes right why did he say God like to do you like for you to read between the line and that's what we did while horse rider Antichrist mystery of iniquity we'll go through some of these things but we've got to get in between this because the mystery of iniquity goes all the way that mystery of iniquity goes all the way to the white throne judgment called if iniquity is found in you you will not go to heaven that's what David said he said hide my nickel to do away with my iniquity get rid of this thing let's get rid of this thing to start with okay do you understand what we're going to go the seals I think the seals and even even that preaching them in 1982 he preached like seven sermons on the first seal but inside those seven sermons you can preach a thousand other sermons because of what went on in between that that was something that was open that book was opening and what that did is he took this book God did through a messenger the book was already open so he just started paid one h2 h3 h4 h5 brother ground just went you know like section 1 section 2 section 3 and when it broke open what did it do it let men of God go in there with these great big nuggets and you start hacking off a little looking at a time and breaking it down to the people and that's what the seals are to me brother ground preach that in one night he preached the first seal second nineteen freeze the second seal that's not the end of it that's just the beginning that was something that when he whipped that top off he never said he put the top back on he said I went that top off and looked down and saw things that man had never seen before and remember you got to remember one thing to keep the vision of him and brother Gene goat remember when he went out he was out here somewhere brother gene was trying to climb up there brother Brandon without here MacLeod he said he stood around how can I get out there he said only God can take a man out there that wasn't just for the problem it might oughta member jingo but it was for our people in the end time to get out there on that platform because we got stand with that problem stood any question but this first see like I say it might take a while we're going to go through a lot of them we're going on you know a lot of avenues going steady we're going to still stay in the first sale remember once a bullet one mystery of iniquity wild horse rider okay remember those things power was given imma leave it right there
