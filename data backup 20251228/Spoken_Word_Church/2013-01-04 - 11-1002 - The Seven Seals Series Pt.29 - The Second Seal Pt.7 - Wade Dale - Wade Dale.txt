========================================

and go our week end is okay and go now the hunting season's up everybody uh open everybody and one more thing if anybody last night if you were not in a bible study which most of you were um this is i'll put this on the internet too that brother bob black sent me this and we were talking about the doctrine of the river jordan doctrine that was going around the message there was a man named cerenthus back in john the apostles time and polycarp and irenaeus's time that preach the same thing he denied the supernatural birth of jesus making him the son of joseph and mary and distinguished him from christ who descended upon him after baptism and left him against the crucifixion so this man actually 30 years 40 years after jesus died was already denying the deity of jesus christ saying that he was just a man he was born a man walked through the earth as a man then god came down and made him god and then he walked through life as god for three and a half years and then god left him and he was crucified just a man and then i'll just read this to you but it is name is serentis c-e-r-i-n-t-h-u-s and you can pull it up on the website just punch in sarenthus it'll tell you all the things there's a lettering page about him it's a whole page here but this is kind of this is something that you and i y'all think that i'm a little brash listen to what john john the apostle said to have so detested surrenders that he once fled a bath house when he found out that cerenthus was inside he went running out the door saying let us flee lest the building fall down for surrenders the enemy of the truth is inside wow go to a church and do that flee the enemy of the truth right and one tradition maintains that john wrote the first two epistles you know john wrote the three little john john one john two first john second john third john they say he wrote the first two johns in count to counter cerethis's heresy but look at the same devil because chris got this from pagan gnosticism and gnosticism is spelled g-n-o-s-t-i-c-i-s-i-m and he mixed them with christianity now what did the roman catholic church do same thing took astor to jupiter to mars and all these and put them into peter paul of saints so this guy this man was the same thing see he said that jesus had a dual nature he was both jesus and the christ now people that's exactly what they're teaching in the message that's that exact same devil right there in the message right here i'm not saying the people are devil the devil's the devil then he gets on people and so this river jordan doctrine that everybody's you know so split over started 2 000 years ago actually started in the garden of eden when jesus went to jesus when satan told eve she'd be like god no we don't want to be like god satan wants to be like god we want to be god man manifest in another form you know i had a question several years ago that i didn't know how many devils there were you go back that far and you've got a devil that was and the way it was told to me and it makes sense once the devil gets on somebody and they believe that that belief will stay with so he can leave that person right and just go to another person right so you can see why it doesn't have to be the millions of people in the world you know you know brother brown said those devils don't die the people die and they just move over to another person like keith always said in jamaica they've got the same problems we do it's just a different name right same devil different name you know different name same devil so same way with this and i'm glad brother bob black pulled this up because we see even one of the other brothers that preaches that jesus was not bodily resurrected he's a message preacher that they took jesus body throated out in the desert well that's exactly what if you keep on going sirensis also said to have taught that jesus was raised from the will be raised from the dead at the last day that he was not resurrected at the time of the resurrection that that body just went away and jesus will come back and resurrect enough and a new body so lady i don't understand i was reading the book on the nights templar and i wanted a it's good story and brings in a lot of facts but when it gets to the last few chapters i was waiting to find out what their thing was well it came to where they found this box that was gold embossed opened it up and it had the bones of jesus okay he didn't resurrect he died they had his bones okay so that's catholic all of it is catholic doctrine covered over in something else sure because everybody and seed message believers are so much you say roman catholic and they go devil antichrist but when you take that demon and you put it over in the message and you slide it in under a little bit different name or a little bit different doctrine see yeah see the message people are not teaching that joseph and mary they know that jesus was born virgin because the prophet taught that so they can't teach like the whole thing that serrantha said serena said that joseph and mary had the body of jesus which we know that's wrong because of the teachings of the prophet so they can't get by those quotes they just say okay well he was virgin born but he wasn't god until the river jordan well they just take pieces of this doctrine satan satan could not take this whole doctrine and hand it to people in the message because they wouldn't believe it but he takes bits and pieces and he puts a little hair and he puts a little hair and puts a little here and you come up with false teaching while teaching makes false people right that's why i don't listen to people i just want to give the lord thanks this morning for our trip down to vidalia that's a one long trip uh-huh and moving furniture in the process too so we didn't get until about 10 o'clock last night but i sure appreciate god's nurse you're late okay hey brother joe how you doing good to see you good to see you i've got to pray i don't hear signing or not do you know this leukemia medic don't have if they say that okay your blood count your blood count goes up so your blood count must be point four to 14 that's your average when you don't have stuff okay he has started going up and when he was sick it went up to like uh 40 40 47 40. and so he he went back to the doctor and it had come down to 29 and they said well that was because she had a fever and all that when he went back to the cancer doctor this past week it's 14. and it's been for a year for two or three years it's been a way above the power of your prayer we have to we have to keep we really have to keep the devil awesome brother david i mean we have to like you said i could try to quit all i wanted to but if everybody's praying all week sister i told him you know her i said hi you know just me you know i could just quit everything be okay she said no she said too many people are praying during the weeks and that's pushing and pushing pushing pushing well i appreciate all your friends okay all right let's go to the second seal go to chapter six of revelation and good to have everybody here with us today and we have a room full if we get any more we're gonna have to have it outside we're in the building oh no we won't do it outside we'll send it away then y'all stay in here i don't have sister gwen and my fan on this morning okay revelation 6 all right good to have sister francine with his wrong way all right second seal when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see they went out another horse that was red the power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword power was given and a sword was given and it's just like we were talking just now about this river jordan doctrine and all this junk that's going around in the message the bible says that god will let you believe a lie and be down by it just like what we were talking about you take that doctrine in any doctrine i'm going to talk about this day any false doctrine you take that in and what's going to happen if you nurture that thing it's going to grow because it's the law that god put you know you say well why did god let all these evil people it's a law man and wife gets together have a child verb and egg comes together really doesn't matter who it comes from but it's the law of god god said in the beginning let each specie bring forth of his kind so that law is continued all right until the law be done away with and christ makes us a new creator and that a new creation and that way mom and daddy didn't have anything to do with this now i can't say mom and daddy made me this way mom and dad didn't make the inside man this way mom and daddy might have helped the outside guy get here but the inside person mom and dad didn't help get here all right same thing with this and then what do we do you feed a kid rotten food he's going to stun his growth or he's going to get sick and that's what we got we got a lot of sick people in the message not physically sick mentally sick or spiritually sick all right especially sick's worse than anything but you take those little girls right there and quit feeding them right don't feed them anymore don't feed them nothing else what's going to happen they're going to stun it they're grown and then they're going to eventually die well that's what why couldn't you quit feeding them same way with you feed this guy in here we know we can feed the outside guy it's evident not more than others except joyce she's an anomaly but that's the way we see that how god's worked in this in this second seal because the sword was given which is a what it's a doctrine you say god give him that doctrine no god didn't give a false doctrine to anybody god can't give false but he can put the true out and let the faults be perverted all right god can't send perverted word god's word is eternal god's word is perfect anything other than that is perverted so satan satan takes the word he can't create a new word because he's not a creator but he can take what god gives and do this right here he power was given to what take peace and kill well that's not what that's not god's characteristic so we know that satan characteristic the red horse was blood combat beast was the ox the church age is the fourth age the dark ages just put it on there just for a minute and get this up because we'll probably go to the third sale after we get back but i want to i want to stop in a few minutes and and then we'll take questions on the second seal if you don't have if you have a question about it only the second seal don't do like brother brown said only on the seals and then ask about riches and pajamas and hairpins so but the first spirit all this is spirits right this is not a literal man getting on the horse these are symbols symbols of spirits all right and spirits working in what the horse is what people power people give them the power satan gets on the horse he gets off one gets on the other horse what he gets on the people he gets on the people and rides through killing the people brother branham said physically killed the people in the dark ages and then spiritually killed billions of people by doctrine so we saw in the first seal that the antichrist spirit was beginning to form just like we read right here from from cyrenthus that little bitty saying well jesus wasn't really christ but christ came on him at the river jordan see that's just a little seed planted it took 300 more years to have a nice in council and then 300 more years for them to come at 606 a.d and say that jesus was a separate substance of god now i've heard people in the message say exact same words jesus was a separate identity or a substance than god it's the same doctrine it was at nicea council coming from the catholic church actually it comes from satan right we name it catholic church but it comes from satan but the antichrist spirit remember brother ronald said it was a spirit and so it couldn't be crowned so they put a pope in and they crowned him all right then it becomes what what does the false prophet do that's the second seal false prophet does what he teaches a doctrine but he's false but he is a prophet he's a prophet but he teaches false doctrine thoughts sword but look that sword was given to satan but didn't have any power it had no power until it got on this horse satan has no power unless power is given the bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's pretty simple but it's pretty eternal pretty profound that you can just resist him and he'll flee from you you don't have to do penance you don't have to get on the floor you don't have to you know stay 24 hail mary's and pay the preacher resist him just say no eve just couldn't say no she said no she thought she was doing the right thing that's our problem sometimes we delve into things and me too we delve into things and we go i really shouldn't have done that was the devil i really shouldn't have done that satan you got me on that one if you won't get me a second time on that one you might get me on something else but you don't get me on that one all right so we got a false prophet so the next thing we're going to look at is the third seal and let's just go ahead and let's just read it to get a to get a background and then we'll drop back third seal first five that's fine tim i'm not gonna i'm gonna be and when it opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i'll be held in a little black horse he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts saying a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see that'll hurt not the oil and the wine all right so that's the next one i want you to get that in your thought read the third seal in your book and we'll make some comments on it but second seal anybody have any questions on the second seal any of the symbols or any of them i mean he's a prophet brother brown said he was a false prophet to a fault system well the system made him the prophet god didn't make him a prophet he's not a prophet like in well balaam see balaam was a prophet that was a person one person balaam this false prophet doesn't have a name except pope but it's a succession of people it's not balaam you understand what i'm saying so god made balaam a pope sorry god made balaam a prophet because remember prophets were born prophets but this is not talking about one person this is talking about system a system a hierarchy all right so there's not one because you can say well which one was the false problem the whole system brother brown said it's an antichrist system what is a system consists of people not one person sure they got one head that they look up to which is the pope but being a false prophet brother brown said he was a false prophet to a false system brother adam also said false teaching brings false birth which is the birth but it's false all right so now it's just true that's not a person that's not one that's not balaam i see what you're talking about no you don't know or you'll still be asking the question let's just be honest that you got a question no gifts and callings i could be the biggest devil ever lived standing right here and you'd be just rejoicing over the word of god gifts and callings are without repentance god knew i had an ability to get people to listen to me okay well that was in the world too you understand i could get people to do what i wanted them to do and i could manipulate everybody in this room if i wanted to maybe that's why i stay away from a lot of it not stay away but you know like me in regina because i can manipulate anybody i want to don't fool yourself any preacher can manipulate anybody they want to you watch them do it now they're doing it now look at it look out in the world of the but look in the message how they just manipulate the people well you know just little puppets why they're using the gift people are wanting a leader right so they're going to pull it from that person they make him that's true you're going to get this morning what you prayed for if you didn't pray for anything you don't get anything if you pray for something god's going you know we've kind of not been on the second seal a whole lot maybe we don't need to but it's what you're pulling from because we're truly servants but see if i can get you to believe that i'm the number one guy and you've got to listen to me and i hear straight from god then what anything i say whether it be losing a hundred dollars or anything like that i was trying to make a point you might need to get up that way yeah but listen gifts and callings listen the bible says gifts and callings many are called but fewer chosen god could call me for a gift and if i don't yield myself to god if i keep yielding myself to the devil guess what i'll become a false prophet i don't have to be a prophet don't get hung on this word right here i'm a prophet today for the prophets who the word comes to be it balaam because the word came to balaam because bayley knew exactly how many land how many rounds to kill he knew how to get an audience with god so he was a prophet he just brother brown said he leaned toward three things money women popularity he leaned toward money he was a hiring prophet so this person right here though is not a not like balaam in the sense that he was born a prophet this is not one person this is a system that's not like brother no no this don't get hunched what i said don't get hung on this word prophet did they know the truth do i the false prophets know the truth and just preach well somewhere it has to be presented to them but they have to take that and twist it just a little bit because satan knows what the truth is he was there when it's all started he knows the word better than we do like i said before he's in church more to rest y'all gets here early very early the catholic system knows this message forward and backwards oh sure i mean they you want to quote that quote but this somewhere everything leaned to to the side of the anti anti word because to say that the catholics have all false doctrine it's not true to say that the baptist have all false doctrine is not true brother brown said even part truth and brother branham some of those roman catholics way back when he said they lived the life they were supposed to live everything they knew they lived in it was just faults from the hierarchy they were following the leader but see this is not a leader this is leaders because there's only one pope we know that but there's a whole lot of look at all these other dioceses that you've got so many people over here that's under the pope you got so many that's this and the pope that was now remember he was uh he was kind of the pope over the um the jesuits right you got homes everywhere so you got false prophet system this is not one person this is a system just like the seals are not for one person it's for us right but we're not an organization we're an organism organization is is what they try to do listen to us we'll tell you what we want you to hear right see but if we're truly born again and and we do have the truth of the message of the hour then you draw what you need from god not what i want to tell you that's the difference they tell you what they want to tell you oh don't read the bible it's confusing we'll interpret it and we'll give it to you that's not the way we the bible says study to show yourself approved a workman needs not be ashamed rightly divide rightly divided you've got to divide whether i'm telling you the future okay a lot of people i've always said listen to this exactly listen to this example when they came out with that movie left behind you remember that yes anybody watching i did what they watched what this come from secular or not secular but protestant baptist methodist pentecost or whatever that side not the catholic side but we know the catholic church has something to do with it because they own the media so they let out what they want to let out that's right so this left behind was that this man which was what was his name the boy camera kirk cameron kirk cameron was the star where kurt cameron was a a bad boy scene of the movie opens and all these cars are wrecked follow me here the cars are all wrecked on the interstate planes are falling out of the sky the guys on the television screen saying thousands of people have disappeared the rapture took place so they say at least you know there's no pilot to the plane all of a sudden you turn around look there's no pilot there you know in the planes you know and the cars on the interstate there's no drivers so yeah so so kurt cameron you know everything goes back in his mind where he was raised a little you know a little baptist boy or whatever it was so the raptures took place so td jake everybody knows tv jakes is all right black preacher and he gets on the television he's on the screen on that movie and he's telling the people hey the raptors took place and i thought well you big dummy if you're still here you have problems but now here was the out here was the out kirk cameron was a sinner he realized the rapture took place and td jakes is telling the people hey you need to repent because in the in the in the denominations they believe that that the rapture can take place and that you have a time period that you can be saved which is fault see i told him right then i said see then it went all the way to the end and kirk cameron goes to the u.n and they've got this guy sitting in the u.n and he's just sitting there controlling people's mind one guy gets up and shoots the other guy right in the head and everybody's like oh my god you know what happened well this guy gets up of course he calms everybody down and he says that really didn't happen that really didn't that that didn't go on that did you see did anybody see that you could see the people's mind changing to him and they're looking around they're like well no that didn't really happen the only dragging the guy off you know he's all blown off be blown away well that didn't really happen well see kurt cameron looks and says well that's the antichrist it was a man that he was changing and controlling people's mind well i told you and i said the antichrist started when they when they said that you can be saved after the rapture that's when the antichrist started the whole movie was antichrist right the whole movie was antichrist not the antichrist at the end and all this is real christianity see to me that to me that's that's what satan is doing he has transformed the people's mind to believe that well you know what that makes that makes lazy people lazy christian well i'll just wait till people disappear and when mom and daddy disappeared i'm gonna go to church and get saved you know uh not gonna happen where's the secret in all of this exactly where was the secret the secret oh there wasn't i mean it just i mean it was just the movie was just completely almost fictitious and laughable to me it should have been to the nominal christians but they all had a you know glory hallelujah fit about it they loved it but it was what because of their prior teaching if you can get somebody to believe that and put out a movie they're going to sit there with that same spell that was what got me they're gonna sit there with that same spell that they said that antichrist at the united nations you know this guy real charismatic real nice looking gentleman he just stands up and he says we didn't see that happen did you see that happen you just see the people you know change in their mind you know and he was controlling them well see that was supposed to be the antichrist guy that raises up you know but it was the whole movie it was anti-word so see there's where we get false teaching it's a false prophet system not one person a system we're all born again individually we're not just roman catholics and you're religious or you're roman catholics and you're a christian you know no you're born again individually then you respond to what god teaches all right anybody else you've got about two minutes the second seal i think i mentioned it a few weeks ago and i kind of don't like being gone a lot but it just happened that way okay but this remember what the first the first aid or the first seal was what justification justify all right this one is always blood is what blood always speaks of sanctification and as they were killed there was a group being sanctified in that fourth age and the same way with you and i the second seal applies to a christian is that we see that i preached it one time down at brother keith brown's church and it really helped the people because we always take the seals as something horrible and something awful and it is if you take the natural part you don't want to be here with that natural seal all right but the spiritual part you and i get but you got to flip-flop it because it can't be it can't be judgment to me and you it's got to be something god gives us to change this body so start looking at the seals as for the redemption of your body we went over this when we first started and it's for not to sanctify the inside person if you're born again you don't need sanctification in your soul right paul said i die daily because this guy's the one that does the bad right right i do have almost a dual nation i got the nature of god i got the nature mama daddy gave me which is controlled by the world if we let it right but like daddy said last night brother ryan's question was your glorified body is being built around your born-again experience it's not that your arm gets holy first just for a carnal example your leg gets holy next and you know god's not building a physical body he's already built the body by the word but when we feed off of it it's not like a little piece of us is going to start getting glorified no it's right here that's wrong those who he has justified he's already glorified we just don't believe that if we believed it we'd be gone already right when we realize that god's already done this sign sealed and delivered and that you and i walk into that that's our walk we walk into that when we walk into that the scripture's not gonna have to change we're gonna have to change scripture don't change those who he's justified he's already glorified if you're born again today you're already in your glorified condition going toward change of the body which has got to happen changing the body's got to happen all right everybody understand we're not we're not glorified and and nothing's going to bother us no we're heading toward that but it's like i said about the kids stop coming to church stop reading your bible stop praying you'll die you'll die just like quit feeding the children their children their sons and daughters of god but quit feeding they'll die sons and daughters of god now are dying because they're not being fed spiritually they're dead first then god's got to take them naturally because they can't go on and attain to the change so this sanctification is to make sure that this guy's clean paul didn't say i die daily because my soul is bad one day and good the next no he's talking about oh wretched man that i am this guy not the inside he knew that that inside guy was perfect complete why could he say what he does in the old in the new testament those who he's justified that's paul said that those who he justifies already glorified that's why that they could listen to paul hear him preach about a resurrection paul was talking about a resurrection of this old guy that they couldn't see inside so phillips and hymenius they go off and start them a church and start them a river jordan doctrine doctrine that paul says the resurrection has already happened remember he had to go rebuke him you know what they said i'm sure this is what they said starting the bible they said what preaching weren't you praying for no they weren't paul said i'm speaking of an out resurrection the lord's getting this guy out of dead words not that this resurrection that already passed because they took what he said and done what twisted it and made a new doctrine all right so y'all next sunday and then lord back
