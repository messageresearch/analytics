in prayer i talked with brother bill younce today and called him and he's doing good and talking real good he said he's still having a little problem with getting his body into the position that it's supposed to be working like eating and little things you know something that we'd think is normal i guess but it's it's different when you you your body gets so shocked but talked real good really really had a good talking and lord willing we're going to try to go up there uh monday if we can to see him so you know just pray the lord would bless amen heavenly father we thank you for this day in your love unto us we thank you for the hour that we have thank you for your word and the truth that we have revealed unto us in this last days we pray now that you'd come and open our eyes of understanding unto you as to what you would desire for us in this hour and lord just remember the sick touch each one father because we know that you said you in your word that you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we thank you we just ask you to make it a manifestation now into the hearts and the lives of the people we love you and we cherish lord your presence tonight with us to speak and not us but that you would take over and use our lips to speak unto your people for this purpose we've gathered tonight to serve you lord and to love you in jesus name amen due to us we'll go to the romans first and then deuteronomy no you're not brethren for i speak to them that know the law have the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth but the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband but a woman which excuse me which hath in husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband now remember this is what an illustration not just speaking necessarily of marriage and divorce et cetera but an illustration of how that we've got to be dead to be born again right so if then while her husband lives she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she'll be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit under god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead were in we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter okay let's go to deuteronomy 2 while you're getting there remember this is the first one then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness and and all in was a mount around mount seer verse three is where we want uh verse two said in the lord speak unto me saying verse 3 there's where we want to take our thought from you have compassed this mountain long enough to turn ye northward you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we have been trying to cover these things of speaking of law and grace speaking of marriage and divorce speaking of the invisible union and trying to tie it all together as to where that we can come forth and look at the uh the situation but we're not wanting to look at the situation back there that is a lot of times our point our thought people will build their message around back there and you know the the secret mysteries and the things that were back there and and all instead of bringing it down to where we're living now tonight i want us to get down to the very nitty gritty points of you and i and maybe that's why a lot of people's out tonight they sensed that so you know okay we're going to be talking about you and i tonight not somewheres else we will mention other things and talk about it but mainly about you and i because i think that you know we've been here long enough after the passing of the prophet and i think it's our fault you know i don't think it's god's fault i think it's our fault i think it's like the prophet of god said moses was there ready but the people wasn't ready so god had to take moses to the wilderness and kept him out there for 40 years until the people got ready and when they began to cry out unto god for a deliverer god sent them a deliverer through moses all right but the point is the waiting the prophet said in the church age book there of the especially the part that ties with spoken words original seed that the part of it was was waiting on the people to be crying out well maybe we're not hungry enough maybe we're not burdened enough maybe we're not into a lot of things i certainly don't want to try to preach as a doomsday style but you know the prophet did say the church always done better under persecution because that's when the time comes that we show our colors and and do you know and and all of that but if you can't keep up with the footman don't worry about it when the horsemen get here because you just won't be there you know if you can't uh come to church and and serve god now just don't worry about it then it'll all be taken care of you'll have a good excuse for not to coming around but somebody's going to be there and i'm contending and i'm one of them i don't know how you feel but i contend i'm one of those and i want to i want to be prepared and then to look at it and to see ourselves and the thought for tonight is church choosing law for grace now i ask you to listen to that message where brother around and preached it you know and title it i think it's 61. oh maybe let's see it's 61 something i know it's in 61. 316. 316 1961 all right i ask you to listen to that to see ourselves because in that message he's bringing it down to you and i am church right right church choosing law for grace now we went through sunday and gave a good bit of points of thinking where he was talking about church choosing law instead of grace now to choose something instead of is is not too bad you know i mean it is but still you you're doing it and knowing what you're doing but when you're choosing something for something else and thinking it's the same thing right now there's where the danger part comes to think well you know well brother dale we you know we ended up by saying that the prophet gave an illustration of two classes of people and one class was i go to church i pay my child i do everything you know and all like that and he said that's good and well and all he said the other one says i do these things but said i do it because of the love that's within our my heart because i want to all right now which one of those do we want to classify ourselves as being you know right you you can force yourself to come to church and and to do and try to live right but the biggest problem is when we become to the place and this is the thought for the message tonight so listen is when we come to the place to think that what we're doing is right when it's not right now as we were talking downstairs before we come up today you know it was all right for martin luther to believe i don't mean it was all right but martin luther believed in the trinity believed in the catholic church he only wanted to try to convert to church he didn't want to get out of it that's his own words all right but see that won't fit today right why because word has been revealed truth has been opened unto us and we can see that there's got to be more than just going to church being good and all of that because that's not what god is coming back after he's coming back after a word-born bride well that's what he's been waiting for all right and that's you know that's our thought church choosing law for grace in other words choosing a way that would be some other way than what god wants but to believe that's the way he wanted now i i hope i proved the point sunday afternoon that some of you didn't hear the message and i made the statements and showed where the prophet said they thought they were right they thought they were right in other words they thought that's what god wanted god had done explained to them who they were and what they were and they said well oh good now give us something to do in other words we we're here now we believe you we want something to do and he said that was their fatal mistake and see by doing that they didn't think they were wrong do you think cain thought he was wrong very sincere he worked himself to death to gather up some fruit to bring to god see are we then putting it to something that would be killing us and us not knowing it now that would be the worst part wouldn't it you remember the story brought around told about the old eagle that they'd caught and brought in and put him in the cage and he's beating his feathers out in his head and bumping it against the cage that he was built to go into the sky but he said now that is bad but he said to see people sitting in churches thinking they're right when they're not amen he said that's horrible well let's talk about lula today everybody else out there that's on the internet can be listening if they don't count themselves a part of this then we're just talking they're just listening don't cost them anything but now what about choosing law instead of grace i've got an opportunity to take this or i got an opportunity to take that that was the thought for the sunday's message all right they thought this was right over here with the law and the things and that was the way they went all right now let's step it up a step tonight to go on choosing law for grace not going over here and something else over here because it's like i've always tried to explain that we we say poro nicodemus when jesus said you must be born again all he had to do is believe right i'll probably use that about 40 000 times this year i guess but see we think well all that just believed well he was a pretty good believer he confessed that no man can do the things you do unless it be of god put his life on the line his job on the line but we think all that does just believe it we see that was death will you agree will you agree in your own thinking now that to nicodemus what he chose was death he had an opportunity for life right thank god the prophet explained it that through that believing that nicodemus had he said nicodemus and gamalia would be there as a foolish virgins i thank god for that that's that's wonderful because they they've kind of put forth an effort see and it god didn't leave them out of it right now but nicodemus he chose to stay where he was at instead of moving on right now trying to illustrate what we're talking about tonight of a church choosing law for grace hypothetical situation but explaining it or expressing it illustrating it see today the problem is is the nicodemus is us are presented the opportunity and we receive that opportunity and we become born again christians but then because of our theology we walk in a way that we think is the way of god that's choosing law see in other words nicodemus you'll see what i'm talking about the children of israel we'll take this instead of this nicodemus said i got to stay with this i can't go with you but see we step out we go with him to me that's what paul is talking about why is paul speaking to the romans that are born again christians right go back to about the first chapter you'll probably hear him saying speaking to the saints because the bible's not written to the world it's written to christians and paul is explaining that we must be dead to the law he's explaining in his own words later on that what i thought was life i found to be death if there's nothing wrong with the law he expressed that but you see if we just step out and walk even with christ and we still hold on to any little idea any thought any concept whatsoever we were life and dinner while ago and i come up couldn't even find it richard had finally found it he said he need to give me an alphabet i said i know the letters i just can't get them in order but brother brown speaks about dialogue remember how you pronounce it d e what is d-a-c-e-l dialogue it's d-e-c-a-l-o-g-u-e all right and he tells you what that is and we were talking about that in the basis of uh what it means it means an organization back phrasing now coming backwards i'm getting the for the definition of organization to come over to the dialogue or dialogue or how you pronounce the word you pronounce it i spelled it where you'll know what it is but you see we can take and i'm not de-christianizing anybody i'm talking i'm talking about christians born again believers and what is keeping us here is our own ideas no i'm waiting on you well that's your idea right and all you got to do is get a couple agree with you and you've got a dialogue or how you pronounce that word huh well you get a group and that's what we all want isn't it you know my definition of why people are caught from for crimes because you you just can't keep your mouth shut you just feel so dirty that you went out and killed 18 people maybe you just feel bad you can't sleep so you go down to the neighbors and you tell the neighbor well you know he ever thought about killing somebody the neighbor said well no if he said no i wouldn't do that well you can move that neighbor and you go to another neighbor but and while you're gonna find somebody that'll sympathize with you and then you can tell them well i killed 18 people i just feel bad well they'll say well that's all right because i kill 19 and i feel bad too you say that's stupid that's exactly what i mean that's how stupid you and i are if you don't like those words talking to my neighbor today i said sometimes i tell the people the door swings out you know i said i don't want anybody to leave the church but in fact if what i say to you makes you leave then that's your problem but listen i'm trying to dig down into you and me and dig out these problems and ideas why did the prophet say we're in these problems of marriage and divorce he said misinterpreted theology we read some quotes our sunday where that the children of israel wanted a theological thing where they could argue about it don't that sound like organizations some of you've been in the message long enough that they don't say it too much now because it's kind of got a i guess people rebuked it so much but how many of you remembers when you would go somewhere and they'd say uh what group you in who do you follow see some of you haven't been out enough to run into those type of people but they're out there but you see church what i'm trying to get us to is just like we're talking about israel israel wanted something to do now i told you my definition of that is because then it finally winds up that they said we want a king they looked around at the people around them and they seen the temples they built the shrines the the things for their gods and brotherhood said they seen the nations now this is his wording he said israel was never to have been a nation you need that he said they were the people of god they didn't need to be a nation oh we want the nation of israel organize religion that's what caused them to want to be a nation that's what causes you and i want to join up with somebody we want to try to find somebody that'll agree with us i guess you've probably got a pastor that's dumb as hard-headed as a rock of a fellow that could ever be but i just can't follow what people say unless it leads me to the god i see amen you know i mean no matter how good it is how beautiful it sounds if it doesn't tie together with with the god that saved me well you're you're just trying to be one that's right i can be a one-man denomination then i believe i've tried so that's enough to settle that but see they wanted law not as a law you remember they didn't want a law that told them to go dig 40 foot every day they didn't want that kind of rules they wanted if you don't like anybody else's definition this is the best one i can come up with they wanted a set of rules to tell them they were right that's what they wanted they wanted to be like the people around them and they chose not they didn't want a book of rules they just wanted something they could do do you think that they want it thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill do you think they really sat down and asked for all of those things something wrong with you mentally not on anything else man don't want rules like that that's why they didn't get what they thought they got they thought they got a set of rules that make them righteous there was no way to be righteous except in god so they chose another way thinking that was god's way you remember the prophet we gave it there sunday where he was talking about it was never god's will to give the law i could just see people in their mouth dropped on the internet especially that and maybe i haven't been around the message a while oh that poor ignoramus the law is god's word amen and that wasn't what they wanted they didn't want god's word they wanted god to okay what they had done or would do what about you and i everybody wanting recognition right i've done that first i said that i saw that and i don't care who saw it first as long as i get it that's my point if it's a revelation i don't care if everybody in the world got it before i did i just want to finally get it that's right but you see what i'm talking about in the natural they wanted things related to the places around them they wanted to look like the nations around them they finally wanted a king you think dayton and court walked up there on their own against moses no they had a group of people with them best i remember the ground swallowed up a good many of them they wanted a group they got a lot of preachers of the day with them because in one account there you know earth opened up and swallowed up 250 priests with sensors with coals right off the altar but do we have we chosen law for grace have we chosen our ways as to be the way of god or have we sought the ways of god which way is it you remember what we went through grace the prophet said had already provided them a prophet pillar of fire to lead them a healer a deliverer an atonement to be made i still ain't got offer preaching on that unconditional covenant yet because we think an unconditional covenant would just i don't have to do anything to get it you got to believe it now you take that off of it and go ahead i don't have to believe it well then you ain't going to be safe go ahead you got to believe it it took god dying for you to get it right that's a pretty good condition and remember under the unconditional covenant they had to keep making sacrifices i hope that bore down into your thinking at least a little bit if it was unconditional why did they offer a sacrifice unconditional like we call it so that's what i'm trying to do tonight to look at it as church choosing law for grace of thinking that we're choosing this is the way of god this is what god wants and i'm happy to do it you know is that the way we think what if he comes down and tell us that's not exactly right that wasn't the lord talking to me right because it's contrary to my thoughts see grace had provided a way for them in their life to walk according to his commandment he said that in exodus 19 and made them the people of god but they wanted to be the nation of israel and that was never god's will they were to be the people of god well you're going to get in trouble in the bible trying to divide the nation of israel i guarantee you that go ahead and try it because you're going to get where 10 tribes goes this way and 12 goes this way and this is unreal this is unsure born this is under you've got a lot of trouble in the bible trying to study out some kind of a nation but see grace had made a way now watch for them there down there whatever they are of salvation right the law never provided one ounce of salvation the law as i was bringing sunday was a record keeper it wasn't transgression until the law came because he didn't have a record keeper it was an individual between him and god now it's a record keeper and they had everything they needed to brought them to christ you tell me something else they needed they had to sacrifice they had the profit they had the pillar of fire they had the healer they had to deliver and all other things joel gyra jove with this can you over all of the jehovah seven compound names and it would have brought them to christ and yet when they got to christ what did they do they killed him why you're a man making yourself god that's what the whole bible had spoke of that would stand there why because it organized right they even had the token what else did they need and it would have finally brought them to christ can i get on down a little further and then just back up brother said look at these pentecostals he said if they just stayed where they was he said the millennium would have been on real quick but he said they organized now why have we been around here isn't it kind of odd that the children of israel was 40 years into wondering and a few years and this and a few years and that and amounts up to about close to 50 years and their problems coming out of egypt and a different thing with the time moses was there and the the time that they rejected him would be even 40 years and in and odd we've been about 50 years bumping pretty close right since the leaving of the prophet of course there'll be a lot of times and shadows when that happened we at 50. why and remember i'm talking to lula georgia not out there now see all the way through the bible and then spoke of the coming of the messiah and they were looking forward to it all the way from genesis constantly they made the atonements but after doing all of that and god telling them how perfect they were they still wanted something to do now like brother branham said i was looking at him one day other day and he come up he said it may be in one of her notes but he said they've tried for i forgot how many years to add anything to god so loved the world i believe it's a scripture he said how can you add anything to the word so now understand what in my illustration of them and then bring it down to us if you had the pillar fire the prophet the atonement all of those things what else would you want god told him just go inhabit the land it's yours i give it to you said abraham has walked all over this land and everywhere he put his foot belongs to you but they wanted the law i hope you're breaking down on one thing to get away from what is this law law law ten commandments that's all it is law i hope you're getting down to understanding what i'm trying to say we're trying to find a way of getting some form of salvation apart from are let me put it in another way what we really want is to heaven help me lord they wanted to be like the people around them and the people around them they've seen them over in front of their god they're idle they were working and slaving and bringing offerings and everything and laying down let me just speak like brother brown would speak about it then you see him getting me look over on another side there rhode is another nation and oh they're just rejoicing they're shouting speaking in tongues that the way he'd say it well this group over here they got miracles okay they got gifts what's wrong with gifts nothing if they're used correctly they're of god but if they're not used correctly what did the prophet say the gifts without the virtues is a stumbling block but i hope you understand what i mean they looked around and seen the way people were doing and they wanted their god to know that they loved him and they wanted to serve him like that thinking that was what he wanted he didn't want that you know what god always wanted and we'll get to it in just a minute as i mentioned a little sunday afternoon you go read the ten commandments and i want you to show me in there where it says you're supposed to love the lord thy god with your heart and your soul and i'd be dyson now and i'm not going to do it but i'll say it in a way how many of you have ever read the ten commandments but what if i started quoting some things to you would you raise your hand that uh and say i sent the ten commandments how many of you believe the bible says that every tub will sit on the song bottom ain't nobody for that see we quote what somebody said to call it bible i've heard people say it's better to put your seed in the belly of a than plant it on the ground i want you to give me scripture for that you can't tell the difference in the seasons except the shedding of the leaves and the bud to the trees i want that in the bible but yet we swear by it how much of the bible do we have as fictional thoughts of others what's been said to us i'm going to jump a little bit and get to something on the point but in the ten commandments the first commandments says what exodus 20 and 2 that shall have no other god before me but when they ask jesus in matthew 22 can you jump over to number five brother joe wherever who's pulling that part of it being number five on your quotes brother anderson see when they asked jesus what was the great commandment in the law what is the great commandment in the law is it one of the ten commandments that said what jesus said jesus said unto them shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart all i sow with all my mind this is the first and great commandment that's not the first commandment the bible first commandment about have no other gods before me deuteronomy is used six or seven times the same quote that jesus made but my point is it's not in the ten commandments so if we deal with ten commandments is all the law is or the word of god but it is in the word of god thou shalt love the lord thy god what did he mean when he said i'm fed up with your sacrifices and it's become a stink in my nostrils i said i would and listen to a man with what an honest and a contrite heart that's what god wanted all the time he didn't want israel to be a nation he wanted them to be the people of god he didn't want israel to have a king he was their king that's right that's it right there why would jesus come up with the greatest commandment and the second he said is likewise that i shall love thy neighbor as thyself but yet we take in our organized mind and we we organize it and then we'll go to somebody else and we'll say uh ain't it in the bible didn't the prophet say so-and-so what do you want want somebody to agree with you is it going to make it any different if they agree with you or differently if it does you're in bad shape in other words if you've got to have brother call if you've got to have brother dick to agree with you that something's right you got a problem you don't believe what you believe is right you see you want to organize it okay now brother d now do you believe it well yeah i believe william brother dean now do you believe well now we're getting it brother chris hey we got four it says that right but what if it ain't in the word you just organized and you know where i'm going eventually brother brown said organization is death you see they wanted something to do they wanted to be like the people around them and they wound up wanting the king it's the nature of man the prophet said number one paragraph or e46 e47 return in jubilee 62 11 22. look what he says excuse me number one probably said number two they called look the church now is like israel and we're not back there he's moved up now he's not back there he's off of israel but he's illustrating with israel the church is like israel when it come up out of egypt when miserable was down there in egypt now here's where we're going to fail tonight because we're going to read about uh the pentecostals the baptists and methodists in a little bit and we're going to look back and say they organized we're going to say they organized he's preaching about them i wonder who he was talking about when one day he said the sickest body that i know of any word is the bride of jesus christ you need that quote look what he says when israel was down in egypt god by his marvelous grace without an organization or anything else he called israel to his health what he called them to their inheritance why they was going towards calvary where christ would meet him he grace furnish them a prophet greatest person filler power grace friends of the lamb sacrificial lamb grace gave them power grace gave them deliverance grace gave them victory grace give them all those things and they danced in the spirit and shouted and praised god about it sounded like a pentecostal meeting but they didn't know that they were five days away but they made their rational stake in exodus the 19th chapter where they accepted the law instead of grace where they turned down god's way to have a way for them their sales give us something to do that's been man's idea all along give us something to do now remember it's been man's idea that's the nature of man adam expressed that in the garden of eden when he was lost instead of going back to god for grace now read it what did he do he tried to make himself an apron and ever since then he's tried to have something to do with redemption when redemption is a free offer of grace my god god alone there's nothing you can do to save yourself god saved you no way at all you can do but man wants something to do into it now why would we want something to do in it okay get at number two this is earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints paragraph 67 or e-67 57 god said i've seen him from the hilltops hallelujah his church's group why they wasn't a nation but god never wanted a nation you say what he's always called him the nation he never wanted to call him a nation he wanted to call him his people they wanted to be a nation they wasn't an organized like the rest of the people now watch it they had organisms but no no nation he said the people will dwell among themselves they'll not be a nation and that's the way the church of god today is a called out group of people it doesn't mean because you're methodists it doesn't mean because you're pentecost it means out of every group god's calling people out giving them holy ghost the holy ghost and that's the church called out certainly it is he's called he calls them out they're not an organization they're an organism their hearts are beating together they're one in christ jesus hallelujah israel started out loving and serving god from their heart but when man's ideas begin to take over they organized become a nation got a king just like everybody else trying to find some way to please their god they started out right where'd he wind up but notice now he said well what's the difference brother dale in an organization and an organism now i'll read you a definition of brother branham over in a little bit what he called a organization but webster says that an organization is a body of persons organized for some end you know gathering together for some end all right but run said it's the people that makes themselves a set of rules and dialogue every how you pronounce it he said like the ten commandments that's what webster says about it when you get on down later a group of people joined together for an organization general motors is an organization there was people got together and they formed a corporation to become an organization churches are organizations but the bride of jesus christ is supposed to be an organism the reason it's an organism is because it is a many-membered body right so then you go over to the organism of the body and you understand the things we're supposed to be a body of believers around the world with a common goal for one thing and that is to serve god from my heart but can we find that today he said well brother dale you you're in the middle of all of it but i can stand here and say i tried what makes you think you're right it's not what i think it's whether or not that word says i'm right you see an organism is a group of believers and that's what started on the day of pentecost back there 2 000 years ago a group of believers but it wasn't long until it become an organization the body of christ is supposed to be an organism parts supplying what need they have to run the body of christ there's nothing wrong we'll read a couple there's nothing wrong with organism or an organism it's an organization now what did brother random say about an organization the problem he said it says i believe this this this this this period that's right he said when you do that you died right there he said when you say i believe this this this this with a comma that says anything else that god will reveal you're an organism is that simple enough i'm supposed to be a deep fellow you know but is that plain sense if we put that period down and say we lula's got it we're the only ones that's got it and you know i ain't never said that but if we do that then we're an organization but if we believe that there is a body of christ around the world that's striving to come to place you know the place god wants us each joint supplying is power then we describe we become the wonderment of the bride of jesus christ which is an organism you see the body of christ then being a group of people we're together because an organism now listen to the webster a form of life composed of mutually dependent parts that maintain various possessions or processes it's good to be an organism i believe around the world today i've always told you that and you know it that there's people that believe the truth i'm just searching for them because i'm fed up with running around the mountain accused of having an antichrist spirit on us because we go to fellowship meetings i can accuse you of having one for going to walmart it's a pretty good organization but listen what does it matter what anybody believes about us it's what our goal is my goal is to preach the gospel for us to be able to walk off of this earth and i thank god the way that i believe it that there's not going to be a bunch of old bodies going in the rapture right i mean i said about walk off the earth you see the people of god you can't organize the holy ghost we want to get back on some more of this but you can't organize the holy ghost he gets out of it every time he was there in the days of martin luther right but when they begin to organize on what luther taught he just moved out right and he started to come on with wesley and pentecost because if you organize you die that's why he said now he said the lutheran church will never come forth again right he's because it died but he said the holy spirit moved out and people just kept moving people move when the holy ghost moves and that's an organism well brother don't you think we ought to write up a book here at lula and tell everybody what we believe i try to every service you know well i mean don't you think we already do that i don't have no problems with it if you want to do it brother mark right now is having the clc reason i preached in 82. he's having some of them put in the book for him he's paying for it i've never offered to give him a dime he ain't never offered to want one he done it himself he asked my permission i said yes sir but you see when they hear that and read that they're going to hear me saying just what i'm saying right now if you denominate this message you die if you organize this message you've run around says you can't denominate the message he said but you can organize it in the lady of seal when you do you die well brother dale we we believe you preach the truth to us good i do too i'm trying but we're not the only one because if you are saying that then the bride is here and i don't quite agree with that i believe around the world there's people that are getting fed up with organized religion you know i felt i headed in the wrong direction one day and a brother told him he said you're trying to make these gentiles live after a book of rules you remember paul always stood peter to the face see peter proved he had the holy ghost because as quick as paul said it he shed his mouth and later he didn't sneak around write little notes and put it in somewhere you know i wrote really wrong when paul rebuked me i was trying to do what was right later he said i have to admit paul said things hard to understand he said people wrestle to their own destruction he never said a word about it he took his correction he proved he was part of an organism to be part of a bride of christ is an organism not an organization he says let's go to number three maybe we'll try to get a few of these things submerging church age 1960 1203 paragraph 38 now we come to this samuel they said now they come to us this time make us or make us a king and lord told him that he rejected that idea and god rejected the idea and the lord him that told him he rejected the idea but exactly what he rejected here with just exactly what he rejected here with organization it's odd brother branham can take illustrations and make it an organization you know that moses when he smoked a rock the second time brother brown said he set up a denomination and that's why god later told him you ain't going to the promised land because you sanctified yourself is that bible just like he rejected that he rejects organization he rejected them having a king well watch what he said he don't reject organism but organization organism we have to have that what organization we don't have to have because it draws lines we are so-and-so we are christian i'm methodist or you're christian i'm baptist that don't mean no more than a pig and a pig pen that has nothing to do with it not at all a christian so what is it today or you're a christian i believe the message who do you follow i follow the two souls the two lords that proves what's the difference what's the difference an organization back there in an organization here you don't reject organism he rejects organization that's how close this thing is folks that's how it is with that quote i give you the end our sunday the one goes to church keeps the book of rules does everything the other one does it out of love what's the difference in what you see you can't see the love you see both of them doing identically the same life whose side would you have been on in the days of the pharisees and the sadducees and that went on down in your heart tomorrow what side would you have been on what kind of priest come on watch what he has to say on number four how close he gets and what about speaking to these people and telling them this on the message investments 1963 803 to be a part of me and i don't belong to any organization once nothing but this full gospel man and yet it is an organization i want you and when it becomes then of course i'll have to leave it now what did he have methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostals right christian businessmen were all of denominationalisms right catholics were there and he said they're not organized yet then when they do i'll have to leave it because it's i it's an organization and an organism is all right but not an organization how close can these things be organization is what number six we got on five or a minute to go so go to number six summer in church age church age book page 251 this is what organization is this world system show me a world system church that is full of the holy ghost that's what he asked i want to see it if you can show me such a church you're my finding a mistake in the word no sir not one of these messengers was organized either they were put out or out or got out because they were convicted of the sin of organization that were they were convicted they were they was they found the wrong of organization they weren't convicted of sin of organization how can the holy spirit possibly be an organizat be an organization when it is organization that takes the place of the spirit and denominations take the place of the word remember organization is death it just can't be any other way if the world takes over the spirit departs first step a little saying a little doctrine right you remember this from the seals second step you begin to see groups getting together and following their ideas then they begin to say if you don't believe like we believe you're forming an organization now come on church a lot of you've been around long enough you've heard them words right you don't belong to their group you're out we'll tell you when this comes it's death but brother dan we're we're lula we're not in these churches we're not in the baptists of methodist you get your coating hat and move over here got still the same ideas see any idea you have or i have that is contrary to the word of god is anti-word sensible and because we can get a group of people to follow it it's where we think it's right now you want something personal swallow the reason brother dale believes he's right because he walks by himself i have been put out a lot i got out that's why i believe i'm right well that don't prove nothing i agree with you don't prove a thing but neither does it prove anything because you can get members to join with you that don't make you right come on can i quote brother random without being vulgar he got into a situation like that one time he said prostitution went up last year is it of god that's the way he said it a christian don't have to have nobody an eagle don't have to have no eagle to walk with it they certainly don't need a hawk it can't fly with it god wants people i'm reading it today individuals who'll follow after his word but then with individuals by doing that it automatically will have an organism in the body of christ around the world just because you've got a thousand following or ten thousand or something following what you're talking about that don't mean it's right there was one man standing there with all of israel turned against him right see a man with the holy ghost walks alone if you don't see that if you can't see that in the life that's been before you for some of you close to 40 years that you've seen the way i've walked that i tried to help everybody else i went overboard trying to help but then it come down i had to walk along is out there on the internet and i don't care i don't have a church i can go to preach at you name me one i said preach at it i didn't go say go there and talk on a good sermon and have a good time in the lecture shout out hallelujah then a place in the world that i can go preach what i believe name it he said well brother dale you're you're saying then you're the only organism i don't got through explaining that so go right ahead i believe around the world there is a bride of jesus christ and every member in that bride is walking alone because you see folks you got to walk along it's not you and your wife it's not you and your children it's not you and your husband in christ as you and god alone if you walk any other way then you're not walking in god's ways but then you take all of those people around the world that are following god and walking in god's word the way they can you've got an organism which is the body of jesus christ the outside of that you're trying to organize it i don't call someone check out what i preach before i preach it he said well maybe york too i might or two that's all right i don't do it i didn't say i didn't listen to other people you misunderstand me i listen to people i go to meetings and i listen and i listen sincerely wade told me something today that will come up later but you see i had to go pray he said daddy i want you to speak at the next minister's meeting that we'd be having here i said i already knew i was going to i didn't even know where they're going to have it we didn't know that until today my wife is a witness i told her driving down the road yesterday i said if we have one at lula i'll preach you see an eagle walks alone a lot of times but then i have to go pray and i'll be praying from now till that day i walk up here not to have a sarcastic hateful attitude because i can take the word and kill with it but if god helps me i can take it and deliver to i've seen it both ways i've always told you it's not me and my wife that's not me and my family i want my wife i want my children i want my grandchildren and great-grandchildren to have a personal experience with jesus christ as their savior not because papa daddy or whatever they call me i want every one of you to have an experience with god that denominationalism won't bother you then let me scan through a couple of these we won't try to pull them up brother joe because it'll be too fast i ask you to listen to the message of church choosing law for grace paragraph 50. he said the church would have been a church tonight glorious without spot or wrinkle if the fathers would have accepted and stayed with the holy spirit that god had brought them out of them organizations but they went right back into it like a dog to its vomit and a hog to its wallet now let's move that up a notch he's talking about the church that come out of organized religion except a pentecostal movement right come on is that right now what about the church has come out after the prophet brought the message come on all the typologists oh they're real good ain't he and they typed that brother branham had to go into the wilderness in 40 years or something later he's coming back to lead us to the promised land you know sometimes i wish that was true i mean you don't believe it no i don't believe it i don't believe he's going to come back and preach anything to us to perfect us right that's right if it can't be done with what he brought he couldn't come back he'd take him longer than he did to start with i've always told you what i believed about that and we're going to have 30 40 days after the resurrection you think we're gonna be well the lord every day it's been raised saw brother random walk in the street said when i whoop down folk oh um it's going to be a happy time along in there and brother branham can go about and preach to us for 30 40 days i have no problems with that that's where you don't take what i say and what i mean you want to interpret my thoughts he can be the first in the resurrection in the last phase i have no problems with that first to me life's life should be first i don't believe he's going to come back and preach anything to us to make us perfect because if the message he brought to us can't do that then he'd have to preach 40 years over again come on i'm just honest he said they went back into the hog like a hog to the waller in the mirror now if you can't sit at church and listen to me without getting sarcastic or building me up to that point you know that's what's happened in this message people around the land take every one of them doctrines one at a time i did to you and showed you it come right out of the old organized religion come right over into the people of this message two souls was a mormon doctrine of pre-existence two lords were just a little higher river jordan doctor that jesus wouldn't go to the river jordan comes straight from the nicean council yet you think i'm mad or hateful to talk about those things but where can you go and tell the truth he gets onto paragraph e16 that's the way it is today that's the way it was 40 years ago with our fathers our pentecostal fathers grace had given them a revival and it brought them out of the world out of the chaos that they were in in their formal denomination and organization so forth and it brought them to the greatest revival tomato zeus coming down from there right pentecostal poured out the holy spirit upon them fill them with the fire of the spirit with a spirit they were singing dashing in the spirit having a wonderful time and little did they know they were all years away from the full promise what about the people setting the night listening to him as he preached this message come on that's who he's talking to was he talking about what they were what's he doing condemning them i thought we read up here that's the way it is today that's the way it was 40 years ago but as it was with israel natural so is it with israel spiritual it goes on to explain where is the light it's by faith it goes right on down paragraph 16. notice but they were all this away because they refused to accept what god had provided for them and they wanted to add something to it that's where we always make our mistakes is when we try to add something to what god has done yeah that's the lord's prayer he said they tried to add one word to the lord's prayer all his years and can't do it paragraph 17. they had to have a law they had all of the things the healing but they wanted a theological experience so they could have something to fuss and argue and break them away paragraph 18 same message or e18 where did we make our mistake is it up there okay where did we make our mistake like israel did oh let's change that right there this i know ain't asking him to do it in there but let's make that we us tonight in lula georgia okay where did we make our mistake in lula georgia like israel did they couldn't get along just getting going the holy spirit was leading us we had to add something to cause unbelief to come in mighty quiet if israel would have went ahead following the way the lord was leading them within two weeks they had been in the promised land but they had to substitute something if the pentecostal church would have moved on in the spirit the way god ordained it to go and at all and had already proved that he was in it we'd have been living in the millennium listen but they didn't but they did the same thing that they did back there as the bible said in corinthians another example what happened the first thing we couldn't raise it up what happened we're in okay the first thing we couldn't be go on believing led by the spirit in a group of believers we had to have something to tack a name onto it we wanted to make an organization tack a name onto it where's the other one i don't they don't have it now but where's that and then lost my place on my notes we gave it sunday it's on jehovah jireh paragraph 61 jehovah jorah priest in 1960 i guess or something i can't even read them onto it to make themselves some kind of a name you want a knife i'm a two soul i'm a two lords i'm a no holy ghost group i'm a lula eyed no wonder the lord hadn't been able to come look how easy it is to do it so that form what would made it somebody got a revelation now watch got a revelation that revelation wasn't wrong and you watch it you ain't explaining that so don't get the idea that's wrong watch it now you ought to be baptized in the name of jesus instead of father son and holy ghost that was a revelation from god because that was the move of god it had to later go on from the oneness into the lord jesus christ but that had to come you know later on all right but they had that name instead of that then what happened instead of moving on with the name of jesus baptism they formed assemblies they got to the pa pafw pfjc and different ones one covenant with a horse other one coming on the cloud there's where you make a mistake there's where you're horribly sin grace has always tried to lead us to the right thing but it's within man and brother branham is all even explaining at one time he said even man made in the order of his making i mean body spirit soul the memory reason of consciousness he said that made him into a place to where he would organize because he's always wanting somebody with him right we got more people than anybody else what about it go down to the last one let's get that and we'll quit just bypass a couple of them should be number 13 brother this is off of the message identification priest in 1963 123 paragraph 14 9 through 153 he talks about a revival of things happening you see i belong to my church my church is as good as your church listen i like even this comical i think brother adam was very comical in a lot of ways he got a point across when he said these women said you know that stuff that that old manicure they got on their face don't tell me he didn't know the difference in manicure and mascara he know there to get his point across right he said well i belong to my church my church is good at your church they're both made out of the same kind of but build it same kind of materials that's right the building has nothing to do with organization is a group of men who gets together make up a die the count dr lock you pronounce it of what they stand for and that's it write up something that you stand for look what he even said nothing against them that's all right listen but it ain't what i'm talking about you wear the same kind of clothes maybe they're decent what other believers would do and still that doesn't make it but now looking here what is it it's the spiritual revelation of the word of god the spiritual revelation of the word of god is the only thing that's not an organization pull that on up let's read it is that the bottom of it brother joe no it's not the end of it you talking about a sanctified body if you were in that day what group would you be identified with with the prophet with a vindicated word although they were in the minority or would you be with the popular opinion folks well i'll tell you i believe that man is crazy now watch what he says roll it on up i believe that man's crazy look and the only way that you'd ever know he wasn't crazy come on the only way you know he's not crazy is for the same god to reveal to you the same thing he revealed to moses how do you know where anybody's got the truth or not when god speaks to you to reveal to what they're telling you and the only way that you'll ever be able to be the images of god and the sons of god is for god to reveal to us and express himself through his word to us and us to the world that's the only channel for christ was the image here on earth that you could see god in a man expressed image of god because god was in him so much that they were one and now when christ left he sanctified the church that the church might take his place and express the word of god see it's the only way it can be done the only way you'll ever know where anybody's preaching the truth or not is for you to be in the truth outside of that don't worry about being confused you already are i hope you follow the point brother rather was speaking about people 50 years ago up to his time i think we should be speaking uh from his time up to where we are 50 years later right where can you find a group of people following the message forgive me for even saying anything about that one ago but where have i got a place and i'd go preach preach from the bottom of my heart i can't do it and you know sometimes it even gets hard here to preach from the bottom of my heart because of two things one thing is there some of you that don't believe the way i do yet you've told me you did from your own lips but then told others you didn't then there's some of you that have told me brother dale we can't make it without you i'm torn in the middle because if you make too much out of me you're going to put me off the scene i've warned you about that twice in my ministry it's come up here that i was a prophet in the five full ministry and i've rebuked that openly twice because i'm not leave me alone let me be what i am i just ain't got nowhere else to preach so try to put up with me see just make god what he is it ain't been god it ain't been no man except this church said on the word it's been god not me but god to keep his church to prove it can be done yes i'm shook hands with and hug next and call brother we love you brother dale you're a great teacher but where's the invitation to go teams and let me stay in the middle just don't make too much out of them because i ain't too much up here for you to look at and that comes from a heart of love for 40 something years preaching to you and i've tried to get you to see jesus christ and for us to not organize like the rest and follow some doctrine you know what i'm getting at we follow a doctrine and an idea if that idea ain't truth we're an organization just like anybody else that's right and that's why we've been here 40-something years it's because we've never seen what god is among us and that don't build no man up to see god among us why would it who am i what am i just a christ like the rest of you the sinner's saved by grace but you had a no stupid nuthead enough to at least say i'm going to stay with the prophet the best i can in that way i love everybody and i don't worry about it let's stand come on brother i think we've been around the mountain long enough i think it's about time to turn northward like a brother told me one time he said lord told me to go north he said i come to athens stayed there a while said he spoke to me again i said go north because he got his directions messed up just a little bit that's all right see he told me to go north go to lula he told me this then one day he told me he said i won't talk to you because he kind of like something here that got missing you know like an old cart that starts missing and then when it does it'll finally quit you know but that's what he started doing and then one day he called me wanted me to come down to athens to meet him i went down there and ate with him and he said brother i got a revelation from the lord the lord told me to go south i listened to him when he finished i said brother god didn't speak to you but he didn't like it i said because you're out of the bible show me in the bible then i said in the bible the children of israel went into promised land they could go east they could go west they could go north but if they went south they went out of the land ain't nothing to do with me since he asked me to tell him what was what i thought from my heart and i did but i become his enemy because i told him the truth there is no scripture you can't go back how can you go back where you come from you know go back to them organizations where you come from they won't have you i'm just trying to get us right here to not sit down and become one of our own and move on with god well that's all i've ever had quit brother 139 130 i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk away for the hand of god in all my life i see and the reason of my blessings hallelujah amen jesus me hey man anybody this is the person of jesus christ that we're talking don't have anybody to about with or any dogs i walk with him and he tells me hallelujah in the name of jesus christ we send this prayer involved in our sister lord because brother boyd's talking about his sister that they may have to take her other leg off with foot offers lord jesus we as the bride of jesus christ that you just take care of all things stop this problem and be there father we wouldn't have any trouble asking you to restore the flood that they've taken off because we believe you we love you we thank you lord in jesus name anybody else let's pray one for another remember the service is just about the whole time here in church my lower back and down into my hip and i'm telling just a little bit ago it's like it just went amen amen what he said and he sent his work and healed us he said his word that's the kind of healing i like is to see it just there it is and just start simply believe it i have a close friend who's going from chemotherapy he's got cancer in his spine and you know i just wish that you'd hear the truth you know that god could heal him before he went tomorrow to take him or i believe that but it's his faith amen yes remember that anybody else just pray one for another remember brother bob we kill him a lot he's young and getting started and he needs a lot of prayers to help him along and he's really progressing greatly and we really really appreciate him and everything and his daddy made a great comment there one day not when he was here this time but he made a great comment one day he said the prophet said you love my children he said i love you for that or something he said i love y'all for loving my son that's good i love you for loving my son that's a good point heavenly father we thank you we pray that lord what we said would be right and needful and we realize a lot of it be misunderstood because people won't know me in my ways and my actions but they've always been one thing in my heart and mind lord is to serve you from the bottom of my heart all my heart all my soul all of my mind that's what we want to do a lot of times lord we want to talk about you and say it's in the soul when it's really in the mind not have a revelation but have an intellectual debate about something or a theology lord we realize that we've been around here for 40 something years now because we haven't taken what you said by the lips of your prophet and just walked straight forward and called it straight like it is prophet said i'll be glad when they'll be like it was in the book of acts and say you ain't saying what paul said well when we do that lord we walk alone but yet i'm never alone because i know who's with me and just helping guide us be with the people on the highway give a safe journey lord let your love be made manifest in each heart and life we thank you father for everything forgive our sins and cleanse us lord lead us in jesus name you dismiss they were in the upper chamber
