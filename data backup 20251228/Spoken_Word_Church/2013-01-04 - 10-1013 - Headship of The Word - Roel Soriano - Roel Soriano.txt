let's just say open the eyes of my heart lord as the brother comes to bring the word of the lord unto it right open the eyes i want to see open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart to see oh pour out your power and love as we sing oh so that we can um see see him in his fullness revealed in the last days all right you know where we are with these people when you see the seals come open she don't know i think it's okay now amen we greet you from the uh far away country of the philippines our church we call it the church of the overcomer right that's right because we believe that there are uh overcomers in every age amen and we claim to be that right and uh all the all the brothers and sisters especially the ministers they send their greetings to brother samuel dale here and the congregation but danny del mundo just wrote me an email saying uh to greet the brothers and sisters here in georgia because he knew i was going to be here tonight amen so it's good to be in the house of the lord amen amen and before i let you be seated i think we should go to the word of god the reading of the word of god we'll go to sums 133 versus one to three i'm happy to be here with my wife cynthia and i want to thank brother luis for driving us over amen sister christine by the louis uh wife is my first cousin so there you see that you know the connection psalms 133 verse one to three behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments as the dew of hermann and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of zion for there shall the lord commanded a blessing even life forevermore these are the words of the lord i'm going to talk about the subject called the headship of the world tonight let us pray father we come humbly before your feet we realize that that nothing is hidden in your presence lord you know our hearts um you know what goes through our minds tonight lord and we just recognize the headship of the world tonight we recognize your presence amongst us and we just ask that you give us inspiration lord help help the minister and he works alike lord and may give us anointing that we may comprehend uh the meaning the true revelation that is behind every word of beer bread tonight we want to give you all the praise and honor and glory i pray that you meet every knee tonight in jesus name amen i hope you can remember to pray for us i told brother dale that we're building a church in in the town of taitai uh he's been to the philippines and uh he can tell you that uh for all these years you know the message came to our country in 1967 and this is now 2012 you and you cannot point to a single church that is really presentable may we still we're still having services in living rooms of houses storefronts and uh uh squatters areas uh and and you know we uh it's kind of like an awkward situation for us because here we come in condemned denominational churches and every time we have weddings we use their churches that's right and and it's not easy sometimes you know we we use their facilities when we have big meetings like conventions and before they let you use their facilities they ask you a lot of questions they want to know if you believe the trinity they want to know you believe in speaking in tongues and uh but the lord has blessed us you know i believe in the power of prayer um last june we organized a we call it the prayer chain where every believer is he takes a slap about of two hours praying the whole church prays for uh 24 or two hours left for one whole month uh there's always somebody praying for a whole month and you know what the lord honored our sacrifices and answered our prayers supernaturally he provided and now we we bought this property uh in in thai town it's supposed to be in the uh central district business district of the town and when we applied for a building permit to build a church they would not give us a permit now can you imagine how difficult it was for us here we put all our money into this property and now we can't build a church but then once again the saints decided to pray pray about it and then uh uh i got an appointment with the mayor of the town and uh we had a little interview it hasn't been five minutes in the office of the mayor and he said you know reverend soriano this is the work of the lord it cannot be hindered amen and i just want to praise him for his goodness and now the construction is going on uh full swing i showed some pictures to our brother sam here so i hope you can remember us in in prayer because it's such a big undertaking it's a big step of faith uh we have a good crowd a good congregation of about uh close to 400 people but but these are are mostly urban poor people right you know they belong to the uh the poorest of the poorest quarters uh i think brother dale knows what i'm talking about uh amen but uh the lord has already supernaturally provided for a big part of the expense so i i believe that you know he will never fail his children i believe in the power of prayer he is our jehovah gyra hallelujah and so uh not only that i also request the church to pray for the the new groups that we are working with right now there's over a hundred new groups now that came into the message because of the mystery exposed seminars that we're doing sorry uh some of them have uh accepted the message all the way some of them are still studying the message you know a lot of them we baptize the ministers the pastors but the pastors find it hard to uh to present the message to their denominational people and so uh they're seeking our help and we're doing a lot of follow-up work follow-up work we're going uh making trips to the islands and to visit their churches and kind of help the pastor a little bit present the message that we believe and there's there's over a hundred of them so you can just imagine and uh and the pressure that come with it right you know the opposition or the uh organized religion oh yeah and also the persecution that the people get there are many cases where the pastor starts preaching the message using the books that we gave to them and preaching from the books and the headquarters hear about it and they were summoned by the council and they were asked to leave the premises you know they were warned uh and then told to uh recant or or uh uh denounce this message call better banner a false prophet uh but then some of them are making a stand amen and because of that they're being cast out of their places of worship i know pastors who are who who were evicted from their parsonages in the middle of the night just think about it and it's hard for a lot of our um our minister brothers because uh they get all kinds of support from the organization and then when they turn their their back to their organization of course they're turning their backs from their support and they're they're really having a hard time so i i just it's my request that you remember those brothers the ministers especially amen okay so uh seems like the revival fire is still burning in our country amen we'll praise the lord for that because we know we're looking for that last team because i don't care how ready you are here in america right if that last season doesn't come in right now we're not going anywhere but uh uh i i i i know that that god is uh somehow using these seminars and the brothers that uh are involved in conducting these seminars and doing follow-up work to different denominational groups to find that last scene amen hallelujah praise the lord so amen but a lot of these churches they make a stand for the word of god yeah right they know who their leader is right we're not led by no pope or presbyter or some bishops we're not led by men the true church of god is led by by the word amen the head of the church is jesus christ we are being led by our leader today brother bannon pointed to our leader today before he passed the scene before he came off the scene in the message leadership he pointed out clearly who our leader is it's not some holy man it's not some uh theologian right some he is our leader today and that's why tonight i'm going to speak about the handshake right of the word hallelujah we're talking about leadership right we're talking about uh the authority that controls people hallelujah and if the church is ever controlled by an authority should be controlled by jesus christ the word amen all right jesus christ is the word of god amen and in our scripture reading the psalmist david he said how good and behold you'll see what's he he's he has a picture before him amen it is a picture of an anointing it's like a ceremony the anointing of aeron amen he said how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity unity the unity of the brethren with what he sees in this picture it is like the precious ointment upon the head you see the anointing starts from the head hallelujah and it runs down upon the beard and even aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garment as the duo hermann and the dude that descended upon the monster to zion for there the lord commanded the blessing life forevermore david as a military man he was a soldier he was a mighty man uh he was a a warrior he understood the beauty and strength of of the order of command amen you know they call it in the military the chain of command and it can never be broken right uh and it flows from the leader from the greatest leader down to the foot soldiers you know the church of jesus christ is a mighty army amen and and the anointing flows from our head our head is not the military general like i said it's not the pope right man it's not a man our head is the lord jesus christ and all anointings come from him so it falls down it runs to the to every part of the body and we understand being the church of jesus christ as we are the body of christ we become a part of that body by uh by one baptism are we baptized into that uh body that's right and and it's important that we recognize our rightful place in the body of christ this message came to adopt us into the body of christ this message came to uh clearly point to us our position in the body hallelujah and uh you know when the chain of command is broken uh there's bound to be chaos and so i understand that they uh they uh they are ordered the the soldiers are ordered to shoot those who break the chain of command this is a serious offense right that's why it is important to recognize leadership in our individual lives we need to recognize leadership in our lives as believers we need to recognize leadership the reason we need to belong to a local assembly right right you should not be uh uh uh uh just like some christians that i know they just go from pillar to post not not recognizing a home church right barbara said every christian should have a home church and he should recognize leadership right he should have a pastor because he knows that his pastor god ordained him to see him true hallelujah and and uh uh david seems to be saying that that should be the uh that should be this is this should be the setup of the church online things should flow from the head to the body the same spirit that was in christ should be in the body the same anointing hallelujah and david seems to be implying that we need uh we need to be under subjection am i right and not break the chain of command it's a capital offense to break it hallelujah there will be anarchy if people don't know their position that's right oh if you can think of problems in the church church splits it happened because there are people who don't know their position a lot of uh problems that we're having today in the message movement is caused by people who don't know their position some some evangelists trying to be pastors some pastors trying to be missionaries you know some some brothers who can't rule their household and trying to be deacons married two or three times and trying to take an office in the church that's where all the well that's where the trouble come from how many who don't recognize their rightful position in the body if we can only recognize our position our calling the gifts that god has endowed into our lives hallelujah when everyone recognizes his rightful position i'm finding out that people who don't know their position in christ they don't know they they cannot respect they don't respect other people's position amen but when a person knows his position in christ you will have a respect all right and you will recognize other people's position in the body and there will be harmony amen and and and we we will work as a team right we will work as a mighty i'm army we will know the chain of command hallelujah right we live in a day all where people assert their rights when people are very opinionated about what they believe because this is the aids of knowledge great education this is the age of advancement in technology and people have all kinds of convictions they have all kinds of persuasions and and this is also the aids of material prosperity and i'm finding out when a person is materially blessed it's hard for him to humble himself what a person has education he cannot humble himself you know brother bannon even said even in the ministry when god blesses a minister and he thinks that that he's somebody that he's above everyone else and it's hard for people to submit right in this age hallelujah and i just i just thank the lord that we have the message to place us where we should be we have the message to tell us hallelujah that we are we are the church of the living god and being the church we are we are the woman right and a woman batman said it's natural for her to surrender herself to a man and the church of jesus christ it should be natural for her to surrender herself to a man because the head of the woman is the man hallelujah right in in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 we see god's divine order of headship the head of the head of the woman is the man the head of man is christ the head of the head of christ is god and and curses the man who will try to break the chain of command this divine order of headship hallelujah you know sisters um you don't wear your uh hair long the the sisters wearing their hair long and wearing feminine dresses it's not just a fashion statement of message believers right you know it has a spiritual meaning amen it says that that the the woman should have power in their heads you should wear a token on your hands because of the angels the scripture said hallelujah now angels are involved here i'm sure right this this submission thing is so important to god that he involves angel they're watching all over the world looking for the token of submission amen you know it's not just you know or long hair it's a power right right the bible said it's the power hallelujah all right and and you don't realize it's sister but you possess a power right on your head it reminds you that you are to submit to your headship right right hallelujah right because um your hair is given to you as a covering right it covers your head just like when uh when the uh rebecca uh covered her head right right hallelujah when he was when she was about to meet i said all right hallelujah and and she had no head yeah and she was going to his head amen hallelujah let me just quote to you a scripture here christ the mystery as the head was took up from the gate from the grave i should say so must his body follow him into eden therefore the body cannot recognize any other headship but the headship of the world no denomination can put anything to it for whatsoever shall take away one word from it or add one another one word to it that they took away from it you're dead hybrid right there she's back here with his testimony in her hands the filthiness of her fornication commit committing spiritual adultery against the very word that she claims to believe see therefore it's the word or nothing hallelujah the church must recognize only the headship of the world not some theologian not some not some big preacher some holy man it's the word or nothing not creeds not denominations right not uh uh uh uh uh traditions right hallelujah but the headshit of the word amen hallelujah thank you jesus so david he understood headship right right and that's why when the philistine came challenging the uh uh armies of israel david was there and he wanted to know what would be the what would be the price yeah what the what would they do to the man that would defeat this giant right and word reach his his brothers and they kind of warn him oh yeah david can't you see how big he is it's impossible to defeat him he's so big you can't defeat him and saul even told him you're just a young boy yeah but this man has been trained from his youth to go to battle hallelujah that's why he uh asked him to wear uh an armor and armor and brother and david wasn't used to that armor he said i've never used this before hallelujah and he wanted to uh he wanted to he went there with this experience his brothers told him he's too big to defeat but david told them he's too big a target for me to miss hallelujah and and it's like winner take all right why do we have to fight ever and and a lot of people dying why don't we just uh take a champion from each camp and the winner takes off if you win we all submit to you but if we win you all submit to us we conquer you hallelujah and that was the deal and praise the lord when when david little david faced the giant uh goliath we know what happened his stone from the slingshot amen went went to the between between the aisle the giant just like a guided missile right right hallelujah and and and goliath fell to the ground but the story didn't end there right the bible says david took goliath sword and amen represents uh the christian that's born of the spirit of god amen not trusting in his own merits in his own ability and he faced the denominational believer hallelujah he was trusting in his spirit and his sword and his seal hallelujah and david said you come to me with your sword and your spirit with your shield i come to you in the name of the lord our god hallelujah david knew who his headship was hallelujah hallelujah we find in uh first samuel chapter 17 verse verse 54 where it says david took the head of the philistine and bought it to jerusalem but he put his armor in his tent you see david won everything for the people of israel right and he took it all he conquered everything hallelujah and i think of christ winning on calgary he's the one that represented us on calvary and he won the battle for you and me he conquered everything he conquered all the forces of the enemy amen even death itself he conquered the the uh the grave hallelujah he conquered all sickness he conquered our oppressive spirit hallelujah and then here we are we stand as christians tonight under the banner of the lord jesus christ the message of the hour there's nothing to be afraid of hallelujah because he has conquered everything for us amen hallelujah thank you jesus that's right you see the difference the true church looks to jesus as head right amen colossians chapter 1 verse 18 said he is the head of the body the church but the denominational church is led by a man right that's the difference right and brother ben said uh that's the reason we are oh we are not the denomination he said let me go find that a quote there that's the reason we have never become a denomination baptism of the holy spirit 1958 the lord has given us the opportunity to merge this little church in many different denominations i know that i know that the uh uh assemblies of god tried to move brother brethren to joining the organization and the united pentecostal church wanted him because of his teaching in in of water baptism in the name of the lord jesus they wanted him and they know that they he would be a big booster to their organization if he joined them hallelujah but he said but we have the opportunity but we don't do it because we want to stay just like this so it can be under the rulership and handshake of jesus christ that's right whether he reveals this to it reveals to us whatever he reveals to us and we see that it's the truth and it lines up with his word all the way back and forth through the bible that is the truth and the spirit agreeing on it then then we have no denominational barriers to hold to us from accepting that we got the if we go we go right ahead into it and move right on hallelujah that's the reason we have the message of the hour and it has not been polluted by any denominational ideas it has not been mixed with creeds and traditions hallelujah we have a pure message and this pure message today will go to a virgin womb of the church hallelujah hallelujah oh i'm so glad that we are free tonight we've not been been brought up and trained to be denominational right hallelujah and and then we we find a certain truth in the bible as long as it lines up with the bible back and forth and the spirit of god is confirming it right and then said the the reason that we know that this message is true because it is vindicated by god himself hallelujah and we are free to believe whatever you want to believe hallelujah no headquarters can tell us what not to believe or what to believe i'm so glad that no hot headquarters can tell us who to fellowship with and who to not fellowship but we are free hallelujah we are free to fellowship with anybody as the lord leaves right i'm so glad hallelujah that as the lord lives i can travel to whatever country i want to all right and and and preach the word right hallelujah without inhibition without limitations right hallelujah that's because brother branham made a stand hallelujah and he did not lean to numbers to to uh uh uh how big the organization is come on how how wealthy the organization is there the influence that they have hallelujah he only trusted in the influence of the word hallelujah amen that's right you know when we started this mystery expo seminars uh the older ministers they kind of belittle my vision right of it because they're saying what are you doing better well taking this message to the denominational people they have already rejected it and now you go and take the message to them come on brother oh and i i just said i just told them how can they reject something that they haven't even heard that's right hallelujah they say but denomination is finished they've taken on the mark of the beast i believe that that we have to give the people an opportunity to hear the voice hear what we believe right hallelujah some of us are just contented that we are in the message but we're waiting for the rapture it's not fair it's not fair that that you heard the message hundreds of times and there are people in the world today that haven't heard upon my heart to take this message to the head the denominational one from this group and one from that group and we were labeled as proselyters these message believers are nothing but proselytes hallelujah yeah so what we did we went right to the head we don't invite the members we invite the ministers the pastors we invite the presbyters and what we do we we just befriend them and we have coffee with them have breakfast with them to uh some restaurant because uh all of the denominational uh organized religion they have uh what we call a networking of ministers and they meet once once a month in a certain place like mcdonald's and they where they uh get to exchange ideas new doctrines and sometimes business deals that take place there and then we just have coffee with them and and and try to find out who's the boss and then we get to befriend the bars and we drop bits and pieces of the mysteries in this message right we say abraham turned to a young man and a woman and i said where did you get that and then we showed them in the bible and they're surprised that it's in the bible it's actually in bible say it word for word right the but it's written between the lines like the prophet said amen hallelujah and so we challenge them would you like to hear some more mysteries like this right and of course they want it uh you know the denominational people the leaders especially uh whether they admit it or not they're hungry for deep teachings the messages for revelations and so okay uh we're going to feed you we pay for the food uh next month at your networking fellowship or as for as long as you sit there and let us explain yeah let us present to you some some more of these mysteries of course we don't reveal our source right away exactly because you know once you mention the name branham first thing they do they go online and type branham and the first hit that they got are useful in negative websites websites that tear down his name tear down his teaching exactly right and and and so we we don't reveal our source right away but we just we just uh show them from the scriptures what the prophet thought about eve not eating an apple about about uh uh mysteries that we believe about the mystery of the godhead and all the other mysteries and and there was this one time in uh sorcerer about uh 12 hours south of manila there was a great assembly of god uh group that that came there was about 60 ministers that that were there mostly assemblies of god and the district perspective was present and since the morning till i ended up the seminar this that afternoon he was aiming he was he was even standing and clapping his hands getting excited you know about the new revelation that he's hearing right and then um we have to give out the books of course in the books you will read the name of william so we had to rebuild reveal our source before we give out the books we dropped the bamboo on them and and when they when they when they see the barbarian's name on the book the presbyter man he said mr zaryan reference toriano excuse me you said this whole day i've been amending you i'm excited because all these things that you've been telling us on youtube but they are perfectly scriptural and now you're telling me that this william branham is your prophet he said i can never believe in this man being a prophet of god i've known him to be a false prophet so i told him it's too late for you to say that sir because you've aimed this teaching already you can't say you don't believe in him you believe his teachings and in that way we have won many many denominational groups to the message of glory to god amen hallelujah pray for us because we've been baptizing whole villages crimes of people in mindanao because you know that's the beauty of headship yeah right you know when you share this message to the members of the congregation right then you just get the members yeah right but when you share this message to the hands the leaders you get the head you get the whole group and praise the lord hallelujah amen we've been baptizing truckloads amen it's not an exaggeration we've been baptizing struck loads of people whole tribes hallelujah and now our names are being broadcast on the radio over the television yeah you watch for this mystery x expo people they're nothing but mass pros lighters they call us we don't just proselyte one or two we appreciate the whole group hallelujah hallelujah and you know uh god vindicates it god glory god proves that he is in this message let me tell you about my experience in one of the church of christ group in one of the islands there in the philippines you know the church of christ they don't believe in in the holy ghost no gift no move of the holy ghost but i was invited by the pastor because they become friends of ours because of the expose and i was invited by the pastor to speak at their anniversary meeting the church anniversary so i obliged and and and preached to that church and guess what i preached what was the holy ghost and what was the holy ghost given for and at the end i made a challenge it said if you haven't had an experience with the holy ghost i challenge you to come to the altar i'm gonna pray for you and see if if what happened in the backs will not happen right here in this in this church you know what the young people they came forward come and then the older people the couples they came forward come on brother and then the assistant pastor came forward forward amen amen and the past and his wife they were sitting at the back of the church and they were looking at each other because everyone everybody was on the altar already and rejoicing and receiving the holy ghost it took time before they decided but they finally came to the front oh my what a meeting we had now holy ghost came down that place and shoot that place hallelujah and we baptize everybody every single one of them in the name of the lord jesus christ it's in an island called talim island probably have met the minister there his name is brother harris arizanore and out of that church three other church of christ church came into the message because like i said this is not just some intellectual teaching amen hallelujah god is behind it amen exactly it's both mechanics and dynamics coming together in the church of jesus christ hallelujah spoken word original seed as he did when he came from the virgin womb height of the spirit womb now so will the virgin now accepting his word be unto me as thou has said though it was said by an angel when he yet was written word isaiah 9 6 they will love him and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subjects to his head the headship of christ was his right amen amen all right there will be a church that will be fully surrendered amen to the authority of the word of god has been revealed to us in this day hallelujah whether the word likes it or not whether the pope likes it or not whether the politicians like it or not there will be a virgin church hallelujah that will say be unto me according to your word hallelujah they will say like christ did not my will father but your will be done hallelujah a lot of people think this submission is a your weakness yeah yeah submission like i said is power right yeah sure right yes when christ fully submitted to the will of his father later on he said all power both in heaven and on earth has now been delivered to me hallelujah even brother submitted had to submit to the handshake he would say you know i'm waiting for something i can't do nothing unless he comes and then when the angel comes he would say he is here right man i now take every spirit in this room under my control i'm telling you submission is power amen amen hallelujah people just don't realize it try it because the woman thinks he's a lesser being because yeah he's the weaker vessel he has to submit yeah but you know i looked at that a word the weaker vessel the woman being a weaker vessel it doesn't it doesn't mean a lesser creature but it means something fragile something that needs to be taken care of something that needs to be protected hallelujah you are not the lesser being you answer me the question which one is the greater the protector or the one being protected amen hallelujah i'll tell you your word you are purchased by the blood of jesus christ no less than the life of god hallelujah purchase you glory hallelujah into the body lord of god that's right that's why the verb said they will have his potentials right if you submit to him and take his word receive the baptism of the holy ghost you become part of their body and you will have the potential the potentials of jesus mean all the power that jesus had you will have right the wisdom that jesus had you will have the holiness that jesus had you will have right amen hallelujah they have his potential for he is their head and they are subject subject to his head the headship of christ is his right you know i told the couples in our church you know submission being submit submissive to your head is different from agreeing with your head because there's a lot of sisters that i know they submit if they agree yeah right right the women said wait a minute we're gonna say we're gonna submit all right but let me check if you're correct on that on this matter i don't think it's the women's place according to the word of god to evaluate whether the man is correct or not his position according to the word of god is to submit all right amen that's right but isn't it true but well that the they're off the line they also have a head right right exactly and all your sisters have to do is to talk to their head about it don't try to evaluate just talk to their head about it you know you can't say you are submitting when when when when your husband says honey i'm gonna take you shopping i'm gonna uh buy you a new dress and a new purse and the wife would say okay honey i submit submission is when you can't agree yeah exactly right amen submission is when you think he's wrong hallelujah and still give in right still obey him us your head hallelujah i mean when we came first when we first came to the message from the denomination we came to the message there were a lot of things that we were questioning in our minds right amen we couldn't agree amen hallelujah but because the spirit of god is in us right right whether we understand it or not we just agree we and that's the secret and there is power in submission hallelujah amen a woman is a nature in jehovah chapter 2 or of a woman to surrender to a man it is the nature of the church to surrender to christ surrender to his will just surrender she has no thinking of her own how you can say amen to that she takes his word and not somebody else's right if he would have done that we would have never had to die right but you listen to reasonings but the real bride of christ takes the headship of christ the word and only believe god's word that's the real and the restored bride hallelujah you know god is so much against denominationalism and denominationalism is you can't receive a truth because your pastor doesn't teach you this truth yeah right or or it's not in the statement of faith or whatever you call it of your religious group that is what is keeping you from believing uh the full word amen because your leadership actually you're looking to some man some organization but if he is your leader the holy spirit amen the bible said when he comes then he will lead you into all truth the holy spirit will never lead you to a denominational church yes sir amen and the truth of the matter is no denomination can cope with this word right with the fullness of the word of god tell me one denomination that can cope with it right hallelujah they always have to refer to a certain code right right a certain a statement of faith or whatever they have in the denominations hallelujah but praise god because he is our head we only submitted to his head hallelujah and you know let me just end with this thought uh i'm concerned because um there are some elements in this message that would like to control oh yeah oh lord the church come on brother there are certain camps in this message that that the the they have no qualms about telling you you can't fellowship with this church here you can't have this picture here you can fellowship with that camp over there hallelujah that's nothing but the nomination listen that's right hallelujah some groups they have their pet doctrines and that's all they fellowship around here that's all they can talk about right hallelujah if you can't agree with your pet doping then you're out hallelujah hallelujah just give me a second here um thank you i want to show you something in joshua chapter 6 verse 26 how many knows that the the wall of jericho is a type of denomination right amen said it's a system that separates brothers hallelujah because of some personality or some doctrines right brothers can see eye to eye and they separate over the matter right yeah hallelujah so the wall of jericho stands uh as the people of israel were going to the promised land it's standing in the way that's why god had to break that wall right supernaturally right right hallelujah it has to be done in a supernatural way right so that the people will never forget right that that wall was standing in the way right that that spirit of denominationalism would have to be broken down and that's uh precisely what malachi 4 has done in our you know in our days to break down every wall of denominationalism amen after the robe the wall has broken down joshua chapter 6 verse verse 26 and joshua adjourned them at that time saying cursed be the man before the lord that rise it up and builded his city this city jericho he shall lay the foundation there in the in his firstborn and his in his youngest son shall we set up the gates of it god so hated that wall that joseph pronounced a curse upon it that's right did not our prophet messenger pronounce a curse against denominationalism that's the reason he said uh by the grace of god we kept ourselves from being defiled by this group we have the privilege of being offered to be affiliated with uh big groups but we didn't do it we just want to be free we just want to believe what we see in the world amen hallelujah and he he condemned denominationalism he didn't he didn't condemn the people but the system right right that keeps them from seeing the truth and that keeps them from fellowshipping with other uh christians god so hated that you know god is for fellowship how many knows that amen he died on the cross for fellowship right hallelujah and he just said separation that's why when david saw this this image of aaron being anointed with oil he said how good and how pleasant right it is for brethren to dwell together in unity hallelujah he must have known how it was for brethren to be fighting each other and then that's why he praised god he appreciated the fact that uh brethren are dwelling together in unity it's because of that anointing amen the holy spirit i believe can keep us together right amen the holy spirit can break every denominational barrier but you know what after joshua pronounced this curse you read in first kings chapter 16 and verse 23 and 34 and i read and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger and all the kings of israel that were before him aha was so influential in his time verse 34 it says here and in his days with high elf the better life bill jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abyron his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in the youngest sons ago according to the word of the lord which is fake by joshua the son of god exactly hallelujah after it's been pronounced people still did it right i'm wondering now in the message movement oh my god after the prophet's soul condemned denominational barriers hallelujah people are still doing it right hallelujah that's right but there's a curse for people who will do it right man that's right and a blessing for people glory who will stand to the principle of non-denominational listen right and only look to the headship right of the world amen hallelujah if you can only look for the headship of the world then we can have his potential right but abram said then you can do the greater works first time barbara explained that i i understood him to mean how can we do something that is greater than what god has already done he said it's not really greater it's just more in numbers but later on he preached it more clearly he said it's actually greater because during the days of the lord jesus christ the holy ghost wasn't given yet right amen so he was not able to impart eternal life during his three and a half ministry on earth and that part has been reserved and it's been allotted for the bride of christ hallelujah because you have been destined to do the greater works if you only know who your headship is sorry you will have the potentials right now and you will do the greater works hallelujah what's a big word imparting eternal life is the greater word there's something else when verbal spoke about the power of the third pope the power of the spoken word he said you'll be able to speak things into existence when there was nothing there he spoke and squirrels existed and things started appearing before his eyes hallelujah don't you know hallelujah that if you only know your who your headship is right yeah i see it hallelujah and you submit yourself completely to him come on hallelujah unto his will come on that you have his potential so time will come amen hallelujah you can speak a world and that a world will actually be created before your side amen and you can actually live in that world living the word of revelation amen hallelujah that's right that's right thank you jesus hey we're we're in the bible can you find jesus creating things into existence come on brother it's not there it's not there it's promised in this time that's right the greater works the greater ministry hallelujah because there will be a bride who will recognize the headship amen amen i can't reach no more amen we sing this song in the philippines whatever it takes do you see it here too whatever it takes that should be our prayer tonight right whatever it takes to be more like him that's what i'm i'm willing to do if it comes against my ideology my education if it comes against my reasoning as a man hallelujah i want to submit right now to the headship of the word of god exactly hallelujah you know people in the philippines they abuse this headship oh yeah they say the pastor is the head of the congregation and they're married he's supposed to the head to be the head of the church and so they become dictators and the people just blindly follows the pastor because the pastor even uses better venomous codes where he said right or wrong you have to obey your pastor that's just another form of deception because if you read hebrews chapter 13 verse 7 it says there obey those that have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god it's the word of god you need to obey amen like paul said follow me be followers of me as i am follower of christ follow me as i follow christ amen said if the man stays with the word you follow him if he lives the word you leave the man and follow the lord the word stay with the word and god is the word hallelujah amen praise the lord it takes to draw closer to you that's what i'll be willing to do whispers there whatever it is and whatever it is listen to this one lord take my houses foreign is for whatever and whatever that's what i'll be willing to do whatever what i'll be willing to because we look to your word for our hatred where would we be without this message thank you that you have given us directions lord and you have restored your your bride back to where she needs to be in perfect obedience to your word hallelujah father if there be any any among us tonight that has not submitted his life completely to you maybe some of us are having reservations some of us are entertaining certain thoughts that are giving us doubts causing us to doubt your word oh father i pray that the holy spirit comes and moves mightily in this sanctuary lord hallelujah over over your bride this evening lord jesus hallelujah and cause her to look to you for leadership hallelujah i pray for every need in this congregation lord if there be any sickness i pray in the name of jesus christ christ conquered all things for us hallelujah and i rebuke the work of the enemy in the lives of each one in trying to destroy the the health of my brothers and sisters i rebuke him and i pray father you restore the help of your children tonight hallelujah and i pray that you cause them to grow in the knowledge and revelation of who jesus christ is we understand lord you are the word today hallelujah you'll be with us lord and keep us clean and pure as we wait for the day of your return in jesus name we pray amen amen anybody have a name is is is is we don't have to worry they'll do it forever oh to jesus god to bring the message not to try to bring something different no to bring the message make it alive make it a reality the message has been delivered into our hands but we must make that manifest for the hidden body unites to bring the message anybody because in that way see we all have the same head that's right and our headship is the word amen anybody have a name just coming with one oh how do you know where you are oh oh for me oh oh is working on that is oh you know oh oh oh me just to think about take a little time and talk to the lord you know he's never busy that's right i never prayed a prayer and found out he was busy and i got a you know an answering machine did you never got one he's always ready to talk to us never busy always ready to talk because why because he's our head and that's what he's wanting to be make sure you tell the brother how much he appreciated and appreciated coming and being with us the family appreciate brother louis and his family being with us and bringing them to be with us
