you know the the cousins the cousins and the aunts and uncles they all thought that Daddy was crazy years ago and I guess he figures what crazy now too but they usually don't come around much but uh

individual but from you Lord that you'll give us Lord Of Your Grace the word of God may it come forth and not return void but accomplish what it said it would accomplish father this word that we have is quickening power it's something that the devil can't stand he hates the word of God and father I pray that that we'll shout it from the Housetop that the word of God is true the word of God is pure and the word of God is inside each and every one of us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost father I pray that you be with us now in the for them of this service be with the ones that are sick be with the ones Lord on Foreign Fields we ask you to give us a blessing today that we can't contain in Jesus name we pray amen now we're on our study with in the seven Church ages and and we're in the we've been in the sardian church age just for a little bit now we're into the Philadelphia Church age if we can get to it because um brother Donnie um f Bush and I were talking the other day and it's you try to get through something and then something else pops up you try to get through that and then something else pops up and I want to get more about I will restore today because the restoration started in Martin Luther's Ministry now remember it was Reformation but it was also the beginning of restoration because it was the two shoots that come up out of the ground After the Dark Ages was over so let's read Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest right in a book and send it to the seven churches of Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis in Philadelphia and Leota and I turned to see The Voice being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and there was a strange thing behind those candlesticks there was a man standing there but that man had on symbol symbols that were feminis right and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man which was a man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps which is up here breast feminis with a golden girdle so there was the son of man there was Jesus Christ standing in Bride form in these Church ages that we're talking about it's God in us it's not God uh you know we're not going to see the Lord Jesus until we meet him in the air but we're going to see him through you through through each individual person the Bride of Jesus Christ so now let's read what the Philadelphian Church a Revelations 3:7 to the angel of the church in Philadelphia we're coming down the home stretch here these things sayith he that's holy he that's true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy words Behold I have set before thee an open door and no one can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and H has not denied my name behold I will make the them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come in worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved them because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation thank God for that which shall come upon all the world all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown to him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you may be seated in the Lord I His blessings to the reading of the word now we've kind of got the we've got the graph here I want you to to um kind of hold that a picture in your mind because we're going to look at at God restoring the church back and we're going to see this is this thing is going to be split up because remember God's perfected in what threes all right but now remember the number of man is four and the number of restoration is four God's perfect number is three right but you've got four combat beasts you've got uh four bugs you've got four horse riders so that's an Earthly number which is not bad because that's a number of restoration but we're going to start here and we're going to look at the first three Church ages we're going to split it up and have the one in the middle and then the last three Church ages being the ones that is closest to us but it will be the ones that will complete the birth back to the word of God everybody with me we're going to look at it in just a minute I will restore when he restored me when to restore something means it had to fall to restore it back it had to fall and Jesus said unless a corn of wheat fall on the ground and die it B us alone but if it comes back up in other words it'll bring forth more fruit now look they had the pure word of God in these three Church ages there wasn't any denomination sure there was some ideas and there was some things that were being formulated by Satan we know that by the white horse rider that was in those three ages but we also know that was a pure unadulterated word of God and there's a quote that that Dad used a long time ago and I can't find it cuz I can't get the right wording but maybe brother Joe or somebody can find it it's where brother R said that the first the word they had in these Church ages first three ages they should have took a Rapture but but but what kept it out was me and you standing here today but what kept it out was that the corn had to go back into the ground Jesus said unless a corner we go and die in the ground well you know he did that over here he died he went the ground come up all right but he was going to be eat down again CU I will restore what was eat what was eat the word of God was eat down here in this church age and then we see that the next three ages completes the birth that we realize in no as justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody with me all right so we're going to split that up into 3 one and three because God has perfected in threes but there's four there cuz four is restoration all right is everybody with me on that going to try to take a little little time on this one now remember all these Church ages a church is a woman we're not supposed to be dominant at all we're supposed to be submissive to Christ but once you assert yourself above God that's where Satan sits everybody with me all right that's what the devil says so so Satan wanted to be like God and and his only listen the only attribute God can portray is what he is cuz he can't change if he's love he's always been love if he's Perfection he's always going to be Perfection but Satan has to change CU he's not he's not uh he was perfect at one time but he's not Eternal he's not an eternal God like God is but he also he is a God right he wants to be like God so so he uses different tactics in different ways so what he done was he took the lowly female and he put her up above everything and made her dominant as we were talking about this morning under the Catholic church is they have Mar olry or mariology which is Mary up here and Jesus down here you pray to Mary don't pray to Jesus CU Mary's a lot better than Jesus is she's really kind and nice and he's not okay but anyway well that's what they live by but it's a dominating female everything happens in the church if some female now I'm not talking about a female person I'm talking about the church dominates over God God does away with them that's why he had to divorce Israel that's why that am man he had to put he had to put Israel away because they became a dominating Force theirself they went and got out from under the word of God and they did what God told them not to do and that was mixed with the world all right so they are a dominating force in these Church ages as we seeing those white horse riders with that power coming forth they were dominating the people okay and then you see in Revelation 17 the domination culminates into mystery Babylon the mother of harlots so you got harlots and the and the mother and the Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the Saints with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus when I saw her I wondered with great admiration as I said this morning John admired that so much he was looking at it he was getting caught up in Hey listen you ought to every once in a while go to the YouTube and put in Vatican put in St Peter's Basilica look at some of those things that they do it's captivating it's beautiful it's perfect it's always gold it's always purple it's always the different things and it's always in line and it's always got the gold glittering and and it's a show but that's what John was admiring but remember that thing he was admiring was the thing that was killing the people all right so what about today what you looking for something for you to admire cuz this pretty and we got and we got a big church and we got a big pretty this and we got a big pretty that and we got it's good to have that but what do you looking for what are you looking for are you looking for that that something that you admire or something God admires God admires his bride that's right he loves her and he is AB absolutely he is captivated with his bride just as Lucas was with Lis you couldn't get I mean you could he could talk to him he's like brain was jelly that day I mean just he didn't know what he was doing he may still not know what he's doing after a year but praise the lord they're together but um we sure appreciate them coming today sure enough so now let's look at the opening of the first now we're going to look at the first three seals and remember the seals looses a Ministry once once the lamb opened the seal there was something went out like a white horse rider which was there was four of them but we're up to number three now but there was a Ministry loosed and that Ministry was so captivating as we were looking at John it was so admired that it was a white horse and he had a bow and he had a crown and oh it looked pretty and and most people thought well that's the church and even brother Brandon preached the mighty conqueror he preached that that was the Holy Ghost don't get quiet on me now 1959 Mighty conquer read it he read Revelation 6 there were several Mighty conquer I don't know which one it was but he showed that this was must and and his his I guess his um understanding at the time was well there's a white horse and and you know this looks really nice and really pretty and they're going forth conquering and and all that but we know that it once the seal opened that it was the devil all right and I saw when the lamb open one of the seals I heard his were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts which is the lion that was the first three Church ages get that in your mind we're going to get a chart maybe somewhere and put it up should have done it before we started but your first Three Ages was the boldness of the lion they had the word of God they had it without uh without principle there was nothing going on there wasn't a Baptist Church on every corner Methodist Church on every corner or there wasn't even a Roman Catholic Church at the time if you'll read in your history go to your history right before nah there was not many Church churches besides True Churches read your read it if you've read it before you'll know they had they had the truth on every corner they had the truth in the churches during the first three Church ages and then Rome comes in and then she flips it around and then they suppress this group of people and they bring in their big churches and their big hierarchies and that's what we're see in today so the one of the four beasts which is the lion said come and see and I saw him Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a boat and a crown was given unto him he went forth conquering and to conquer so the first three Church ages he bluffed his way into the true church Satan does not want to be in the false church he wants to be in the true church but when he comes into the true church brother Michael he makes it false cuz that's all he is there's no truth in him at all he's a liar even if he tries to tell a little bit of the truth like he did to Eve all but one word it was a lie all right but then it be become in these churches they become to say well I don't know well Mary is nicer than Jesus she was a sweet lady you know and and and and I don't see how Jesus was was God Almighty because he he cried and he had to eat and we saw him grown with a headache and we saw this and saw that so they said Well there must be he must be another substance of God so then they take another person out then they say well the Holy Ghost is the spirit so there's got to be another one so there's three Personalities in the godhead which was a saying then it began pre began to be preached it became a deed it became something that they wrote down and said this is what we believe then it became a Doctrine to where it came in the nasan council it was a doctrine that was it it was a trinity that was water baptism name father son Holy Ghost eternal hell Purgatory all those things were formulated now listen I said formulated Satan formulates remember he's not an original God had an original Church God's got an original word God's got an original Ministry but Satan follows right behind so close to the Bible says almost deceive the very elect if possible all right that's why every church has to have a Doctrine we have to have a do brother R said a church is not a church without a Doctrine right so you have to have a Doctrine well they have a Doctrine too their Doctrine is father son Holy Ghost baptism their Doctrine is Hell's Eternal their Doctrine is all we know all that we've been in the message long enough you heard it so those first three agents was they were the white righteous church but they began to eat from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil they didn't eat from the tree of life anymore they started going with man's ideas they started listening to other people so we get to the fourth Church age and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast which is the ox say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword he had a bow and no arrows couldn't shoot anybody couldn't kill anybody but God allowed this power remember brother Dell preached many years ago a sermon called permitted power and that's what Satan has he has permitted power Satan can create no power of his self except you amen you give him the power you and me we give him we give Satan the power cuz he's powerless without having somebody to work through now God don't have nobody have to have anybody to work through he he decided that he wanted to work through a bride cuz he loved her and he loves us and we're part of it but Satan's not but Satan wants to have his own group so he tries to imitate so he gets on a red horse and he rides that red horse through that middle Church age the fourth Church Age killing people killing 68 million Christians because they believe something different than what the Catholic Church believe and he was given a great sword or a word so he went forth and he was conquering but now he's going to kill brother said they took the sword of dogma and Antichrist and cut down the real true worshippers all down Through the Ages by the millions and when Christ comes with a sword for it's his word that proceeds out of his mouth he will slay every enemy there is before him you believe it kill the enemy Revelation 6:5 now we'll get to the church age we just talked about the sardian church age and the Philadelphian Church age is the man anointing or the man beast power all right because remember a man is what a man is intelligent a lon's bold a lon's strong but it's not as intelligent as a man is an ox is not as intelligent as a man is so we come to the intelligent age and I read you a whole list of things I don't even think I brought it but there was a whole list from the 1500s to the 1800s which covered these two Church ages Ma you had all kind of things you I mean you had you had buggies coming up you had gunpowder you had uh print presses you had all these different things that were that were formulated by man and put together it was a it was an age and then brother randam will tell us about the next Church age Philadelphia that where that open door was a missionary age they could travel faster they could travel better they could get in a boat they didn't have a car at the time but they could get in some really fast two Hors wagons instead of one horse wagon so as man Advanced we know Satan advanced cuz he's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast the Manpower say come and see and I beheld a low of Black Horse He that said on him had a pair of balances in his hand I was thinking about this yesterday brother Bown doesn't cover this but if he's symbolizing now listen to me just a second if he's before you go to sleep if he's symbolizing if John sees this now remember in the first two Church ages it was symbolics and it was hidden it was it was a mystery it was a bow with no arrows it was given a great sword we didn't know what that was until the seal opened brother M told us that sword was a false doctrine that bow was a bluff now we come to this person here which is he's now got a pair of balances in his hand now what is the pair of balance is you put something on here which is a known weight one pound weight and then you keep putting stuff on here until they what balance out to me now like I said this is just me that I the way I see it if there's symbolics there then we see that the third Beast or the sardian church age everything started to come back into balance the truth started to come back into balance cuz it was so much false to Luther we're going to see in a minute when Le when Luther pulled out man they hated him they tried to kill him right why he was trying to bring the balance back he was trying to bring the balance back but he couldn't bring it all the way back cuz he was a reformer not a restorer he wasn't a prophet he was a minister he was a anointed of God had the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like you do but he was only anointed to give a certain piece of the word which was the just shall live by faith but as Satan saw a man sit with balances in his hand I believe God was balancing the word back out again he was bringing it back to light to where we can understand what true justification is that we don't have to do Penance that we don't have to do works we just saved by grace Justified freely as we read the scriptures that we did this morning and it was a black horse and what's black horse a black horse is death and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast now look the there was another voice came out this was Jesus Christ himself another voice a voice in the midst of the four Beast said a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine he knew they were going to charge for no venance he knew that they were going to charge for all these indulgences and praying people out of purgatory and all these different things but he says hey don't hurt my oil and my wine in other words leave the Holy Ghost alone the Holy Ghost is going to work in these Church ages Satan you leave it alone cuz you can't touch it anyway so listen on the third seal brother Ram says look how many knows what the third Beast look like look like a man the first one was a lion the other one a calf or an ox and the third one look like a man or as a man now remember the first church age was a lion age that was a line of the tribe of Judah Christ his own influence of Life taken that age that's the first Beast which means power that answered by human voice the next age was the ox age or the Dark Age the dark Rider's age now the reason this first age was a white age I've always heard people say that the first Rider white was the power of the church see he said the same thing went forth to conquer him we find out he was given a crown that that was it it was the church it was the church but where did he go to he went to Rome that Church went to Rome it came out of that's where it started was in Rome it's where he did or received his crown now remember the second age was a red horse which was a dark age and now the next age the man age which was the black horse rider he was the age of the reformers the Voice who spoke now the black horse rider that was the Antichrist but the one that was speaking in that age was represented as a man and that's the wisdom smart rudness cuz listen Martin Luther had to be shrewd John Wesley had to be shrewd cuz the Catholic church was the dominant force in that age and if they said the wrong thing we know they did but they used their smartness to get like Luther he said what he said and he run into that castle and hit for two three years he wasn't a coward he just needed to get alone to write the Bible and put it together all right so now what brother R say here we let's just put it all together Antichrist why White Horse kills by spirit being Antichrist spiritual killed now that happened in the first church age it was a bluff so he spiritually killed the people not red watch number two red horse kills by sword or word but they kill by literal sword political power when church and state United black horse Souls when he give out his Doctrine and she did there with her fornications and he weighed out the food by sold there what he give food for balance and Penny and so forth in other words indulgences and then we'll get into the fourth Church age I mean the fourth uh seal which will be the last Church age is this church age we live in now it's a Pale Horse what Jesus tell us he said in Revelations 3:14 he said I wished you were cold or hot I wish you were black or white not color of people but I wish you were black or white but what have we done we mixed it he s I'm going to spew you out of my mouth that's the Pale Horse Pale Horse was all three of those wound up together into one color Eternal separation from God oh my praise be to God now just for a minute we'll look at the sardian church age I know th Works remember it was works because it was the O's age now that's the name that you liveth in are dead and I've not found your works perfect before God why because a lot of it still was Catholic dogma but Luther wasn't responsible to bring everything all the way out he was only responsible to preach the just yall live by faith and tell the people you have an option past the Catholic Church you have a way to get out of that where you don't have to pay penants anymore believe the word of God like I said before Luther took the Latin Vulgate turned it into German and from German tendale turned it into English so that give you our that give our Bible here that we see today as Luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held to Works Penance prayers and other unscriptural means and as for the freed Christians glorified the son the Catholic Church increased their deification of Mary even until the 20th century like now where Pope Pi literally exalted married to glorification in a resurrected body how many of y'all knew that before I told you that I know some of you didn't yeah they literally preach teach that Mary was resurrected with Jesus now I don't know how and she sits on the white on the throne you know she she's been glorified and she's she's been taken up and a resurrected body that Doctrine is absolutely the Babylonian one that remember we talked about doas and and sael in this sardian church age where that happened the son carried the mother up to heaven it just it's just false Pagan they come right from the Pagan pages of the pagan bible so Martin Luther had to stand against that he's regarded as one of the most influential figures in Western and Christian history why he finally stood up to the Catholic church he finally stood up and said that's enough we're not paying anymore indulges we're not doing that we're going to live by the word of God and God was happy with that even though he just preached a just shall live by faith and he may have believed in a trinity he may have baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost but that wasn't time that was a reformer time that was not a restoration time praise God we've got the restoration time in our time yes but it took a prophet to restore the Bible tells us and this is what I was telling you this morning when we ended Martin Luther was sitting one day and he was pinning the Bible from Latin to to um German and he read Romans 1 and he got happy he said for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as as it is written that just shall live by faith and I believe that that that brother Chris that that just illuminated in his in his head those those words just popped up off the page ay no tell how many times he read it cuz he had to wrote it in the Old Testament CU it's in the Old Testament everybody with me you know that it's in the Old Testament because that's why Paul said as it is written he knew it was in the Old Testament and he just brought it up today for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth the Catholic Church they held the truth but they held an unrighteousness they added their part to it before they give it out to the people Luther read in Galatians 3 this is Paul still writing but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith Hebrews 10:38 says now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him in other words if anybody has another Doctrine I'm not going to be there my soul the soul of God shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back into predition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul and I believe Martin Luther had a little bit of a Pentecostal experience at that time he said man he said this is the way it is because that's when he wrote his thesis that's when he wrote the 95 thesis and he pulled away from the Catholic church and remember he wrote that letter to the pope pretty much he blistered the pope told him he wasn't the one that we needed to pray to he wasn't the one we needed to pay indulgences to it said just shall live by the faith of God and they Redeemed by Jesus Christ according to Isaiah but he went against modern theology but he were a reformer he was a mighty preacher and teacher of the word and his insisted especially in his first years of public Eminence that the word was the sole Criterion thus he was against works as a means of Salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration because at that time the Catholic Church developed the sprinkling of the kids and the babies and do you know the Catholic church that's a Doctrine if your baby is not christened it goes to hell Josh went through one well they had one it's some some of Leah folks yeah they they put a lot in they they try to get it there before the baby dies if the baby dies the baby goes to hell so they try to get it to the christening part so I'm sure the christening part had a little bit under the table maybe some green backs was from 50s or hundreds in in a in a roll somewhere but that's what they said you got to be you got to have that baby infant baptism no such thing as that thank God for a prophet brother R said all babies go to heaven good enough for me all right now when you come to the age of accountability you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but as a baby all babies go to heaven praise the Lord for a prophet see the pro that's the difference between a prophet and a reformer a prophet brings the word of God and lines it right up a reformer can bring a little bit out but there's still some down here that's not correct thank God he sent us a prophet that's why he said he would send us one in the end time to restore us back to what that first church age where Paul was thus he was against the works of is a mean of Sal means of Salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration he taught the mediation of Christ apart from man which the mediation of the pope is I mean of Catholic is what the pope you go to the pope or you pray to Mary he taught the mediation of Christ apart from man as was the original and Pentecostal concept what stirred his heart by the Holy Ghost which was the little green chute that signified that truth was coming back not that it was 100% truth but the seed had to go under the ground we'll show it to you in just a minute but it didn't come back as full grain you don't plant corn and all of a sudden you get a an ear of corn sticks up out of the ground sometimes I wish that you take care of all the times of drought and all the other times of worms and everything else getting in it but it came with two shoots then after the two shoots come a stalk after the stalk come a tassel after the tassel come to corn and that's the age we're in now but it had to start with two shoes that signified that truth was coming back to the church in other words like I said God was balancing it back up where it got so unbalanced in the in the Dark Ages now he's balancing it back up but now remember Satan's right there with him truth was coming back to the church as it was known at Pentecost was the doctrine of justification which is what salvation by grace apart from Works justification there is Absol absolutely no way you can get it by working that's right you work after you get it but not before I recognize that Dr Luther did not believe only and preach only justification but that was his major theme as indeed it had to be for that is the basic doctrine of the truth of the word you know that that is if you if you never get Justified you won't get the Holy Ghost what you quiet for you can't just jump right up to get the Holy Ghost sorry you know the teaching of this church and brother Brown too you got to go through three stages you got to be justified you got to ask God to chop off your past sins before he's going to try to come into your sorry self amen then he's got to clean you up take an unclean Spirit out so that you can what get along with you and him and then he fills you with the Holy Ghost he just don't just jump right in filling with the Holy GH fill you with the Holy Ghost I wish that was true no I don't then wouldn't be a journey now watch he will be forever known as the instrument in the hand of God who revived this truth see they had it in the first church age they knew they needed to be justified that's why Paul said Justified freely that's why Paul said to just your live by faith then you come up to James and he talk about works and faith we know how that works right it's not all works you show your works by the faith you have he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith surely we admit that he knew and did teach that we are to go from Faith to Faith In other words he did preach a progression he didn't just say the just shall live by faith and forget about it no he preached a progression but remember his progression didn't take to full restoration it only took partial to what reform the people all right see that's what they do when you take them to Alcoholics Anonymous and all these different things they try to reform them the old the the old Devil's still there right remember the alcoholic they go to the 12-step program they do all the AA stuff they said look you're always an alcoholic you can never be around alcohol you can never be around this why they're reforming you into something but I'm going to tell you something you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul and I promise you one thing you have been restored back to where you never drunk the thing in in the beginning and now what justification does it takes you back to where you never did it in the first place Place amen praise God surely we admit that he knew and did teach that we are to go from Faith to Faith His Marvelous understanding of sovereignty election predestination and other truths maybe he need to preach some people in the message show him to be a great man in the word yet I say again as do historians God used him to bring to the people God's standard against Works which is the just shall live by faith now as I mentioned already this age has been called by the historians the period of reformation that is exactly right that is what it is it had to be that for Martin Luther was a reformer not a prophet so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like the Apostle Paul who was both Apostle and Prophet now what did Paul do Paul restored the law made it Grace and Faith by writing the New Testament hello then they live by that for the first three Church ages all right then so what Martin Luther did on this side of the Dark Ages he did the same thing he but he didn't bring a whole truth because he wasn't a prophet he couldn't catch the Revelation that Paul could catch he caught part of a revelation and that part was that just shall live by faith and the people came out there had to be that's why there is a Protestant movement are the Baptist the Baptists are Protestants the methodists are pro we're Protestants cuz we protest what happened back there we're Protestants all right so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like the Apostle Paul who was both Apostle and Prophet brother R said the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it Reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been another Pentecostal age that's why your Alpha age was a what a Pentecostal age began with a Pentecostal age amen and your Omega Church is going to have to start with a 1906 isusa Street Pentecostal experience all right the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it Reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been under another Pentecostal age but it was not the best that could be said was strengthen that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing there was certainly there certainly was this age had justification but it missed same s ification all right now look and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that doesn't mean they didn't get the Holy Ghost that doesn't mean that God said no we're they're just no that's not what that brother R saying their justification was their holy ghost that was the Holy Ghost for the day and age they lived in Martin Luther will come up praise God with the other bride every bride down Through the Ages he'll come right up with them and we'll go into Glory but he didn't have the fullness that God wants to work in the fullness of the Holy Ghost but it did in this end time that is what God's original plan was watch that is what they had at Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost while listen to me the reason for being justified and Sanctified is to the end you might be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen that is the reason that there is a church it's the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do the mighty Works which he did came back upon the church at Pentecost so that they could do the works that he did this age did not have those works oh they had the written word but not the revealed word this just was the Reformation period but fear not little flock God said I will restore we'll talk about that in just a second and this reform was going to be the start of it he was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depths of Satan in the dark ages to the depths of God that they had at Pentecost and the first few years of the existence of the church now be careful and get this it says in the second verse it says for I have not found thy works perfect before God do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it is unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age why they had to written word they had it already they they had already got it put in print form they had it in their hand but they didn't know how to use it they didn't know how to use it nobody was preaching at that time there was only one true and living God that there was only one water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ right so it was unfulfilled but it was an age CU I want you watch what brother R said it was just the start of getting back that is why I said the Bible called it Reformation not restoration it had started out in the doctrine of sanctification which meant salvation was all of God now see that pulled away from the Catholic church for 900 years they said believe the Catholic church and you're saved amen so God had to pull away from that but not he didn't pull away all the way he pulled them out so far watch I'll read this to you in just a second it started in the doctrine of justification which meant salvation was all of God oh how Luther preached the sovereignty of God in election he knew it was all of Grace he separated the church Church from rule by ecclesiastical hierarchy he tore down the idols he cast out the confession to the priest he denounced the pope he was a very important guy it was wonderfully good as he started but God said 1500 years before Luther you are going to start things but your age will see it all unfulfilled I'm leaving that to what later hallelujah our god reth he knows the end from the beginning and yes Luther was his messenger it didn't look like it as We examined the flaws but there was a man called Jonah he had flaws in his life too but he was a prophet though you and I might not want to say it on the basis of how he acted now let's come on down a little further now this was an unfulfilled age now this is Brother Brown it was an age of reformation but that is how God wanted now remember no anybody ever told y'all God don't make a mistake like 15 times this morning and twice today God don't make a mistake I I sometimes we wonder what he never makes a mistake he's never had a different thought his thoughts the same that's why I can depend on what what and Luther could depend on that if God wrote it amen if God said to just shall live by faith he's not going to waver from that now man May waver but he's not going to waver for that from that and the just shall live by faith but that's how God wanted it Revelations 18:4 and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partaker of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues now remember he tells us to come out all right in this age we come fully out but in all the other ages only a partway come out don't get quiet I'm going to prove it right here brother R said in the Feast of the trumpets he said the Holy Ghost has been bound by the denominations all these 2,000 years right we find out it has now notice the sabbaths seven sabbaths they couldn't get all the way out all right so let's go back just a second and let's review the Sabbath what is the Sabbath it's every seven days there was a release or every seven every seven years there was a release right then you had a golden one which was the 50th Jubilee and everything went free but these these sevens every seven years only certain partial things I hope you're getting this only certain things went free that just shall live by faith that's what went free not everything else but when you come to the 50th Jubilee all goes free that's why seven sabbaths our brother Brown explains in this piece of the piece of the trumpet seven sevens is what 49 you're still in time you're still looped in the church ages that's why you and I have got to be called out of this age we've got to be in that Jubilee time where everything this thing right here yes ghost free you young people may not shout about that but that's people that are getting old absolutely we're shouting about it right brother Kylie Amen brother Kylie's in there holding his shoulder now Lucas said you know he's like man I can get out of the bed in .25 seconds larm goes off boom I'm up alarm goes off I hit snooze 3 4 times and then there has to be a resurrection of my legs and my back and my arms you know how he say you look down you go feet get up well we're looking for that time where that don't have to happen we're going to be changed back to a young man and woman and we'll be that 20-year-old kid again ain't that great I mean y'all want to why would we want to do all we're doing come to the end of our life and then live in an old body for an eternity no we have a promise that we're going to be young kids Prime of our life 20 years old those of you that's not 20 yet you will be 20 then lucky people so God promised a restoration let's talk about this just for a second and then you can go back to sleep I will restore God promised it and like I said before Jesus stood and said if a corn of wheat we'll read in just a minute fall on the ground and die to BU us alone but it's got to go in the ground so it can bring up more fruit if Jesus would have not went in the ground and died they wouldn't be fruit sitting here today they wouldn't be fruit in all the church ages but he had to die to release that life to release what was inside of him so that the plant could grow but he knew that in the middle Church age it was going to be eat again according to Joel I will restore the years that the palom worm cankerworm and all the different ones caterpillar has eaten we'll read it in a second I'm going to restore that that's why that that I love the book that brother Brown preached the restoration of the Bride tree it really brings out a lot of things that the Bible tells us that we can put it together and that's why he's a prophet see he was a prophet he could put those things together so perfect why because he had a mind of God it was actually God speaking to us in his fullness so the first three ages remember God's perfect in three the first three ages the pure word of God went out is everybody with me all right Shake Yourself just for a second you got the first three Church ages epsa Smyrna thara everybody I mean pergamus right then you got the Dark Ages the seed had to go in the ground in the Dark Ages 68 million Christians were killed but there had to be a little bit of light left there had to be enough to carry over so that something went they was planted it could come back up but when it comes back up you've got three more ages to complete the birth brother R's going to read it to we're going to read it in just a minute with Sardis which is the little Shute then you got Philadelphia the stock in between here in Lea was the what the shook which is Pentecost and then you got to full grain which is standing here today or sitting here today in front of me so the first three ages the pure word was preached then the fourth Church age went into the ground John 12:23 Jesus said the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified so so listen to get the glorification of the son of man or the are the fullness of the son of man he had to go in the ground then he had to go in the ground too in the middle of church age so that the son of man could come back right now today in the end time in his fullness verely verely I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and we see that today so now we see one two three middle age Columba that age right th tyan age the word went in the ground they eat it down so bad Till There Was Not much any of it left but then God said I will restore and he starts with two shoes Martin Luther the just shall live by faith John Wesley sanctification then the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see it there and then brother Brian brings this message at the end of the Pentecostal age everybody with me on that all right Joel 2 says behold be glad ye children of Zion and rejoice now who are we we're the children we're the daughters of Zion right and rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath given you the former Reign moderately now what's the former reain that's teaching the former rain is a teaching rain all right if rainfalls what do you do you plant you hope and pray that it rains on it to pop that seed open all right is everybody with me then you got a rain right before the Harvest you need another rain to really boost it up and then it's going to dry out and become grain again just like it was what you put in the ground some of you people that have Gardens you know what I'm talking about and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain teaching rain and the latter rain which is the Harvest rain in the first month there's not many things you can plant on June the 1st and on June the 30th Harvest it except for the Bride of Jesus Christ and that's what he's talking about and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust is eat cat cankerworm caterpillar Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed mf's interpretation is I will make up to you for the years that have been eatting in other words 1 two three those three ages had the full word of God Satan got involved corn of wheat had to go back in the ground but God promised brother Michael that he's going to restore but what he's going to do he's going to make up to us for the years of those Dark Ages are The New American Bible says I will repay you for the years which the Locust eat the grasshopper devour cutter my great Army which I sent among you Ezekiel 47:2 then I brought me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that lookth Eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth Eastward he measured a thousand cubics and he brought me through the waters now what's Waters Waters is people and the waters were to the ankles again he measured a thousand brought me through the waters it was to the knees again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loins afterwards he measured a thousand and it was a river now that's four stages right ankles knees loins swim in justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word of God being restored back in the end time there's your four stages it was a river I could not pass over for the waters were risen Waters to swim in a river that can not be passed over thank God we got water we can swim in we don't have ankle deep water anymore we have water you can swim you can if you want to but we believe in a progressive revelation we believe in God progresses we believe that God is always moving he's leading us out into deeper water if you want to go and he said unto me son of man hast thou seen this then he brought me and caused me to return back to the brink of the brink of the river so now the first three ages the pure word of God was given there was no restoration because it was pure word of God coming right from Jesus Christ right to Paul Peter and all the different ones but then the fourth Church age there was a dying out there was a a corn of wheat went in the ground but the fifth age and the sixth age were reformers the fifth age was sardian the six ages Philadelphia which was Luther and Wesley and then he's going to start restoring though but starting a Reformation or reform the people watch what brother Brown said and I've not found your works perfect you haven't come to Perfection because we find out now that they had justification right here justification I believe he's pointing to the chart no I beg your pardon justification is right here under Luther he corrects himself watch sanctification is here and here is the holy spirit see now that three elements that worked in those three Church ages that's what it takes to constitute the full birth what does it take a full birth water blood and life all right water breaks blood comes baby comes then life all right they were only conceived as a little germ in the womb of the mother that's right the holy ghost coming to birth the third third seal brother R said but then if the Pentecostal message was the last message which justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost the last three messages all right Luther Wesley Pentecost and the full restoration of the word through the prophet brother brandom is what's going to finish this thing and take us out of here all right the last three messages the last three Church ages forms the complete birth just like when a woman is having going to have her baby the actual first thing happens is water next is blood the next is life when they killed Jesus the substance came from his body to make up the new other words the new church or the New Birth they stuck his side blood and water came out and into thy hands I commend my spirit what came from his body was water blood and spirit John 5:7 tells you about that so A Lutheran asked brother brandom one time said do we have the Holy Ghost brother Bram says potentially cuz he was looking at because they were taught preaching justification was it well now look justification was it in Martin Luther's time but justification wasn't it when you were sitting in front of a prophet everybody with me it's a different situation when it was over here if you were to look at Martin Luther and talked to Martin Luther that was the Holy Ghost that was what God was pleased to dwell in the people that had a revelation of the just shall live by faith but now when you're over here and you're a Lutheran and you're in a Lutheran denomination and you're looking at a prophet across the the uh table and you say brother brandom where are we what do we have the Holy Ghost he says potentially because in the Lutheran mind is they've got the Holy Ghost it was here but God's moved on over here now to where justification just gets you started because that's what he's going to explain now this brother Seminary is out in the country and surrounded by many acres of Farmland you wonder why that happened just so brother R could explain this right here and the guy can understand it many acres of Farmland on which the students can work and thereby pay their way through college not get it give to them by the government hello he also has factories that go along with the farm to give added employment so using his fields to illustrate my case I said once there was a man who went forth on his own ground to plant a field of corn he pulled up the stumps cleared the Rocks plowed and disc it up then planted his corn each morning he looked out across the field but one morning instead of bearing ground he saw myriads of little blades coming up he said praise God for my Field of Corn I then asked him did the man have corn and the man said well in one way he did I said potentially yes that was you Lutheran in the Reformation putting forth your blade seed the corn began to grow after it had rotted in the ground during the dark Ag and he continued on to tell him though he had to update his Revelation to where justification was just getting you started in this church age all right so justification is what we were talking about the other day if we look at justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost as the outer Court inner court and holy of holies Luther's justification put them in the body but the justification that you and I are under today it only clears out your past sin it only gets rid of what you did before all right and you're still in the outer court now brother R talks about the outer court now that's a sign or type of the people the regenerated man who comes to Christ gives his life but never become hid away into the Holy Spirit he lives a life that he knows he's eating Mana there's many people today that's never went any further than the outer court and I'm going to say today there's many people in this message that you get taught that false teaching that all you got to do is s a message church and believe God sent a prophet and that se inside of you just going to come love aivee that was put there before the foundation of the world there's truth to that but I told the preacher the other day I said look I'm just going to preach good old salvation in my church it's my church now I'm going to preach justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost seed comes to life I said you can tell your people that they always was eternal and the seed was always there and they can just do I said but the Bible and brother brandham tells in the future home he gets right to the end of his ministry and he says thank God for these three works are steps of Grace he said I preached it when I was a boy this was after the seals a lot of people say well after the seals he said just believe you know seed's going to just pop to life I believe it does pop to life I believe you do have predestination you do have representation God can't change his mind if he ever loved you if he ever if you ever were part of him there you're part of him now but you got to go to a process to where you can see it to where you can believe it in the mind of God you never were lost that's why when we come to True justification over here under the seals the real you never did it and you got to start realizing that that the real you didn't do it now the other part of you is going to help you remember that you did it what the carnal mind part but you got to overcome that but if you stay in the outer Court look there's many people today that's never went any further than the outer Court the veil yet they are Christians now watch brother Brandon by the millions they enjoy Christ in an outward form they go to church with a consolation of knowing they belong to church but they have never become hid away with him in the in course God sent a prophet go to church don't cut your hair read read your Bible listen to The Prophet's message that don't say none of that I just said saved any one of you not one thing I said saved you so don't worry about that teaching it's it's not false it's just not exactly all true yes in the mind of God you always were seed PR changed his mind but when we come through the veil of Adam and Eve where we were supposed to be born born by Spoken Word everybody with me we were supposed to be born by Spoken Word just like you were with at your new birth you were supposed to be born spoken word children no sex involved but once you come through that Veil that sex Veil brother Bri said our eyes have been open and we have to have intercourse to have kids you come back to where it says it's the fall that's why they call it fall cuz you fa and you have to be restored yes I can go over here and I can look back being in the message now something years I can look back and see that I always was eternal I can see I always was in the mind of God my Lord Genesis 1: 126 my favorite scripture that puts me in the mind of God before the foundation of the world but I had a time down here I was lost you were lost you were dead that's right and on your way to hell if you don't have a new birth experience Jesus did not tell Nicodemus Nicodemus just believe me right Nicodemus you always was just believe it he said Nicodemus you must be born from above something has to come from somewhere to get inside of you don't let nobody fool you and another thing we'll call your attention just before we close same here look at the light on the outside of the Court it was the firmament that Lit it up in other words the outer Court was wide open if you look going out the door turn to the left and look up you'll see the outer Court it was actually called the court of the Gentiles cuz they could walk in that Court couldn't go any further but it was just a common area and when it rained you got wet when it was blistering hot like it is now you got sunburnt so look some days was cloudy some days the sun didn't shine at all some days it was dark now that's the in the outer Court that's the same way with me and you you start your journey some days you have good days some days you have rainy days some days you have a complete tornado some days you have an earthquake it's just the outer Court that's where you live and you're up and down out and in and out up and down you can walk in and out but if you go into that next part you're getting closer you go into that next part it's covered and it's got an artificial light a Candlestick and it does have Mana you can start eating that Mana because it is excuse me sanctification sanctification is the work of the Holy Ghost it gets you closer to God but inside that holy of holies only one person can go and that's you and God and when you go behind that there is Mana that never will cease there's Mana that's been in there since the foundation of the world I'm talking about the Holy Ghost has been in that and you got to go get it yes the priest didn't come out and say I don't need to eat that I already got it in me no he needed to eat it same way with me and you you need to eat the word of God but during on in justification that's the part you and I have got to realize we're going to have bad days and good days but get into the next court when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast now we're getting to the Man Age Again behold and L a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast saying measure of wheat for penny three measures of barley for a penny and see thou not hurt the oil of the wine the Holy Ghost is coming back in power it's coming back to the fullness of the word it's not there yet but it's coming to it listen praise God for not just dumping all this on top of us praise God for him giving us progressive revelation or a time to be justified a time to be sanctified and a time to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen cuz see that's my journey I know my journey when God Justified me he chopped off all my past sins then he Sanctified me he started cleaning me up I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus started coming to church I felt so empty inside well that's good but you better get it filled with something cuz Satan will come back and fill it up according to the B Book of Luke it says the unclean Spirit goes out walks in dry places seeks rest findest none comes back and sees the house swept and garnished you're in church then he's going to bring seven demons worse than he is and he's going to say send that message church right there and you just believe that you always was and you had this eternal seed inside of you and come on people that's a lie that is a lie you did not have eternal life in your soul when you were born I didn't maybe I'm different but I didn't the things I did God said I will not dwell in an unclean vessel the old Indian said after me Born Again In Me are two dogs after because remember before you were just black dog then when the Holy Ghost comes in he slides that black guy out into the what into the spirit realm and they start battling each other I didn't have a battle when I was a sinner right pray for me what pray for me now cuz I ain't a sinner no more but at that time I was a sinner I didn't have no battles I could hold a beer it wouldn't bother me I can say bad words it didn't bother me but when I come under conviction yes something came to life but it was the word of God that I heard it's the word of God you heard there's your seed the seed is a word of God God does not have sperm sorry so plain but God's not like a man like that he doesn't need that his his seed is the word of God and as it goes forward spiritual multiplication happens look amen so we start with that church age that brought us out of the Dark Ages come up out of the ground two little shoots coming up that was justification that was a work of the Holy Ghost and now we'll look at the Philadelphia and church age just for a second and then we'll then we'll uh start next week because we'll have next week to to minister to just pray for us we have a tough week coming up to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things sayith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength what a little bit of Doctrine this truth Luther had a little bit he had two shoot strength I mean look look the life of that seed's inside there don't look like it at the time but whatever was down in here that life the first thing it popped up is Two Shoes then you got a stock then it looks a little bit closer in a tassel and then you got to take the tassel or the shuck and pull it away and there's your True Grain but the life is still in every bit of that but remember the life of those two shoots leaves and goes into the stock goes from the stock and goes into the tassel out of the tassel into the full corn all right thou Hast a little strength and Hast kept my word and Hast not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come in worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation praise God for that which shall come upon all the Earth yes we're tempted by something every single day you wake up in the morning and you those of you that check your Facebook pages and an ad pops up yeah keep me from the hour of Temptation gossip and all that other stuff which shall come upon all well you don't have to say Amen I'll say it anyway which shall come amen which shall come upon all the earth look to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown to him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God oh my hold the hold the church up he's going to hold the church up with you that's what a pillar does not a pillow which some of you need now a pillow but a pillar something that holds the church up that's what's right in front of y'all right there those poles those are pillars that Gary Brother Gary CR hates those but that's okay we'll use them for a little while and I will Rite and I I don't like him either and he shall go no more out and I will ride upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God this is getting pretty close to the Lord you know and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem was name name name name the name is fixing to be restored back to the church now it wasn't fully in in Luther it wasn't fully in Wesley but when you come to Pentecost and then the restoration under brother brandham the name comes back and I'm not going to worry about I'll write upon him my new name brother R said we'd get that name so let God give you that name I'm not going to I just want to be called Christian he that ha A near let him hear what the spirit saith un the churches Revelations 3:8 I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and Hast kept my word and Hast not denied my name watch what brother Brown says the first phrase of this verse I Know Thy works is analyzed in the rest of the verse for their Works had to do with the open door little strength the word and the name in order to understand the wealth of meaning involved in behold I set before you an Open Door no man can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another now he's talking about lap over we talked about it before but each age runs over into the next Church age God doesn't show shut it off abruptly he runs it over into the other age all right so watch this there is an overlapping so what happened is Wesley is going to take what Luther had come on Wesley's going to take what Luther had by the Holy Ghost he's going to use it cuz he believed in justification he believed Martin Luther's writings CU he said he did in his writings but he wanted he knew there was something further that the Pentecostals can pull out sanctification cuz the ages lap over there's an overlapping a melting or Fading Into rather than an Abrupt end and a clear-cut start this age particularly flows into the next age and not only does this age overflow into the last age that's where we're at but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has about run its course the leosan age quickly comes in bringing both the tears in the wheat to harvest first find the tears to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn Matthew 13:30 remember please that the sardian church AE started the Reformation that must still go on until the grain that was planted at Pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing Etc until it comes right back to the original seed while this is going on the tears that were sewn will have to go through their cycle and be harvested too so in other words Satan is right there again same one pale horse rider he's right there riding and the tears are the unbelief of the church now watch this and we'll close right here I want you to see something here God works in threes doesn't he it was in the third or perian age that the church was married to the state remember we went through that during the age of um the Third Church age pergami Church age the church was married to the state remember Constantine married church and state together the Deeds of the nicians had become the doctrine of the nicians that age was the open door look for the false Vine now God's fixing an open door for the True Vine now in this age we're going to talk about Philadelphia but he but Satan opened it up way back here in that third Church age that age was the open door for the false Vine once it was back up by the power of the state it became actually a world system even though it bore the name Christian thus it spread like wildfire but now Three Ages later after a long and hard struggle of Faith here comes the open door to the truth the word of the Lord now has its day of course the fifth age had set the stage for this Mighty move as that age gave us exploration colonization the printing of books and the man's name was John West ly that was a messenger to the a let's stand at our feet we get into better and better good and good this is something that um I know sometimes it's um feels like you preaching the choir because we already already know this but then you got somebody like the other day brother Andre head came by and he said man he said keep and June was saying well you need to get out of the sardian church age sometime between now and the Rapture and uh he said oh brother you bringing out all kind of stay in there stay in there stay in there so it's just how you look at it nothing nothing to jun's fine but see but see there's and I know there's a lot of you that are sitting here that're going let's get on to this let's get on to that there's some that hadn't got along to that yet so you got to come back and get them I told you God God told me two years ago he said I'm not going to leave one person behind so if I have to go back and if God has to go back and get the little ones praise God praise God he's going to bring us all up listen just hang on you know what we might God might be doing trying your patience see if you'll hang on for a little while till we get the kids and I don't mean kids by age I mean kids by understanding get them brought up up and then we'll all leave no one behind God's not going to leave me behind behind he's God Don't Make a mistakes anybody ever I'm I'm going to preach on that one day let's sing a song God bless you I love these Church ages CU you know what I see the characterization of what I need to be as they were coming up they were progressing they were getting more and more then they had to fall on the ground you and I had to come to realization we were dead and then there was something came to life inside of us and we started growing as little babies two little shoots then we came to the stock then we came to the tassel and then now we've come to the full grain you and I are at that fourth stage of the word of God being brought to live to life again inside of me and you let's sing a song every Church age look for this time

live by faith we have to have faith that you've forgiven us of our past sins and we have to have the sanctifying power of the blood that cleanses us and sets us aside for service and then fill us with the Holy Ghost father that's my desire that every person in this church will be filled with the Holy Ghost that has the new birth and and has that Zeal and and strength inside of their self to meet
