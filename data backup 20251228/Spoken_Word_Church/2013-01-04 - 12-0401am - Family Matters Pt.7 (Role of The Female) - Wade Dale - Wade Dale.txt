hours after that said we're having steak tonight come by and eat so everybody took care of him he said for breakfast this morning so i had to mix cereal in a bowl and put milk in it and so i'm okay

among us we welcome you sir and we have two visitors among us now that we uh that we welcome you we always say welcome one time to the visitors we don't give you a little visitors pass or anything like that but uh you are a visitor today but when you come back to just part of us because we have no we have no paper that you have to fill out we have no uh uh we only want one thing written down and that's our name in the land book of life before the foundation of the world that's all we're worried about as far as being a fellowship we're just a interfaith non-denominational group of people that believe the word of god and you're going to see it today because we're going to read some scripture and we're all going to read some some uh some quotes so if you got your bibles let's go back to first peter since all of you are up here want to announce cameras announced that bob black's preaching wednesday night so is that true yes what happened oh okay okay i don't know april fool's right i just want to see bob hit the floor but he didn't brother daniel's preaching for us wednesday night they got my brother sometimes gets the words mixed up you know but brother daniel will be preaching for us wednesday lord willing just keep them in your prayers and brother bob is doing a good job down in the bible study downstairs in the sunday school class so thank god that he's uh he's taking over that part for me and brother joe does also him brother donnie helps out so god just puts people in the place saturday at two o'clock we're having the uh the daleville uh down at the chicken house we're having the easter get together so come and be with us what's the bible study on anything questions general questions okay just come bring you a chair with you we're gonna try to bring some but bring your chair bring you a uh a jacket maybe a little cool when the sun goes down but we're gonna have bible study like an old brush artery out under the out under the stars and uh we're going to start at 2 o'clock there on saturday and have bible study at 6. so um also let me get all these out of the way brother we had a real good time brother ron spencer's he said tell everyone that you hey and i spoke with him my text message yesterday or friday they're trying to get some systems like we have but they're going to do more videoing inside the church and put it into the study and into the um kindergarten class or whatever it is where they used for their um for their babies in the cry room there so he's trying to we're trying to fix him up a a plan for that so just keep brother joe and brother anderson and richard and some of them keep them in your prayers to try to put together something to send to him because they're really you know they're not behind on that stuff they just don't have anything they just they just take their sermons by audio and that's it so it's going to be an undertaking that's that's kind of the way we started so and just remember too that we're going to be speaking now on the role of the female we're going to maybe just for a moment we're going to background for those some of you that are not here um i hope everybody that wasn't here last sunday listen to brother dale sermon if you didn't he was talking about youtube me too all of us and we're going to cover that this afternoon because the bible talks about adorning ornament of great price the bible says here we're going to read it listen let's pray before we get started heavenly father we pray lord that you will just touch us now be with us lord be an active participant in the service father not a bystander not a recorder because lord recording our actions in words lord are not good enough father but if the holy spirit would come and take over the service and say what needs to be said lord and let the hearers hear what needs to be heard and see what needs to be seen and then lord let us take it and apply it to our life and go back home and and use these things that you give us to guide lord you give us a bible the open book lord to guide us and lead us through every aspect of our life we pray now as we speak about the role of the female or the wife in the in the family that you would just lord just do it with eyesight lord just do it with with reverence and meekness that we should lord towards you because we're all feminine in the body of christ so as we speak today lord may we may we realize in the back of our head that that we truly are the bride of jesus christ and we need to act the same way that that we we say that our sister should act from scripture and from the prophet's message lord may that be applied to all of our lives more male and female we're all female in the body of christ being the bride of jesus christ and then you speak very highly over lord so lord i know that there's a group of people that is getting their self ready lord a bride that will adorn herself in meekness and and a wonderful spirit lord and do the right things of god father we pray should forgive us of our sins and many mistakes lord be with the foreign mission field bless them father give them fruit for their labor or be with the ones that are not here that you touch them be with you lord as she travels back tomorrow that you'll give her a blessing father and sister brother benny's wife lord just bless her lord and the ones that are not here or may you bring them back into the full lord and be really in a good safe condition and let them be rested and lord let them be lord a life for you wherever they are father just be with us bless us keep us safe we ask these things in jesus name amen now i'm going to read out the dialogue again so you can just follow along for those of you that are not familiar this the diagonal is the actual writings of scripture straight from the scrolls not the king james version it comes verbatim off of the dead sea scrolls right onto the book and then king james took it and put it into the form that you see now we're not saying this is wrong but and it is it's right it's ordained that's the way it should be but i'm going to read out the dialogue because sometimes the dialogue gives you just a little different not a different meaning but a different angle on the same meaning all right chapter three verse one and like matter let wives be subject to their own husband so that if some are disobedient to the word they may without a word be gained through the conduct of their wives having seen your conduct chaste with fear whose decoration let it not be that external one abrading the hair and putting on gold chains or wearing of apparel but decorate the hidden of the heart you know why because if you decorate the hidden amount of the heart first he'll decorate the outside that's right all right so you got to understand one thing if we're not decorating the outside right something's wrong on the inside all right but decorate the hidden man of the heart with what is incorruptible what is it a meek and quiet spirit which is very precious in the sight of god we're going to cover that this afternoon probably not this morning a meek and quiet spirit which is very precious in the sight of god for thus formally also those holy women man women can be holy too who hoped in god adorned themselves being subject to their own husbands as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose children ye are become doing good and not fearing any terror now here we go verse seven in like matter husbands dwell according to knowledge with the female as the weaker vessel bestowing honor as being also joint heirs of the gracious gift of life in order that your prayers may not be hindered and you may be seen the lord has blessing to the reason of the word that your prayers be not hindered now we're gonna we're gonna do a little background on this with back to genesis 3 16. to pull up genesis 3 16 we've got we got to cover how this all come about genesis 3 16 remember there was what unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply by sorrow and thy conception this is after the fall this is after what happened in the garden of eden excuse me multiply that sort of thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring four children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over there right all right now for our visitors we don't it's not ruling like with an iron fist or a ruling with with a uh with a strong arm rule with love just how you want jesus to treat you that's how you need to treat your wife and just how your wife acts towards you you should act toward god all right so but we're going to try to stay with the natural it's real hard when you get to the female because the female types the bride so much man the spiritual bride that you try to move over sometimes in the spiritual angles but we got to stay here because wives you must be subject to your husband amen and then in genesis 3 16 that brought in what did it bring in it brought in a double covenant right amen the double covenant right man god man female god male female all right used to be god and looking at them and even they were the same right right co-equal joint heirs that's what we're going back to that's what it says right here in in first peter it says we're going back to being joined heir man with god so the double covenant though is that the female the actor that was in the garden of eden the female comes under the mail and according to scripture she is to obey her husband all right and he is to be her headship or her head all right then we come down and show them the three-dimensional love which was body spirit and soul i just want to kind of go over these a little bit body spirit and soul that in body and spirit you can you can um many things can happen between a man and a woman in the body and spirit but if you're one and soul you both have to be born again by the incorruptible word of god to truly be one in body and spirit you can just like each other you can just you can get along with each other you can just be happy with each other you see people out in the world that are just sinners and be mad 60 years and be just as happy why because they've got that filial love in their body and spirit but to have a godly love to have the love of god you must have the love of jesus christ inside your heart right you must have something inside on the inside that truly when adam and eve were one remember he she was inside of him she was truly one right because she was flesh from his flesh and bone of his bone because god took a piece of his flesh and made a female now you and i if you're married today that's not true when you and i but we become that amen right by the word of god the fall took us away but by the grace of god and by the baptism of the holy ghost in our soul it brings us back together as one so truly you can't be husband and wife without both of you having the new birth right that's right in christ i said you can be one you be all right in the world and you can do this you can tolerate each other but the reason a lot of divorces happen is they get it in the body they get in the spirit together but they never get it in the soul man because two people with the baptism of the holy ghost you might not get along with each other but there won't be any divorce in your mind god don't god's not going to divorce why what if god just divorced us because one day we did something wrong come on people proud of him same way with your wife but if she's a godly woman you're godly man things will work out even the bible says you can separate for a time right we're not going to cover that right now that's in the family part but it's you can separate bible says separate stay away from each other for a little while but come back together amen all right so we'll cover that a little bit later but i just want you to realize that that it's not that we're so much of this great high person with a lot of mentality like daddy said there's a lot of you women and i i want to share this with you that sister collins told us there was a brother arnett i don't know if you remember him or not but he had a uh she was telling us that the last time we went down the preach forum she said brother arnett got a personal interview with brother brown him and his wife went into the room with brother brown and brother arnett and his wife and brother brown started bringing things out in his life and said brother did you need to let go of the finances and let her handle them said you can't handle money yep and she told this that he said that this is true brother you can't have money and said you will never be successful if you keep handling the money you need to let her handle the money do you know the man walked out never let his wife handled the money and died broke yeah yeah i wouldn't even went to the interview if i wasn't going to listen to what somebody says and i i'm going to cover it a little bit this afternoon maybe a little harsh but i'm going to give you a little part of it there's a southern spirit in this church oh yeah yeah there's a stubborn spirit in this church there's also a spirit of incontinence in this church where people do this while the preacher's preaching it's not that's not part of god's word i don't care how spiritual you think you are you don't have to preach and preach what somebody say man you don't have to preach and preach that's according to god's word and according to the prophet so you can deal with him not me that's why we're gonna read a lot of quotes you can deal with him not me right all right you'll have to give account for your actions remember last sunday amen all right now listen headship of the man ephesians 5 and 23 where the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body people this is why i wanted to do this amen because we have a stubborn spirit in his church you're not going to change god's the only person who's going to change it brother dale's preached this for 40 years and we get worse and worse and worse talk about adorning i was standing with one of you that's in this sanctuary today at a fellowship meet down here downstairs turn around look at your wife bent down in the refrigerator and this much of her skin was showing from her top to her dress and you just sit there and looked at it and i don't think he did anything about it last sunday this pulpit should have been so packed with people asking forgiveness but no we're so far up in the headstone so we don't have to give forgiveness anymore no if i have to act like some of the way y'all people act i don't want it i don't want it man i do not want it man our actions speak louder than our words all right i'm not mad i'm just i just want us to get this stubborn spirit out of the way out of here all right initiate remember we we watched the the five things that we that we showed we'll get started on the woman in a minute but the the male is to initiate or have the initiative in other words be the forerunner be the one that not has the better idea not has the first idea but has the last say right man you know i've always said you know in joking that you i mean you men should always have the final voice in them in an argument yes ma'am yeah yes dear but that's just in joking yeah no when you come together right you need to decide as one man if you decide is one you you know what happens if you decide is one you can't later two weeks later and say you said this was your fault well initiate you take the initiative right govern means to rule direct or strongly influence the action of another we're supposed to govern over our house govern over our children and govern over even you sisters should come down into this place to govern over the children that god gave you all right the house and be responsible today you should take as many notes as the sister sitting beside of you because she won't ever have to give an account for what you do right but you're going to give an account for everything that she does man so you need to be paying attention to this thing where you can go fishing or something yeah right brother here cranch where are you at you fall over okay way back in the bag responsible for your actions and hurt both male and female should listen to this then what was he to rule by rule by the word because the word is our headship if your husband tells you not to go to church if he tells you you got to start doing this that's not according to the word of god he then it's not your head amen the word is the ultimate head and what we're talking about today is going to be straight from the word of god in the prophet's message all right rule by the word of god if he's not if he's not a born-again christian if he allows you to go into church the bible says hey go on yeah because you will be the one that probably will get him to start coming to church man not a bunch of other people going around because you're the closest to him right remember the the example about the sister that the husband was a drunk and had tried to stop drinking and he was trying to get converted but he still had his old drinking buddy and they came back home and he said my wife's a real christian another guy said i she'll she'll break somewhere you know we will break and my husband said you just watched this so they went in like they were drunk you know and sat down and the wife fixed them dinner and said the husband slapped it off into the floor and and said woman you can't fix nothing and walks out you know when they run around the house and look into the window and she's cleaning the floor singing much jesus may of the cross alone and all the world go free she didn't just save her husband the boy the boy that was with her husband got saved all right so see there you sisters have a real big part in this amen and then also we as males should be the servant leader what sir she's not a doormat servant leader right amen all right now look let's read this comment first and then we'll start on a few close the woman female or wife all interchangeable except if you don't have a husband take the wife part out all right needs to know what god expects of her her husband needs to understand her role also because it says you gotta dwell with what wisdom and understanding in other words you gotta dwell with knowledge right we gotta have knowledge of your position right because remember you're responsible she's not right needs to understand her role also the male is told to dwell with her according to knowledge and that's what we're going to try today to try to give some of us men i'm talking about me too that needs to be a little more in tune with what our wife's supposed to do the men should take as many notes as the female because the man is responsible for her actions and as a leader ahead it is your role to help her correct her action don't do this don't do this bless god you hear him you go get straightened out no no that puts it as one right this is a one like this man exactly you see something in your your wife's life gina always asked me when she put something on for the first time she says how does this look that's the first thing she does how does this look and i've told her many times that maybe she needs to put a something white under like sister went you know put something on underneath because they're always stuff cut low but you can always wear something underneath or does this match or you know not match but does my slip show or or thank god women you ought to put you down in here tuck it in if you don't it's going to tuck out yeah and i don't want to see that part remember you will answer for your wife's actions right she won't have to answer for yours exactly right but that will be okay now let's go to genesis 2-18 and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him and help meet for him do you realize who did that god give adam i helped me adam i know i didn't have a choice to choose who she was but god's give you a help me right right if you really believe it you don't believe you just like you know body and spirit running around here you know with no uh um new birth then you know get born again right i know we all started out most of us started out without the new birth when we were married amen that's where our problems begin all right but our problems will end if we get the new birth while we're born right right isn't that right amen right isn't that right i like that smiling that's right because it will will it take care of every problem no i'm sorry am i too loud what are you doing sitting up here no space back there okay all right mr milk i'm gonna blow her away sitting up here sister sitting on the front row in the role of the woman you love the lord man go to first corinthians 11. now this is we're not going to cover your sisters ought to know you shouldn't cut your hair because the bible tells you not to but let's cover the aspect of what's inside all this every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonest his head that's why you look around brothers don't have long hair amen okay but every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered that doesn't mean wearing a hat right because you'll see them down here a little bit further uncovered dishonest her head not her natural head she dishonors her husband not her natural head she doesn't dishonor her natural head she dishonors her natural her husband all right for that is even all one as she we're shaving she's going to cut her hair you might as well shave it for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered right for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man we're going to look into adorning what do we do adorning means putting things on right problem is with this age people are taking things off not putting things on right right but a man is not of the woman but the woman of the man amen neither was the man created for the woman but the woman was created for the man right listen to this for this cause and we're going to get into this in just a little bit for this cause all the woman to have power on her head now natural not power over us power on her head this is talking natural because the power comes from us showing what like brother dale said what are you showing the world right all right this calls out the woman have power on her head because of the angels and we'll get into that in just a little bit brother brown covers that now we're going to read some quotes for those of you that are new here i'm not going to try to explain this too much but you know there was prophets and there was uh in the old testament and prophets in the new testament well i believe there was a prophet in the end time we all believe that that a man named william branham was vindicated of god vindicated messenger right he didn't just have a healing campaign he had a message behind it and this message we believe was not another interpretation of the bible but it was a clear interpretation of what the bible already said because he didn't say anything outside the bible all right amen all right so we're going to read a couple of quotes here number one now this kind of just sets the stage for it right here now a woman is not meant this is from a phantom church age now woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her woman who is truly female all film female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want circle that want she will want to be under authority right and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that god made for her she's perverted right he's perverted right email that lets the woman take authority he's also broken that image what the devil covenant right and he is perverted right that's why a woman cannot wear that which pertaining to the man or cut her hair right you say well let me ask you a question i know most of you know this but when you walk up to a bathroom a woman's not supposed to wear pants and she's the way you tell a male from a female should be the way they direct right what the bible says now if you walk into a bat into a mcdonald's and you look over here and you look on this little thing about this big it doesn't say a word it's an image of a round little thing with with arms and with a shirt and a pair of pants now you women do you go in that one that's for the male right over here on this side don't say a word to nobody there's a what there's a woman there with long hair and a what a dress the world still testifies i don't care if they they got it all perverted out there the world still testifies that a female's supposed to look like this and a male supposed to look like this all right so you know god i don't know he just he's tolerating a lot so that's why a woman cannot wear that which pertains to the man why because she then urged her authority above the man or puts her equal you're going to be equal with man don't worry when everything comes back but during the fall during the double covenant that we're under down here you're not to do that right or to cut your hair why because you cut your hair you take yourself out from under the headship of the male right she is never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does she is intruding into the male domain right taking authority and perverting herself and when a woman invades a pulpit which is commanded she must not do she shows what spirit she's up being a dominating female is antichrist and the seeds of the roman catholic church are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently but when it comes to the word let god be true and every man's word be alive all right now number two mark of the beast 1956. now listen before we get started in this my wife works three days a week all right she don't work in a public job but if you work in a public job you just listen to what brother brown said to do and you make your decision um i'm not saying yes or no some of you have to work because you don't have a spouse that's different somebody's got to make a living amen okay but let's let the prophet tell you what a woman's supposed to do when a woman gets out of the kitchen she's out of her place whether she's preaching the gospel or whatever she's doing she's out of her place man was not made for woman but woman was made for man man it's not a byproduct of a woman but the woman is a byproduct of the man i know that scorches but it's gospel pill that'll open up your spiritual digesting tract and let the holy ghost sweep through and make you a different person if you'll believe it has that big word if if you'll believe it amen well it's the bible it's the bible said now can you hear or has your ear already stopped up now if you doubt this read first corinthians 11 chapter when you go out find out if it's not find out if that's not true other scriptures isaiah 6 isaiah 5. oh my all through the scriptures colossians galatians paul speaking saying you obey your husband amen all right now we're going to cover this because of the angel because she was made for man and because of the angels the woman is to have long hair it is assigned to god and man right she is under man's authority outside of that they're both perverted if you allow that to happen amen i'm sorry that's what the prophet said okay you got to deal with it people we got a lot of things we did in our past life that that you can't erase but you can do something about it you can make better you understand what i'm saying you can't erase what happened back here but you sure can get on your knees and that be the first thing you pray about you and your spouse get right with god both of you right is that right i thought you were asleep number three choosing over bride i got 37 quotes today so we gotta hurry that's for both services giving up a bride now notice again how the natural bride types the spiritual the word says that she was made for man and not man made for woman or her now i'm going to speak and why in a few minutes on the bride of christ but i'm trying to show you the background of it woman was made for man and not man for woman that's the reason under the old law now look that's the old law polygamy was legal polygamy is not legal anymore we don't believe in polygamy i don't need but one man neither do you boy think what your gas bill would be then if you had two or three of them running around for all those of you that don't know it were teaching that course dave ramsey's financial piece and and boyd's got an issue with some gas got some gas issues not getting on him but that didn't come out right give me back the tape and start over again petrol issues so just pray for all of us we're doing it we're everybody's doing a real good job we got about uh 18 of you that are sitting here in the class and in five weeks this is for the glory of god in five weeks in those 23 people that are there which some of them are from keller williams we say they they have saved a cumulative of 24 000 dollars and paid off no save twenty almost twenty nine thousand dollars and paid off twenty four thousand dollars in debt in five weeks and they didn't nobody get an inherent inheritance during that five weeks either that was all taking your money and letting god help you put your money where you need where it needs to be a woman was made for man and not man for woman that's the reason under the old law that polygamy was legal because you had david with 500 wives well they couldn't have no other husband they had one husband just like this type of jesus christ right gloria because jesus christ is one man but he's going to have a mini-membered bride amen that's a type you're not jesus christ so you don't need 500 wives man all right or david eager that was for populating the world and and doing all that god allowed that to happen but it was a type to show us that there's one jesus christ one god almighty amen and a mini-membered bride but we only have one husband glory he has many member brides but we only have one husband that's who christ our head that's why we get out from under that look what happened we've left our spouse we've left all of his protection we've left all the things because he's responsible for us exactly that's why he whips us like last sunday to get back in line right that's why he does it with with but not with um an iron fist he does it with grace thank god most of us most of us i'm saying need to have a real bad beating all right now look next one brother anderson's doing a really good job keeping up with me oh he's he should be he should be patted on the back because he's pretty wrung out he's preaching the same sermon i am but he's doing it back there in that in that room him brother joe and brother joe is the one writing all this down hey if you want to get copies of this they're on the internet you can pull them right off the internet and download them and you can read right along except for the comments that we make which are a few which i wanted the prophet to do all this unless the woman sees or understands that she is made for the woman is more difficult for the wife now these remains are my thoughts it is more difficult for the wife to truly be happy in her submissive role do you understand what that means unless you understand that you're going to have hard feelings about your spouse being under submission to him right exactly right it's going to be hard but if you understand and and then the male understands with knowledge that you're supposed to be at this position it makes it much better for the wife is truly to be ha for her to truly be happy you must in other words you must what we're trying to explain today you must realize the submissive role now we're going to look up that word in just a minute or submit or submissive and show you what it means right hey man not being you know like we've seen them in the message you know they walk around like this you know what more like this you know barefooting pregnant but that's okay let's go to the next one okay here we go yeah we got to get to the to the help meet now remember go back here again the lord god said it's not good for the man to be alone i will make him and help me not help me right anybody can be a mate right two boys can be a mate two girls can be a mate right but help me i help me help me mean suitable helper amen suitable helper that's a help me not a help mate but the word help mate come from the word help me right when they took it out of the original they they put it in to help mate and that's what brother brown talks about help mate and you see other people talking about help me hardly anybody says the actual word help me right that is a helper me or what suitable for him so put the word suitable where it says me you're a helper suitable for him amen if you've got a god fear in life she's full of the holy ghost like brother brown said outside of the love of jesus christ that you have in your heart the new birth there's nothing nothing in this world right more more pleasurable more to make you happy to make you more rich and your life be more full than than a wife that's full of the holy ghost amen right so now let's go to ephesians five wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord right all right now let's go to number four laos and churches a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown said the wisest man on earth who was asked you ought to know he had a thousand of them and that many a man ought to honor a good woman see but an evil one is water in his blood and his blood is his life right you man that's got good wives you don't now know how you want to thank god for a good life for if god could have given a man anything better for a helpmate he'd have done it right but a woman is the best help mate that god could give a man but in other words he starts but when they turn away or when they're watering the blood i didn't want to read that part so you can read it later on all right now let's go to a note the time today i just made a good cut there you go the wife is given the responsibility to carry out god's plan as a suitable help mate so that's your responsibility don't shun that that is your responsibility to be a suitable help mate her responsibility is to com is to complement or be complementary to her mate man now listen you don't always have to agree with what he says and you can make your own comments it don't mean you have to be quiet right but you must be complimentary and i don't like to say this it's like an accessory you know a good looking pocketbook with but but you are you accessorize your your your spouse because he's not really one without you right amen he's not really one without you right all right so and i don't like this i tried to look at the word accessory but that's not really but let's read these submit to give over to yield the power of a star or authority of another to yield yourself to the power and authority of another you need to know when you get married remember the veils over your head in the old country they lifted the veil remember took it off and she put her head right in the veil on the man's shoulder showing that she was submitting herself to her spouse and that he was the one that was going to help her through life they were going to be helpers together suitable the word suitable means appropriate fitting or becoming the word complementary is an expression of praise commendation which is an award or admiration you should be complimentary you should be amen where you can praise your spouse and you spouses of praise your wife but look a commendation or an award because brother branham said the greatest thing you could get outside of salvation is that good wife you got what that's your reward for an award it's really an award for you doing the right thing right it's an award she's an award for you doing the right thing you know what we're we're the award that jesus christ gets amen let's go spiritual for a second we're the award or reward that jesus gets amen that we can sit down with him on his throne glory because we what we have become submitted suitable there's nobody going to be in that city that's not suitable to the lord jesus christ there's not anybody going to be in the new city who's not submissive because remember stubbornness is as witchcraft amen submit yeah that will be in heaven suitable that will be in heaven complimentary that's what we are right we're going to read later on today that god so thought of us he typed us as the city coming down out of heaven man the very future home that we're going to live in in eternity he said it was as a bride what adorned for her husband he thought so much of it that in the last of the book we look we didn't look so good in the first book as far as looking at the natural part of it in genesis the woman the female but when we get towards in revelation that's all he does he just just loads us up with all kind of praise and glory and and of course it all come from him but the wife in revelations 19 we'll get to that this afternoon has made herself ready amen all right so you must be submissive suitable and complementary to your spouse amen correct right man i remember we all come from the old school message you know and the woman said and did nothing and i mean you're not saying that nothing but had no say so or not you know i think you're going to sit down amen because like i said same way with this course that we're teaching i don't want y'all i don't want anybody to get filthy rich i just want a male and a female to get together and talk about something besides grumbling and arguing and fighting but if you two can sit down and work on a budget say this is what we're gonna do just like you two ought to do you'll get a lot more done that's right man there's too much of this i'm going in this direction i'm going in this direction if you're married you better sit down with that spouse we'll read in just a minute it's either tonight either this afternoon or this evening where brother brown really puts that together so let's go complimentary watch how sarah did with abraham yeah let's pull that one up i'm telling you people we there's too much we got to get together i want people to sit down talk about things you know if you can't do that now how are you going to do it in glory how is she going to be your eternal mate right how's she going to be your eternal mate in glory and you can't sit down and talk to her about buying a washing machine i'm glad it's quiet i set something up brother ron spencer's about um i was preaching on something on on the uh adoption and we were talking about uh certain things and they got real quiet especially when i told them that the new testament didn't begin for the book of acts and then i had to explain that because nobody said amen and uh that was about 230 people sitting in the in the sanctuary you know they all were like so i explained it and brother ron came back and said it takes a teacher takes a teacher he didn't make a comment this is the glory of the lord not mine he said if my teachers in school were as interesting as that man i'd still be in school i like to make it interesting i like man i like to make it where it's not just you know it's like i told brother mo you should come out here with a sack of books right brother richard i'm sister charlotte your dad you'd come out with a sack this behind it'd be three hours you'd come out with a stack this height still be three ounces he'd come out with just a few still you're gonna get three hours but he broke it down and he took it right out from under your fingernails right exactly and he run it all the way through your body right i mean that's where you get your foundation you get your teaching is your foundation because it tells you that why for so many years we had preachers say don't do this do this don't do that do this don't tell me why right right if you'll tell me why amen tell me why we don't do this right tell me why the sisters don't cut their hair right because you're urshipping authority over the man amen and god won't hear your prayers right except for repentance amen sorry you know everything ties together this has been the last thing we ought to think about christ in the church but we got to be able to go home and live together in harmony time of decision here's sarah now sarah brother brown always used sarah as a type of of the true wife right because she could call abraham lord and mean it amen and you know what he acted like one right i don't want you to call me lord if i don't act like one amen all right and the time had come for abraham the great patriarch and servant of god to make a decision this decision was that he was to decide just on who his son isaac that he'd waited 25 years for and received him as one from the dead and know that he was a called and separated messenger of god abraham knew who he was right brothers we need to know who we are what our position is all right man you know what if you'll find yours it'll be easy for her to find her right you find yours and she knows what your position is a lot easier for her right all right and there was a time come when he had to make the decision who would be his help mate to carry on the plan of god i think he's talking about like hagar and sarah and you know back and forth abraham back and forth you see god didn't make all don't make all our decisions right i love what brother brady told me one time he said god is in control i know that but he give you five senses right to you yeah i've always said why did god put deacons in the church if the holy ghost took care of everything right right amen why did i put nature in the church because he knew we were still human beings right and we still needed guidance all right that's my husband should be a guide instead of a instead of a controlling hard person you should be god right because remember we are supposed to be first protectors remember jesus was first partakers we're supposed to be first protectors as an example look at him amen all right makes it easier for our job right you see god don't make all of our decisions and there's many times that god doesn't tell his prophets just what to do because they have to make the decision if there is no decision that we have to make just wait every move on god then there is no overcoming on our party man and sometimes they make the wrong decision god's anointed prophets make the wrong decision and many times are deceived remember abraham went to hagar instead of to sarah all right right so there's where you though and i put that in there to show you that god see there was a time come when he had to make a decision who would be as hell made to carry out the plan of god he saw it in sarah he didn't see it hey guard he saw it in south america okay he saw it in sarah so so brothers look at your wife hey man if she's not going down on something that's right tell her about it don't go in and jerk it off of her right just tell her say look stand back and say look your top don't meet your bottom and i don't want people to see the part that i see i don't want anybody looking at my wife seeing the parts that i see right let's just be honest as human beings i hate that it makes you sick number six but the words original seed but the word was with that anointed prophet because the word of the lord came to the prophets joe we may not get to number 16. i told him he's going to stop on quote 16 we may not get there now god doesn't change his system so remember god doesn't change his word god doesn't change what he's doing you and i have to change that's what being born again means your first birth was wrong right why you had to have a new verse born from where jesus said above right that's why it's easier to be to is when you both have the same goals objective same holy ghost the same the same outlook sure you might like pink and i might like blue they ain't gotta do it right all right you god doesn't change the system no no he never changed his system now what was it there stood three again there went janice and jammers performing miracles like went down sodom done one little miracle and blind the people see there stood abraham the anointed one with god and his helpmate sarah right that's right here's to janice and james and that's all about moses performing miracles anything that moses could do in the sign of miracles miracles and signs there stood the anointing word the prophet with his helper his assistant always i can preach on that now for just about a good two hours we know that moses had an assistant which was aaron but he also had a support right amen that was his choice that was his wife bob said he was the meekest most humble man in the world that's what the bible said amen all right nope you see this man man needed a help mate we couldn't do without a help me we had to have one to fulfill the plan and commission of god which is what multiply and replenish the earth and have fellowship now we know when god said that in genesis 1 26 and 27 for us to replenish the earth was right now that's what we're doing spiritual multiplication exactly the spoken word not through the loins of man but when the fall happened which that's what we believe happened in the fall that that the beast and eve got together in a sexual relationship and had you had twins which was adam and and the beast had twins cain and abel and it's pretty clear in the bible right because kane's not part of adam glennis all right cain's not part of adam's lineage anywhere in the bible that's right bob said kane was of that wicked one so we know what happened in the garden the missing link has been exposed hey man exactly i always wondered about that in school but when the prophet brought it out so plain and have to worry about it no more then when god took that upright beast which was a the beast or or an upright creature that was between man and the monkey when he took that and made it a snake he took every bone structure that anything that would compare with us right and just obliterated it sent right back down the line into the state into the snake linens man needed to help me to carry out the plan and commission of god which was what there's two things god wanted what fellowship right and relationship right now god wants us to have relationship with him not like we have with our spouse but a spiritual relationship through the word of god amen that we communicate back and forth with the almighty right that's what he wanted to fellowship in relationship same way with you and i amen he wants you and i to have fellowship and relationship down here on the earth fellowship with your spouse and have relationship in other words replenish the earth now naturally right because you're on the west side and god's son and daughter of god is going to get here right now is by sex but in the eternal plan of god he knew that but we're going right back to the place to where had they not been a fault we have all come sons and daughters of god amen and been made eternal well guess what that's what's happening right now we're heading right back right because remember redemption is not putting this down and picking up a pencil it's this paper went down so the paper's got to come back up right so if man fell by by sexual relationship then we must have it not a sexual relationship with jesus christ but a spiritual relationship with jesus christ to get us back to this place that's why jesus came born of a woman but no sex no egg no germ was given by man it was god almighty himself put the egg and the germ in the womb of mary she was just an oven you take a pile make it anywhere you want to you put it in an oven right and then he cleans the womb as he came out almighty god jesus christ the very god not another not a second person he was god almighty right made in the human flesh what so he could take this flesh back right man he wants us to live right here we're going to live in this thing right here for eternity we're going to live in this flesh right here we're not going to be spooked we're not going to be casper the friendly ghost we're going to be human beings right and he wants us to have a help meet there with us amen so if you're truly born again and you're you're married to a born-again christian spouse they'll be in glory with you for eternity eternity never to be separated remember we read that last night all right let's go number seven in the garden of eden there were two trees one of them was the tree of life the other was the tree treated out now people you know what wasn't two trees what two physical trees remember the bible talks about you being the fruit of your mother you're the fruit of your mother's womb right so you're not to partake of that fruit it wasn't eating an apple if it was they should have covered their mouth and their hands when it came out to meet god but when they cover right where the act happened one of them was the tree of life the other was the tree of death a man refused the tree of life and accepted the tree of death and that's what the world's done today it's refused the tree of life which is christ and made a woman their god right she's american goddess that sounds hard i'm stripping down the women and i want to tell you after all a woman let me burn up on this and men you're coming next look a woman is not even so low she's not even a creation in god she's a byproduct why she come out of god right how she come out of man to be a help me right she's a byproduct after god made the whole creation he took a piece off of a man and made a woman she wasn't even considered an original creation correctly she became a helpmate two man and through there and through there she's supposed to live for that what to be a helpmate help me but today men has turned around and made her what took her out from under and put her to god instead of jesus christ the woman is the god of this country right that's right anybody with any common sense would know that much less holy ghost saints would know that that a woman is what this whole world falls down to number eight does god ever change his mind about his word let's just read it he's talking about this brother carol but scroll it on up he wanted to ordain some about roy davis when he left the church when brother roy davis wanted to ordain some women preachers he said no sir as an elder i said i cannot do that consciously it's against the word of god i don't know you brother carol but upon the basis of your testimony and that truth that you stand for we have nothing against these women they are sisters we love them we believe that they got their place and that they must stay see and we believe that they are a darling to a man a helpmate and by no means we think they're the greatest gift outside of salvation that god ever gave a man but she's got no place in the pulpit according to the word of god upon that basis and your faith in god we lay hands on you as fellowship to come go with us what he's doing he's ordaining his brother to go with him right to a place or ordinating him into into the church let us lay hands on him right so he's real common about he's give god the glory man has given the wife for his glory all right let's go to the next one now listen to this this is where you're supposed to help your spouse help me is to be involved with whatever god has called her husband to do right brother if god's called your husband to play the piano or the guitar or the or the or the doe bro or the whatever it is instrument you know what if that's his position god wants him in that position you'd be happy with him in that position and support him in that position all right same way with the minister minister's wife we'll read it in just a few minutes because once you start something in a row you sisters must be involved with that because look involved with whatever god has called her husband to do here is where i think the importance of the role of the wife comes into view that's my opinion all right these are my notes to do two things support and to understand support means to bear or hold up to maintain sustain under trial if your husband's going through the trial at work or at the church here or anything sustain him you're the sustaining factor right you're not supposed to throw rocks at him you're supposed to bring him in and say hey let's talk about this thing to bear to hold up to maintain to sustain under trial that's the support your sister should give to your husband and to understand them means to perceive the meaning of now listen to this to be thoroughly familiar with right you say well i'm not supposed to jim's not supposed to preach no but she used to be thoroughly familiar with what goes on under that man part of ministering right leave me alone when i need to be left alone i said something to her the other day and i gotta apologize to her when she get when she gets back i was doing some of this and i i just looked at her i didn't say anything i just looked at her and she knew that she'd kind of when i get into a zone and start pulling all this together you know somebody said well i don't understand that you know how you know how you do things you get in a zone and then somebody comes in and just asks you a question and it just kind of runs you off and you can't get your thought back quick enough so i just kind of looked there a little bit also i got to apologize to her when you get back and i don't mind that but she knows when i'm doing something she's to support that yeah you know not come in and let the kids run around grand baby was playing in the room and she actually did take diana out of the room when where she was playing she of course she wanted to be with all she didn't understand but see june understood so the one that did understand took the one that didn't understand out right if i hit you don't worry about it we'll pray for you just be a little just be a little low like uh benjamin there i'm not used to anybody sitting on his front row set brother dick he's over here a little bit so i can't get to him but to understand to perceive the meaning of be thoroughly familiar right if if your spouse plays the piano or the guitar be supportive sustain them under trial perceive the meaning of what they're doing because they have a very important role yeah you're supposed to be that right not here no supportive right i'm like i'm one of the same barking chihuahua dog around your ankle yeah don't want to be that right now too let's see if you'll go this far with me your sisters have got to have discernment to realize that that man's not carrying you off in a different direction right right that's where the holy ghost inside of you is going to have to take over and say hold on you say you yeah yeah exactly that's not a problem with that don't do it in public remember you you fight in the backyard with your family but don't fight my family in the front yard when you're gonna fight all of us all right so do inside your home if you have a problem work on it but remember if he starts taking you off in another direction that's not scriptural or that's not moral then you have the responsibility of saying hey let's take a look at this thing let's go talk to our pastor or or if you're not you know if you're not if you're not going to church here if you look listen on the internet or something go find a third party that has some wisdom that's like dave ramsey said he said don't go talk to your bro brother-in-law about finances and don't go talk to somebody's been divorced 14 times about marriage right he said find somebody that's been married for 65 years take them out to lunch and say how did you do it yeah all right so that's what you got to do there's a lot of there's a lot of things that we got to apply to our regular family life i told you when we started this thing we live more in humanity than we live in the heavenly right amen right oh some of you may not but you're just lying cause we're humans we have human thoughts we have human ideas we have to live in life we have bills we got cars that break down we got carpets got to be replaced in the house we got kids that need this in that human life that's human life okay a humanity but you know what this didn't surprise god all right he's not up there saying well i gotta change something remember the problem said he doesn't change right so he knows and has made provisions for everything that goes on in our life he's already made provisions for it okay keep raising your hand now just i'm gonna hit you i'll remember your left all right let's go to number number nine possessing all things now we know the story of abraham what had happened he had been called to a place of duty he'd been called out of his land the land of the challenge the city of earth where he had been there with his father and his people and that's down in the shiner valley probably reached for the land and abraham as we understand wasn't any special person inside of the world right ryan just fulfilled his role he just walked out the back door with a diaper in his hand and one of the kids he's helping his mate right back and forth a lot of you wouldn't done that you gotta understand your role i am not changing the diaper he said and abraham as we understand wasn't any special person the reason i picked this quote because remember we're not any special person in the world in the world but in the sight of god we're the most precious people on the face of the earth all right in other words he wasn't a king or a monarch or a publication in other words he wanted some of this but now god made him that right give him all kind of cattle give him all kind of land told him he was the chosen one for the age and he was just a man and he married his half sister which was sarah and probably married her when she was a young woman and god had called him at the age of 75 75 to a life of service and it also included his help mate and right here we could start i believe when god calls a man to service if he's a married man and has a help mate he calls his wife with him because they two are one that's the fastest baby change i've ever seen in my life that's a world record brother i think he just switched i think he just switched kids but you change the number good job man he's doing great put a timer on him and he calls his wife whitney because day two are one and so wherever we find later on that god possibly would have killed sarah when she doubted the angel's message 25 years later when they were sitting under the oak tree that day but when she laughed when the angel told her or told abraham that she was going to be mother and sarah laughed within herself and said how could i old 90 years old her husband 100 her womb had dried up for years and his body's good is dead and how could she ever have pleasure with her husband again and she laughed to herself and the angel with his back turned to the tendency why does there left and she denied it now that's telling god this face that he's wrong because remember melchizedek was jesus christ the theophany of jesus christ not the land jesus christ not the flesh jesus christ but theophany of god was that man because he abraham called him lord amen right and she denied now that's telling god his face that he's wrong see and that would have took her life but god could not take sarah because she was a part of abraham see and she was in the covenant with him so she had to go with him so she could not take abraham or take sarah without taking apart abraham for those two are one right hey man when you get called it calls two not just one calls two all right let's go to number ten let's just read the underlying part perseverance i guess your sweetheart came too i know you feel that way about her you talk about some other brother she's still your sweetheart and that's the way we i know we all of us christians feel that way about our wives and they're still our sweetheart i hope it never changes in my family and never changes in your family that we can always feel that way about our wives after all they stand side by side with us to help us fight these battles and we need them amen although i've said many scorching things to them but it wasn't in such a way to make them feel bad it was such a way to keep them in line with the gospel and see that's satan's tool where he works the hardest that was his first instrument is that right he knew he couldn't go directly to abraham i mean to adam in the garden of eden right right so he went to the weaker vessel he went to eve preached her sermon and her problem was she didn't say let's go talk to adam about this she started preaching back to him that's why women shouldn't preach right they get their feelings and emotions and all these things you know going and boy he really preached for a good sermon and then that's what happened in the garden that's why a woman shouldn't do that because now she's under the covenant where man is through over her that was his first instrument he's never changed what he hit the woman in the beginning he's hitting her in the end right that's where we fell as women look at all the women in politics and look at all the women that are doing things with people that are in politics and all the what it's always a woman look at herman cain and all them you know whether he did it or not a woman was involved somewhere that's why let me caution you brothers some of young brothers and even some of us old brothers do not go anywhere with another woman that ain't your wife unless it's your daughter or your grandkid all right don't go no way don't go in a room with a woman by yourself it's not your spouse if you have to counsel with a female you take either another brother which is not good but you need to take your wife right yeah and go counsel with that person if they want to have a private conversation i don't like being in a room with a woman by myself i just don't that you say well is it me may not be me i can maybe control myself but she may not or somebody around may see us going down the road and say that's not his wife right what's going on we know what's happening now see you just keep those things away because that's what satan does satan got eve separated from adam and when she got eve separated from adam that's when he did his job amen that's what he's saying right here he's never changed he stays right there we just have to pray for our sisters constantly of course they pray for us too and together with one unit we march forward like an undefeated army with our great chief captain christ jesus and his word going before us making a way for us number eleven my wife i guess they introduced her here tonight they was going to she's 34 years old and almost completely gray as you noticed if there's any credit to be given to the branham family it doesn't come to me give it to her she's the one who stood between me and the door helping the people doing all that we can bless your heart may god give her a peace in the kingdom of god and he will as god showed the prophet what he would get in heaven his wife was there right only a preacher can hardly realize what a preacher's wife goes through you know it brothers i'm glad god gave us a help mate aren't you yes sir a man that's got a good loyal wife ought to be so true and loyal to her and she she that's got a good husband ought to be the same way look at the world today and how it is in chaos that's right right number 12. i ain't faced jezebel here's the only thing you do now when you leave the church tonight you say you know i kind of believe brother branham right yeah now that is the truth but tomorrow you go right back into the office where you are to go that's the next thing we're going to talk about right back into the office where you ought to go if your husband's sick you need to do it but if it isn't listen dear sister beer god made you for one place the kitchen when you get out of there you're out of the hell of his will remember that women that was made to be a helpmate at the house she never was made for office work and it caused more disgrace and divorces and things now remember i told you that we're can't deny what he said amen okay now you sisters like i said that have to make a living on your own because your spouse is not with you or are deceased or or you know not good or not good to you or whatever you know you that's something you own on a case-by-case basis i'm just reading to you what the prophet said because in my dealings of being a business owner for years ago and dealing with business and higher management all my life since about 1980s three i've seen it woman listen i'm just giving this example and then we made it stop right here yeah we'll just brother joe we'll just have to we'll just maybe stop here this 15th tail but you watch like i said i've seen it happen my sister goes to work when her husband comes home she comes home y'all see y'all see each other at the worst time curlers house gown hey took a bath male and female yeah but now when you go to work what happens you put on your best you dress up your best right and then when you get to work you spend more time talking i'm not mean yeah i mean just everyday conversation at work than you do talking to your spouse right so be careful because that's the devil's trap amen because he'll if the guy that you're working for doesn't have the holy ghost the first thing he's going to start doing is saying oh you having problems today yeah yeah this and that and the other well the whole end of it is divorce or an adulterous affair or something and that's what brother bran was talking about you got to go to work to help your family help your spouse now i'm going to tell you this he said if you have a debt we'll read it tonight if you have a debt try to pay the debt off not a problem but if you're just doing it he says to have a bigger car or have a bigger house he'll tell you i'll read in just a little bit that's not what it's supposed to do now you know find something june was a date she had daycare in our home for 12 14 years that was okay we had an income coming home she stayed at home now she works with sister pam i'm not saying that's exactly right i'm trying to work my way through to where she don't have to work that's my goal to work to that okay you're working just three days a week but if you have to work you have to work i'm not condemning work but what i'm saying is you are the weaker vessel right and you can be trapped by some slick head in an office setting because you look your best at that time you've just took a good bath you put all good clothes on and you go to work then the toils of life follows you and what's the first thing you do you start opening up and start talking and then you start getting closer closer and closer to that person because you spend more time with them than you are your own husband right they see then you go home supper's not on the table house is not clean and then your husband walks in from a 10-hour job or an eight-hour job and he sees that and what's the first thing he's going to say why isn't this done why isn't this done some of us jump in and help i do a lot to help jim with that that's okay that's my business i want to i don't want it i don't i like cooking right i just don't like cleaning up i like cooking if i cook she'll clean up sometimes so that's okay but see but if you had to come in from an office environment and then you gotta come into the reality of a home life kids running around you know changing diapers and and then you're tired she's tired but what's gonna happen is you're gonna if you're gonna if you don't talk to each other you're gonna start doing this you're just going to come home and exist you're going to put your curlers back in your hair you're going to not look your best to your spouse and then he's going to start maybe looking elsewhere i'm just being honest you understand if you're not born again i'm talking about if you're born again and do that you're not well you're not working you start running around your wife and you think you're born again you forget you're not right all right that's just you say well no that's right i thought that little thing on the inside was eternal life and it's supposed to keep you when this won't keep you and all the other parts of your body don't keep you that inside's supposed to keep you right that's what i depend on i depend on that to keep me right because i know what i need to shield myself from i don't know about you but i know what my weak spots are you know why because i live in them right all right before we get let's go ahead and do let's go ahead and reach scripture and then we'll it'll be a basis for this afternoon titus 2 verse 3 and 4 the aged woman likewise that they be in behavior as becoming holiness not false accusers accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that's the age woman aged woman now like daddy said last sunday somebody is always watching you somebody's always watching you and it's every little thing they'll pull it apart quicker than you than you will right but they'll pick it's just hard sometimes to get people to realize we we need to change you know people can people tell me more about your life then i see what your life is yeah all right so the people being a minister all i got to do is just walk in a room and shut up somebody's going to start talking yeah because that's just the gift that we have that's the same way just shut up you just start listening they'll just pour their heart out yeah that's just a gift that i have i'm not and you know what the reason many preachers fail they don't have the holy ghost for one and number two they left that overtake into the woman's part and adultery fornication all the things like that you can use your gift to get whatever you want can't you right you can use your gift to get whatever you want if you're a minister right you better keep that thing under control amen that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands so you older sisters you see the younger sisters doing stuff i thank god for gary atkins which is not here today they got a business trip down in florida or in alabama but he took a brother that we had been talking to about cutting his hair he just took the brother went hey his hair cut you people get involved it don't have to come from here a lot of times people don't want it to come from here right yeah you know michael you can't take hate somebody can but that's okay but if some of you like look it says teach the younger women in other words i shouldn't have to come to um hope and say something if she's dressing unappropriately some of you sisters go to her and i'm just using for an example it's okay you don't mind but do that don't wait till daddy has to get up here and pour it all out an hour i thought we were members together amen daddy and i and the ministers in this church are not up here and y'all down here i don't want that i don't want up here god's up here that see when you do that you urship authority above your head right that you may teach the young woman to be women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children some of you older sisters teach the younger sisters how to do things and your younger sisters you know what if you rebel then you go back to witchcraft again there you go back to being a bastard child right that's what the bible says not me that's what the bible says to be discreet chase keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands look at that last statement right that the word of god be not blasphemed amen amen let's read it one more time the age women likewise that they be in behavior as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers are good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands love their children to be discreet chaste which means pure keepers at home amen good obedient to their own husbands in other words all that you can't blaspheme if you do all that above that right right but if you don't you could because says that the word of god be not blessed thing pretty powerful all right let's go to proverbs who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies proverbs 31 27 she look as well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness right i could say something there but i don't have time we'll wait first timothy let's read some of these we may read them this afternoon when we get back i will therefore i will therefore that the young women married their children guide the house how many times do we look at this three scriptures that says house household keepers of the home give none occasion give none occasion to the adversary who's that the devil to speak reproachfully right don't give me something to talk about because the devil's going to find something to talk about oh yeah all right quote number 13. forgive me we'll just stand and sing a song and dismiss but i need to get this down right here because i need to give the quotes to back this up brother brown's life story i said i don't know home is not the house listen this quote very popular it's the order of the house that makes the home it's the order of the house that makes the home that's what makes home no matter if it's a shanty whatever it is if the order is right on the inside and godly it's more of a home than if you had a palace somewhere remember he married those two groups of people everybody remember the story he married a group of people that he married a husband and wife that were alcoa can or some some kind of great company and they went and lived in the castle and they fought the whole time you know but he went down there and a married a a little boy and girl that she didn't have any shoes on they were so poor they had to they lived in a box car remember he went down there and cut a door out in a box car had a little um like an orange crate to sit on that's all it had well he goes and he sees this group sitting on the hill and they're fighting and fussing but he goes down and he kind of goes around and and listens to these before he comes up to the to the thing and she's sitting on his lap and they're worried about a 15-cent dress he said i'd rather have that a million times and have that one on the hill that's where this is all coming from exactly if the order is right on the inside and godly it's more of a home than if you had a palace somewhere and i would probably venture to say without knowing anything that happened with these people that were on the hill that were born to a rich family that had rich they probably divorced they probably never made it but i believe these people down here if they did what they're supposed to do and godly people they didn't stay in that boxcar very long they moved up because the order of the house was correct amen i'd rather live in a shanty and be happy than to live in a palace and be unhappy that's right all right let's go on to the next one hey north at night in tucson arizona we got a woman judge there in the city that's the reason the city is so polluted wow and we got a woman ain't got no business in politics she ain't got no business in over any authority in the church her place is a man's queen at home outside of that she has nothing and we know that to be the truth you'll never find i know that sounds old-fashioned but i'm responsible this is 1965. and i know that after my going away from this earth them tapes and then books will be living on which is true today and many of you young children will find out in the days to come that this is exactly the truth because i speak it in the name of the lord amen go to the next two fifteen excuse me over bride now this is where he looked up and seeing right here he looked up seen the steeple on top of the other house i stood there looked a few minutes i thought who is the rich man i thought if i bill branham if you want to take which place where would you go for me i'd take not that pretty thing on top of the hill he's talking about the mansion i take this character down here as a real homemaker somebody that loved me and stayed with me somebody trying to make a home and not bleeding you for everything for a final reason somebody that was with you part of you amen all right let's go to number 16 expression all these years of happy marriage was an expression this is sister belle's funeral you remember what happened to this he got the message that it was a sister shepard let me tell you how in tune this prophet was to god but that how god allowed that prophet not to be at sister bell's side when she died because it was her time to go he went to see sister shepard because he got the he he got mixed up went to see sister shepard he said i couldn't get to her in time and she went on to be with the lord pretty powerful all these years of happy marriage was an expression of her loyalties a wife i wish somebody said it's about my wife you know your wife too to make a home for a husband and her children that expressed itself through the hard times when little fellas around the table hard going and a mother takes a mother to know how to put things together and that's the truth amen and to make it last when little hungry mouths are around the table but stand by her husband loyal stand by her children it was an expression of genuine loyalty that's before every one of you i wouldn't have to say that you know that to be the truth see you wouldn't have no words she lived that life they were thinking the same thing he was right because she lived a louder sermon than the one he was preaching i wouldn't have to say that you know that to be the truth yes sir all right listen let me make this comment let's see something you think about for this afternoon and then we'll then we'll stay in let's go ahead and stand anyway you will not be known by how successful you are in business sisters brothers it doesn't matter god's not gonna put you in a bigger palace because you're a businessman and you're successful you will not be known by how successful you are in business or a profession but you will be known by how you fulfill your scriptural position and your responsibility exactly right now is that not true amen you won't be known you won't be known by your financial situation i mean we gotta have them down here we gotta need to do good we all need to do good down here with our money we need to do good with our household but look you'll be known by how you fulfill your scriptural position and your responsibility in that position that's what god's looking at he's not looking at whether you live in a trailer or a mansion he's looking if you're in your scriptural position and your scriptural responsibility well that come with this thing one song before you it's 12 o'clock and you love the lord yeah this okay didn't hurt anybody's feelings didn't tell any stories or or lies on anybody i hope and i just i let brother brown do the talking to me man and then if you got a problem with him then got a problem with god you might have any just for a few minutes a sweet dreams i love you oh me when you make a confession give us i love you foreign sister lord that our stomach the lord will be fine in their head will quit hurting them and you'll bless the lord in those the innocence of you father that shall just believe you lord and have a connection to your father we believe in jesus name treat in the scriptures um i love you you love me this morning your voice means more me she me just keep thanking god just keep thanking god oh is you know i told him in uh in virginia last weekend i said that regardless of of what happens to me i want somebody to make it the glory amen and that's the truth i mean regardless of of what happens to me yeah i may fall tomorrow but i want god to help somebody that's my request every time i walk out of a out of um an office to come and stand before the greatest people that god ever put on the face of the area right is that you'll just not see uh an old man standing up here trying to tell you what to do but you'll see that gods give us leaders he's given us the holy ghost to to confer with what we're hearing amen see that's the conversation you should have right it's the spiritual conversation between you and god you should reflect back you know the only way the only way that you're going to make my daddy happy you could buy him a mansion and 14 cars and send him on 45 trips around the world wouldn't be too bad but if you people would do what the word says line up to the word of god glory get this stubborn stupidness off of us that we can't take correction well either take it or leave one of the two because i don't and if god gives me if i'm the stubborn one get me out of the way like my old high school football coach said lead follow or get out of the way because there's somebody coming up behind you is pushing you i want us to stop this be willing to change we're supposed to be pliable remember the potter once he gets finished and puts you in the oven and trials you harden he can't mold you anymore right but when he can see you up on that shelf before that happens and get you down and remold you i watch him do it all the time over craving party when i was little but he had a little more water because you get a little bit hard water of the word made it pliable and he would make they'd make this beautiful little pot and if it was off to one side guess what start over again so he molded into what he wanted it to be amen and he's the great potter and we're the clay and clay is pliable until you put it in an oven right and bake it all right you love the lord you know it's a little bit late i'm sorry but come back at two o'clock if you're not mad at me you can come back at two o'clock but it's the word of god folks it's the word of god it's not my own ideas i don't want my ideas out of the word of god amen this is the word of god that if if you think that that i've done anything to to upset you then you come tell me because i don't want to upset nobody but i want us this is the way it's going to be remember god don't change right we're supposed to change to meet him all right all right dearly father we pray that you would be with us now as we go eat about it come back two o'clock lord that you will strengthen everybody that you would give them lord spiritual strength and natural strength as we go eat a natural meal lord you've heard the requests and the prayers and the confessions of the people up front here lord is coming and told you lord what they're going to do so father may you hold them to that may you hold them to that word that they spoke lord and the words that we spoke back to them in the name of jesus christ the bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the bible says to confess our sins one to another and you will be what you will be most happy to forgive us lord it's just the confession part let us all confess our sins confess our faults let us be pliable let us be where you can mold us into the image of you father be with us take care of us until we get back this afternoon lord in the name of jesus christ we ask all these things amen go with the lord oh i can't make it this life is over them it gives me oh is you
