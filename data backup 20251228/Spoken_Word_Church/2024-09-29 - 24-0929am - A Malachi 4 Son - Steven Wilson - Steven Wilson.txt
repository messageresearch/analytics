so you know Mary passed September 15th but September 8th that was the men's meeting and Anderson with brother Wade and brother Boyd they went to the men's meeting and my sister shows up Rebecca right so we hang around and I told Rebecca okay I'd like to take you out uh for lunch after service and then Rebecca says well let's go by Mary's house pick her up cuz we know she likes Golden Coral let's take her out too so we said okay so we all headed her there to her uh her place and we found her and she had a visitor there she had a friend there and we looked at each other with Rebecca we knew uh it would be very hard to get her out you know she has a visitor but at the back of my mind I knew my mom is coming in two weeks from that time you know she was coming so I told uh Mary well you have a you you know the kids were happy to see her they said uh you know Aunt Mary good to see you and then I told her since you have a guest I'll just take him out uh we would't even go to go we'll just pick a McDonald's or something close to Rebecca cuz she has two hours to drive back home um and uh yeah she said okay so I told you we we we'll meet again we'll we'll go out another time cuz Mom was coming so it just happened to be that's the last time we saw her um I asked Rebecca you know what made you come that Sunday you know who who pushed you to come but at the back end my dad has been pushed in Rebecca you go to church go to church don't stay home just go to church so that Sunday she picks to come and that just happened to be like we just went to say goodbye the kids went to say goodbye and that's right right that's just how things but I look at it like that's just God's Providence and just a lot of questions but God God provided that amen going to sing Psalms 23 the Lord's my sheer I'll not want he may Tak me down [Music] to in pous green he lead me the quiet Water [Music] by my soul oh he do restore again and me to walk do May within the path of rightousness even for

head thou DST with all anoint and my cup all overflows good and mercy all my life shall surely follow me and in God's house forever my d in place shall [Music] [Applause] be praise the Lord what a wonderful song to turn the Psalms into a song and of course the Psalms are the songs that David s you know Psalms 23 when we uh think about that we kind of think uh well this is always quoted at funerals but I consider that a Psalm of Life right it's it's even for the day you're born into this world and and your purpose and existence that can be applied those verses can be applied even in the future home amen so all the word of God is is so beautiful and it gives us light and life um Sister Janice Wilson your husband said he would love to hear you give us a special this morning so we're

I got it go now for a little while but goodbye is not the [Music] end I've got to go now for a but goodbye is not the [Music] end give my hand clap of Praise not the end what a statement that is Hall you imagine there the disciples were with Jesus for three years and they didn't know what was going to happen and now the pressures of the G government was coming down and and now he's arrested and we

reflection in your own life you see your own journey in these songs and you know uh a lot of times something God has dealt with me over the years with is just stubbornness and thinking that you can handle everything yourself and all this burden and I don't need anybody's help but we're not made for that we're sheep we're made to cry out and and and you're not made to just handle all these burdens in your life yourself brother Bob been talking about the Eternal attribute of God the reason we're in this Fallen condition is go through all these trials and temptations but you're not meant to hold all that yourself it's like that Pilgrim progress right those rocks and his back a lot of Burden but you can give them to him and there's times where you think you don't want to talk to anybody God can work through other people just sit down and say I need you to pray for me I'm not going to tell you all details but you're not meant to go along in this journey he's with you but he's in you and he's in each other for us to encourage one another I must tell him amen there's a time it's okay to not be okay but you don't have to stay that way he can take your burdens you just get along with him and open up your heart and he'll come on the scene amen Let's uh let's sing that of course uh you are my refuge the amen he's such a refuge in a time of need you are my refuge You Are

know brother Steven Wilson but uh um he's a good brother he's a good friend uh been in the family a long time and we sure do appreciate him and Sister Janice coming just a couple of announcements number one I really thought that my wife was holding secrets for me it wasn't June that has vertigo it's Julie Mr Julie cramp CU she's sitting downstairs and she said that wasn't for June that was for me so brother Ryan Julie not juny cuz that scared me to death I talked to June this morning and they're in the Poconos and she's got to drive back and then fly back home tonight uh with the girls and she never told me that so I was a bit upset there for a moment but uh that all got cleared up so uh it's all an interpretation right remember Wednesday night brother Lis will be here we are leaving tomorrow uh when June comes back uh we have a cabin in the mountain for about four or five days we're going to uh spend some time it's our anniversary next Sunday so 45 years all all her not me amen amen amen that's all right sister Regina I'm glad you're excited about something so we're going to the mountains for a few days and we won't be here Wednesday night but we sure will be streaming in if we can um brother Aaron is at brother um Dutch Scott um remember next Sunday now brother uh Andre head will be here brother Bob's going to go speak for him up there and if some of you saw the pictures of what's going on up there it is totally devastating what's going on um up there took stevenh and Janice they had to go around the world and they going to have to go around to go world to go back home because a lot of places are totally gone roads are gone people are gone so uh we we really dodged the bullet here we didn't have any problem at all we thank God for that but we also want to have sincere prayer for those people that I think right now there's a total of 70 something people that they can't find uh scattered up in North Carolina in Tennessee that they haven't even been able to find besides the on they have some got swept away but um folks this is just a dropping a bucket to what's coming I don't want to scare you it is but this is a Dro in the bucket with what's coming especially the United States when when California sinks this won't even be remembered so let's get into what our refuge today the greatest thing we can you know I I saw the other day that some of the millionaires are taking these these big old uh silos and they've took the missiles out of it but the but the rich people are building houses underneath it Apartments so they can make it through the make it through the U the nuclear explosion or whatever it is but give me Eagle wings give me feathers I'll take feathers anytime if it's under his wing I'll promise you you can't dig a hole deep enough to get away from God so we're going to listen today to the word of the Lord couple more announcements real quick next Sunday brother Andre will be with us we'll still just have one service though but we will have communion and foot washing after that first service next Sunday everybody understand that we'll have communion foot washing just soon as brother Andre gets finished speaking we'll go ahead and have um communion and foot washing but one service there'll be no afternoon service that is the first Sunday also next week remember $20 bring you $20 and maybe put some bins in there Ben Franklin if you don't know that's on a $50 bill I think so anyway but next Sunday we'll be taking up an offering that offering will go to Vision books for the berry coffee and we can they can make a book for 8 cents and they can make a church age book for 86 cents so for a dollar your $20 go a long way but bring your money if you want to write a check as we've always said for All These Years brother Dell said if you want to write a check and run it through the church that's fine if you want to take it off on your taxes just make sure you put a note on it to tell sister Lisa that is for vision books all right it's the way we've done it forever okay so it's nothing new brother Dale's always said that just to give you an opportunity to to maybe take a little bit more your taxes but I'm not going to worry about that I'm just going to give a good a good offering to myself and not worry about the IRS they're not going to heaven I'll promise you I didn't say the people the IRS is not going the government part praise God they're don't make you happy that'll make it real happy but just remember that next Sunday foot washing and communion after service brother Andre head will be here brother Bob is going to be up there pray for him traveling he's going to be up there preaching for them we're going to swap and um we'll have regular normal service and then communion foot washing and then we will take up an offering for vision books to send the books overseas to the Believers there so all mine's clear you love the Lord we're fixing to hear from him if you believe that you've come to hear from God you've not come to hear from one person you come to hear from the Lord and I believe brother Steven has been ordained to do that today it's his job so it's his job to get out of the way and let God speak amen so let's uh he's from uh Johnson City Tennessee his dad's brother Richard Wilson if you didn't know that he been here did Dad's more more service and he's been here speaking for him he's he's a solid brother in the Lord and we sure do appreciate him amen and uh we appreciate his ministry and we'll be seeing him more often I hope down here to to preach for us

Spirit of promis all right so we get the promise we get the spirit of adoption we get the promise now now you know what brother you wasn't groan before but all of a sudden now when that new birth comes in you start groaning cuz why you recognize you come from another world now there's something in you from another world all right so let's go which is which is that that Holy Spirit of promise what which is the earnest the down payment of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession un the praise of his glory Lord add the blessing in reading of his word you can be seated brother collie I'm glad you got around the roadblocks amen so there's a lot of roadblocks on the road the last couple of days I'll tell you young people something when I was young it's a long time ago now when I was young I had two favorite preachers it's bad to tell them myself brother Michael but my two favorite preachers when I was young was brother James collie and brother Charles Lee Johnson there an Irwin and this is the worst part telling myself brother col it's because they preached about 20 minutes you remember that don't you brother collie brother collie preach about 20 30 minutes of ter we like we like to brother collie didn't we I can't do that I'm sorry I can't preach 20 minutes I can barely say my name in 20 minutes so but I I promise you I won't be long and but it it is good to be here I don't want to be emotional but a lot of great memories have down here a lot of great memories look that picture brother collie and see brother dick and all the ones you know one of the greatest memories I had foran when that door used to be back here and you lot of you sister pegy you remember brother Tatum would walk through that door that's right walk through that door and when everybody sitting that there first thing he do teren just right here if there's ever been more humble man I've never met him right there's never been a sweeter Kinder man the brother tat him he told me want to tell you this and I'll get started there's so many stories I could tell about down here you know about things you just don't want to say too much but things brother Dale did I mean just you just keep tell everything but brother Tatum told about meeting brother brandham was just amazing story he said when he met brother brandham down there said he walked out that hotel room and said brother said he' been praying Michael he said I want to meet God's prophet he was down there in Louisiana he said I just want to meet God's Prophet said he pulled up the motel down there didn't know nothing pull up the mot they was going to stay parked his car got out said the motel sister Regina said the motel door open and out walk brother Brandon brother colie said brother Brandon walked straight to him stuck his hand out and said I'm William brand I'm brother William Brandon he said those eyes look like they could look right through you and said you know what he said he started talking to him about Malachi 4 amen that's what I'm here to talk to you about today a child out of Malachi 4 a son and daughter birthed out of Malachi 4 that's what I talk to you just a few minutes about because I'll tell you I don't believe a Christian in this day is just a Christian as days gone by we're not called to be Christians so-called we've watered down Christianity so much it's pathetic that's what's Happ people pass away now and they'll say oh God must have need a race car driver he must have need this driver God don't need nothing you need God he don't need you all right so let's just let's forget that silliness and realize we need one thing and that's the word which is god brother say you're seeing the word you're seeing Jesus all right so I want to talk today like I said of Malachi four child but what what I want you to see here it's the gospel of your salvation nobody else's salvation your salvation that's why it's to you and to you alone I say to thee Upon This Rock I'll build it's not to a group see everybody wants to make it to a group but you're not Israel that's you're an IND idual you come through this journey this new birth being born again all right so keep that in mind after you heard the gospel of your salvation now let's go over to now here's what I have to do I'll just tell you y'all that don't know I have to stay in the scriptures to stay on Focus I go I get too wound up and I will I'll get wound up and I can't help that I didn't mean I'm I'm not trying to be but I just I got to stay with the scriptures to keep me on track am because my mind will get going you know you try to put too much in but let's go to First Peter okay I I asked brother Louise could he understand Tennessee Tennessee he's having a hard time speaking Tennessee and I understand I understand that if I say yans that means you all so I just but you know I am what I am you know and um but there's one thing about it I know where I come from and we finish up today see that's what's so hard sometimes Terence you can remember what I used to be you could way can remember what I used to be amen but I'm going to tell you when I end up today you may find out I've been the self-same person all the time come on all right so let's just read this and get get going it's about time to quit here I Ain got started first First Peter 1 elect according to the four knowledge of God that's the only way like brother that's the only way you're predestinated is through the for knowledge of God now let me explain here for you young people I know it's not a use service but just think about it this way in in um future home brother Brandon was talking about for knowledge he said let me show you how for knowledge works let me explain how for knowledge of God works and he starts to talk about the Visions so let me just do it this way brother Brandon would see a vision he'd see he'd see the vision of what was going to happen in somebody's home he would say he'd say this lady's going to come in with a brown coat on going to have a brown coat on there's a hat that's on top of the coffee table right there's a husband's here a child's over here there's a sick woman here I see that sick woman get well all right so what happens is brother Brandon's in the home he's seen the vision he knows what's going to happen God's for knowledge has showed him what's going to happen that's what so you God know in other words God knows the end from the beginning that's that's the only thing it ain't you are special it's God knows the end from the beginning so God's so brother Brandon's in the vision he's there in the home now brother collie he's there there's no woman there with a brown coat on that's right right the hat is sitting on the kitchen table it ain't on the coffee table the little kid over here is laying there dying sick brother Brandon wants to heal pray for the sick child but the vision he can't do it why God's forign knowledge just said certain things have to be so from this remember you can't God change God's word all right you can't change his word you can't change his mind you can't so brother Brandon here he was a word Prophet greatest Prophet God's ever had on this Earth in my opinion not just a word Prophet a church age messenger all right so here he was he saw the vision he couldn't say well God I can't wait for the hat to get moved I can't wait for the woman to get I got to get this he couldn't do that he had to wait sister he had to wait so about that time somebody knocks on the door well there's sister Betty with her Brown coat on well sister June over here says Lord have mercy sister Betty where'd you get that brown coat at I I just stopped I saw a sign down there and they said they was having a sale and I just bought this brown coat never owned the brown coat but God knew she's going to have that brown coat on brother Brandon knew she was right so she gets the brown coat on here she comes walking in with it and while she do she just goes there sets the coat down there there the Hat sitting on the cof on the table she picks the the Hat up and set you on the coffee table yeah brother Brandon didn't have one thing to do with it but what happened he could then go and pray for the child there's for knowledge you can't make it happen what God knew it would happen and it just happens all right so like brother Bob said God brings things together but God don't make you do nothing he didn't put you through a pipe it's free moral agency every bit of it's what you choose to do with it all right all right so now let's stay with this right here because it's by the elect according to the four knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit under obedience the sprink of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and po peace be multiplied blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ well we got them everywhere don't we amen we got two or three of them which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us again into a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance now he said what we're he predestinate to anher but what happened we just read there Pro our promise of our inheritance Earnest of our inheritance to an inheritance that's Incorruptible that inheritance is Incorruptible you can look at me and tell I'm corruptible yeah so I didn't come the right way to an inheritance it's Incorruptible that's good amen undefiled can't mess it up I may put the wrong interpretation on it but it don't change it I may put a cow brother Zach I may put a cow on the top of the tree eating grass you know you got all the pieces of the puzzle but you got the cow on the top of the tree Zach's a cow man that cow starve death for long but you get that cow out of the tree put that tree full of leaves and put it down there in a pretty green pasture you got all the pieces in the right places so we can't misplace it can we we got to put it in the right place all right so to it inher inrupt undefiled that fadeth not away amen all right so now what not away where's it at reserved in heaven for who for you so I'm talking to you nobody else but you Ryan that's who I'm talking to all right who are kept by the power of God through faith and salvation ready to be revealed in the last time now let's skip on over I was going to read 13 but we'll do that later verse 23 now that's what it's reserved in heaven for you nobody else the gospel of your salvation is in heaven and no nobody else can get it all right but let's don't put it in heaven leave it there you leave it there you're in trouble we're gonna find out here in a minute I'm I'll get you something I promise that have what we're going to get you we're going to get something that's from heaven was in heaven sister Peggy it was reserved but here see here brother Dell was going on here's here's the thing I don't want to minister I don't want a minister telling me I can't wait to go to brother Dale don't misunderstand me you all don't misunderstand I want a minister says I want something to bring brother Dell here that's what we got to have we're not looking to everybody else is looking to go to heaven I ain't looking to go to heaven they're they're up see we got it backwards they're up there saying how long to come back here they said brother Brandon we don't eat here we don't eat here we ate down there what you know what when they come here brother colie we go in the restur first thing we do is eat Ain I think we'll eat here they'll eat here right but see see everybody's looking oh I want to go I'm going there going no sir we got to have something that brings them here I'll get to here in the me I just get ahead of myself always do there's a ministry here now that your position your position there's a ministry here now that's never been here before outside of the first Ministry the alpha ministry that's the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ himself son of man Ministry not Son of God lth Paul never come to it you have to have the ministry of the son of man same Ministry in the same Ministry in end Paul didn't come to a change son of man did all right Paul said I want I prophesy in part I preach in part I do this in part we sit in part but when that which is perfect is come that's what we've got Perfection let me tell you what it is you tell you the ministry the ministry brother Bob is the neck Ministry we're not in the days of the feat we're not in the day what is that neck do brother colie it connects the head and the body together the body for Seven Ages Seven Ages is what it's connected to not just this body through Seven Ages is what it's connected to exactly what it is why they're all crying why cuz we're not the head but we unite The Head and the body that's what the gospel of your salvation does that's the attribute you're to express oh man I get excited already and it ain't got started think about it now thank all right so pray for me being born again being born again not of corruptible wait a minute wait it says what to an inheritance in corruptible that's right being not of corruptible so this what my inheritance must be the word of God all right what did I bypass what did you bypass you bypassed one thing that's the word now let me quote your former Pastor I still calling you Pastor I ain't picking on way but brother Dale you wasn't there and went around the word you didn't come that way that what your brother D taught us that's what brother Dell taught you wasn't there no sir you wasn't there that's the difference the Lord Jesus Christ he was an IM morphe word body you was not you was a thought and attributing God Jesus Christ was almighty God and still is a self-same person all the time he didn't bypass it so let me Terence I get too fired up I get too Zach I get excited listen it's something to get excited about when you see the word open you see that word opening it's something to get excited about let me tell you something Jesus Christ didn't come in The Book of Life he was the Lamb's Book he wasn't in no he you didn't have to get him transition from The Book of Life to the Lamb's Book no sir let me tell you we'll finish it up if I get there brother Bob brother brandom said you're the same book same book same person same life same everything when you get this three-fold Revelation when our sry now so we got to be birth somewhere you don't just wake up there one day your birth there same book what he saying um invisible Union greater portion of marriage divorce what did he say what whatever was the old book is gone that book of life you a you can't find your name in that book of life no more brother Dy me you young people let me give you an example I can read in the Bible and I can read it to you how many of have you ever read about Abraham everybody picks on the women many ever read about Sarah laughing God everybody's heard that what about your father Abraham sister Peggy when was m Elohim self-existing God talking to M talking to Abraham said you're going to have a child what Abraham do he didn't stand and laugh like Sarah did he laid on the ground and laughed laid on the ground and laughed then he went down to there the king thought he's going to try to save his own hi brother Gary what'd he do he said take take her she's my sister you can have her now listen don't you do that but let me ask you something something brother Bob read in the Bible show me in the Bible where Sarah and Abraham was ever changed on if he hadn't tried to give her away to the king how would you have ever known it why would a king want a granny when he could had every woman he wanted down there for 25 years why would he want a granny showing you right there in the word Right Between the Lines he'd been there' been changed if he hadn't done it to BR would never seen that's what they speaking of think about it now it's exactly what happened but than look here young people there was Abraham done those things look horrible so you got there's the let's just take it this way there is The Book of Life That's wrote about it but after Calvary when you read the New Testament read Romans 4 said I get down and out and start feeling sorry for myself I said I turned to Romans 4 what happened in Romans 4 Abraham staggered not you can't find when the Holy Ghost started right brother colie they said brother collie did you can't find it written anywhere by the Holy Ghost and he did that you can't find where Abraham ever staggered or fell so you see what I'm saying see what the blood of Jesus Christ will do to a person it has nothing to do with the past it has everything to do with today hey man that's exactly what it is I ain't even got to my scripture being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible that's your inheritance that's what was reserved in heaven see that's the beauty of it God knew like brother B said that word will cross your path he knew what you'd do with it would crossed your path yes sir sure no you didn't have it when you got in this world you come between Satan and Eve is that our Prophet you was born between Satan and Eve Satan's plan if the original word had nothing to do with in the garden it had nothing to do with your birth but it was corruptible but this birth here cuz we're going I'm if I can just stay with my notes and just shut up we're going to find we're going to take we're going to come the right way this time we didn't mom and daddy didn't bring me here right but this birth here is going to bring me here right it's going to bring me back I'll read it here in a minute brother Ram said you can absorb this you can go back brother collie and be born just like you should have been born in the beginning all right so let me tell you something I was finish it up brother Terence you know what brother BR said he said now he brother Bach he didn't just wake up one day and feel this he had birthed I read spoke word Original Seed there's your faith of the fathers there's your faith of the fathers 62 he's faith of the father he he's built it back he's build it back to Holy Spirit he's right there he's standing exactly where Paul stood and what did he say I've got him out on a limb what John say stood the same place brother call he had the baptism Holy Ghost 60 years what' John say all's lost we're just going to go back to Cosmic life all's lost what Paul say we go under Perfection if God permits but God didn't permit it so you got to go on so what happened the Holy Ghost told Brother Bron said pick up your pen Prophet pick up your pen and write amen what did he write The Law of reproduction then what did he get into he said as of yet as of yet Malachi 4 has not been fulfilled all right but I'm here to tell you it's being fulfilled Malachi 4 is being fulfilled all right all right so let me let me get by if Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever amen all right that's what was reserved in heaven for you all right so real quick now Romans 10 how you going to get it verse verse six but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise so righteousness of faith has a voice it can talk oh yeah it speaks here's what it says it says not speaking on it say not in thine heart who shall Ascend into heaven in other words it don't say it's in heaven waiting for me no it ain't that who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall Ascend into the deep that is to bring Christ again from the dead but what saith it what does the righteous of Faith say the word well that's what you bypassed that's what was reserved in heaven for youen is n thee even in thy mouth and in th my heart now it's still you it's still talking to you so you say why my pastor got this it don't matter what your pastor's got if it ain't in you it don't matter what any man don't matter what any man's got if it ain't in you because the gospel of the your salvation comes through the mouth of somebody that's the only way you get it after you hear the gospel of your that's the only way you get it you that's why that's the way man chose all right so but but what sayith the word is neither even in thy mouth in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus shall confess thine heart the god of the raising from the dead Thou shalt be saved now don't take this the wrong way that scripture has deceived more people than any scripture in the Bible in my opinion amen and I don't mean the scriptures deceiving because it's not it's the way it's interpreted to people just call upon the name of the Lord you're saved and live like the devil the rest of the time that ain't what it is it's when the very life of Jesus Christ comes in you and express itself through you oh we got signs and water that's wonderful it ain't over signs and wonders brother colie it's over the word the showdowns over the word all right what is Thou shalt for with the m with the heart man believeth you don't stop you keep believing unto righteousness and with a mouth confession is made to Salvation for the scripture say whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed let me stop skip on down here real quick verse 14 how then shall they call in whom theyve not not believed here was Paul up there met that you not Paul Phillip now he was up there having a good time he at a red hot Revival wasn't he they seeing a lot of wonderful things and people say all these things about brother Brandon you know people leave the message people know what they want to oh he wasn't there you think they have believed Philip been picked up and taken 300 miles down the road I doubt they believed that if they lived back there sister Peggy they wouldn't have believed it but it happened so let me tell you young people something else you say I'm a Christian then you're a fanatic you believe in the fanatical you have to believe in the fanatical you Liv in the days of Noah they said it's never rained you said it's going to rain you Liv in the days of Abraham you say Abraham you're too old to make a baby I'm going to have a baby Sarah you can't have a baby I'll have a baby you have to believe in the fanatical that is close so so now you're living the day he that liveth and believeth in this shall never die well well sister Peggy from the time these babies are born we teach them to scared to death of death time they're able to crawl we're scared we're gonna drop them on their soft spot we're scared we prob putting plugins in the Sid so they won't stick their fingers and from the day we're born we're programmed to be scared to death but now we're trying to be reprogrammed to teach us death has no place here that's what we got to be programmed with the word of God is Incorruptible it's undefiled it sh fadeth not away that's what's being formed in you not in heaven don't believe that your theop is not in heaven your Theo is your soul what listen list not you if somebody sitting here this morning brother and they they never been born again they hear the word of God you know what they're hearing from they theop you know why they're hearing from not it's in heaven it's coming through my mouth what is your theophany it's a word body so what is the birth of the word it's that word somebody speaks God quickens in your heart not in your heart it makes your heart the word there you see you bypass that you bypass that word listen that's why I look like I do that's why I told somebody the other day I don't care to be baldheaded if I went back when I go back but sister pegan I'm 18 year old whatever I won't be 18 I'll be like I was at 18 it won't be no years attached to it I don't care it wouldn't bother me to still be baldheaded but I'll be so glad to get rid of these things I mean that they they you sweat they get all over it you get out there cows is act rain it gets all you it's just a mess they're they aggravation but that's all if that's the worst thing I got in my life I got a good life you know so but you see what I'm saying I I'm sorry I I'm just excited the word of God is something to get excited about I'll get into something here in a minute we got we've got something brothers and sister I'm telling you if we'll come by the word now come by the word all right let me just get going here so you see how shall they call how then shall they call in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher all right I don't believe in a fivefold Ministry that ain't my problem they'll say sister Peggy they'll say brother brandham now listen Matthew 16 what they say Jesus said who do men say I the son of man am so what they say you're one of the prophets that's right was the very god terance of the prophets and they was making him a prophet so the people will say brother bradon's the five-fold ministry let me tell you something don't do that to him right don't make him a a fivefold Ministry Prophet right it sounds spiritual to say those things but that's brother Paul when he met those people up on the road you know what happened he knew right quick they wasn't coming by the word didn't he he knew they hadn't come his way they hadn't come the way he came he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe well he didn't know there'd be such a thing he didn't say he what wonderful brothers no he didn't he said he what he told him what to do and they received it that's the difference most now they received it so what so that's my point about people say brother Brown no sir don't make brother Brown just a fivefold Ministry you're you're you're demeaning his office and I don't mean the five4 ministry is deme don't miss don't misunderstand me but he is a word prophet he don't answer to nobody but God I do he don't he doesn't all right but I'm going to tell you something this ministry down here does something that he couldn't finish and that's unite The Head and the body together we'll get to that if I go it's 12:00 and we Ain even started oh goodness see all right so how shall they preach except they be sent now brother Ram said he said you'll believe John 3:16 what about John 2019 huh he said I challenge you to believe that as if as my father sent me even so send I you and if he sent me here today and I had to come a long way to get here if he sent me here today he sent me here for somebody he had me come for somebody all right so so the word has come for somebody so you you got to be the one that says that's for me I need a new birth I need I need this I need that whatever it is you have need of it's in the word of God that spoke to you today all right so let so what how how can they preach that they be S as it is written how beautiful the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things now remember this cuz we're going to finish with this here in a little while I'm going to try my best to go fast but they have not obeyed the gospel for Isaiah say Lord who ha believed our report that's right so then Faith cometh not comes cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and the word of God Only You can't add the word in a Creed CU that body will not be built in a Creed it will not do it all right so I've got a l L the more scriptures I'll get to but we're just going to try to again so now stay with me okay Adam and Eve we know remember daddy preached that here a few months ago Adam and Eve put us across the chasm but there was a time there I could read the quotes I've got them all here I ain't going to take the time to do it because I'm GNA try to hurry I just get nervous I I can't help that I'm just I used to pick at my daddy and I shouldn't have done that cuz now I'm the same way you know you reap what you s I did Zach I said he'll see this I used to pick at about daddy why do you worry why do you worry you'll understand but I now I'm the same way I don't want to worry you out but I sure want you to get something I sure want you to get something I just want us free see the listen the Holy Ghost the message this Holy Ghost has been bound at the river been bound at the doors of Creeds and dogmas for nearly 2000 years but it's to be loosed by the end time message well listen then what's that mean brother Danny we're first it's loosed us we're listen whether you realize it or not we're in the Jubilee we're in the 70th we're in the final Jubilee it started in 1977 all right so we're in the time of release in other words it says brother Michael it says you know what you don't have to serve that Master no more that don't no body you don't have to serve that no more why Malachi 4 says a son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings that ain't no healing Revival that's righten that's oh see everybody says Malachi 45 and 6 you Mali 4 no sir Malachi 4 it it takes us all the way to the Millennium through the change of the body Moses and Elijah's there the whole thing in Malachi for the fullness of the godhead bodies there all right I'll get to that here in a few minutes if I can get time but the thing about it now see there was a time there was no death no death across the CM there there was in the Garden of Eden they she didn't even have her name Eve her name was Adam she got a name she was living after she did what she did the Lutheran got their name Lutheran after they did what they did Sir the Baptist they got a name but they lost they name the name they lost their husband's name all right so so listen there was a time there death would have never got in there was a word there you that preach that right but see what Eve listen to the reason I'm already wearing myself out just stay with me see we as the Bible says we're grown this is the breach message it shows there something that we're not in our ought to be condition now listen like I said while ago when I was a sinner I wasn't groaning I was having a good time I thought it was I wasn't groaning right but it's after you're born again you s Joanna you start groaning cuz you're look your eye you got an upward pull before you just had a downward pull you didn't know no difference but now you've got an upward pull why the word has come to you all right so now look what happens you're groaning it shows there's something you're not in your right to be State you're not in your right to be conditioned you fall from somewhere now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us we know it was eternal life they fell from amen they lost her claims eternal life Adam and Eve eternal life death in the Garden of Eden brought all nature under them to death the tree died before that animal never died we know that it we cross this Chasm we're beyond the reach of God on the other side of the chasm he goes on talking about how this given free moral agency all right so we I'm I'm just going to preach and not read some of these quotes God here's the power of transformation 65 Birds didn't have to die the wolf and lamb were feeding together sounds like the Millennium doesn't it and the lion the leopard and Ox there was no killing no death no sorrow there was ad them male and female all she had to do is wait for her word husband to bring that word that they hadn't partook of what they was waiting for an oncoming promise she wasn't his wife yet they was an oncoming promise to her if they had waited now their youth was being renewed just that much was keeping their youth renewed but there's a part of that tree they hadn't eat from yet amen that was what going to change them to young people permanently Eternal people amen but they turned that word down that's the word they turned down so let me just paraphrase the save time that word they turned down that book the title deed to the earth now and that book went back to God Amen all right so now they didn't lose their salvation they didn't lose eternal life they failed from our eternal life In the Flesh all right so we know that but now look that book Let's just put this the Lamb's Book went back to God cuz it's a book of names it's the word of God it went back to God the original honor and the title deed all right so what happened for 6,000 years come on here that seed or 4,000 years that seed that Adam turned down that went back to God had no place to land amen where' it land it landed in the womb of a little virgin that said be to me according to Thy word and what did it produce It produced the word It produced a son It produced a Son of God that didn't have to die he didn't have to die sir he died because of one reason you and I were dead I'm in the message now stay with me I'm in the message you like brother Bob said I while ago you can get listen when your birth to where brother brandom was we'll get to it I ain't got I got the quotes here when you're birthed to where brother Brandon was and that's where you have to be birthed to let me tell you where it's at same place Jesus Christ was birth to same place that's where it is you ain't going to die there's a fullness of the godhead bodily anointing on you you're not the fullest of godhead body don't misunderstand me but that anointing that's what left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he couldn't die listen how that anointing talked te this Temple down three days I'll raise it up that's what that you can't take my life I'll give it but you can't take it that's how it talks that's the way a Christian talks they ain't defeated think about it brother they ain't defeated are they they he ra what when enemy comes in like a flood what's he he raises up a standard listen so stay with me now and pray for me so look that went back to God it wound up in the womb of Mary it there was Mary birthed the very word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh Mary had nothing to do with we know that but there was the book there see it was the book he didn't he in the book of life that's when it what it came in after the fall The Book of Life came in after the fall Lamb's Book never had no beginning that Lamb's Book sister Peggy had no beginning of days or end of life he never had no beginning of days or end of life no sir so what happened it brought us all here across the chasm we know that I'm just going so so here we are born across the casine no hope y lost no different Adolf Hitler the only difference that little woman at the well like brother B say that little woman at the well and them far them Pharisees down there that lived a whole lot better life than she did the only one difference between them was what representation of predestination what was it God's forign knowledge knowing what she would do with the word and what they would do with it and when it crossed their path they knew they'd make it above and it blacked their name out that's how important it is young people and old people alike not to turn the word down cuz when you turn that word down that blacks your name your name comes out of the book of life he said most Gentiles names come out you don't want to come out you want to transfer now when brother brand saying transfer brother Bob he's not saying oh it was always in the L's book He's just telling you what you've been born again you're now expressing the Lamb's Book you're now expressing what what you in God all the time all right so now say with me so they were we were born the original word had nothing to do with it but the original word came to the Mary right when that original word he what he started talking l a corn a week die he abide alone all right so he ain't going to abide alone because the promise go God predestinated the world of Sons and Daughters of God that's what he predestinated that's the whole plan and purpose that's what Adam and Eve turned that down here come the Lord Jesus what to bring that into fruition all right so then he had the his ministry that's son of man Ministry brother said you got to understand those names yes you do you got to understand them you got to place them right he was son of man amen that was his Earthly Ministry God that was the prophet that's the word made flesh there he was when he died he raised ascended came back for 50 days later in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Son of God through SE y'all know this I'm just I got to keep going through Seven Ages Son of God through Seven Ages all right but there's a brother said then son of David but he said in there there's a conjunction there's a conjunction in there between Son of God and Son of David so let me tell you there's a Grace to be brought to you and I to at the revelation of Jesus Christ there is the conjunction all right so look what happens so there that conjunction is son of man again there's your Alpha Ministry in the beginning the Lord Jesus Christ son of man Ministry not just in brother Bram I'll get to it here in a little bit not just in he said it's these sons of men that anointing is upon these sons of men to bring the very same Ministry it's the ministry of Jesus Christ himself if you don't have that brothers and sisters and I don't have that we're lost we're lost there's no there because that's the only out that's what it is I'll show you I'm going to hurry here all right so so we're across the chasm and brother brandham but everybody like brother B said everybody likes to take the quotes you always was eternal all these things brother BR never spoke those things until what after the seals were open so stay with me now and you young people you so I can't they talk about Seven Seals they talk about sister Anna back there God love her I ain't pick I ain't going to embarrass you but people in young and old let me show you something let let's turn real quick let me turn let's go to 1 Corinthians 13 you young people see it haunts me I ain't lying to you I went to church with a lot of kids and I grew up and a lot of them don't follow it haunts me brother collie the kids I went to school with now my age or church with just off that halts me that bothers me to know in amen why I want them to know what I I want them to see what I see that bothers me so you young people I want you to understand one thing you somebody some preacher tells you you don't have to understand this message you just believe it you tell them you say you call Steven Wilson I'll talk to them I ain't being mean or boastful I ain't being I'll talk to him and love brother col but let me tell you something as a when I was a child We Believe Paul you know what I did I understood as a child is that right a newborn baby in Christ you know what's going to happen to you cuz I know how I come you see one God brother ter said don't matter where you read you know what you read one God you girls first when you first God reveals to you don't cut your hair don't do this don't you know what happens you start reading who that's my glory why why it's yours it's yours he's give it to you see that's what the Revelation is it's yours so don't let anybody tell you you don't have to understand you're too young you're not too young the Holy Ghost is the revealer of the word it's not you you're never too young or too old to understand God as long as he's the one doing the revealing see what's wrong is we want the people to be educated in it ever learning we don't need to be ever learning we need to be ever receiving Revelation long for God long for god let's don't forget Revelation cuz that's the only thing that Revelation is going to take you out of here so you young people says I just they get into second pool third one we're going to get into something here in a minute that pool third pool whatever let me tell you something how many young people here knows what two plus two is don't be afraid to raise your hand there was a time you didn't but you kept going to school sir now if I walked in you know my daughters are older now but if I walked in the house and they still had a pacifier in their mouth at 26 years old and they still in the third grade I'd be worried brother colie I'd be worried about them Paul says what he come to give us skill Daniel said he come to give us skill and understanding the Holy Ghost came to the same reason get the new birth and you'll get an understanding I promise you that God will reveal himself to you but what happens you understand two plus two is four that's a silly Inc carnal but it's help you understand two plus two is four well then all of a sudden brother Donnie this teacher says you know what we're going to do today we're going to add a little bit to that what's two plus two plus two well then you start scrap well getting your fingers and toes out well that's six well then the next year you're going to go they're going to move you up a grade they're GNA say what's two time three you know what that is that's the same thing as two plus 2 plus two so get the foundation the foundation was two plus two if you don't get the foundation right I guarantee you ain't going to get the multiplication or division anything else right so that my point is this get the new birth and get into the word listen to the word get into the word cuz when you hear something wrong there has to be one inside of you that let you know that ain't right that's what you have to have you got to have the one let me tell you brother Brandon sit in his room I'm just going ahead and get this and get it over with brother Brandon sitting there in his room he said as yet Malachi 4 ain't been fulfilled right he's sitting there in his room on that first seal Y come on he said I would have made not a mistake a horrible mistake if he had not come in the room now he didn't come through the door he was in him so the one inside him already knew what he was going to reveal he just hadn't revealed it yet so the one inside you already knows everything he knows what you have need of he knows when the time to reveal it he knows when they hear you hear he's waiting in you brother Bob for somebody to bring you in that word so he can reveal it to you so brother man said I have made a horrible mistake but he came in the room and straight he was going on Old notes and things youall know so let me tell you something I ain't read it yet but I will in a few minutes Ephesians 1: 15 is the only place you can stand it's your Prophet not Stephen that's right the only place you can stand and not be deceived in this hour and that's the adoption of children by Jesus Christ that's the only place you can stand now I believe personally those seals was brother bram's adoption that's what I believe he wasn't adop there he was standing there just like Paul faith of fathers absolutely don't I hate to say this especially people see they already think I'm crazy I'm not saying brother Brandon was deceived or don't take it that way it hadn't open to him and why wouldn't that Holy Ghost sister Peggy let him wouldn't let him preach that wrong no you know why it wasn't in the book it's got to be in the book that's why you can't add or take away not in this day it wasn't in the book so what happened he opened it he said this is my so here he walked to the platform at night brother Ryan he looked just like he did the week before month before year before 6,000 years before brother Terence there's a man the Garden of Eden they said I've got a book I've got the title deed of the earth now let me tell you here brother Brandon Walks to that platform and he walks around and he looks at him he says here stands here stands a lamb with a book in his hand there is the same book brother here's what we don't realize there was the same book that Adam had there's the book that's going to bring you and I to a change of a body there's the book of eternal life there's the title de let me tell you this here's what I believe brother Brandon could have took the world over over he could have took the world over but it wasn't wrot of him let me read something to you God won't change you people say oh God I don't argue over I don't believe in arguing don't Mis understand people say I'm not gonna pick over Doctrine because I want us all to be there let me tell you something you're going to be right by the word you ain't going to be there not in this day time we God don't waken our ignorance just that sounds spiritual and sweet but it ain't no good that's right brother Michael that ain't no good you're going to be right by the word right cuz that's what you bypass you're ordained for this day now I'm talking about the brother B this the attribute for this day we get all right let me read something to you just to show you something what I'm talking about amen God don't change his mind if he's going to change it for anybody he changed it for brother brandom there he was God didn't change his mind then he said no Prophet no now here he is this is recognizes your damn message you can read it I think goes back to 57 you can look it up and read it brother brandham was going to Israel they sent a million Bibles over there they said brother brandham if you'll go they'll brother Danny they'll see that Messiah sign they'll see that Prophet they'll believe you you'll convert a million Jews sounds good don't it all right listen to what brother Ram said he said it's the king's message that's recognize it friends he said you remember me he said he gathered Israel in three days third day he said those two prophets two Hebrew prophets they'll recognize see now brother you read what brother R talks about each time you can see how his understanding goes up because the 70 weeks of things had been revealed to him been open he said you remember me standing in Cairo to go up there when Levi Louis pis and said brother brand if they ever see that they believe they're prophets I said it's a good thing for me see how man is now here's a prophet but see the grace of God Amen no most people refuse the grace of God because they want they won't say you know especially get up and tell it but the gra see the grace of God I said I'll read this New Testament they read it Louis sent them over a million over brother Louis P from Sweden about modern he said there it's not that modern bunch of Jews but in their homand and come down if that be the Messiah let us see the sign of we'll believe it Lou said brother brand There's an opportunity There's an opportunity someone told me that it would be an opportunity I got I got a ride and ride on down there some come over to me said brother Argan BR said brother brand that would just alarm Israel bring them out before it show them sign for they'll believe it I said Lord Here I Am Ready jumped on the plane took the money got me a ticket stop the Cairo yeah I'm ready is God going to change his mind and send him on no this is Brother brand y'all that's right I'm ready Holy Spirit said this is not your place he ain't going to change his mind for nobody is he this ain't your place this is not your time G get you get ahead of yourself I thought oh my I come way over here I'm going to go something says stop right here don't you go that way turn out into India so Sean I see God won't change his mind for nobody or nothing all right so let me show you there stood brother Brown that first seal he said here stands a lamb all right I've done we had that lamb there's the book Adam had Amen brother said I'm an abstract title deed holder amen listen we we'd love to talk about Adam had it yeah but it's bad people Amen brother Bram had it now brother Bram was stand in the place he could have went in a Rapture he had rapturing faith you'll never convince if he didn't you and I never get it but only reason he did not go in the change of the body he come to forun he come for one reason that was the forun the Lord Jesus he said who can convince me of sin brother said wait till that church comes to that same position show me where I disbel the word so there was brother brand same place stay with me here and when he's preaching Christ the mystery I'm going to hurry cuz I'm going to cut a lot of it out and I'm just save time when he's preaching Christ the mystery we all understand and know he's preaching the seventh seal yes is he's preaching the third pull amen that's what he's preaching amen the third pull is the Finish it's over amen it comes a place the third pool it's to the totally lost it's to the toally lost but it's for the bride it's to the totally lost so it was over brother Brandon was preaching he based it on the entire Bible and he said you'll see this morning why I've said what I've said all the years of the time all my Ministry it's the third pull amen it's the seventh seal Amen in other words God had what incarnated himself in that Prophet when he started to read the message read spoken words Original Seed read Christ the mystery you want to get some I mean it'll help you too you better have some time cuz they're long but they're good live in them live in them look what happens that first that message he starts telling he said what you'll see here what's happened see God had changed this one I'm not saying brother R is almighty God but God had he said when that Holy Spirit Holy Ghost that's Among Us Now becomes incarnate to us in the person of Jesus Christ will'll crown him King of Kings now that's not 63 that's right here now we crown him king of hings here so that word has to become incarnate to us not just to the two prophets in Israel because the spirit of Elijah comes off the Gentile bride and goes there all right out of Zion comes the deliverer all right so now look he's preaching the third pull amen why he's preaching yes sir Now list what happens you want to talk about Grace I just read about it sister Joan you want to talk about Grace here's the end of the message page 87 in the book everything's manifested in Christ God the church everything else is manifested in Christ the Bible is Christ see you're the you got to be the full revelation of the entire thing right all right yes sir now listen he's preached the third pull not knowing Here Comes Your Grace if you don't have this we was gone amen I wasn't even born we had no way out but God not knowing of course being spiritual you want spiritual things beginning of this message he said I'm not even going to look at the clock I'm not going to notice the clock he's he's talking about what what had happened in his ministry how this would happened but he immediately went to the scriptures there of of Jesus on the road to mess you know what it was they didn't know who he was there you go he went right here in the beginning not Colossians one he went first on the scripture the road the mass why he was telling the people you don't know who's here you don't know what's among you God had changed his form he changed his language you know what had happened he said by the washing of the water of the word you never did do it if you won't stand in the water and be washed you're just as filthy as Eve ever was spotted as Eve ever was you know what else he said I said it while ago you go go back and be born just like you should have been born at the beginning what did he say brother collie he said I ain't no longer the son of Charles and Ella Brandon now he wasn't denying who he was what was he doing he telling you he would been birthed back you know where he was at sister Joanna you know this you heard it you know where he was at he was standing just like he' never left the Garden of Eden he was standing right there brother colie like he never left the Garden of Eden that's where you and I are birth to we got to be birthed there by Revelation before we go there you have to say it that's my point to you young people you have to say it you have to say your you have to say your salvation the word of faith you have to speak it you'll have to speak the same thing down here Jesus said raise it brother Brandon said sitting there thinking on Mark see that's what happens my mind goes so many places Mark 11 Mark 11 he said I sitting there thinking on that here's another reason God won't change his mind about his word your word if it's word God's word don't matter whose mouth it comes out of if it's God speaking is Goden listen here brother BR sitting there brother Ryan he said think about Mark 11 he said why am i t some squirrels well speaking Prophet how many you want I want three what'd he do all of a sudden out where there was no squirrel where there's nothing there appeared a beautiful squirrel brother what'd he do he shot the squirrel what did he do though he went and got the squirrel said I'm going home now did he not but what' God do God said wait a minute Prophet you said three God don't change his mind he had to get three because why God said three all right so you so this when you speak it expect it cuz we got to speak it but it's got to be revealed first God first does it then he reveals it then he makes it manifest see he's done it people all not knowing this but if you'll turn and look at the clock he wasn't look at it but he looked at it it's on the dot two o'clock we've heard this for 50 years but all of a sudden about three years ago old sister Joanna it just come illuminated in it it just lit up something changed this thing changed brothers and sisters it's went to a it I tell it's in a different hemisphere brother collie not knowing this it's on the dot 2 o00 the end of the second pool wait a minute Prophet you preached the third not knowing this he didn't know it but God knew it God know it in the second pool the third pool is at hand right now Jesus's second pull what it do it got him crucified but what was his second pull I am my father's one tear this Temple down so if God had not stepped in right there it was over the third pull was there it was over but he said Prophet prophesy prophesy amen so what happened then brother Bob all the years of his ministry the seals and there there is a second pull there's the seed talk about an attribute talk about a true genan seed there's the genan seed there's the seed that Adam and Eve I'll read it right here in Christ the mystery let me just read it he told us let me find it here and in there talking about Malachi 4 when the current's flowing through the word of God expresses the works I do you'll do also but in the last days it will come to pass behold I send you Elijah the prophet he'll turn the heart of the children back to the faith of the fathers but see faith of the fathers just gets us out on a limb it we got to get there you got to be birth there you don't you know birth you are here your there's your birth you all know this your birth here you add to your birth you add to your faith it's all Faith right here Holy Spirit that's us neck amen that's who's going to join us see just call Paul down here you don't put Faith the father's down here Paul had Faith the fathers but Paul's up here it's a symbol amen that's what it is anyway he express it and there are some there would come a time for he Express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church had a PRI Church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people amen all right so well we can't do that no I know I'm glad you said that I know you can't that's right we'll read in Malachi 4 in a minute you know who does it in the day that I do this sayth the Lord and ain't you and I doing it we've already got in the mess but he's here to what breaking out the mess we came in so I ain't worried about it I'm going to let him do it all right oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by what right accepting what Eve turned down well that's what Mary accepted what did it produce you say well we can't he was born different he was come on buddy but this new birth is not different this new birth I'm talking about it's the word of God because see people say oh you're trying to get somewhere you can't get to you can't but he brings you there it's the washing of the water of the word brings you to the same place he was at cuz God only has one kind of son and every Son's after that kind don't now listen e that first Eve brother she fell on Hebrews 138 amen she fell on Jesus Christ the same yest stand forever so don't make me another person don't make me something else don't make yourself something else cuz you're following the same she did that's right you're saying the new birth different don't get quiet on me cuz it's not CU that's what brother Braham taught us you're back to where you should have been if You' have came in the right way in the beginning sir if you have came right in the beginning would you have ever died if sin hadn't got in turns you and I wouldn't be this old sin would have never got in so then if the word has come back to birth us back to that isn't any difference than what was in the beginning I thought he was reserved in for you I thought it was Incorruptible I thought it was undefiled that's right brother Michael that's the truth so don't don't deny it don't be afraid of it that's what God has sent it to you for that's the truth except to what anointed by what except what Eve turned down in Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is his see the anointed word eve turned down he comes back and we accept s other place here i' got it wrote down what's he do here's the here it is he said he promised the word would be here and here it is so what happened there stay with me now I'm gonna hit these notes here I've got all this but I ain't gonna get to it look what he says a Malachi four child is a fanatical child amen come on bu all right they're a fanatical child people says you're you're a fanatic Wilson that's what I amen I believe in the Supernatural I believe in a God that can change a heart I believe in a God that can change a man or One A boy I believe in a God that can reveal his word all right so I believe he has to birth us back I'll get to it here in a minute I promise you amen believes things are impossible it believes they'll never die amen think about it now see the second pull of Jesus was prophecy turn it down and I'll raise it so there's the seed there's the seed brother Brandon brought us well God said wait a minute Propet second pull let's put that Gene let's put that seed in them they've got to have that seed to be birthed back just like you was birth that's what it was brother and sister whether we want to believe it or not see the second pull so I you young people when I say second pull what that is that's prophecy that's the word so if I tell brother Michael brother Michael I'll be at your house tomorrow I'm speaking of something that happen when I show up tomorrow there is the manifestation of it that's that's what Jesus said tear this Temple down in 3 days I'll raise it what did he do he expressed what he said it went back for him so I see that so when you read where the third pull goes back for it there it does what's it do it goes back to the prophecy the word the seed that you've received it expresses it because you can't express it only God can do it all right is that I hope that makes sense I want to make it so simple you it is yes cuz it's revealed in simplicity so everybody wants to be go forget that stuff just get the word you know that's what it's all about we don't need that second pull all right no man spoke like him ain't never been a man speak like that man TI it down all rais it now there have been a lot of people raised from the dead even the Old Testament they throw the bones on the dead person on the bones of el they come back alive lot of things a lot of other people raised De Jesus raised a lot of people from the dead but nobody ever raised thems from the dead all right so now here was a man said I will die but I don't need I don't need Mama to come by and pray for me I don't need nobody no priest or my he here was a man said I will die I'll lay my life down and I'll raise it up myself all right so no man spoke like that man and let me tell you something else brothers and sisters that's who lives in you today the very glory of God that us rise and shine upon thee that's what lives in you today think about it now greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world what are we afraid of Hallelujah I mean I tell you what I will raise no man spoke like him then here come a man called William brandom then old man spoke like that man here he was saying things you can go back and be born just like you should have been born in the beginning what do you mean I come here across the C when you're saying I can be born right you're now then after that he starts saying you ain't the son of Charles Ella brandom you wasn't born on no certain day see he's in the very positive God's mind he had been B now he wasn't telling you something to learn he was telling you his experience through Redemption see that's what brother BR was preaching see we we have made it educational we've learned about it brother ter we can teach the new birth we just we can teach it I don't want to teach it I want you to experience it see brother Brandon was preaching us his experience and he had been birthed There Brother Gary he had been birthed back to there like he should so he was standing just like he was in the Garden of Eden that's why but he you know what he wanted to see he said I want to live to see it he wanted to see you live see you and I to get that let me find this right here get ready for that so look brother R look at his second pool prophecy that's what he started speaking that's right that second pull telling you who you were right now just because he told you that that don't make you that you got to be birthed there through the watching of the water of the word that's exactly what it all is see Paul all spoke in part I ain't got time to read those scriptures brother Brandon went into Perfection y Paul didn't go into Perfection brother Brandon went into Perfection Paul did not brother Brandon brought the full plan of Redemption Jesus Christ showed the entire Plan of Redemption went through the whole Plan of Redemption even through the change of the body he did brother Brandon went through the entire Plan of Redemption through Revelation he just didn't come to what the third stage of adoption which is the change because he couldn't where he was at just like I read he couldn't because of where he came in the scriptures that's the only reason all right so but look same seed Mary received is the same seed you're birth with amen that's right so you get the same B birth and stand the same place he stood the way you came had nothing to do with it cuz it was reserved it didn't corrupt it's still the same seed it's going to do the same thing that done if You' received in the first in the Garden of Eden brother Michael it's because you came wrong he got nothing to do with it it makes him a redeemer see it makes him everything it expresses him see everybody say brother B somebody says praise God I always was you know what they're doing they're not allowing God to express his attribute they don't realize it it sounds spiritual and they wonderful but it's not the truth God let it happen he didn't make it happen he let it happen so what he can express his attribute so what he's a redeemer you know who makes him a redeemer you and I make him a redeemer because why we come to full Redemption so there's his full expression as a redeemer expressed and you and I sister Joyce why I tell you what I'd like to throw these things sometimes they just getting the way but see what but see we we express the full Plan of Redemption oh my I got to hurry I'm sorry I got a long drive y'all don't so we're all right see brother see look here same birth stand the same place he stood brother Brandon took the place of God in marriage and divorce the fir look here the first man that had the book you know what he did he said that's a cow he said that's a horse he said that's a dog and you know what nobody's been a to change it s it's still a cat dog horse whatever it is whatever that son said that's what it was there's that Prophet up there on the mountain talking to God out there and that that Pillar of Fire going up and down people's watching what was he doing why there's no hope people sitting there being married three and four and five times and everything else all messed up what happened brother BR said there a mess here's what I believe and I ain't making a doctor out of this what do you you say Prophet what do you say what do you say prophet and what brother Rand say by the opening of The Seven Cals I can say this amen by the why see what those seals do it goes why it takes you back to the beginning if Jesus had he couldn't have done that but one scripture they come to Jesus and they about Moses and and divorce Jesus what would he say brother boy he know he'd say it wasn't so from the beginning so there was a man that was back before the beginning there he was so see what we've got we got something to it that what that God has brought you and I that's from the Garden of Eden to take us back there I got a whole goodness back in the garden you never see you're back in the garden never done it you came the same way you don't by Pastor theoy down here you bypass the word the first time but this time you don't bypass it it's being see that's what's going to change you the one inside you let me tell you what it is I'll just read the last little quote right here brother Bob was reading there a while ago well I thought I had it yeah they asked brother man what's the change he said it's the word in you he said it builds another person in the image of the person you are so it's not another person it's you it's who you are so potentially so potentially it's in here what is it the word promised from the the foundation of the world where's it at it's being formed in you this only reflects the negative that reflects the positive the word the same thing translation of the Bri be the same word same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word the same thing did with Sarah this body cannot do it so it have to be changed same way to receive that son the word in you what's going to do it all right so that's why it's so important let me hurry here there stood a lamb with a book in his hand the original honor back on Earth amen back on Earth and he brought it to you and I in a prophecy seed form that you and I can what be a part be expressed out of that book we got to have the same book same title deed it's time to get the squatters off see this Earth out here don't listen you all don't misunderstand this Earth don't belong to the Mexican people it don't belong to the black people it don't belong to the white people it belongs to the new race it belongs to the new race it ain't some old race it's the new race that's who it belongs to God's race he didn't put people in men and women in heaven he put them on Earth that's where we're going to live don't look to go to heaven look to look to bring Heaven here that's exactly right that second pull prophecy brings us to the same place in the word a redeemed son or daughter of God back in Eden like you never left it exactly where it brings you all right now listen I want to read something right here Janice we got to go let's listen now the truth praise brother Brown said praise God for the open those seven I thank you for letting me come preach thank you I love you brother I love you brother K ain't nobody wants to hear you you know and I but here you get down out but I ain't got nothing to do with it God sends a man he goes in a man that's exactly right you know listen me and Daddy was talking the other day right I do I'll get down and out and aggravated whatever I'm just a baby but you think sis we don't know what that Prophet went through you think you get rejected and get down out sister Peggy we don't know what that Prophet went through the way people treated him and done him but you know what Billy Paul said he said you never did know who his enemies was right never knew who his enemies was I tell you where Billy put up our place here several years ago he told us he told that story heard it yall May I'm tell you this just this get me quit brother Brandon had a little child y'all heard it come across the platform didn't have no eyeballs no eyeballs and there she come across brother Billy said brother brandom got her with the hand looked at her and started talking to her said he started praying praying for her her mama's there with her say she's praying for said all of a sudden while brother Brandon was playing brother Michael said all of a sudden in her ey saw it started spinning say there something spinning going said all of a sudden though brother Ram just stopped and said honey I forgot to ask you something she looked up and she said what he said what color eyes you want think about it now think about it brother whatever she said that's the way it was think about it now that's what God's bringing us back to showing us see showing us what the word of God will do anything oh listen now thank God praise God for open these seals my prayer to know these things now the real true revelation of me cazic comes into view what he was God the word and he became flesh yes he had to be no one else is immortal like him no but I see I had a father mother you did too Jesus had father and mother but this man had no father and mother Jesus had a time he started this man didn't this man could th Jesus gave his life this man couldn't because he was life amen and it's the selfs same man all the time so I can show you in the message one place brother R say that he said that was not Jesus talking to mecad or Abraham that was me that weren't Jesus it wasn't cuz Jesus hadn't been born yet but then he'll turn right around two weeks later and say brother Ryan that was Jesus can you go with me there that's what he'll say why he's a self-same person the flesh had nothing to do with it so that's what your new birth is this flesh what it used to be brother col it ain't what it used to be why it's coming to something so now let me show you this real quick me I got it printed over here I'm sorry let me get this right here this milk kesic the difference between you and him now think about this the difference between him and you as a son not your first birth right amen right brother not your first birth your first birth had nothing to do with it you came Satan's plan lost with the world but what through his act through his thoughts through his for knowledge he knew what you do and that word crossed your path you he didn't let be put this way like brother R said in the future home he didn't wait till you got down here to see what you choose he chose you before the foundation of the world but he didn't just choose you because he's going to make brother Michael serve him he knew brother Michael would serve him said he knew I'd love him he knew I'd love him he knew I'd serve him he listen I believe in free moral agency yes sir you're looking at one man believes in free moral agency God cuz why in other words if not God is not a redeemer there no way he's a respector person listen he he see you say see he was at the beginning the word and a morphe body amen he came and lived in that person that's who meaz make and the person of meaz later you heard no more of me cazic because he became Jesus Christ selfsame person all the time just changing his form so don't tell me when he changes his form to me I'm another person don't tell me when Ryan that that word becomes incarnate brother Ryan he's another person he may look like the same little brother Ryan that comes up here and real softspoken he don't change a bit but it's a selfs same person all the time that's what that birth does because b c was the priest but he became Jesus Christ you bypass that because in that form he know see you bypass that but as a sign down here you don't bypass it all right I promise I'm stopping two things when I'm going to stop cuz I believe the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints what I'm talking about is perfection that's the Garden of Eden the only way to get there is through the fivefold ministry for the perfecting where you're not tossed to and fro everywh in the doctor as a child you're unskillful as a child I'm not talking about an age I'm talking about as a newborn baby Christ you got to be taught and brought up because the five-fold ministry is not taught in this day brought in this day for repentance don't misunderstand me it brings you it's for Perfection we've come for Perfection that's what it's for and it happens so here's what happened we just read that while ago Malachi 4 behold the day cometh and we're facing it right now yes sir all the actors are here amen all the actors are on the Earth right now all the proud ye all that do wickedly shall be stubbled the day that cometh shall burn them say the Lord of host and it shall leave them neither root nor Branch see we're fate s of Destruction we don't get messed up it's bride don't get twisted up down here the church does but not the bride this bride down here she don't have no spot rink or blemish about her why she is him sister Peggy she is him he's become her and she's become him but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing in his wing that's a change of the body you shall go forth and grow the C star ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be Ash of the souls your feet the day thou shal do this our's the Millennium our's a Malachi four child ter was Malachi four child well then you better come through this that's where it's at Remember You The Law of Moses my servant when I came out in wh for all Israel statutes and judgment behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet for the coming of great careful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children that's John the Baptist all right it's all in Malachi for the fullness of the godheads right in there and the Heart of the children of their father lest th come and smite the Earth with a curse so let I should have read it this way brother Bob because here's the way I've heard it read a lot over the years behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming in great and Dreadful day of the Lord lest I smite the Earth with a curse but that ain't right it it's up to you that's right what did he do back in the Garden of Eden when the book went back what' he do he smoked the Earth with a curse he didn't smile he didn't curse Adam and Eve that's right he smoked the Earth with a curse same books back you turn that brother Danny you turn that book down the Earth's cursed it's up to you and I brother Brand's done his part he brought the seed now that five-fold ministry's got it to bring it all right therefore my people I'm stopping let's stand I promise let's stand ver Isaiah 52 therefore my people shall know my name right amen therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that does speak behold it is I yes how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that's what we read while ago wasn't it Romans 10 bring Good Tidings that publishes peace and bringeth Good Tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto Zion thy God reth Amen thy watch men come on y not watch man watch men amen now here's where it gets tight thy Watchmen shall lift up the voice one voice right with the voice together they sing amen for they shall see amen ey eye amen eye to eye not toss to and fro Amen brother R I got the quot L here brother R said we're coming to the completion of the word we're in the hour of the completion of the word brother Ryan we're down here in the time now sister Peggy Amen brother BR said he said he didn't say I give I didn't give I give all he didn't say that Terence he don't say I'll give you he said I give some Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers he didn't give all brother Brandon talking about the change he said there'll be some that won't go by the grave there'll be some that'll be changed you know who they are the ones that the fivefold the ones that have taken the word through that ministry that's the son so what that that fivefold Ministry they'll see ey eye there's no contradictions in the word there's no Contra if you don't believe it read brother I ain't going to take the time to do it read brother he said what what watch what happens when that bride yes is in harmony when that group gets together sir Christ the mystery and Harmony of the Revelation not of the intellectual the Revelation not the knowledge of the Revelation but Harmony of the Revelation he said what he said the bride would recognize her position he said that's when the Rapture will go what's our position right here our position's right here we're not the shoulder we're not the head we're not the thigh we're the neck we're the uniting time God bless you I got shut up or I'll be here all day thank you [Applause] again [Music] hallu I want y'all to stop just a minute stop playing don't leave there's a kid one time oh some 40 years ago I guess he come driving up to a church in Tennessee he wasn't in very good shape smell kind of funny that same boy got in a car had a horrible wreck about bit his tongue into Satan was trying to stop that tongue you heard today but God said no no I'm just going to teach him a lesson right my dad yeah your dad tell them you don't have special the Dale family is to us yes come having a high school cafeteria I'd been to a football game I was young and done embarassed to say it way come up to me he said you might want to leave he had my back said you might want to leave yeah but I just young and done I got in that wreck at night you know one thing I say and I brag on my dad he didn't most people brother Bob and their kids get in trouble it's always the other people's kids are the problem you know he got the wrong crowd my dad stood in the pill pit the very next Sunday and he told him he said my son was the wrong crowd right he didn't get with the wrong crowd he was the wrong crowd at 11:30 that night I hit a telephone pole head on I can still see it just like it was last night thing right there when I'm telling you brother and sister you young people when it's on you it's on you right there's nothing you can do about it so don't get if you don't have your heart if your heart's not and God now get in it yes amen you know that's right that PS on me the very minute I was wrecking something woke daddy up and said pray for Stephen the very same minute and I've never told nobody this way you said it right there God showed me later cuz it bit my tongue all the way into two I had one little piece where had SW all the way on that's right God showed me L I've never said that said I've never said that's the truth what he just said God showed me that yeah Satan tried to stop it my dad went off an embankment 70 something feet should have killed him that was his because his appointment with death was right there right right right but it's men every men have appointment with death not man yeah if it said man that means we all have to die but it says men not all men will die just that's right God bless you amen you are wonderful people we all kind of we all grew up together so we've known each other we pretty much know our ins and outs and and all our stuff but he didn't tell you one story you remember what happened this weekend with the I'm going to tell that what happened this weekend with the storms and the um I mean where he lived up there the bridges got wiped out people got wiped out uh if you saw on the news where they were extracting those people off of the top of that hospital that was only where they were Landing was right in front of his daddy's house right down below it if you've ever been there it's right where the old track used to be that was close and everything in the world Steven said he said everything in the world was going wrong to get down here had some trees fall overs a fence got cows let me tell you how God works he was almost ready to call me and say he wasn't coming and then the devil wasn't finished he goes down to the barn to crank his tractor he has a little friend there to help him and they can't get the tractor started so Steven's going to get a go and get a battery walking back home he said Lord if you don't want me to go he said don't start that tractor pretty much if you don't want me to go all this has happened all this is going on they went down there and tried him and his friend tried to crank that tractor he said when he got home to do all that he said he turned around and looked and there was a man down in the barn doing this got we don't believe in a supernatural you've missed it somewhere this was appointed of God this was a load I'm going to tell you something and this is no um a disrespect to to Steven we call each other by the first we we're family we a brother we're family I'm sorry but uh you just heard today you just heard for those of you that don't know my dad and never heard him preach you just heard my dad for the last 50 years all in one sermon but it was in a different way that he brought it that you can understand it now and his dad same way it's what you heard and let me tell you something else this is the precursor to what you're going to hear when we get started on Malachi 4 cuz we're right at the last Church age we right at the last time I told you we're going to talk about brother br's Ministry well right there he told you the whole thing right there that was powerful if you didn't understand it then then you got to pray to God God's the only one who can help you understand it but it was a truth and that was the most positive sermon I've ever heard him preach and he was very comfortable he wasn't at first but he got comfortable but we appreciate brother Steven he has absolutely got a Ministry that that and I'll promise you he couldn't preach that at other places for those of you that know he can no he can pre he can only preach that here that we can understand it and at his church right that's why that's why our ministers Don't Preach a whole lot and I ain't saying nothing that's just I'm just giving God all the all the glory for it for the foundation we have with brother Dale and brother Richard Wilson all these years being together and being feeding off each other and feeding off the word of God and and I feel proud that that Steven didn't get his tongue ripped out of his out of his mouth Satan was trying to stop him I was thinking that when I sitting right that all come back to my memory when you were sitting I thought man he shouldn't even be up here talking his tongue was gone but the doctors put it back together and I think that was God's tongue that talked to us today I don't think that was D Wilson so let's give our brother a good hand listen we're in the closing of time everything that's happening is not happening it's happening for a purpose every step is happening for a purpose everything everything that's going on all the preachers that we have come in all the ministry that's been that's been ministered here and all the ministers that go out and Minister other places it's all coming down as brother Steven said is coming down to we got to all be right on they can't be 15 different doctrines come on no you said oh you got your way and you got my way even brother Ram said well he's coming on a horse or or or or a cloud he said it don't matter but that was with him that was with him he was talking to denominational people ain't talking to denominational people now we got to get this thing down right and you know what I don't know if y'all ever heard this before but God don't make a mistake God never I say it every service God never changes his mind he's always right he puts people in when he wants to put them in he takes them out where he wants to take them out sir cuz God is is in control of this whole thing and I appreciate brother Steven I appreciate you coming and and pouring your heart out to us we sure do appreciate you and we sure will uh have you back and that's another story yeah that's another story he would have been preaching in jeans and a t-shirt he forgot his clothes so he had to go buy he had to go buy that suit last night but uh see the devil he just tries to he's a trip uper he just tries to make thing go Haywire but guess what I think we heard from God today amen and God made sure that but that's what he said you know he said God if I'm not supposed to go don't let that tractor sorry but if I'm supposed to go let that thing and he said that guy was out there going we got it started we got it start he said we tried and tried and tried for for more than a minute long time try to get that thing started cuz maybe the battery is dead or something but we serve a good God Amen and if you have a need let's sing a song real quick well not real quick we're not going anywhere but they got to go home but let's sing how great God

ready to get on an airplane here pretty quick and get back home and uh um but we were at a men's meeting and um we were sitting around talking about something and then later on the minister he read acts 238 now how many times have we read acts 238 a lot a lot of times right yes amen and one day it was revealed to you what that said amen billions of people read acts 238 and and don't even they don't even consider it old brother Tatum he told us one time when he was a Baptist you know they believed in Father Son and Holy Ghost baptism which is false we know that but brother Tatum he said I'd read that where John you know where in Matthew where Jesus said that he said when I get to Acts 2 he said I just flip right through the pages kind of skip over it well listen you can't skip over the word of God you might can but he's going to bring you back to it every time and I sat there and almost weeped and acts 238 if you really see that and you read it that God revealed that to you and he didn't reveal it to the whole world he only revealed that to you brother Ryan cuz you won't see it unless you do see it because of the 8 billion people in this world probably seven or eight Bill almost 8 billion people they baptize the name Father Son and Holy Ghost that's the common way to do it that's the most popular way to do it but it ain't the right way to do it you got to take on a name if you didn't realize your name today I adure you in the name of the Lord find your name in that book cuz remember that book is in the hand of the lamb and if you're not of the Lamb you're not in that book you're in that book of life that's going to be judged at the end of time but not not the bride not the Lamb's Book not that Eternal part that genesis: 126 when he said that that was all of us that was all of his children he's ever going to have that's at Genesis 126 man and that was what was in that book that's really what that book was was God spoke and said I'm going to have a group of people that's going to be my children and they couldn't fulfill it so he took all that back and hold on held on to it until Jesus came with the book inside of of him it's a secret it's a secret catching away like brother Steven said you know you look at brother Ryan and you look all people grow they just that's just brother Ryan no that's a son and daughter of God coming to a headship that's never been before never been before the head's never connected to the body until this day there's never been a day can we sing that song there's never been a day like this day you can find it we'll sing that one song and then we'll be [Music] this you believe that like this day to me there has never a day like this day do you see it do you see that we're in a Time the time of catching the [Applause] way who is that light sh for me you so bright as this day this glor of sing it to him oh that has never been a [Applause] day like this day to me there has never been a day like this day I see there never a that sh so this this glor there's never been a day I told the church the other day brother stepen I said the Lord kind of impressed don't me that I'm start I'm going to start writing down all the scriptures that that I mean fulfilled at the end time man you got to start with Genesis 126 cuz you got to start with Perfection on that side then you got to come down to all the different places where it says at the end Daniel seal this up till the time of the end well if it's down here in the time of the end every one of those scriptures is going to be fulfilled while we got our eyes open and we're breathing air that's right exactly you'd say well I ain't seen it well read it again read it again you're in there somewhere yes sir read about it Daniel seal this up until the time of the end you're not going to understand this but there's going to be a people that will understand it the wise will understand you love the Lord amen let's tell brother Steven how much you appreciate him yes sir um pray for him on his way back pray for those people up there I talked to um Brother Richard Douglas said that there was some power outages up there and he's preaching
