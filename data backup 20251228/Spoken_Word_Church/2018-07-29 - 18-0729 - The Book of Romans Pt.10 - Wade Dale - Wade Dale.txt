========================================

Oh one minute guys down game for two minutes sometimes time we have to study the book of Romans Romans we are now on chapters of Romans and let's see I got my pad back I got my OtterBox Defender [Music] [Applause] hey Dad all right so every book runs you got that done here we go so we are on the book of Romans we're on chapter six now remember this is the baptismal scripture this is one we use for baptism and I'm going to read it out of the Lexington but first we're going to read it here from and make a few comments now remember what Paul does he gives us a B give this day a lot of and what we did is we went from chapter 5 I'm gonna read chapter 5 let me read the last part of chapter 5 let's do that for chapter 5 because remember man put the chapters then Paul is just writing a letter all right so now he's talking about the offense of one and all this verse 19 brass by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so be it so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous nicolette obedient moreover the law entered that the offense might abound alright so in other words what the law is a magnifier okay it brings you to a knowledge that your own alright but now it's not a lord over you okay you know because like I said before there's many laws on the books of the nation today that don't dick no I don't I'm not under that law it says don't drink and drive if you if you blow the point oh eight you go to jail whoa I'm never gonna drink and drive I'm never gonna drink so therefore I won't be drinking and driving so that law really I want to have to round I have to read that law several times that laws on the books but it's not effective to me they bring out that it's not effective so there's the law on here if you've never come into adultery that law it's not an effect of you isn't mrs. Tucker it's not even there all right so that's what what Christ did he came wanted to magnify the law but where sin abounded grace did much more abound remember grace was first grace was here first before there ever was Christ was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world so he was slain way before then even before Adam because remember by one man's disobedience many were made sinners then who - coming up Adam that's Adam I so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous in Christ play moreover the law into the defense my development where sin abounded grace did much more abound that as sin has reigned unto death even so my grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord that's what we start stopped last Sunday so now we're on chapter six of Romans and as we've been talking before just to back up or give a little review for some that are here today then won't be here next week err but here last week so anyway so what we got I hope we've got in the background in just a minute we've got my circumcision and uncircumcision but we're going through the seals upstairs you know the world a force field so we see that grace coming up to the fifty we see really how grace comes in but now we also see that that the book of Romans speaks of justification sanctification and holy go all right because he talked about circumcision so now we're going to look and see though I want you to see this this is you said well this is the baptismal scripture this is not only the baptismal scripture this is your born-again script okay now you can be baptized you don't be born but you can't be dead and buried with Christ and not having about this one's all the guys right okay you can be baptized we put many a wet Oh many a dry centering them in the water and I hate this but you bring them out there just a wet Center you never see them the more they don't come back no more or either they go off somewhere else but if you're truly buried in Christ remember would come up to third seal dayit death that third seal you gotta be dated your old cousins got to be dead if the older husband's dead then what you bury him and walk in newness of life all right you got the newness of life coming back up that's what we want to read right here what shall we say then now remember verse of chapter five he's a continuation he's now he's answering his question what shall we say them shall we continue in sin that grace may abound in other words people we need to quit sinning because you think you got grace to cover everything and you're just your commitment necklace is what you're doing your knowing you shouldn't do it and you you're doing it anyway that's iniquity right now we stand every day as Christians we said but they're going east on me right here will we continue in sin are we going to continue to be an adulterer are we going to continue to be a lot of GD deed that grace may abound all grace can cover me you see that's that that's that once they know they say that was nothing that's what it is I said domination aligned a once they don't win say but once they'd always say then they say you got to go to judgment and up through the tribulation I'm to me I don't I'm gonna don't get like I said before I am so proud that if no other major doctrine in this whole message ever being revealed to me is that I don't have to to the judgment and I don't have to go through tribulation I don't have to stand before the judgment seat like everybody else and I do not have to go through the tribulation so to me back to things right there is nothing else coming that's good enough for me but nobody said what shall we question what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound what the mark died forbid people wake up you know and he's talking to Roman so he's talking to Gentiles how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein right now listen we're not dead to stand in their body nobody don't sin right we stand in our spirit realm all right remember week our compartmentalised all that during the seal you do not use if you're a sinner you're sinning from your soul because your soul is born in sin shapen in iniquity it is that it has a nature attached to it after the age of accountability their thing Adamic old devil nature attached to your soul and it blackens that soul until God comes in or you just stay that way so you stand from the inward man you stand from the soul but now once that soul is saved once you're dead what the old man dies that nature detaches and guys Christ comes in the new husband right raises you up all right make sure you see you Carlos dot is so don't worry about that compartmentalize put that over there if you're born again today your soul cannot sin like John tell some perf God says you can't see him see remaineth in you the season I need your body it seems not in your experience the season your soul because the word goes down to the soul the man seasons to join tomorrow separate that's what we've done now you can't send it this does not sin this is a product of sin this is a product of mom and dad but this only does what the motivator tells it today okay so if you're born again in your soul if you're dead to sin live any longer therein we shouldn't be but in our spirit realm is where we sin is Christian's memory reason conscious affects an imagination take that home again and study and study that's my problem my memory my reasoning mind my conscious my affection which is not that affection is for your wife that affection is oh I love baseball I love you love Christ from your soul because that is love that's the capstone right here I love sure you will see the new birth down here but this is what capped it off but it's all of divine love comes remember what brother L strong about the brother brother the elements on them you receive the divine nature of God when you're born again down here in fact so you receive a divine nature why your own nature's day it so this is the soul now watch the soul then what do we do here where do these virtues come in they work to the outside memory reason conscious affects it make an exit so when we compartmentalize I don't worry about my flesh I just try to keep it fed Fran saying don't know don't do that I try to keep it fed more than it needs in case something happens and I can't eat for awhile but all this is it is a is a outward view got see taste feel smell in here what is it that's five that that's five endless if you're negating your soul you cannot sin you cannot sin brother Brown said remember original quote up there you can't stand enough if you're born again you can't send enough to go back the other direction I'm a but if you stand up a bunch we continuing sin then the old eggs are still in there the old the old my brother Graham called the old they call dynamic nature but the old thing that the root of evil the root of evil what root root is the very center of where all the nutrients come up front right the nutrients doesn't come from the tree itself to come to the root so the root of evil is still there so you still that's why you continue in sin because the roots still there okay the root of evil is still in the soul give that dead dead thus then moving out of the way you don't have to worry about that and then my brother Bell said let that soul start living out our problem is is we stop the flu though don't blame saying for a lot of things we do think we do Cherie but he can't work but remember me be satisfied he cannot work on yourself if your morning you you cannot can't touch it it's so fiery hot he can never touch it he has to let go but now in your spirit realm he can play with it all right you say all again you stay willing to understand maximize my skin since your skin don't say it you scan this guy here doesn't sin this is this is only a display of what's inside this is the only once keeps everything together all right so let me prove it to you before in the Old Testament if the priest didn't touch a woman remember say if you commit adultery will kill you in the Old Testament well those priests could have carnal sexual thoughts about them the women and they were fine as long as they didn't touch them but when Jesus come along he said don't worry about touching them he said if you have lusted in your heart you've committed adultery already not with this thing so there don't worry we know we know as human beings we ought to know even as even as born-again Christians that our carnality is in our spirit realm and then it displays the list to have the carnal acts that we knew which is fine bends undefiled we okay with that all right thanks good but we still do are motivated by that spirit realm memory reason conscience affection imagination okay so compartmentalize and compartmentalize that when you read Paul because Paul's telling us shall we contend sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that our dad that stamp all sin how are we then are dead to sin live it over here you're dead to sin living you over there in he's telling the people he says this when he's trying to tell them to look if you born again hello if you born again if you're born again you know I'm gonna sit in your soul but you still have problems look no you know that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death not naturally okay remember the dead Christ shall rise first if you're not dead now he ain't talking about the dead out there in the team know if you're dead in Christ now right you'll rise first the dead in Christ shall rise first therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life and of life remember I preached a sermon on going over not to lives to life it's to life that we have to deal with our view in life in our spiritual life all right for if we have been planted together planning together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified now when they put you across and crucify you you die there's never been anybody ever come down home across it was life they're all they're all deceased alright we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection watch this knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin that's not this so this is not destroyed when you're born again the body of sin you don't have two bodies inside of you but you have a nature attached to you that makes your body do things I mean just real simple if you'll compartmentalize it it makes your understand what's going on here that we have strict consent in our spirit realm can't touch the soul it's done it's finished listen it's sitting in heavenly places it's actually in another dimension I mean we're not sitting in heaven places we're sitting it's poking we're Church today but our soul by the Bible is still in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so we have been raised up by resurrected right see that's one of the two people were preaching philip thygesen jimenez was preaching the pulse and the resurrection and already come close what's he doing he's telling them we're being resurrected we're being brought up we're sitting in heavenly places they were listening to him preach just like people do they listen that's the same demon that comes up with all these strange doctrines they hear what brother Ram preaches and they go well they go pretty strand doctrine same time well brother Branham said well they said well Paulo said we were resurrected they said the resurrection snowpacks no Paul didn't say the resurrection at them fast he said we were resurrected sitting in heavenly places but they took that doctrine and you know what if they did they thought of me so much to leave and when Paul rebuked them they said we're right so rebel Paul had turned over to the devil they were so right till the person they got the docked him from came to him and said I'm not saying that and they said well yeah they would keep them we're going we're gonna keep this revelation we're going to teach this revelation you know that happens all over the country even in Jamaica activity same demon different name knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead member we would agree marriage and divorce a little bit on the third seal if your whole husband is dead you're free to marry you're free to marry you have no law restriction if your husband's dead except that you may believe but only in Christ is what the Bible says so now in the spiritual acts that if he that is dead it's free from sin no look we're not there physically do you know what he's talking about that old nature is dead we're free from sin that's what you and I have to realize because it is a two-fold thing we live every day and we stand every day right but we don't stand on our soul our soul is just as perfect as God is it's already resurrected this already took the money change because we have a body right here the body of sin but if it's dead and destroyed look we're going to read them down here maybe and we get to it excuse me you can't accuse a dead man I mean anything we were justified by the death of Christ you can't blame us hello somebody get that one of these days we will take a body changed so I changes what already in here that's right so it's not coming from me I have somewhere it's coming from right here all right for he that is dead it's freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we don't you shall live with him now that's eternal life we live with him all right knowing that Christ being raised from the dead died no more he didn't have to go be dead again that's right even we were listening to the upstairs about Roy Branham indicted this generation for the second crucifixion the crowd what they put him on a cross and kill me by what by their doctrine okay what the inside person you can't be alive with Christ on this in the soul and be lost that's right or do what they were talking about doing he brother Graham didn't die to Christian he would indict in the denominational spirit of the whole right what they did they killed Christ that's why Christ had to come off of the mountain in Matthew and said tell this vision of no one to what the Son of Man be risen again from the dead he was killed in dirt and dive around here and raised but down to the church ages they killed him again and today the Son of Man is written in me and you yes these work what's the word made flesh knowing that Christ will yeah knowing that Christ being raised from the dead no more deaths have no more dominion over him now we're dead buried in Christ that's that's no more dominion over now what we've got to do is compartmentalize then we got to take down our soul and start into our spirit round get our spirit realm to believe that right that those who he's justified is already glorified and then all of a sudden the body is going to change you're not going to eat right you know work out you're not going to get this thing ready for our body saying no no I'm sure I Abraham when he met Mel Kennedy before he got his body chained he probably had to give up I have a chair like this okay and had to be helped down set of stairs and he was 99 not 50 but I'm sure that he wasn't feeling very spry the day before okay but that next morning he got a body gen4 hand that he died he died understand once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise he's talking to you them likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God to Jesus let not stand therefore reign in your mortal body it says in not home this is more money so it's in your mortal body because remember this thing doesn't sin it's a product of sin yes but it does not send this this man you're looking at today used to hold things in his hand that was not good beer all kind of stuff you can do some kind of you know that one finger wave and all that stuff but we got cleaned me up he didn't give me a new flesh nobody cleaned up the flesh I got you know what you've done you clean them the inside man the inside man the outside man just reacted to the inside of man let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof now you know let's move on you know better than that don't loose with your body where's it start right memory reasoning conscience effective the madness comes remember there's only one sense in the soul flaker doubt favorite out that's it all right but now you come out the next room you've got five senses that Satan can come in this way and God's trying to work his way out this way they meet that battleground let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God look for sin shall not have dominion over you nice of I'm telling you this you gotta believe what the Bible already wrote for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace but let a minute pulse is now what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid no you not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey I let Satan working my memories in constant imagination and all that stuff I let him do that you do that but we should yield ourselves to God more then he have the preeminence and then even though Satan comes you just because remember save came to Jesus talk to him tempted him with what external thing things you can see you know all the things like that be him being God Almighty saying didn't have a problem talking to it so don't you think he's got a problem talking to you right for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid no United to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God be thanked that we are the servant look but God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you become the servants of righteousness I like that alright now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back and read it out of the Greek lexicon you see a little bit clearer what Paul's talking all right great what then shall we say all week to continue in sin that favor man well sorry by no means now shall we who have died by sin live any longer in it pretty blunt or are you ignorant that as many as have been on green ones they are are you ignorant that as many as have been immersed in the Christ have been immersed into his death verse 3 verse 4 we have therefore been entombed with him by the immersion into that death that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father so also we should walk in a new life verse 5 for him we have been planted together in the likeness of his death certainly we shall be also in doubt of his resurrection knowing this that our old man was crucified with him so that the body of sin may be rendered powerless I like that may be rendered powerless that we may no longer be enslaved to sin because you were slaves simply when you we know that verse 7 for he who died listen to this for he who died has been justified from sin because you can't accuse the dead man of anything you can go out in the graveyard and and get daddy my daddy's daddy died see 70 something years ago and you can't accuse him of robbing by yesterday they don't care what you did you can acuity you walk out then you can deed them up out of the grave a look at it face to face and see you did and if you're dead if we're dead in Christ we're we have people for he who died has been justified from sin and if we died with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him that's verse 8 verse 9 knowing that Christ having been raised from the dead dies no more death no longer lords over him that's verse 9 verse 10 for the death which he died he died if I sent one though words he died for our sin he died of the perpetuation that took all of our sins away he died my sin once but the life which he lives he lives by God verse 10 verse 11 thus also do you account yourself dead indeed by sin but living by God and in the anointed Jesus I like that dude which is this record verse 11 verse 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body in order to obey its desired excuse me verse 13 nor present remembers to sin as instruments of iniquity but present yourself to God as if alive from the dead so that's what you are you are alive from the dead alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments of righteousness for 14 we're fourteen four since you're not Lord over you for ye are not under law but under favor verse fifteen what then should we send because we are not under the law but under favor by no means verse 16 do you not know that to whom you present yourself slaves for obedience his slaves you are to whom you are obedient try explain to them where their ups and to death or of obedience to righteousness verse 17 but thanks to God that though you were slaves of sin yet you obeyed from the heart that mould of instruction into which you were delivered mold would be what body right right that doctrine which was delivered unto you verse 18 and having been emancipated from sin what set free emancipation is that free I remember brother Keith preaching on emancipation right and having been emancipated from sin you become subservient to righteousness I speak humanly because of the weakness of your flesh I didn't when we read nineteen all the way over here 423 doing things with them for as you present your members enslaved to the impurity and iniquity so now present your members bound to righteousness for a while that said the original says for sanctification so we went through a justification we've gone through sanctification minded to me once you see once you see the the total plan of redemption you see Redemption and in Reverse in every scripture when the seal is open and you see that God has done all this forth it truly makes it a brand new book verse 24 when we were slaves of sin you were free as the righteousness did you can't be you can't be serving it to both okay can't be serving at the boat look at 21 what fruit therefore had you at that time in things of which you are now ashamed for the end of those things is death natural I'm especially dead but it will take you to upgrade when then you go to welcome judgment but now having being emancipated from sin and having become bound to God you have your fruit and sanctification and the end listen and the end and knowing a known young life or each for everlasting life hey i ôm I am life for the wages of sin is death but the gracious gift of God is anointed a I am i have knowing life by the anointed Jesus our Lord so that hold that chapter there tells us something that I and something's gonna live the only way you can be dead to sin and never and never come back once you cross that line but you can't stand enough to be loved if you're born again so if we get born again then we've stayed that it doesn't take our troubles away I mean we still have laws that we have to deal with I mean there's still things that we have to be careful because you got your memory reasoning concepts based imagination which is not born again which is not covered by the Holy Ghost only those the thing you're so and then he's trying to get that he's trying to cover it he's trying to get you to what grow up in the stature of a perfect man right because you do get the Holy Ghost when you get the Holy Ghost you get everything you need for your journey the problem is the problem is is we try to I don't say strangle but I guess sometimes you can say strangle and not let the Holy Ghost work we did that and then we must yield ourselves members to Christ yield our members for Christ and and stop worry about your soul if you're born again don't worry about that because listen they'll take care of itself my biggest problem one more time it's my memory when I think what I remember Satan reminds me what I did god don't remind me what you did but you know what he can't even remember what sins are you talking about another song what's it and that's true you remember I told you you know several years ago I'm that's my place that something happened that was not good that I didn't that's the one I'm so sorry for that and you know I'm like you idiot even though these are the entities he's standing right there where he going me coming now he said he'd forget it and when he said he'd forget it anyway you want picture it the only way we can as humans apply it would be what the song what the Prophet said he puts it in the Sea of God's forgetfulness for me never to be remembered again so he quit so don't don't you see next I probably keep going back to the old person's on well I'm sorry for all there if you're born in your souls right gods want to work on that thing to bring it out he's not one to he's not want us to say that's our problem do you understand me that's our problem we hashed up all the old things we did and we get condemned in our self when Christ is sitting there going you're telling me this new thing that I don't know nothing about you know what you said Jack I'm not forgot that now you need to forget it right I mean really yeah it always boils down it's all it's all choice make sure you watch what Paul was talking about yield hoodoos the new hoodoos who lose the ilding who don't know who does the yell me you do you do doc don't know yielding he is who here we either yield out something fine are you myself little devil that's not fair yielding their self to the devil you know he don't yield you and I yield we yield one way there so I feel right so all right it's time to go please stop Lord bless you we enjoy the word today [Music]
