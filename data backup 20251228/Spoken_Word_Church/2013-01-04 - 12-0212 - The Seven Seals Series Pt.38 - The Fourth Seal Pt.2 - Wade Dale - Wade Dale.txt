========================================

our pieces You Gotta Give the old lady some black okay he's over 60 not 50. she's over six nope thank you honey after the banquet I will begin always been there after the banquet so after the banquet you need to wear our armor yeah sure do no pitchforks nope no pigs nobody's behind me no probably what's going to happen is y'all all turn around in the views turn around the fuse and beat you back up to me in the back she's the back seat but everything's pitched back from the front coming back when you just hit the back wall and that thing just goes okay oh you know why it's not oh yeah yeah how old are you I need to turn this thing on somewhere yep hello but I am fantastic you're right thank you all right Revelation chapter six did everybody bring their book we're going to read out of that so today so let's read them I go to sleep this morning so because of y'all I got up at 5 30 and read some more so maybe I needed to read myself so maybe there's some music okay and when he had opened the four steel I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see now look at Behold a Pale Horse and his name that said on him was death and Hell Followed With It and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the Earth to kill the sword and with Hunger with death and with the beasts of the earth now let's go to Matthew 24. does everybody understand why we go to Matthew why we go to Matthew this is proving that brother Branham did not bring something not out of scripture and that Jesus preached six seal while he was here on Earth okay this is this this is the Sixth Seal right here that he was preaching on this mountain to his group of disciples so we're proving here that that Jesus preached them John expounded on them and then brother Branham just came and gave us the between the lines okay so he gave us the between the lines the Revelation okay that Jesus was talking about because Jesus only spoke so many words watching verse 9. then she'll deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake that's the fourth seal that Jesus is speaking of there all right turn back to Revelations 6 because we may read that again but let's read in your uh in the book here turn to Fourth seal all right fourth seal and y'all have to excuse me because I got up this morning at five when I got out or 5 30. and I was so tired last night and I forgot to put my take my contacts out so when I got up like I stuck my head in a bowl of milk everything was milky all that protein that got on my contacts so I was fumbling through the house I thought what is the problem I did like that when I did I pushed my contact over and I said I went to sleep with my contacts so I got to wear these glasses and my arms are not long enough to read with these glasses in them so turn to paragraph one seventeen 117. foreign now he has a name are we there they're saying man okay got it got it okay now he has a name called Death now notice none of the other writers none of the other horses are no time that this rider ever rode they didn't have that man had no name but now he is called death it is not mentioned see he is revealed now what he is death all right now look go down to paragraph one twenty and we're going to set our beast in order all right paragraph 120. then we'll get up to the Chart here but under the revelation of the line now watch now I want you to read this close trying to be sure wrote down Place stand here under not under the revelation of the Lion's age or the first age the early age this wasn't revealed the next day through the age of the ox which is the Dark Age the middle age it wasn't revealed as it was that's what it was nor the man-like Beast of wisdom representing the reformers Lutheran Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed but in the eagle AIDS the last days the prophetic age were there is to rise prophetic utterance seeing to whom the secrets always come to now there's where we just and that's what he told me that's where we just come to so proving that all of our beasts are right but did you see that what it said in that paragraph 117. what he is is death all right now hold that in your mind because the four seals here well let's get our charges make sure we've got everything right it was a Pale Horse white red and black mixed together all the all brother Brian said all the doctrines mixed together basically that's what it is all the dolphins mixed together coming up into this age now this is us this is our age right here okay the eagle eight his name was death so there had to have something to name that all right and it would kill with a sword and hunger death and with beef now the combat Beast he just showed proved to you brother Brown did that that was the eagle anointing or Eagle age which is the seventh Church age and the wicked one is where death and held on earth now obviously we know that all that that brother around him saw about hell he would really think it was in hell now if what he saw in JC Penney's was just these little girls with a little bit of eyeliner uh you know they come into work and places they got tattoos all over them and they got Rings hanging out of everything they got you know every extremity and uh so that's what hell's going to be it's gonna be those hideous beasts just like people that are walking living on the Earth right now but they're dead the Bible says while they're living right so we have come to this for seal and then we see that it's come through the Antichrist false prophet I didn't cover this much because these two are basically about the same false prophet anointed false prophet we're going to read it in the in the syllable in a minute and then incarnate Beast now we'll not see this Beast incarnate we'll be gone the Rapture will take place God's going to Incarnate a group of people first then Satan is going to come and be incarnate and Beast and take over the world he's going to be that one that comes in and just takes over the world but it's going to be a religious taking over it's not going to be some of these dictators that we think like like we saw in our age in our time we've seen uh Saddam Hussein and and Osama Bin Laden that ain't nothing that ain't got nothing to do with the devil I mean sure the devil's anointed them but that's got nothing to do with the end of the world really right it's going to be a religious person right because that's where the greatest death is religious deaths spiritual death is not bad if you're a Christian but natural death is not bad if you're a Christian right that's right spiritual death is what's going to kill you know Beware of the one that can take the you know kill the soul or the second death all right that's what this is so don't get in your mind that we've named while we're dying no we've been dying since since Adam and Eve and it's able and Cain eventually died that's not a mystery you get older your body shuts down and you get a disease you die physical death right so let's get all that physical death out of the way because it's spiritual death right the Bible says dead while they're alive you can be spiritually so dead you're black that's right and be just the most alive person in the world right so this Antichrist this this Beast sure it came as a spirit right a saying among the people then it became Deeds put a pope in crowned him he started speaking then he became anointed during the time that anointing is what killed those people in the Dark Ages that anointing is what killed people spiritually in Lutheran Wesley's age they denominated the great message of Luther they nominated the great message of Wesley and let's not just disclude you know include let's include the Baptist and let's include the methodists and the Pentecostals all those they had a time right sure but they stopped and they died brother Brian said we're gonna read it right here we can say what we want to and we like Daddy said we love the people but brother Brown said that denominational system is eternally dead when you're eternally dead there's no coming back it's like brother Ram said one time he said we're standing on a Razor's Edge he said you fall off one side or the other he said you never come back because you know that what's that wedge like this you fall off this side of the wedge there's no way to get back unless you get back up on the wedge because you're just going to keep getting further and further away all right just like a bullet and does everybody understand how that works I mean brother around says talk about bullets too hold on we'll do that today because this is important because that's what happened in the ages what happened with a gun is a gun has a back part like this here's the barrel of the gun now if that Barrel extends out you're gonna have to get three-dimensional women here this is the end of the barrel all right there's a little Dot that sticks up about that far at the end of that Barrel now everybody take your fingers like that that's the back now to hold that finger up like this in front of it that's the front Okay you put this right here just like that and your target should be right up above it all right now what happens if this this this one does not move right this one stays steady but this one has a control it has a screw running through it all right that screw when you turn that screw it moves that back sight this way or this way okay okay all right okay so if you're shooting a gun like brother random explain if you're shooting a gun and say that you're over here but now you have to move the front over you got it you have to move you know you're like this and say that say that you're shooting off to the left that means your V is over here and you've had to pull this Barrel over because you want it lined up like this okay so what you got to do is if you're like if you're like this but you're shooting this way what you got to do is you got to move that thing over and bring that back in line and then you'll be shooting straight if I get it you understand that one brother but what brother Brown said is he said if you shoot right here though and you got a Target and you're shooting right here and here's the bullseye and you're shooting over here like four five six shots there's no way at 50 yards you're going to be off this much at 100 yards you're going to be off way over here right at 200 yards you're going to be off way over here you're gonna never get back to dead center unless you move this backside over yeah these iron socks okay they're Scopes that you can do the same thing with that's why we have scope guns look like this and they're the same way they work the same way what happens is this what this wire and this wire is on the control and you turn them and they go down or sideways okay okay all right so if you're hitting over here you will never get to Bullseye unless you change something to get back to what we call this is called zero zero means you get you put that dot right there and it puts in bullets right there in the middle of that Target but if you never move if you stop take the screw out of this thing and say I ain't moving it no more your Bullet at 400 yards is going to be over here 500 yards over here you understand you're never going to get back in line unless you move this back over to line up with this that's what brother Brown was talking about when he's talking about bullets the same way with the word of God they got off down here in the ages and started firing over here to the left say right but they never did anything he said that's the Old and New Testament um right Old and New Testament you move that over get off of the word you're never gonna come back because this is what happens see the bullet comes out of the hole and if you got it pointed in that direction according to this the bullet's gonna this is Center the bullet's going to hit right here well as you keep getting further and further away that bullets keep is going to be in a V so you're never going to come back to your target here's your target right here look how much further you're going off okay and I just used left for an example I don't mean it's left or right but one way or the other and if you're off this way you're going to go this way you got to come back to the zero and it goes right there and hits the Bulldog that's what brother Brown came to do he came to put it back on this Bullseye man had got it way off over here Oneness got it well over here Trinity got it off way over here God brought it back with William Branham and told him said right here you plant this tree in this tree pull them together and what'd he do and he hit the bullseye that's what he's talking about in these seals you got to come back to the original you got to come back so you understand now more what yeah when he says she had the gun that's what he was talking about because it's like and it's like he said we're standing on a Razor's Edge Lauren if you got even if you've got a razor blade which is what real fan but up there if you look on a microscope if you look at a microscope at a razor blade it's like this you just can't see it because it's so tiny of a wedge but guess what if you're standing right here and you fall off on this side it's just like that how are you ever gonna get back right you can't you got to get back up here on the on the edge or if you fall off on this side guess what see this thing don't curve back around it just keeps going off that's why people in the doctrines unless the people come back to the true word of God they never come back they always stay off all right so everybody understand this I don't know where in the world that came from but that was for somebody to help them that's okay but that's what brother Brown was talking about when he's talking about hitting that Target and talking about the ages the whole time it's it's death the whole time but in this age you could sit there and name it there's death right there that denominational system is death right that's why I wait because the other ages that's right we winked at their ignorance of not being able to hit the target but they were in the age of man where you can only see so far but then you brought a prophet that was happened to be a marksman a hunter and he could describe it so simple with a gun with the iron sights with a v in the back and the Little Dot in the front that's why you shoot any gun same way with uh even with a scope you do the same thing if you're off you got to screw that thing back where it moves over and you're and you're hitting dead on all right but if not the further you go 100 yards 200 yards 300 yards it's just like a wedge so you never come back unless you come right back to the original go back to your bench get back lined up with the Old and New Testament well he called those sites right the Old and New Testament the Holy Spirit leading all right then that gun fires right all right that's what he's doing in this end time he's got us firing the bullet right all right so let's read take our books back out here I read the whole four steel this morning so I needed to read it over again I guess huh all right let's read right here and I'll show you paragraph one 54. if my arms were all right 154. now God only knows how many he calls to spiritually die by this anti-bible word teaching this is the one he put 68 million to the store and killed him and probably literally millions billions died spiritually on his false teaching no wonder he could take the name of death see the writer the first place was an antichrist he was death to begin with but he was innocent then he received a crown a triple crown and when he did he be United Satan United in his church and state because he was over both of them Antichrist was Satan in the form of a man right so now let's go over to the next page and brother Brown is going to explain let's go to paragraph what is that 160. he's going to explain now I want you to notice the four of them notice the off Mark of four of the spiritual mathematics not as threes this is four he is in four here first Antichrist White second false prophet red third biker of heavens and earth and purgatory black fourth the Beast Pale Horse Satan being kicked Out of Heaven but where's he being kicked out of heaven he was kicked out of heaven a long time ago by Michael and his angels to come down here to do his business among us but God knew that God give us provision okay send it coming south all right to do or to to when I say do the Plan of Redemption but it is it's to do the Plan of Redemption that's what he come to do because we were lost now go to paragraph 166. just exactly like the church grows his church went from Antichrist or false prophet and in a great age to come to Beast that is to rise show the church it comes the same way through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost is Christ being in the people just exactly and he's got the answer type of it over here see the top of it rather or hears exactly that's him he's kicked out of heaven and he reads revelation 13. one through eight and we'll not read that right now all right we'll read that in just a second but let's stop right here so we've got our false anointing and then we've got our true anointing which is what the eagle the eagle anointing death and Hell on Earth now watch The Last Enemy to be destroyed that kind of fitting that it's in the fourth age and the Rapture takes flight takes place in a for sale he said well there's there's three more that's true but there's no more combat beasts remember there was lion oxman and white eagle four bugs eat it down four combat beasts had to come back and restore it in the Book of Joel and also in the Book of Ezekiel you'll see this line oxman and eagle could happen any other age had to happen in our age but see they weren't required to learn about death so they were going to die they were going to die anyway all right and that's just truth they died they're dead aren't they yeah okay and everybody from today match Dead all right that's just a fact that's just things we have to live with but there's got to be a group that's we which are alive and remain which is overcome the what the Bible says overcome the Beast and his teaching all right so we had to overcome because see like Mom said God winked at the ignorance of even there's going to be let me let you in on a little secret there's going to be Catholics those original first Catholics there's going to be in heaven they're going to have it they accepted Jesus Christ they lived the best they could they they live Luther's age Wesley's age Columbus age all those people they're born again believers sure they come out of that system but you're going to see a lot of people now I don't know if they'll ever be a pope in heaven but there were some sincere ones they may be giving eternal life I don't know for what they believe you know you never know but watch how it Narrows just like we're talking about this wedge but see it's narrowing this way up for us because it's coming out of denominations up to what what do you think that right there is thank you there's your headstone right there we got it we don't have to we're not required to come down here we're required to be right here right headstone well same way the Beast is doing the same thing he's trying to get you away from it right Christ is trying to get you right here that's right right at that Pinnacle that's where we're at there's nothing else left there's no more Church ages there's no more prophets the next thing we do is we go on a Rapture right so the Raptor takes place on the fourth seal because the combat beasts are gone and the combat Beast are to work you put all those combat beats into two words Holy Ghost those combat beasts are what they're the Lamb's protection or they are to protect the word of God well where's the word of God foreign on a piece of paper That's what Satan wants it to be stay on a piece of paper but when it's right here then you've got every combat Beast right here with you today lion bold Ox sacrificial right intelligence of a man to whip the devil because man's intelligence can't do it it's got to be the intelligence of God okay and then the eagle we got to get out of here we gotta you know get up out of this place move sword right so you got Co one two three and we're at number four right because I want you to understand this today if the Rapture takes place on a fourth seal what what about five six and seven so this is important the four seal is very important because it's a bridge it fills in kind of a gap it's a it's it fills in a there's a meaning here all right so let's do this real slow this will be the last point then we'll pick it back up next Sunday see a one two three and four what justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and brother Brown says the word or the word and I say the word incarnate all right if the word's not incarnate we don't go into Rapture that's right if we're if the word is not incarnate into people we don't want a Rapture you can't take a change unless your word incarnate now these people were the word for their day but brother Brown you read that right there it says we read it one justification I wrote in here just in case sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost is Christ being in the people number four see it was Christ in the people here but we're talking about incarnate because Satan doesn't know how to Incarnate flesh yet but when he sees us go up and how it's done he comes right in and incarnates a beast and does his work just like God comes in and incarnates you and does his work changes your body saw something today I want to read it where brother Brown was talking about and I think that maybe when I got up early this morning because I'd really been looking for a quote for that I found it right there in the Forest Hill kind of strange huh all right now seal one two three and four is a type of your journey here on Earth correct right right all right fifth seal six seals seventh seal happens after we're gone the literal actually all these literally happen while we're gone okay but for us to get out of here there's one group of people this is one group right here this could be potentially the dead in Christ because there's nothing puts them in a body change okay okay brother random was standing with the adoption what we've been preaching on adoption he was standing adopted son of God he still died all right this is the dead in Christ that's their requirement is to be justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and walk in the word of your day right one more group of people left First Corinthians or second Corinthians we which are what alive um pay attention this gets you in the body of Christ this does not get you a body change it puts you toward one all right but she toured one but even being the word incarnate Jesus was a word incarnate brother random to me was the word incarnate for his day for his day he wasn't God but he died humanly he died his flesh died all right five six and seven comes right back under this and you go back through because remember we're going to get into the fifth seal which is Grace six seal which is sanctification and then this is the what this is the getting out of here that's remember brother Ryan said Jesus preached six seals and he was the seventh he was the seventh he took a body change now we know he died but he died for me and you so that we wouldn't have to die that's the difference he died so we wouldn't have to he marred his body so our body don't have to be marked right are we okay yes yes I'm not stealing anything or breaking anybody's thoughts or processor what if you don't understand what would help me brother random come he did come to tell us how to live but after 63 when that he said that's what the message was done that is it your body Soul and Spirit paper ratchet right and the other ages did not have that that's right and that's why he had to come here none of them back there were stored it 100 percent brother Brown restored it 100 and that's how you can have a hundred percent word and go interact or go be chat what he done if you want to really just categorize it this was 63 and back and this was 63 and up you can't do it without either one this is pre-63. listen people these people that are born again Christian that'll never know the revelation of these Salem so it's not a requirement that these seals are revealed to you to be a born-again Christian everybody understand that I mean I know we we preached that you know God know the seals no you need to get born again first sure but it is to take a it is to take a nap to get out to take a body change you've got to get all of them that's right but when brother Brown says the bride goes up on the fourth seal people go cuckoo because they say man there's five six and seven left well five six and seven is for the people that are alive and remain you get all these together and you'll not see death so see a one through four there's four anybody that's dead and gone on and we've not broke any part of the brother Reynolds message we've not broken any Scripture we're going to prove it a little bit later on I don't have time maybe we'll do it this next week but the sixth fifth seal six seal seventh seal to me are very important if you want to really hone into something if you're born again and you're walking in a word there's no bigger word if if you're born again walking in the word then you've got these four then we need to know about Grace and sanctification because this is nothing else but justification over again sanctification over again baptism of the Holy Ghost addicts Apex pinnacle because all this right here is Ephesians 4 is Ephesians 1 where this is the earnest of our inheritance right here until the what full purchased possession Jesus didn't come just to purchase your soul when he dripped his blood on the earth it's in here brother Brown and it's in the future home brother Brian said your body was in this earth when it first begun he just dropped his blood on it cleansed and claimed this whole entire Earth and that's where your body was so your body's already been claimed but what happens is this guy right here racks through this thing right here stops this right here that's just about as simple you put all the message you want to in it you can make all the quotes you want but that's what it is God's already done this waiting on you and I Satan's in a battle but now see if we were not ever able to name death we never could overcome it that's what we're getting to next we got to be able to overcome death but he had to have a name first we had to have a name brother Brown had to come and say hey the eagle age had to bring a name to death well now what named death no it was it was named organization false Doctrine something that's keeping you out of the Rapture whatever that is that's death it ain't physical death like I said we've named physical deaths at stable died right yeah so it was the spiritual part so let's read this right here I want to find it and read it something I found this morning somebody had had a question about creation now listen go to paragraph what is that 282 282. let's go to 281. paragraph 281. now listen to this don't you listen as I said as I said God is like a big contractor he lays out all his material on the Earth then he builds his buildings now remember before there was a grain of of seed on the Earth before there was a son that ever struck the Earth your body was laying on the Earth because you are the dust of the earth see you are God is the contractor now the way he was going to do it now some people thinks that maybe Adam was going to speak into Eve and she was going to conceive and have a baby through her womb Listen People God only gave us these bodies he knew we were going to reproduce sexually okay he knew that but he gave us these bodies because we're a higher creation of animal a male dog let's just be playing a male dog's got a thing like a male animal does I mean like a male human does why we're the higher creation when God put us in this flesh he could make us something different than his creation he created a male and a female dog to procreate right so he gave us male and female parts in our human body but not to do that listen watch this right here now the way he was going to do it was reach down and get like he did Adam a little bunch of calcium potash and Cosmic light and go there's my other son see then he'd bring up some more and say there's another one spoken word but what did Eve do she corrupted that way and she brought it through a sexual act then death struck now what is God going to do keep reading he's got so many of those seeds down through there that's predestinated so much to predestinate and then at the end time he won't say Eve come bear another child hmm here call and I'll answer that's all that's it that's the idea period so in the beginning sure he gave us human part male and female parts but only because he put us in a higher form of animal creation right yeah we weren't supposed to produce sexually we were supposed to produce by the spoken word why is why he preach spoken words Original Seed spoken word is the Original Seed it was supposed to go Adam or I would say you had a part of it because she was Adam she wasn't Eve she was Adam but you there you go he didn't have to bring I don't have a loom did he no and Adam wasn't going to be the one that spoke the dog was gonna be the one that saw you well now Adam was one of them sure he was God of the earth that's what he was saying he said he'd give it just like he did Adam and coach God Adam was given the book to reproduce Genesis 1 26 and 27 says multiplying replenish the Earth before they ever put us in a human body So Adam when he put that into Adam he didn't change it that's what's happening now brother down started with 18 people well I say this all the time but sometimes it don't go strike home brother now started with 18 people 30 years ago 40 years ago he's got a hundred now they're not Mama's kids but they're brother Dale's kids they're spiritually brother Dale's kids we're all brother Dale's kids spiritually that spiritual reproduction that's Genesis one that's why I love that scripture so much that's me and you being reproduced right here or produced not reproduced but being produced right here with no sex involved that's one of these you see these preachers go out and do the things they do and and have relations with women because it's so close you can preach it so close to you and get in the flesh and that's what this guy wants he wants you to get in the flesh and do things but God sent the Holy Ghost to get us a holy ghost in here to work on this outside guy all right so see you one two four Rapture takes place everybody understand that the reason the Rapture takes place there's a group that takes these brings it right back into here and death doesn't bother him anymore it'll never hit him may just be one person maybe two people maybe ten maybe a thousand it ain't gonna be many but these were dead in Christ they arise first because these don't have to rise they never died they're going up that's why the Raptor takes place on the fourth step there's no more combat beats the Holy Ghost Lift Off the Earth guess what you and I live with it ain't gonna leave the Holy Ghost here because if we leave the Holy Ghost here you still got kids here right right yeah you don't have kids no more so he's gone he don't have to be here all right let's go God bless you
