========================================

our Lord open the eyes of man I want to see you I want to see you amen I want to see you high and shining in the light of your glory for hours to power and [Music] shining in a lot of power and a nanny they meant I want to see him don't you good to see about in the house the Lord if you like to turn in your scriptures turn to first Peter one that we're not going to get on to going up the pyramid in the statue of a perfect man yet but we're using part of the scripture alright but I encourage you ask if you will for the next a couple of services if you'll do your studying or your thoughts or your reading and do it to the basis of the stature of a perfect man you know if you listen to the tape read the book stay especially in the first part where he's talking about faith how faith and be born again you want to get into that now so I don't know where to be Sunday morning Wednesday but pretty quick okay remember now the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday which is a what to 17th remember brother Ernie Villanueva will be with us ministering for the weekend so keep these in mind keep all of the people that are sick and all of the things and I sent a message and said she has strep and double ear infection and a sinus infection so she's got a full dose of it you just remember her in your prayers and didn't do it I wish you would remember my nice one Terrence was requesting about because it's kind of an odd thing he's five years difference between us I'm her uncle but I'm only five years older than she is she was the first one of the nieces and nephews but she is kind of the medicine is affecting her to where that she thinks she's somewheres else and she thinks he's here thinks she's there and and everything and it was kind of funny but I did ask her I could always kid with her a lot I said if you write all this down we'll we'll make a book out of this thing and I said now you tell them next time they give you some medicine because that's what's doing it said tell them to give you some it's in Technicolor where you dreams and weird things or be different you know this is something the kid would pray for because she thinks that they've trying to put her into a nursing home you know when I told her day after don't you worry about it yeah you know I'll keep up with it and everything don't you worry about it you know in other words I'll go tell her today they tell me they're gonna put her in a nursing home but until then you just prayed she'd be all right I thought she's 7d what would that be 72 and that's you know she's having a lot of trouble with the medication so remember that first Peter 1:18 through 23 father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you for your love thank you for understanding thank you for you and we pray that you would just bless us now as we try to minister your word and open the eyes that we may walk therein and father lead us forgive our sins bless those that are sick among us never enter their Lord in all this trouble and never Richards got a lot of it in the different ones Lord and remember the cornesfamily they're in the loss of the loved one just remember all of these things father and let your love be with us we love you we thank you in Jesus name they meant hmm president much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's now so you were the reason I'm picking this is we're trying to come in now to the new birth getting in to the day of Pentecost and in Paulus telling them you know all that Old Testament is fine but it didn't produce now we have to come to something that is anchoring it and getting more sure than what that was see in the understanding all right so you wouldn't redeem with that see all right but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who've early was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him give him glory in your faith and hope might be it that's your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned that means there's white height as you can get in other words your your experience in Christ love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever you may be seated Lord that is blessing now we're going to be using this as a title for the next few messages of being born again alright now we're going to be using it coming up to the born-again experience because that's what you're doing and remember you you're your new birth starts when you believe alright so if you truly believe now and that new birth starts it doesn't mean it's in too real it doesn't mean it's fully grown or anything it just means it starts alright so from that time on if it continues then all the way through your whole experience you are being born again then we'll get into the pyramid and pick up C of the things that we need of being born again of that basis but let's hold it to this part too to give understanding now we've tried to express something I have to Yemen review just a tad bit that to make sure we follow where we were talking about from salvation to Redemption and all of the message on salvation we saw that God as brother hood a brother in red green but the Henry Green would quote I think it's a quote pretty close but anyhow he would quote that God started his church the way he wanted it he wanted he wants his church the way he started it so that's that's the truth of where it was and we saw that that God started his children on earth in the basis of Adam and Eve and God giving them according to blasphemous names giving them eternal life in their soul all right but their body in their spirit was not eternal and it was in in the time bracket of not counting days and all like that for a while but then it developed into the being days and times all right but that was his children and that was the way God wanted his children Adam especially we use Adam called we don't want to see we don't want to get Eve because there's too much thinking about her but remember she was a child of God now are you gonna say she wasn't are you gonna say that Adam was but he wasn't then you're in trouble because remember the same one that put life into Adam put life into Eve alright so then we have to go with that the heavy eternal life in their body and that was the way God intended for it to be he meant for all of us to come that away without sin without any problems or insight that we would have come into being all right our body our soul would have been eternal with our body and our spirit would not been eternal and then we could go because it was already dire in the garden the tree of life was there for mankind to go eat of that tree and it would have produced the glorification or whatever you want to call it into our bodies you know but we know we didn't come that away but that's the way God wanted it that was his example now we're going to read a quote if we get over far enough in the message where brother Adam says to be born of the word in spirit is to take you back like you should have been in the beginning no to be born to the word espírita to take you back to that so that's a promise if he started his church our people you know we want to call it children more than saying church because we don't want to use church back dark so we he started his family with eternal life in their soul a body and a spirit that needed it and the sin came it came through the point of Eve and her memory reason causes sometimes that Satan could penetrate and bring it to the wrong place alright so we've had to battle ever since we covered that in a lot of messages trying to get down to a point to word that we could talk about the new birth all right now see then that's what God wants okay the new birth brings eternal life to you in your soul all right what's your body and spirit is still of the world right but your soul is eternal now what did Adam fall from he never fell from eternal life as we try to make it if he did he died and went to hell so you'd be in bad shape he fell from the point that he never brought forth an eternal body her manifestation could come forth in his body all right so what is the redemptive plan that you talk about in the seals I thought we believe that the Prophet said everything Adam lost all right he said Jesus regained all right it's going to be restored right it's going to be brought to that seat in the redemptive plan that when it's finished then it will go back like it was because we'll be in eternity you have the Millennium is kind of a stopover that you'll be there with eternal the bride now with eternal life living in body spirit and soul in the millennial reign all right Lisi didn't step into the future home all right so then it shows by going to the future home that God had more in his plan and purpose than to just bring us into this world and even just to bring us and let us come to eternal life in body spirit and so he's going to take us to an eternity where we can get a message the Prophet said appear down through the ages after this world is over all right so it's gonna listen want something to look forward to okay so now as I said now get the point then the way God wanted it he started it we ought to return back to the way it was when he started it then we can go from there own and we can talk about Redemption in that way all right see when we get to that point okay now follow it then so then we come down to a position now and we were talking about it the last couple of messages of talking about that eternal life begins when you believe the same way your new birth begins when you believe it's not in full reality maybe you that's not the word for it I don't understand it ain't market but I know it ain't in manifestation until you receive it all right see then when it comes in to receiving it then you can believe all right now we'll get back to it in a minute and go back through it of what the new birth really is but now see I want to make these statements so you'll follow the point I believe the Bible and the prophet of God they taught the new birth taught it correctly all right I've got a quote laying here from the will read it in a minute from the future home that were he from the beginning from the beginning he said I never changed yet we say this and we say that and we go this way he said he never changed he said he'd never changed one hour older and doctrine all right now do we believe that see I believe that this as well as I believe John 3:16 I believe that just as well as I believe Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelations Tim 7 you said yeah no no no I went over that with you and over and over it come and show me where he changed his doctrine now not made human mistakes error speeches or doings or towns or counties let's show me where he changed his doctrine because if you showed me where he changed his doctrine then we don't need to follow him Oh your your your I know but I'm an odd person but I believe that but that's who I believe I don't believe he changed his doctor my whole life is based on the fact that he didn't see then that away then I know how I'm not gonna argue with nobody about what they think he miss here he done that way no no I'm gonna believe exactly what I've always believed the messenger the human being had human errors in things as a human being but the message is the word of God it can't be tampered with the message now the message you get on over there and you'll try to quote it but just I'll run ahead we see then you get over you say but the message in the messenger one now how are you gonna make that if you're saying that the wrong way you've got the message in the messenger is one you gotta bread around being God so you say get it right the messenger could make human errors the human man the messenger but the message he brought is perfect and like I said there the other day on her emphasizing it you said yeah but he talked to a white horse rider nobody know where that ever preached the truth about the white horse rider it was sealed up in the Word of God and God winked at man's ignorance who tried to play around to try to figure it out learn accursed Larkin actually taught the white horse rider was the Antichrist before brother Branham ever come along but he wouldn't know prophet he didn't have no message to bring you except what Sean Cho said did he have a message well it's brother over here he's got signed what did he have a message he said silent world what did the Prophet say he said if you take it don't matter what happened now I'm trying to get this in my memory he said it doesn't matter what happens or goes on or whatever they claim if they'll come forth with the same old message then what would you say yeah but you're trying to get to the same old message now listen to what he's saying you try to bring the same you come out and try to preach Luther's message as the rapture you can't do it so then let's get it in the right order to understand okay now see then that's why I believe that the Bible and the prophets message declares that the new birth is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that puts you into the body of Christ which is what Jesus taught in John 3 that you must be born again and is exactly what took place on the depth in the column now that's a bold statement to make in there but I conclude that's right yeah but I brother I can read you where he said if I agreed or he said then just remember he's the Prophet I'm not you're not so you know we take words we take the word he and say I can give you a verbatim yeah but if it ain't of Revelation what is it okay and we're gonna get down to the revelation in a minute no that's I was intending to keep on going in a line I had to draw back all right so bear with me a little bit and see to be born again I believe according to the prophets message and the Bible that it emphatically declares that you must go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit to be in the body of Christ to have eternal life and we're not talking about foolish virgins to get it later when I told my dad we're talking about here now ok so don't run out we'll see all right now see then you must go through the three steps of grace and by going through those three steps butter brown and set it on the future home yeah I got one we won't jump over a little bit so we want to get this point then we'll back up to something in the scriptures that I want you to read with me okay but listen go to number one be so you can see when I put a 1 a 1 B that means I got on this 1 2 3 4 and then something happens and I get this and where am I gonna put it I have to go rewrite all them ones and threes and threes so I just go to a 1 a 1 B 1 C you know just take that away sorry but listen to what he says now because we claim to believe that he's the Prophet all right so let's just get what he's a saying and he says here starting on paragraph 86 of the future home I live that title I've heard very little priests about it in the line that it's written that's an odd title the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride oh but we're not earthly we're up in heaven we always was eternally come on notice how God makes it plain to us and if that wasn't a great confirmation of a good confirmation a good a great loving blessing from God when I seen this and see that since the boy first time ever Christ dealt with me I've always talked those three stages of grace you see yeah but I can show you where he said this here or he said this here that was 1964 okay I've got another one didn't bring it for them too but on paragraph 28 of the seeds he'll not be hired with a shook 1965 he said I never changed one iota in my doctrine now I've told you I believe he growed in grace and knowledge I believe he groped an understanding of the doctrine well yet he never changed the doctrine called you can't have a growth development I'd be like a baby you feeding as a baby and then when he gives about 10 or 12 year old it jumps off it becomes a monkey or a dog or a cat you'd be changing what you're trying to raise see don't don't do that with the gospel now watch what he says now the first step is repentance toward God then followers that is water baptism water baptism repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism Fowler's showing that repentance was genuine are to remit our our PI sins that has nothing to do with the future sin justification shuts off you PI sins that's nothing to do your future it just cuts the scene though all right now getting the point of what I'm saying getting the point that he always talked the three stages so he always told justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit okay you say yeah but he said just now you're the one that's correcting me you don't get that I say something I'm tell you to read it this way and then you come up but I got there well you're the one that's correcting him and you're accusing me of correction him okay sorry nothing to do with the future you know the remains repentantly about two thousand times Jesus cried what for a remission taking away of PI sins has nothing to do with the future just your sins has been chopped off what you did you can't repent for what item done you never done it Adam did you just get forgiveness for what you've done the old nature is still dire even though you've repented you've asked God to forgive you no sins are gone but the old nature is still there so see there's for the problem with people they come to the altar they repent of their sins it chops off their PI sin they think they got everything and they're not talked it's got to get it something else look he talks to get some bright board and watch what he said I'm a long ways from being an artist here's a human heart here's a human heart now I would say only one thing right there you say yeah but you're gonna know I'm gonna tell you what I believe I believe that's the same human heart that he drugged it's in two stages one of them shows that the heart and the snake the other one shows the Dove your race is just out of this over here it's all taken care of you come forth with the dog that's the only thing and I'll tell you there's always been my thought to that you have your so it's alright here's the human heart here's the human heart now this one over here has a snake in it that's sin he has his life this one over here has a dove in it which is the Holy Spirit here he has life well this one here he has malice hatred in that's what is causing it it is this is this fella here well you see there's something else causing the doing so watch it now well this one over here has love and joy and long-suffering that's what does it down here then when you are asked are your forgiven of your sins you only done this taking that away right now you can take the snake out if you want to our lines of sin we can draw it out and do this it takes out sin but the old root of evil still there that's what we're going to get to read them bringing this but when you're asked you're forgiven you they send you only done that's taken that away but the thing that made you do it is still here still that that's the old root of evil it's still there notice then you repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if he gave you of your sin notice right then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness to think right taking away sanctification is a Greek compound Greek word which means cleanse and set aside for service then the next comes the baptism mother fire and the Holy Ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost inside then you bring forth the same life that this is because that's it all right now once notice in the natural birth when a woman gives birth to a baby the natural life types of spiritual life then a woman gives birth to a baby the natural the first thing happens it's breaking the water in blood then spirit the life in the door grab the little feller spanking her run claps his hands and and the way he goes screaming water blood spirit now when a baby is born into the kingdom of God he comes the same way water blood spirit okay now he said that justification chops off you pi sins but what caused you to do it still which is the old root of evil right the old root of evil goes out of you okay now you can have these two if you want them then pull them up faced with a message called dedication which would be one see it in that heart still desires the root of evil to do wrong because the trees just cut down the root of evil is there how does it go out he can he can only be forgiven for what he done not what Adam done and on the aspergillus now what does it come to sanctification comes and cleans cleanses that heart from sin and roots out ever element of sin you remember Jesus the unclean spirit goes out of a man it walked in my place is secret wrath trying to find the unclean spirit goes out at sanctification come on one day we'll just read it questions and answers on the older ghosts he talking about Martin Luther the thing he preached that it's all right but you've got to be sanctified cleanse the root of evil taken out of you by the blood of Jesus Christ all right so now that unclean spirit goes out at sanctification but what kind of an individual are you jesus said it you find he comes he finds a house swept and garnished then he comes back in the what when out comes back in and it's worse because you don't the prophet covered it then the reason it's worse of seven times worse it becomes a religious demon and what is a religious demon he tells you you're saved I repented I baptized I've done well said I'm sanctified I quit this now quit that I don't do this and don't do that all that's gone from me I don't know about that Holy Ghost in time what's happened something come back in and is speaking back out be careful what you do in that situation because I contend and believe that that's where the biggest portion of the world is or the religious world is today they're certainly not at the new birth I mean we're not throwing off on how many of you are here what's over there that's group over here I don't preach like that and you know better I preach here but you know yourself the biggest portion of the world of the millions and millions and billions of so-called Christians that they're not born again well that's you and you go talk to them and just talk a little bit and see what they're born again or not it ain't no bother to make oh they don't matter it's not anything to me I'm not talking to them out there I'm talking here I won't mean you to understand we've got to go through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost which puts the life of God inside of us and run around them even covers in future home you just think about it you think about a person that's justified and sanctified we just read a statement did you notice it but a random says the Holy Ghost and fire comes and burns out oh that's left if you're repetitive he sins if the root of evil is going out what's left you is that enough you me what's left us right that's it don't want to go along with the word don't want to follow the rest of it all right come on yeah but that should be enough to let you know where I stand on that part all right and get it to the base is then that you can follow I never noticed it I want to I want them to pull up number one hey I had read this read this of John three I've always contended that Abraham that Nicodemus and Jesus didn't have a five-minute conversation they came together and they discussed things and as they were discussing Dining's then Jesus says you must be born again so evidently Nicodemus wanted to know what he talked right we know that you're a teacher come from God no man can do these things except God be with him right all right but think about it he wouldn't have five minute sermon it was over quite a period of time that's no problem I'm just trying to make a point to you then we think he run in and said well Jesus what do you believe you must be born again I don't understand Jesus told him exactly how to be born again when he said you must be born again he told him how like no I said the other day now he told him that where it couldn't even happen because there was no way it could happen at that time he had to go die but that's what Jesus was telling him let's read it and see there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God where no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with it pretty good pretty good discussion right a pretty good point that he's making he gave him the height to the teachers he gave him the height of knowing that God had to be with him he just didn't say you must be born again and cut him off that's what I want you to read jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus answered to him how can a man be born when he's old in the end of the second time into his mother's wound and be born jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit he's explaining to Nicodemus what he needs to go through to be born again now listen Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goes so he's every one that is born of the Spirit Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be jesus answered and said unto Him art thou master of Israel no it's not these things now if you understand what I'm getting at now Jesus is gonna tell him exactly what he needs to do and tell him what he's gonna do cause this is Nicodemus is still talking John 3 was the Lord Jesus talking to Nicodemus not to your name to Nicodemus but come on you asked him we couldn't do jesus saith unto Him are there a master of Israel no it's not these things verily verily I say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness and what you if I've told you earthly things and you believe not how sure you believe if I tell you of heavenly thought talking to Nicodemus no man has ascended up to heaven look what he said but he that came down from heaven even the Son of Man which is in heaven he's still talking to Nicodemus as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up what's he explaining he's telling him what he come to do and what it's going to take he's gonna take his death the one from heaven to come to earth and die for mankind he tells me more about the new birth than just to say you must be warned again I never never put that together never saw it - no - that night there brother faughn he was bringing the scripture and I said oh that's Nicodemus he explained it to Nicodemus whosoever now watch him and his Moses lifted serpent in the wilderness even so much the Son of Man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life then he's telling him he needs to be born again and he's telling him what he needs to do is believe on him right watch him for God so loved the world anybody else has quoted that scripture but did we ever thank he's quoting it to Nicodemus you've coating it he's telling Nicodemus or our God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life that's it our God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world was it the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already why because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God a couple more verses go down below there who was he talking to who was the great scripture that says for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son was to Nicodemus Nicodemus couldn't understand it right but he plainly tells him of his birth his life and why that he would even say God must be with you Nicodemus recognized every bit of that but then he told him what's he got sitting out his son into the world to condemn the world went to the world through him might be say he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he didn't believe that Jesus Christ was Almighty God they come to die for the sins of mankind that was - Nicodemus there wasn't no five minute sermon was over a long period of time maybe hours they said and discussed and he explained to him what he come to do Nicodemus winds up and gets up walks out because he can't understand do we understand do we understand search this was preaching to Nicodemus giving him a change giving him a change but he couldn't follow it I never thought about it where he said for God so loved the world he gave you don't about I thought it hasn't been it to me and you and it is come on that's to you and me but who was it talking to to start with to the man that come to talk to him and he couldn't understand it Nicodemus was the teacher the greatest of all of them it can't be understood by intellectual conception what about Nicodemus getting all of that put before him and offered all of that but turned it down and Peter that couldn't even sign his own name accepted it what was the difference won by an intellectual conception was following in doing which was Nicodemus a great man but a render said he would be given eternal life for the standard he took for the Lord Jesus Nicodemus in Khmer used to delegate eternal life but you're not can't depend on the fact that waiting for eternal life you know saying well hope we hope we gotta get settled here it's gonna be on this side where we get it settled then if there's anything there that's left up to him all right but do you get it now the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and being born again is the one in the same it is an individual being baptized into the body of Jesus Christ and giving him eternal life now we get to it and it to three weeks it'll be a thought that we've got to pick up well why would brother Branham say certain things why would he explain things in a way that sounds like it's totally contrary to the other statements that he's made Nicodemus is a perfect example he said right there listen to every bit of it and Jesus said how don't you know I mean and he's seen enough babies born and you seen the fact that water blood spirit brings a life anything in your own to know what I'm doing and I'm here teaching this is my doctrine my doctrine is you must be born again they said but I just can't understand how you do that we can't be done by Emelec all right now let's pick it up see then by the prophets message the Bible in a statement I might want to go then by putting them all together I believe the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the morning any experience is the one on the side All Right see you take it and you'll say yeah but I believe it's an uber starts this way then this comes in this way go a little further and they go through the further you can't use it that way you can use a growth development but not change something to make this to be one thing in this to be the psycho thing and this to be the third time you can't do that you got to come to it like it is all right listen so we read it will read it again going at the number one now we'll get started on her one notes instead of the way the NC and D and listen to what cuz we read this over and over this is out of the church age book page 144 some learning church age which is the church age book he explains where people misunderstands him when he gives an altar call for people to come I I cast the net to respond to the people I asked him to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit he says my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say that believe that I am inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they are already born again so when I fight those who are spirit filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones surge forward to deal with the people in such matter as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speaking in to speak in tongues okay well because he doesn't went through one thing they gotta go over to another thing okay they don't teach justification is speaking in tongues they teach the baptism of the holy ghost he's speaking in tongue I saw one the other day that I'd never seen you ever heard run around and say this he said the Baptist believe in water babblers water baptism unto regeneration that's power phrase anybody very close I told you something all the time over and over cuz were coming from go find you a Baptist and talk to them you can go from Baptist Church to a Methodist Church they accept your baptism you go to Baptist to anywhere that but if you go from a Methodist to the Baptist you're going to get baptized they don't matter father son Holy Ghost ain't got nothing do with it so when brother round said and I said Lord I've always wondered was that the way it was he said they're actually believing that's the water baptism under regeneration I said well okay well could we believe and what did they try to get him to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and I want to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place now look at all you exactly's exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the Spirit of God is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one in the same so there's your new birth baptism I mean new birth you know baptism in the Holy Ghost and born-again experience put together one time he said that's what took place at penny college I've taught you that over and over and over those disciples for three and a half years went through justification of sanctification but they never received the baptism in the Holy Spirit until the upper room you can talk about being born again and start out and brother Adam does I gave you these he says your new birth begins when you believe I believe and he got him to do with the answer to the question the question is while he will get on over later and say I can prove that you're born into the body I that you're you I could prove that you're born again I believed it and said baptized into the body for the gift that sounds contrary but the answer is that it'll be taken care of it'll be there and you'll see how simple it is but listen so how many times we went over this statement what is the new birth then brother Brandon what is the new birth you say well brother Brandon what is a new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you shook her hand join the church done something different seda Creed promised to say about Kota its Christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon now in a minute we're gonna get to something that we're gonna put two things together the Lord willing so he goes on in Christ the mystery he says what is it it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself the new burns reveals this he says the new birth is Christ is a revelation that God has to reveal to you this great mystery and that's when you earth great mystery and that's the new birth God is known by simplicity and revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person we went through that we've been over this statement from Patmos vision they've got these and they're put on the Internet where people can read them even if they don't use them here but they'll catch up and you can read it and he says while you're talking on Revelation ask him to give you a revelation of it where it can only be known by revelation now watch all these scriptures appear and you can only be saved by revelation well brother Dale I didn't get no revelation when I got saved you didn't for some reason come to the altar I've tried to make it so simple you didn't for some reason come to the altar and said I want to be saved something's dealing with me well something is revealing to you that you need to be saved why don't you take it that way you don't have that word or I didn't get the seals when I got born again no no you won't I've said it and I mean it and I've stuck with it for 50 years every person in the world hypothetical statement but every person in the world could stand it to faith in the father's and they'd still be no change of the body until the message would come for that to take place your wonderful world to live in but a staff stages it's got to be developed so you can only be known and you can only be saved you have knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's reveal to you what no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost now how did we cover that we gave you a lot of them I had a lot more to read the no man can say that jesus is a crop no man can call Jesus the crop without the Holy Ghost without the baptism of the Holy Ghost then it's not you saying that Jesus is the Christ it's the father speaking out of you to say it because it's my revelation then that's what I mean you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved into it's revealed to you no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is the Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost you don't know it yourself until the Holy Spirit has revealed it to you and he's becoming you no man can call Jesus the Christ no man could call Jesus the Christ without a revelation then we went through those others I want you to read this one so pull up number six now you know what will be saved by Revelation so now what is the new birth this is from spoken words of regional seed now for the birth of the word is Christ not have polluted our denominations the early church no denomination is just the word and spirit irrigated what happened Jesus sowed the word right the disciples went to the upper room the word had been sown the Holy Ghost came and irrigated the word they got certain things like Peter saying thou art the Christ God could reveal that to him but that was not a born again new birth experience he could say to the like a little woman touch the hem of his garment names could be revealed to mankind it was revealed to Mary he said be it unto me according to thy word but they never brought the new birth right so now look just a word and spirit irrigated brother God laid the word down like that and the Holy Spirit irrigated it and there she went she brought forth children what is the new birth it's the birth of the word what is the baptism when the Holy Ghost the fulfillment of the word it was spoke of all the way through he came to birth in a group of people she just told him you to receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you all those things would happen so now what's he saying look at number 7 you must be born again now folks teachers will bring folks verse true prophets will bring the birth bring the word the birth of the word Christ false prophets will bring false birth the birth of churches and that birth of the word what is the new birth read your simple parable of the sower of the seed the son of man was a sort of the seat I preached this for 40 years to the son of man is the only sower of the seed now you want to go in for ours in the Bible with that and take every parable and relate to it that Jesus Christ sowed and if that parable is talking about you and me and we must believe it is as we are the children of the kingdom right then if it is that parable is speaking of the fact of you and I becoming the children of God there was a God's a whole plan and purpose all right now think about it look at this when I was spoken word go to number 8 Oh God's sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 the new birth to ever person that made them a son of God brought them to John 3:6 3 and that you must be born again don't stop reading to be born of the water and spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again unto the place of where you should have been at the beginning now do you remember what I said while ago you remember what I said start with God started his church with Adam and Eve with eternal life and their soul body and spirit not eternal okay now the new birth brings you to want back like you should have been at the beginning which is what eternal life in your soul body and spirit still of the world now he can come on the scene to start dealing with the redemption of the body and the spirit realm the cleansing thought what are you reading see that's the reason Christ died bring us right back again to were sons of God because right back to sons and daughters of a living God the new birth brings that and don't bring the growth development to Adam handed ad in the garden know that rose with a statue of a perfect man we've got a long ways to go but we got to get at the bottom of the pyramid does ever start cuz if you don't you're gonna be like most of the people of the message like one brother said he said see there it says Holy Spirit right up here and said if you believe that that's the new work you got to turn it upside down that was what was that I'm sorry I kind of like what happened the other day even some of you said it his brother Dale used to tell us someone's hopes and now we believe it first hell don't you hurt it now listen so what is the new birth it's the word planted that you hear and the Holy Ghost it comes to irrigate that word or make it alive right it brings you to the new birth it brings you to a position of what faith faith brings you to a position of faith so we're gonna get we're just trying to get a little background to bring it down to faith then you're at the bottom of the pyramid we'll go up I asked you to read brother Branham you see him saying that's got to get to have faith you got to get born again now faith if you listen to rage you'll see what he's saying he's right in the beginning to where he starts now some of the statements is on over later so just listen to it read it I'm asking you I'm gonna try to get away from the sarcastic statements but I can't have it if you ain't got enough gumption to go read and listen don't come and tell me I'm wrong and for heaven's sake don't go tell somebody else I'm wrong if I'm right I asked you to read the book I give you the quotes but I'm accused of everything in the book out of it not one thing about it I'll fight for you till the day I die to try to get you the word to where you can see it you may not like me you may not understand me you may hate my ways it takes one thing about it come and show me where I'm wrong I don't mean that statement to be are sarcastic Reena if you're telling me and you show me I'm wrong I can be corrected but I'm not gonna listen to your system a little well brother random saying that we hear any better Adam said it over here you know all the message together because you got to remember one time I don't care what you quote run around and say it listen I don't care what you quote that he said a verbatim quote you can't make that contrary to worry said in the that we started on the future home then I talked three processes from the beginning and that I never changed in doctrine now you make them fit we know you don't see what I've done for the past month or so he's taking statements brother run and say it placing them in order and showing you you know the exactly what he's talking about he said you're no new birth begins when you believe that's exactly 100 percent correct it's not in the full manifestation he's like a child begotten let's talk about faith for a minute I think go to number nine henkle works his faith express and remember remember what we're saying back up you can't be saved without a revelation and it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not a revelation of you to you brother told me he said I see Who I am I said and brother for any quarter to other daily my brother said I see Who I am now baby I can see who Jesus is I said you're wrong that's sound good I said you're wrong you've got to see who Jesus is first cuz it's Jesus gonna make you what you are so it's Jesus first so what is a new birth the revelation not of you the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you Joyce a revelation now let's get on this revelation to me now faith is a revelation from God that faith is a revelation that's where I want to stay or just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by His grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith listen you're a how faith is gift to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the revelation faith is a revelation okay wait a number-10 rapture but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's been revealed its scuse me it's revealed to her and to Revelation the true Bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture I think we've waited 50 years don't you look there it is a revelation for the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith now get to statement then go to statue a very bland you cannot have a revelation without to be in faith so faith is the new birth which is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you who was revealed to Abel right come on faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham they could call anything contrary to what hid what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't sure now faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God the church is built upon the revelation the whole entire body okay now what does Hebrews 11:1 say let's see how sharor this new birth is let's find out how all of this all the years that people had just taught will the new birth the new birth is the new birth anew then you'll see why brother Brown said that's why the baptism when Holy Ghost been so incorrectly talk so if it's the baptism been incorrectly the new birth has been incorrectly taught the born-again experience has been incorrectly talk it's just something you believe something you do something you do shout you're speaking tongue what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost let's see if you can really hold on the one evidence from the Holy Ghost really is to look what he says on now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence those things not seen that's an evidence faith is an evidence we don't read the prophet mentioned don't worry about just hold on faith isn't evidence what is your evidence of the whole to go what is your evidence of the holy go I see how did I cried I spoke in tongues I believe the Prophet I did then words out in evidence words out of faith when Satan can impersonate every one of them you've got to have something in your experience that it's Satan cannot impersonate if not did you don't have a substance you got a flim-flam the idea of a mental conception sorry look what he says now speak to this mountain number two well he says now by God over our hearts to this understanding the faith is not a myth neither is it something that's a you just imagined faith is positive faith is the substance and doesn't say faith is a substance faith is the this I'm not an English part so don't worry about it but I know that D has a lot to do with it because I did know this in the Baptist Church John was called John the Baptist because they wasn't but one we know that in the Baptist Church that there was one John the Baptist so they mean singular right the faith is not a minute needed asepsis assume you're my party faith is a substance just the same as this glass is now where do we get to your substance and your experience being the same let's see if you can hold us that real see if your substance your faith and your experience will all turn out to be the same come on faith is the substance just the same as this Lyceus it's the same as this book is faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence now how many how many quotes do you need some run around their faith is it positive something you have and he said it's even like this if you're hungry and want something to eat and I give you a quarter he said that's the purchasing power of the loaf of bread that's the substance that's how real a substance but you can't shorten nobody else go try to tell somebody about your revelation doses together let's talk go get you it now not throwing I want to go get you good Baptists or something and saying I want you to know Lord spoke to me one day and said he's real mmm might be to you and that's all it is to you it was to nobody else in the world that day if it was there was some personal to themselves okay let's go same as his vice role at home we ain't finished with 13 we got a good better read role 13 yeah we just finished well okay well in 30 roll it up until we get to the read I give the regiment what my subject is how faith in God now we're tired of God's blessed word that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word or of the word that's good in hearing by the word or other word now first there's also an experience what is your experience the faith is also an experience in many times faith is had listen by a former experience makes faith grow i believe that don't you former experience makes it grow so then you've got something to hold on to and you stand on that to get something else as it grows okay faith being the substance of things Oh far the evidence of things not seen so many people fail to find the real meaning of what faith is some people believe that faith is some sensation are some emotion I see how did that crying spoken tell me come on but the Bible said that faith is the substance of things hoped for now some things it's a mental conception of the word but that is not right faith is the substance that a mental conception don't you but that's not right faith is a substance faith is not a myth faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence now look to have an evidence it must be a substance if you got an evidence tonight and you can't make it in short as a substance then I have to say it I doubt your evidence I'm evil what are we gonna do to have an evidence you claiming evidence of something don't you the reason you're born again all right he's your evidence a substance if not why's your face get red when I say that you know what I mean can you say I have an evidence brother Dale that is a very substance of the gospel my evidence will fit ever born-again believer that's in the body of Jesus Christ will yours because my evidence is exactly what the Prophet said it's whether or not the spirit in you agrees I love that wording agrees a lot of them agree but I do while they're agree stops and they don't agrees with word right to have an evidence they just land on my desk for about two months to have an evidence it must be a substance how sure is your evidence so it is not just something that you imagine in your mind it's something that absolutely you have it's something that you possess in your own being and what is it it's the evidence of things that you have hope for what is your hope I don't know them one hope that's in Jesus Christ now all the things he does I can have hoping but the first start I gotta have hope in Jesus Christ because I can't trust nothing else he's got to start in Jesus Christ that's why when you get the new birth you're only gonna be born again as an individual in the body of Christ now there's a group collective this is Gentiles it's evidence that you have hope for it's the evidence of things that you'd not do not have as yet I'm reading him cologne which you have the authority of God to say that you have it now how many years have you heard brother Dale preach this you got to confess it before you can get it nobody in the Bible ever received the new birth without hearing the word first show me Bible or anyone without hearing the word from somebody a statement from somebody mama said it daddy said short to me you say with the prophets I don't mind you going that way remember if he's a prophet prophet he connects his experience back to the Prophet before him so he's already hurt he said when I wasn't Elijah he never heard nobody I questioned that thought because God made contact with it he knew I loved him listen it's not something that you kindly push yourself to I've noticed so much of that in my meetings that people try to work themselves up into something to make them believe now you can't do that you're just beating the ire but faith is something that's just no no but faith is something that's just as calm and settle as it can be it's taking God at His Word and having assurance in your heart the God is able to keep what he has said that he would do and will perform everything that he said he would do I've noticed that many times people think they must be must be prayed for that's all right we should pray for each other or that their hands might be are some evangelists hands must be ministered that's alright that'll bring contacts and so forth of faith but real unadulterated faith is taking God and His Word real faith is taking God in his word what is your evidence of the Holy Ghost now we're gonna say a little bit let's get it now your faith is the substance of the substance of things you hope for and it's an experience and don't you see what happened Jesus so do word they walk with him for three and a half years held in that position the unclean spirit drove out all the time had the ministry went out and heal the sick cast out Devils if ever but then they had to go to the Upper Room to wait I like their experience don't you pretty good experience just stayed for three and a half years he left mom and daddy look at Peter goes on their wife said honey I'll see you later where you going I don't know who are you going with I'm following this guy I mean you say you just making them all cry I'm not making a mockery I'm just telling God's honest truth that's what he done remember they didn't have no welfare take care of his wife while he was gone you hear him okay I'm silly but is it the truth look at what all of those apostles done and walked with him in the word one day that word was made alive neither Holy Ghost has come here bring your remembers whatsoever things I see it but rest it even teach you things to come what is your evidence is it faith if it is faith is the substance faith is the revealed Word of God right so my evidence has to be the revealed Word of God did you get my evidence of the Holy Ghost has to have to do with the word being revealed now you tell me what it is oh it's just believing the Prophet was a prophet the devil beat you go start that see that's one thing folks I wish you'd be with me I don't play with you in games I say it like it is faith is a substance the substance isn't evidence now you go to court you walk in the courtroom and you say and they'll say what's the evidence they don't say what's your faith right what's the evidence well I got evidence that so-and-so stole this from me because I went to their house and found it and I got I got evidence here now and we lay all this out it's ok but now watch it can't be what somebody else says remember no man called Jesus Christ it can't be that you don't go into court with hearsay evidence I only seen one time they've done that our life a told judge we're sitting on that jury and they kept throwing up things and throwing up things and you know he's got a right to do it's right why levy said y'all hold it a minute he said there were one of these to do it said let's just have fun said the floors open bring up all the circumstantial evidences you want a brain they shed them every one up circumstantial evidence won't do in the court neither will it doing God's Word yours experience must match your evidence that you've got right the evidence you've got is your faith that you have that's been revealed to you that Jesus is the Christ if they've been revealed to Jesus graph you don't have an evidence you have what somebody else says you never hear say forget what I'm saying get what the Prophet is saying if you've got a substance you've got an evidence you've got an evidence you've got a substance something this real something that you're not afraid you're not afraid to tell somebody what you believe well I'll tell you what you just wouldn't understand you wouldn't understand my my my my my ways and end times so I ain't only really don't need me me trying to explain to you because you wouldn't understand me I've always told you my evidence and it's never been on experiences of something that's happened he's never been the dead raised he's never been the sick healed he's never been God appear into me he's never been an angel three times in my home I don't mind telling you it's never been none of that none of that is my evidence because Satan can impersonate every one of them but there's one thing the Prophet said he can't do he can't bring the word word by word he can't be the revealed word he thinks he is but he can't be so what is your substance how real is your God is he a real substance or a myth is he somebody you can talk to in contrary to the people of the message that he can talk back to you is that contrary to most people they don't talk it I put that out I'm blunt the word come to the Prophet we talked about that we're talking about a house blowed away and God said get out of it we're talking about gifts and callings we're going to get into that in the point where brother Randall covers that when you're baptized into the body you're baptized into gifts cool but he says now you can talk about Satan and impersonation he says you can't have a gift without having the Holy Ghost then he talked about impersonators I know you cannot have a real genuine gift from God that causes him now you got that in the right order you hold if you don't you gonna run away right faith is the substance of things over everything I have a hope for is in this Bible and the message that has been brought to us in that I have a hope of an eternal life in the land beyond the rivers what I call it I have a hope and a change of these bodies I have a hope in this world even coming to a redemptive plan to be washed off and used of God at least I've got a hope you know Abraham had a hope his with a substance that okay you won't get on that off Abraham's hope was a substance it NoHo he didn't hope against hope like what brother Richard Wilson said that time better he said our Abraham was taking that boy up there to offer and said just remember when he burning me to have a spoonful of ashes he burned it he burned me to that smoother life he said that was morning headstart Lee right to start with he only had faith then he had at least a spoon of Isis that's some real faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of not things that you can't explain to nobody else but it's within you let it random did you keep your salvation when your wife died and your daughter died he said no he said my salvation kept me he had a substance if you have the new birth today you have the substance of the gospel dwelling within you the substance of the gospel itself living in you come on musicians come on faith we're gonna get to that that's what I asked you to read statue of a perfect man and listen to him real careful where he says you have have faith and be born again I've got one let's see what I do with it oh yeah Macy's called perfect faith 1963 so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance of faith listen to him he is isolated from the entire world he said well that's only brother Branham and all you know the prophets or something let's read what he says he is isolated from the world and becomes a new creature in Christ when you become a new creature in Christ you have a substance faith you have the substance of the gospel dwelling within you which is a revelation of faith he's asked the lady for the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ that now darn now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just a pastor the Deacons trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with God alone every individual walks in the world with God alone you're baptized into the kingdom and there there's nobody in there but you and God he gives the others orders and you pack him out whatever he said there's not a shadow of doubt no order you walk right on if the Lord says that there's nobody in the world can take you out of it you go right on just the same talk you out of this Q now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail the faith never failed yes he was a Miss mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others perfect faith well brother you believe you have perfect faith I believe I'm born again if I'm born again that's perfect faith now not what I want what I need no but what I got is perfect faith if you have the new birth what you got is perfect faith just hold on to it exorcise it what do we got listing he might have innate goodness and mercy shall follow all the day all the days of my surely goodness and Java needs shall follow all the day all the day [Music] and I should dwell in the house of the Lord forever a feast [Music] surely goodness and mercy shall follow all the days all the day

experience relates right down to the Word of God because we believe that your word has been sewn into our hearts and you've come and irrigated it as the Prophet said and quicken it to us and you said when that happens it takes us back like it should have been in the beginning we thank you revealing it to us go home with us and take care of everybody give us nature nee may our hearts be joined together in you in Jesus name Jesus has a tablespread where the Saints of God are fed he invites
