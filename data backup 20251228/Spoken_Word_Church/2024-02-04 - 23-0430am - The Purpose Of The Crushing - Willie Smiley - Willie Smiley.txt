let's give the Lord a hand of Praise this morning amen amen it's good to be in the service of the Living God this morning I got a brother at our church he always say I'd rather be in the house of the Lord than the best hospital it is in in the country so I kind of agree with him on that it's it's always good to be uh in the house of the Lord wherever I am you know I heard brother uh Dale talking about the different ones and I app I appreciate the mediums that we have today of uh Facebook and and all of these different uh Avenues to be able to especially as you get older and feeble in the body but it's just something about it brother brandom say when a when a man get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he can't hardly wait till the church doors open and and I'm that kind of person I I remember uh Contracting Co a couple of times and having the quarantine that was misery for me you know trying to trying to watch the service at home I ain't good at that I you know one time I had a brother that was preaching at the church and man I was struggling bad before I know it I was up in the bed and all I could hear I was gone so I I appreciate the Lord this morning uh let's get our Bibles out we'll read a place in the scripture it's good to be here um to be in fellowship with brother uh Dale and brother Samuel I I met them some years ago at at brother um burle's Camp I don't know if I met him before then but I know did yeah and uh brother Dale got down and preached for us and it's been a long long time so I I was surprised when my brother-in-law like he brother Dale I want you to come up in in Minister I was like okay praise the Lord but over the years I I had had the privilege of uh uh being able to uh like I said I appreciate the internet and all I I got a chance to actually hear some good preaching from Brother Dale it's it's not many people that I listen to uh but I I always used to find myself um listen to to the pastor then over the years just a Elder in the faith uh I still feel like you know um I ain't much of a Preacher but it's it's always good to be able to listen to people that you got confidence in you know somebody that's that's going to be in the straight narrow uh uh go go you know going to cut you a little bit but it's going to be right it's it's it's going it's going to be right so I I salute him amen uh this morning and it's a a privilege to be able to share uh the plat platform that he's built over 40 some years and that that's something that you know as a servant of God you don't you don't take for granted amen a a man like brother d uh so we we like to read a scripture have a word of prayer and just see how the Lord will lead us all right amen uh Philippians chapter 4 verse one verse of scripture uh no maybe we we'll read from the 18th and the 19th when you have it say Amen it says but I have all and abound I am full having received of uh and I'm not going to try to mess that word up for you the things which were sent from you an odor a sweet smell a sacrifice accepted well pleasing to God but my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus amen uh let us have a word of prayer gracious Heavenly Father we just come this morning to give thanks and praise for allowing us this opportunity to be able to come and to be able to Fellowship around uh Eagles food we just thank you for the invite we pray that you anoint us a fresh anoint my body Lord in my in I thinking Lord the enemy been just kind of fighting me since yesterday in the flesh but Lord I got the victory Lord and uh we just want to pray for the Saints back home and brother Jack and uh pray that you just continue to have your way we ask these and other prayers and blessings in Jesus name we ask it amen amen amen you may be seated this morning um we just like by the grace of God to use as a topic the purpose of the crushing and just a little sub subject that we approached at home uh during the Easter holiday pre- Easter because brother Jack preached the Easter sermon and uh some things that we were just trying to um encourage the church by uh a lot of times I I I realize in working with people I passed it a little bit about 23 years I don't anymore but uh we just kind of assist uh my brother-in-law brother Jack and and just working with the Saints there in westpond beach and just one of the things that I I've I've grown to realize uh and just talking with people and listening to people uh the purpose of things for a lot of people people uh they feel like well this is not necessary and and and that's not necessary uh the word purpose it means the reason for which something is done or created uh for which something exists and and when when we think about God uh be be just be when there was when there was nothing and nobody to uh consult in his mind God uh had purpose for just everything that was was done is that right how many can say Amen to that amen and and you know we we we we're talking about a sovereign God is that right we we're talking about infant knowledge right and and for me I don't I don't think that anything could supersede the knowledge of God the the principles of which God laid things out is that right and so for me now this is me I don't know about anybody else because you know everybody else got their own mindsets and and especially in a day of of of reasoning and and and and just false light and things of that nature we we find that when when people look at at scripture you know they pulling out this and they're pulling out that and this don't mean this don't mean that anymore and and we we're living in a a age of confusion is that right I I think I heard somebody say it you know you just don't hardly know what to call anybody anymore he she they them you know all these these plurals and and just so much so much nonsense that don't coincide with what God's purpose was I mean God in the beginning in his mind he he had family in his mind he purposed when he brought into existence Adam and saw Adam you know was long he brought you know forth Eve from the side of Adam that was the purpose of God that that was to uh establish amen a a a picture and also to show what was in just God's mind because what was in God's what was in God was attributes and and so what we see in Genesis was the expression of the attribute Ro of God right I mean when when you go back to Genesis you see uh a a real standard you you see you see real family you see you see real order is that right is that right you see you see you see perfection in Genesis glory to God now now we working towards that we know by thought these things has been restored we thank God we've had a prophet you know we we we're in a season now where where people are walking away from the word of God and things of that nature and and that's their choice because they're free moral ages that's that's their choice to do that but but to me it shows that people have a lack of understanding that that they miss they they have missed the OB jective of of God sending us a a a prophet and and and what was his motives and what was his his in his his intentions were were all about is that right and and for me it it to kind of show us what was in the mind of God see with with without Genesis and Genesis being the seed chapter of the Bible we wouldn't have no picture righten right we we wouldn't have a picture we wouldn't have anything to look back at then how could you know preaching the scriptures speak of Redemption how could we actually uh use that type of terminology if we had nothing to look back [Music] to right and because we got something that we could look back to we could talk about Redemption right right we could we could we could talk about Redemption we could we could we could uh use this terminology purpose right amen when we see when we see the complete layout of God Amen right oh I like like that we can look back and see a perfect Church Hallelujah that's that's wonderful right amen we we could look back and see things in order things in things in a Oneness right you could see you could see uh families in Oneness and in order and brother Brandon makes a statement in Oneness he say that's a that's a wonderful picture just to paraphrase it right that's a wonderful picture to see everything that that's that's in order right you know the wife with the husbands and husband with wives and them with children yeah right so when I start to look at that man I appreciate God sending a servant because we didn't even have a clue just just you know uh bits and pieces I was able to listen to the uh uh uh Sunday school lesson now who who was that can I can I see who that was amen I I I really do appreciate that uh those those different principles because I wish I had those things when when I was a younger man you know uh growing up before I got married I would have un understand you know I won't go into that boy cuz those things they close to my heart in this season uh be because I'm you know you're never too too old to learn and and grow and and uh you you just got to be a student right at all times you you never no matter how old you are you're never too old to be a student to to be able to learn and and I think these things for a younger generation is it's just so so important right to really be able to comprehend all of these little principles let me get off of that cuz I'm starting to feel I'm starting to feel good on that those are the things I I it's just been close to my heart at at home and just trying to make sure that uh this younger generation don't don't do like you know we did we didn't we had the reveal word but just some some things was missing when I was coming up being a Christian 35 years it was a lot of doctrinal things and and trying to really establish this and then you know I come out of a certain uh a view of the word and uh come into the knowledge of the truth and and you just saw a Clash of the Titans back then you know what I mean and so it it left us kind of uh lacking in certain areas in certain areas you know we were Christians but we we didn't have a full grasp on on you know our roles you know uh what my role would be as as a as a a a Christian and as a husband as a father and and so on and so forth and my wife it's just so much that we didn't we didn't get so you we just kind of went in there blind we went in blind and so we we just kind of made a lot of mistakes you know we made a lot of mistakes that if if we educated ourselves uh from a from younger age and uh not not that things would go smoothly because we we in a contest this morning right we we are still fighting the Devil he's he's still a good adversary that's for sure he's he's still a good adversary but we would we would have known a little bit better how to combat right combat him throw him off a lot of areas we wouldn't made the kind of mistakes that we made right glory to God so I mean even in this season those things are purposed oh yeah purposed I don't think that was by mistake right see my brother had to be crushed a little bit you know so so that uh uh uh somebody else would benefit from his crushing but but like we say there's there's a purpose in in in God always has been right always always has been a a purpose a thought not just something that's random all right we we're not dealing with just random things it God sending us a prophet it wasn't just random right it it it was scriptural see when people look at us and they criticize and all those guys now this is not random we're not here randomly we we we're a part of what God had in his mind what God purpose for for this hour in which we're living in like not just some random group of uh uh carnal minded people that have come together and and gathered in no we could look back to scripture and see where where God had foreordained God used the prophet to speak about another Prophet coming and and with his coming his coming had a purpose right and it it's far beyond belt buckles and all right it's it's so much deeper than than him and and and all of those different things he his in his coming in the purpose of his coming it was to turn us back amen uh to an original an original thought an original program of God right not something that's manmade and man set up and you know hierarchy and all of those different things to turn us back to God himself turn us back to real worship of God glory to God Amen not the worship of humanity but real worship of God by the word I believe that was that was purposeful uh when it come to God but but when we look back to Genesis we we could see the purpose of God right we could see the expression of the attributes of God is that right and and and we could look back and we get a real uh uh good view a good picture you know looking at the fall We Don't Preach apples and things of that nature we we realize we realize what those things were right Eve opened up the wound of her mind and she accepted uh wrong seed right amen she she should have she should have kind of kept going but it it just really shows you uh uh the the intellectual mind and reasoning you can't do that with the devil and I think for a lot of people that have walked away and things of that nature it's it's the same Spirit intellectual men and and trying to reason and instead instead of letting God reveal his plan and purpose to him they they want to kind of of reason and and just kind of make a lot of things personal you know personal attacks and things of that nature but uh we we have something that's far greater than that but but we we we look in Genesis and we find the fall right amen we we we find Eve lustin for a PhD lustin to be to be smart and I I'll just say this and I hope this be okay she broke protocol in doing that right she bypassed her head right she she bypassed her head she bypassed order she broke protocol in in order to to accept something intellectually right because because if she would have went to her head initially I don't believe that she would have gotten in the in the position that she found herself in right and and she probably thought that she had a a a greater understanding than than what Adam had given to her but then she found out oh my it wasn't what I thought it was and and that's just like unbelief come on unbelief really is not what it it is cracked up to be in in in the beginning stages it seemed like man this might not be so bad you know I don't know about y'all but I I didn't really grew up in the backseat of the church um I was kind of what they call the [Music] hoam but it it was by choice it it was it was making bad decision I mean my mother took us to church we didn't I didn't grow up in the message but I kind of my mother was part Apostolic part Baptist she as a kid my grandmother was oldfashioned Pentecost amen and she died that way she didn't she didn't you know change when she died she still had a skirt on and her blouses you know and stuff like that she wasn't showing cleavage and and nah n but that was just too strict for my mother so you know she went to the Baptist Church and uh there there was a little bit more lenient and and things of that nature so I had both you know things coming up but I at a at a young age I I made some bad decisions that that took me by the way of you know the streets and and drugs and and you you won't be able to tell by looking at me now but if you just saw me in 19 1988 you know I was about this big and I was all messed up from crack and some of everything else that I was on but but I but I thank God that that when I actually got converted I got converted in the message Lord the the first day I was working on a a church in West Palm Beach that you know uh I was a part of brother Westco they were building and I'm a drywall finisher by trade and I walked in there that day and I was needing God like you know I you never needed God before I just really without God I would have perished because I was kind of suicidal and everything but you know I'm grateful for God purposing sir right God God send me kn what age knowing what time knowing the season God ordering my steps we used to sing this song order my steps in your word somebody know how to preach with me I like that uh God ordered my steps and I'm so glad that he did is that right amen he he brought me to he brought me to to truth amen is that right he brought forth for change in me amen right that I don't think that I would have gotten in any other uh denominational Church brother Wade told me that I ain't got much time this morning so I I I I'm slow and uh you know I I mean I had to tell them at church I'm I'm not an old old man but I'm not a young young man anymore so I can't spin around and like that like little brother Andrew gloving them they kick and stomping he probably been down the hours by now yeah him and brother Solomon but I'm a little older now so I just don't move as much I just try to I just try to bring out things that you know because one of the things that I've learned over the years we've had a lot of excitement right we've had a lot of excitement and all of that but some times you have to look at where are all of those people yeah where where where are all the people with with the I'm I'm quite sure with the amount of people that have come through those doors and if they would have stayed this place wouldn't even be big enough right amen so so you have to ask the question I'm I'm big on I'm big on asking the questions and it's and it's not it's not ministry right right now I can vouch for that and I ain't even a part of this local assembly it's not what's been preached but it's what's been quickened what what done move from here to here see that makes the difference it's got to move from here to here in order to bring the stability that's needed for for for when you're challenged by the enemy up here yes right one thing I I can't reason enough I ain't that smart I don't have any diplomas or degrees or anything so I have to rely on what's been quickened to me by almighty God is that right so so we we we see the Fallen Genesis is that right and and we we see initially you know Adam trying to do something with within him himself that that was so contrary to uh scripture and what would be the purpose of God right and and I often look at it from this standpoint because there's that there's there's protocol there's there's things that you know brother Brandon priest to message Christ being identified by his characteristics him being identified by 's word is that right and so if if God would have uh justly uh allowed Adam to to uh uh adapt the Fig Leaf religion then that's what it would have been down through history right that that would have been the standard that would have been the program see a Adam had no no ability come on no ability to redeem right glory to God and I heard and I heard I heard this for the first time right here right uh uh where Adam took Eve he still couldn't redeem her right he still couldn't cuz he didn't even know the program of God he still didn't know what was what was didn't in God's mind he couldn't he couldn't see how God was going to use blood down through scripture he couldn't see that so him so him taking Eve never really never redeemed right that was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world there was principles that were going to come into play sir amen after God comes on the scene and make the provision yeah see my God shall supply all see man could not supply the need man could not meet the need for Redemption couldn't do it the intellect the man Adam and all of the work that he put in I guess when we grow on the other side maybe we'll get a chance to see that I'm not you know I don't know but I like to just stand there and watch the work that he put in and and what he done and then God comes down and say Adam where you at you know I'm going be sitting there kind of like this Adam you know just watching it play out Adam where are you right and then Adam realizes this not working this is not working cuz I still kind of feel condemned I don't know about you but I'm going over here you know you can stay there but I'm going over here cuz it's not working something is wrong here some something is wrong right and so when God comes down now now everything is broken yes the harmony amen of the husband and wife broken there Fellowship broken every everything is broken and Adam did not know how to fix it no he brother that that's that's that's kind of like a lot of folk their lives are broken and they be trying to fix it and they be trying to fix stuff and you can't fix it without God see people people wants to bypass the atonements and and the orders and the layouts and structures right and and and try to do things with within themselves and and it don't work you you can't fix yourself I couldn't fix myself is that right glory to God I couldn't couldn't I didn't know how I didn't know where the starting point was right I I I didn't really realize you know I always just thought church was for old folk well praise the Lord I you know I ain't no different than most young people you know they I feel like church just for my momy and my daddy my Grandmama and them no no that's just not it search is for you too cuz you can't fix yourself you can't fix your disposition you can't fix your attitude you can't fix your mindset on your own like the brother was talking about you know his spending habits what but where where did those habits formulate from from from his background and the people that he W I'm with you on that bro I'm with you on that you know and then you wake up and like oo this ain't good oh yeah this as far as I am yeah now I should be way up the road somewhere you should be yeah right but you're not right because because of your mindset was was really carnal right amen and you know I've been there done that you know we I first got married man we were trying to get everything we saw back in the day when when we didn't have laptops back then desktops cost you 1,500 and printers cost you 300 500 stuff like we were trying to get everything not not realizing you know you just got to grow and build up so you can get to these things and not get yourself into debt and stuff like that right but let's let's look at Genesis a little bit more you know Adam didn't know the program of God right right right so unfortunate it's it's a lot of Bible people today don't really know the program of God right it's it's it's still got to be blood right amen it's see I appreciate the bleeding bloody word right you know we appreciate we appreciate Calvary listen let me tell you something God purposed that see God knew that Calvary was necessary amen amen right it and you can't it ain't something that you can bypass you can't shake enough hands right you can't shake enough hands to get in it put your name on enough books to get into Glory you got to come God's provided way right God's provided way you you got to follow the process that's that's been laid out right glory to God you know I come up a little Baptist I was baptized twice in the Baptist Church and I I know what it's like the the the the doors of the church open and to come up and shake the people hand right and get my name on the on the book oh yeah right but it wasn't until I came to the message of the hour where I realized that there was a little scripture over there where Jesus was talking to n Nicodemus and say buddy listen you must you must you must be born again what see it's it's it's vital it's something that you can't get around is something that's required that you must be born again right glory to God see you see uh well y'all still preach that yes because there's still people trying to get in by a handshake or an association with you know brother brandom and his children and things of that nature or some great preacher being their friends or even now this going just thing just a little bit well I'm in the message right see you could you could be in something not being something you can have an association see and that's what has happened to a lot of people they had an association and and a mental conception but never really had a birth and the moment some real issues came amen right I go fishing you know right the same idea with with Peter them they had an association oh yeah right with with Christ they was a part of the church they they took part in Miracles and things of that nature right but when the shepherd was smitten and then the Sheep kind of you know he went and found Peter fishing and things of that nature right amen but when when Peter amen uh got a birth you never you never see in scripture where he backslid like that right amen and and so that's a part of what's what's been required uh in the evening time under under the light of the right see people people think that brother bam came and did something that was outside of scripture his ministry was to turn us back to scripture to to show the fallacy in the things that people were doing that was so contrary to the scripture right like like shaking hands right and just being a part of of these systems and programs and things that were were set up amen right amen this is not a denomination sir glory to God it it's not see this is a quickening this is turning our hearts this this is a a a a a work of Grace is that right this is this is real Fellowship under the bleedy bloody word yeah right so that's why when I see people doing what they doing it's like they ain't got nothing to do with me come on y'all to preach with me somebody that that has nothing to do with me right cuz I appreciate what's what's been what's been uh quickened amen so so you know uh we we realize after the fall the fall the unbelief coming in it it brought it brought death it brought sin it brought this ideology that we see now right all of this this this his and her and this and oh it it drives you crazy now right almost even on your job you just got to be careful right you you you used to could stand up for what was right come on you you us kind of stand up for real principles but but now the way that they got it they have more Authority uh uh than what the believer have and even brother brandham told us back then in the 60s you know the inner workings of what was working in politics and the percentages of of these guys that had these different types of spirits on them working in politics and and now look at look at look at the the laws and the the cancer cancel cultures now and and the influence that these guys have right the influence it it takes something to stand for the work glory to God but but with with all of the unbelief that that kind of coming to existence you know uh God sent Christ on the scene and crushed him that's right because it was necessary right it it was so and a lot of times people people don't understand well why God had to do it that way and you know I I I'm reminded of a quote where where brother Brandon was talking about this smart guy and he couldn't understand how God uh uh you know this great God would allow these people to be put to death and to go through all of this trauma like that they went through not realizing he said you know uh uh it had to happen amen they they had to you know a SE had to fall into the ground and die it it was it was necessary for God's program see what people don't understand and we wouldn't either if we didn't have a prophet to open up our understanding so that we could see why under that day amen and its message back then these people had to be amen uh uh uh killed and mared under the ox AE right why why it was so necessary for the right cuz we we try to see God one way but God is a god of Grace but God is also a god of judgment right if he if if he's father cuz most children want to uh they God to be they father to be the daddy of of just Grace you know and and smiles and and and just giving and buying and and and but they don't want that Daddy with the Judgment Rod right see as as young adults you know my my children still kind of looking looking at me like I was a tyrant right but to me it was like you know I had multiple hats there was Grace there right cuz I wasn't a legalistic type person but but then you know there was times where you know brother brand say you pay for neglect that I wouldn't neglect to use the rod the rod the rod had its purpose the rod was necessary cuz ain't none of them in jail see they may not be able to understand anything that I did that's right that's right come on but now some of like my oldest is you know uh F to have his first be my first grandbaby and and all I always tell my children this I just pray to God that I'm around when y'all children start growing up I just want to be a fly on all they walls so I could come back and critique you go huh I could critique but you didn't do that just did you yeah it was It was kind of the time when when I I think at the time I had three boys and uh you know they was coming up and I used to get on them and my my wife used to say honey you you just too rough on them boys too rough I like really I said well listen they going to whoop you they're not F to whoop me unfortunately uh they're not going to whoop me and and and next the next thing I know I see her got one by the ear walking through the hall real fast and angry looking I say honey you too rough on that boy she she just she could the next thing I know I hear kids getting whooped and I'm feeling sorry for them then I'm like at one time she was beating my second oldest and man I CL I'm like what's going on in there man I went in there he screaming and H and rolling around and kicking I'm like I felt sorry I wanted to grab the Bell honey take it no but I noce you Spar a ride you spoil a child right so you get to the point where you know you you just have to stay biblical right amen but you don't you don't you don't just whooping anger you know I I never beat him while I was angry I always did things while I had a cool level head you know I I'm one snatching them up cuz I'm a big dude and uh I'm like I'm not going to jail for child abuse being this big Angry africanamerican guy just beat his little bitt no uhuh no I'm going be cool and calm you know my kids could tell you they've never heard me argue at their mother I've never rais my voice at them I feel like this is my house I don't have to be shouting and screaming boy every time you something boy I will boy I will bust your head to the white meat really and you a Christian you busting the head to the y'all know what I'm talking about to the white part show man you need to alter you know but I discipline them but I discipline them with with a cool demeanor you know but they still say I was a tyrant cuz I beat him yeah and I'll beat them again if I had to do it you know this is this is the weird thing if I had to raise my children all over again I raise him the same way you know pretty much with I think with with more information maybe a little bit of things I might do a little bit differently but for when I look at it holistically I can't see where I did anything outside of the word that was given to me by a prophet amen which was the mind of God right and how could I bypass that and say you know I could be an appropriate leader in my home right trying to bypass the word and intellectualize it I I can't I couldn't do it so I I appreciate uh God sending us a prophet right amen amen to to just show me and teach me cuz I didn't have a dad you know if you got a dad I'm going tell you something you ought to appreciate well I I put it to like this one I had a dad but he wasn't much of a dad cuz he he he would be in our lives periodically but you know he was you know he was he was what he was he he drunk and that was his best friend yeah but I still loved him to the day he died but I I I didn't gather the necessary knowledge that I needed to help me as a young man to navigate through Society I had to get my knowledge from society which was enity to God right glory to God I had I had to throw all that that that had to become Dum right so so that so that you know there could be a transformation a renewing right a re and I'm still renewing that that's still there still right now and I'm 60 years old and there still a constant renewing I passed it for 23 years but there still a renewing right of of of my mind amen right glory to God what you better yes I'm not ashamed of that right I'm not I'm not ashamed of of growth right I you know uh as I grow I want to live to be I heard some folk up in here like 90 something who where the 90 years up in here it's like 94 right 9 9 6 and 90 something y'all help me I want to get their age and and you know here's the thing they walked in here better than me in they right right mind and all that I'm a I'm inspiring to that right if if but now if the Rapture taking place I'm going with the raps amen I'm going with the rapure right amen I I'm I'mma I'mma close out this morning uh because I have to right I have to I I I've learned to be obedient BR brother brother Wade is my that's my pastor this morning so I've I've learned something I've learned to be obedient M maybe y'all that this that felt funny that just really felt funny when I y'all didn't respond like I thought y'all would respond you know but i' I've learned that you know brother Jack brother Jack preached here right brother Jack

me and ask me anything cuz I'm not your pastor right he is right and so brother Dale is my pastor and I want to be obedient this morning and we'll pick up this afternoon by the grace of God and uh we'll preach a little while and when the time to cut off this afternoon I shut it all down cuz I got a plane to ciss tonight you know brother D told me said well I don't like y'all ministers to this come in and fly out like that I didn't want to do it I was debating hard I wanted to kind of stay over maybe to tomorrow but I just thought well maybe I'll just do it the next time if there be a next time uh I I'll drive my car and uh I'll I'll stay cuz I like that guy right there I kind of like that guy amen cuz you know he makes you laugh and all of that he not not one of these starchy preachers

father we just thank you this morning for your Amazing Grace and goodness Lord um I just thank you for this opportunity and I pray that something was said this morning I I know that I didn't really get to where I wanted to go we trust that we could get there this afternoon but I I I just appreciate I I I learned brother bham taught us that the the gift is the ability to give get yourself out of the way and I'm just used to getting out of the way and just letting you speak I don't think any words that a minister speaks that's just living is is in vain somebody need something so we thank you

know what's going on so we got to be crushed you got to crush a rose before it really smells good you got to crush a flower before you can really get the odor to it so that's what he's heading toward

crushes me now I don't crush you like today you got born again that crushed that crushed the old you right out of you amen that just crushed us because he was crushed at Calvary that's what we give back to him as he gives us eternal life and then crushes that old nature out and puts his nature in remember service at 2:00 this afternoon and he does have to catch a plane at 9:00 but I think we can
