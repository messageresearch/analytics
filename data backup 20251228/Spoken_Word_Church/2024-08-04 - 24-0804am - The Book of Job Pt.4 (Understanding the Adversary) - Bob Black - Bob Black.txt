========================================

God bless you Saints good morning we're going to be turning back to Job chapter 1 we had such a fine time at the um ministers meeting yesterday fellowshipping with other brothers and uh just really edifying and so we this morning we'll continue from Job chapter 1 we'll start about verse 6 let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we're so thankful Lord for your word and for the revelation of desire that we have Lord to give us overcoming power against the devil and Lord as we study these things out this morning I pray God that you'll help us to navigate your word and open these things up to us and Quicken them to us Lord grant it Lord that you'll prepare our hearts to receive what you've got in store for your bride today I pray God that you'll be with brother Keith as he's preparing Lord back in the study Grant it Lord that you'll just uh fill it Liberty to be with us today we pray in your name amen so um job 1:6 says there was a day when the uh sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them now I so I I want to meditate today on just what what Satan does because you know uh sometimes we we forget that sat Satan is real and um and brother Brandon would say he'd make comments like he you'd say Satan and demons are real Spiritual Beings just as angels are real Satan is called the devil which means the tormenter so Satan's real he's very real and he he's very good at his job his role is to torment in your in your mind in your spirit in your body or your soul if you're not born again and you think about what what a devil what a devil does it will it will influence it ta as an influence to to influence your people's thoughts or habits as an influence on your body to make you're sick to influence your behavior but a devil can't do something against your will if you're if you're responding in faith it can only act if you open up your heart the person's got to yield themselves to the Demon's influence so a Satan's influence manifest in unclean habits like lying or lusting or addictions all of those things are attributed to demonic influences that are preying on people's weaknesses but people have a choice whether to resist or give in that's why the scripture says resist the devil resist him and he'll flee from you right and we've got the ammunition to resist him faith in God's word God has given us the equipment to be able to resist the devil so while Satan's got influence over the world he has no power over a Believer who actively resist him through faith in God's word and you see that's one of the things that's revealed in the seals that he's just a Blu a Believer that's got the the new birth that's reacting in faith he can respond appropriately to the to the devil when the Devil comes with his Li well it's not for you you can't get the promise with his lies with his thoughts whether whever it might be and trying to influence with sickness trying to influence when the Mind battles you've got the equipment by faith to respond to the devil resist the devil and he'll flee from you so ultimately Satan Was Defeated at the Cross of Christ and he has no legal rights over a Believer he's just a squatter so that that means as a Believer you got a right to tell him you you got to you got to get out of here he has no right to any of your any of God's Property but he tries to deceive you into thinking that he's got a right to be there or he can't leave his his deception is to make people think he's got power over them so look at what what is being related here in job 1:6 there was a day when the sons of God this Angelic Council all all all the sons of God reporting back of their activities and here The Devil Is Right right there amongst them and this is this is how the devil likes to do cuz the devil we we can brother brand has has explained over and over that that Satan is religious and you know the de the world is already he's he's already got them you know they're in their they're in that state of sin but that's not really where the devil likes to be because he started as an an angel of Light and uh the worship angel that would lead Worship in heaven so he wants to be where there's worship so he's going to try to get himself just like here where the sons of God came to present themselves he was there amongst them he wants to get in the church and brother Brown would say in a testimoni on the sea he said that's the way it is it's always a mixed crowd Believers make Believers and unbelievers always conglomerated together there they are even when the sons of God come up before God in the Book of Job it says Satan was sitting among them when the sons of God appeared in the presence of God certainly they're always there and another place he said so the devil goes to church this is maybe a stum a stumbler to think that the devil wants to go to church the devil goes to church the devil belongs to church the devil Acts like a Christian he's a deceiver and you see what the the nature of that the devil is he's trying to deceive you to think he's got a right to be where to to to be there to he's got a right to uh your property he's got a right to to uh take your joy away and take all that he's a deceiver and that's what he does he deceives and he said brother Ram said if he didn't act like a Christian and act like a church he wouldn't be a deceiver no man could be deceived only if they the difference was black and white if it's contrary to one another but the Bible said it'd be so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible the spirit in the last days and he said friends we're there and again we're talking about this story of in job where the sons of God were gathered together and Satan was right there among them you know you follow you follow all the all the little Parables and things that brother R talked about that it's it would be so so close so close how like a lamb and a goat a lamb and a goat sounds sounds almost identical you say one's M and one's by well you can't hardly can't hardly tell it apart but but it's the nature that there's a nature that that makes makes them different different animals one one will give you everything that's got and the other as soon as you walk into the Barnard it wants to butt you and knock you over and and you're like well here it comes it wants to wants to push you over but it's the nature look how he said and earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints notice how from the beginning Satan has been so close now a lot of people say today oh brother brandom don't you think that communism is awful yes it's awful but that's not the Antichrist no sir Jesus said the Antichrist would be so close like the real it would deceive the very elect if possible it's religious people that's where it comes in and he said those Pharisees and religious people of that day who went around with these forms and made fun and poked fingers and said they were a bunch of illiterate and so forth that same Spirit lives on men and women today and look how even when the seals were opened brother brandom was initially confused about who that white horse rider is cuz it's so clo the white it's white it looks well we'll put a label on that and say well it's it's the Holy Ghost but then God revealed to him that's not the Holy Ghost it's going to be so close and look how look how we're examining this morning what what the devil does what the influ how he deceives and the unity of one God in one church he said you see Satan uses a man's head is thinking we he might think something's right he's using his own his own way and he said he chose that in the Garden of Eden they take a man's head is thinking and he has brought that down even to the church see the devil takes a man's head so he can use use his eyes and if you'll notice if the man isn't genuinely Born Again spiritual he'll take what he can see with his eyes the pride of life and he'll go many men to say he's going to achieve something he wants to join church he wants to be religious and he'll look around till he can find the biggest church he can find because man wants to do something big he wants to make a big name for himself that's what caral carnal foolish thinking man think oh if I can have my organization if I can only add so many thousands to my denomination it'll be the largest then in the land of its kind what good does that do but he thinks he's achieving something because he's adding more you see how deceptive the devil is to think that if we just add more more and more people but God wants people that are genuine Converse to not have more people but to more have more Born Again experience to really give your heart to God it's not more people bigger bigger churches and all those things we want but we want more of God we want more of the word I I really sitting there listening to brother old speak yesterday and he was talking about how there's a lot of different ways that we can measure the Holy Ghost you can measure by how how much you jump around or how much you uh you cry or all these kind of things but the way that God has given us to measure the Holy Ghost is by Revelation so that's what we're seeking we're seeking revelation we want we the more the more Holy Ghost you get the more revelation ation you have and that revelation will produce a change in your life and that is how you combat the devil when a revelation will tell will help you to be able to discern the true and the false and to be able to recognize and brother R would say that's how how you really overcome the devil is when you can recognize him in all of his tricks right right when you recognize well that's not God putting that thought in my mind or that's not God that maybe somebody will say something to you that's very very uh uh that's contrary to the word or whatever so let's we'll say this morning tell me about the devil I want to tell you about the devil he is the author of Glamour and sin and unbelief and doubt and pride and all those things that are contrary to God and he'll influence he's trying to influence people in the church in those ways to make you doubt and to make you disbelieve he pervert and imitates what God creates everything God will create something perfect and he'll pervert it and make it sick he'll pervert it and make it die he'll he'll he'll pervert it and make it make the real truth and pervert it and make it a deception he perverts something good and make it make it false pervert it and make it a lie he'll pervert a true church and make it a false Church he'll pervert a true religion and make it a false religion he is cunning and he tries to deceive even the elect if possible he tries could be so close that it would deceive the elect if it was possible but thank God it's not possible he is the ruler of this world's kingdoms and Nations and he causes all the wars and stries and immorality that's what the devil's doing you you think about the the devil is the accuser there in job he's the accuser of Believers he's trying to find a fault and Satan one of Satan's attributes he he just could not see that job was a real believer that's where that's where Satan got all stumbled up he was like if I take everything away from him he ain't going to believe he he's he's going to give away all it I'm going to take everything it made a deal with God I'm going to take everything to show to you that he's not going to really believe he's offered all these sacrifices and I'm going to leave him nothing left but the ashes of that lamb that he's been sacrificing and then he won't believe you but job proved him wrong right and Satan can't Satan can't see inside of the heart of the real believer look what he wants to inflict pain and suffering he tries to break our faith and and our allegiance to God through difficult trials but you know he's got limits on his power he can't do nothing unless God pulls back the Hedge and says go ahead so uh you think about that this morning Satan's got a leash on him he can't do nothing unless he's got permission but you know Satan is persistent in his attacks he'll try he'll try and he he then he'll he'll back off and he'll try again he'll keep coming back so you got to be you got to be fervent in your resistance and you got to know how to resist him because Satan is a worthy adversary look even after the even after the first wave of attacks in Jo in Job chapter one well here he comes back around again and and now now he he he took away all of job's possessions now J Job chapter 2 now he's going to start attacking his his body and then the rest of job later on he's he's attacking his mind and giving him all those Minds battle so he just keeps coming back wave after wave and that's how the devil does and his ultimate goal is to turn people away from God that's his that's his goal is to make make you think God don't love you make you think church is not for you make you think God the the promises are not for you and deceive you from from being able to to to reap the rewards of a Believer and his desire was for job to curse God to his faith and renounce his faith in the midst of suffering and look how Satan works too he worked through circumstances in this in Job chapter 1 he used Raiders and he used Wind and Fire and all those things to destroy Joe's possessions and his family which shows that he can work through natural means but look look how Satan attacks Christians he'll influence people to doubt the word well I I don't believe that Miracles are possible you you you see how the devil that that's the devil if you don't believe that God can work a miracle in your life it it takes Faith to combat that the more word you receive it's actually building up your faith to combat the devil because that's a demonic influence to make you think that that promise is not for you he tries to he his deception he tries to get you more focused on the church or or your pastor and develop a relationship with those things and get more focused on Church programs or entertainment or the chili the chili that you can eat at the good church function instead of a the spirit of God instead of a relationship with God and that's where the deception of Satan is one to some maybe he'll want you to try to get you to develop a a relationship with the church instead of with God and and and that's the decep the deceptive nature of the devil he'll attack with with sickness and disease and oppression and possession and all of those things to try to take away everything that every every everything from a Believer he's tries and and look what he'll try to do he'll try to get you alone try to separate try to separate the little sheep from the flock get them away get them isolated get them isolated so they don't go to church get them isolated from other believers or get them get them alone without Jesus and separate him from the word so that he can do like a wolf and just just kill him and look at what he he'll blow his poisonous breath of strife to try to get people broken up try to get homes broken up make make people get uh separated over just little differences little little little little tiny little things will come up and he'll create a great blow it up into a great big thing and and it's the devil so you want to overcome the devil you recognize him in his little tricks don't just let the little tiny little things blow up into a great big thing and then then you got a something that it might take you decades to overcome because he it's the devil and look here's how you know you can recognize that the devil is active when you when you deny the word that's the devil that's the Demonic influence when you say I'm not going to tow the line with the word or you see somebody not Towing the line with the word it's something like somebody living in adultery let's for example just to make a drastic example somebody living obviously they're not towing with the line with the word and that's because of a demonic influence because Satan influences us to to unbelieve to disbelieve sin is disbelief and to deny the word to deny the to deny any of the word to deny anything from the word is is a product of unbelief amen even something something is maybe is basic as Mark 16 or that signs will follow the Believers if you doubt those things it's not coming from God right you can see Satan is active when you look at a church or a church system a denominational systems that compromise their teachings for popularity or focus on Creeds instead of the spirit that's what brother R laid out in the in as he laid out the church ages that nickan spirit in the early church age was trying to control and prevent the Holy Spirit from moving in the people it was the devil the devil to try to limit to try to limit the correct teaching of the word to try to limit the moving of the spirit and it was the deceptive power of the devil another way you can tell that the devil is active is that when you see immorality and wickedness increasing like in the days of Noah it just grow grows and grows but God's he's going to raise up a standard I I believe in having a standard and living right and doing right so that you're separated and you're not you're not living like the world a lack of faith for the supernatural calling of the devil when God moves that's a sign of the devil and and because of the Demonic influence people will have nervous breakdowns and unrest and unable to stand still just like job was roaming through the Earth to and fro God wants us to be rested and peaceful and and have know where we're standing and know what we believe not not roaming about wondering wondering what's real and wondering what's right he know God God's purpose and plan for our life is not to have a nervous breakdown or be in unrest and have to be dosed up in all kinds of pills and things you see those that's a product of what the de the the devil does those things it's the devil and Christianity versus idolatry brother R said I've seen good people and Pentecostal people pastors who didn't understand the people get into hysterics and fall into transes and everything like that and do things and finally run them into the insane institution and what was it how how does the devil influence somebody it's opening up their heart right he said it was opening up their heart innocent people and Devils came in and taken place there is a real devil let me just impress upon your mind this this morning that there is a real devil brother R will make statements like if you we believe there's a God but you if you believe if you believe God you got to believe there's a devil too cuz whether there it's true there's going to be that opposition there there is a real devil and Satan is the author of strife he's the author of marital strife and unfaithfulness divorce cheating on spouses and being dishonorable in marriage he's the author of all that substance abuse trying to pervert that Godly thirst that people have for God into drinking and smoking and and and and going to the gas station and getting all that all that marijuana oil and and and trying to do something to satisfy the holy thirst that God has given you I wonder sometimes if we'd really if we'd really get desperate before God and instead of satisfying that thirst with something else like the devil wants us to do but get on our knees and and be real men and women of God and and and and get get those uh those those rubbed mark on our on our knees in prayer and really spend some time alone with God something oh then that thirst will be satisfied materialism and worldliness focusing too much on money and status and Fashions and entertainment instead of God and division among Believers cuz listen Satan is real demonic influence is real demonic possession is real and brother B would say in Christianity versus idolatry he said if you don't believe there really is a devil you don't believe there's a God sure you've got to believe the contrary the pro and con so there is a real devil and he is a person not a thought he is a person there's teaching going on that says the devil is just an evil thought you get no it isn't the Devil is a person and then the message how can I overcome he said overcome means to recognize the devil and everyone of his tricks a lot of people says there ain't no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there is a real devil he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize ize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace now listen to this by his grace you are more than a match for him that's real overcoming when you recognize now think now back to our story job has made all his sacrifices for all the sins of his family maybe even something that was overlooked he's offering that burnt offering and now his his sin his offering has been offered he's he has nothing left but the ashes of that sacrifice and he's sitting there on the ashes of his sacrifice and and and and and and you think you think all this time that D the devil was watching job the devil knew all about job and in Job chapter 3 he said the things that I fear have come upon me so job knew what he feared and brother Brandon would even say that uh he said there's he said I might as well be honest there's Satan know he said Satan just knows what you're a little afraid of and there's no need in me trying to get around it that even brother brandham was afraid you know sometimes a little bit fearful of of of certain cases that would come up epileptic cases and different kind of things he like the devil knows the devil knows that you think that Satan is a people Watcher and he's watching you and he's he's gathering information to see what you're afraid of and what what bothers you and and that's what he's going to use as a tactic because that's what he used as a tactic against job job he he knew Job was afraid of losing everything of losing his family and all the things that happened to him so the devil is constantly studying the best way to attack and you think this morning that there's there's another dimension that you can't see what all the all these activities are going on just like in job all this this conversation was going on and job was sitting down there unaware that people were interest that God and Satan were interested in him brother R would say he said Satan knows just what you're a little afraid of and there's no need in me trying to get around it in job 3:25 for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of has come upon me Satan knows Satan he said no matter how educated you are how smart you may be how well you may think you know the Bible Satan knows it just a lot better than you do he said Satan knows when you're bluffing but he also knows when you you got it he knows he knows when you got it and he knows that he's got limitations that he can't do one thing without God's approval you think about think about the attributes of of Satan that he can't do one thing without God's approval and he's got limited knowledge of the situation he had to ask God about job he had trouble grasping that job was a real authentic believer and job uh s Satan just couldn't sit still he's a RoR in job 1:7 and 2:2 he's going moving about he couldn't sit still he's going around examining things and he cannot subvert God's ultimate purposes no matter what the devil does God's purpose is going to be fulfilled and the devil is not Eternal so that proves that whatever Satan's doing it's only going to last for a season his testing of job had a beginning and an end showing that his actions are bound by time so whatever you're going through this morning Satan's got you in sitting on the ash Heep just remember this two shall pass and we'll stop there God bless you Saints [Applause]
