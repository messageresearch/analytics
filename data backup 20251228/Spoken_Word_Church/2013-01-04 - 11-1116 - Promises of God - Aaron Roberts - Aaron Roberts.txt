amen I was getting ready this evening I saying Lord I I don't ever want to reach a place where I think i' I've reached it all I reached the place that that this is this is all that you have for me because I want to believe that there's every day there's something new there's something greater than what we have today because I look back over my life and I can truly say today is the greatest day of my life amen because I I look back at what I what I've come through and I've had some great things and the Lord has sh me things but I wouldn't take my experience today for any any experience that I've had in my life today I I I think today is is the greatest day of my life what God has shown me and it doesn't matter and we one of the things we'll talk about tonight but you it doesn't matter about the trials and tribulations all these things hey that's that's part of the thing that's part of life right but it's what God has given us what God has shown us it's it's so I just you know such an amazing thing I thank God for that if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to look into 2 Corinthians chapter 1 appreciate the Lord and His blessings on us amen y'all pray for me and I pray for y'all Lord will speak to us amen I've battled this thing for two days now and I've had some kind of bug and it's uh I feel kind of rung out so y'all just pray for me but we going to get through this but you know Lord takes care of us amen amen let's all bow our heads and just speak to the author before we read the scripture Heavenly Father we thank you for another opportunity to be in your house Lord Jesus together with your people those of light precious faith and we just pray tonight that you just come speak to each heart and each life father for each need that's represented in this building we pray that you just come on the scene and touch each one Lord just help me get out of the way you come and speak this evening what you'd have us to say Lord just minister in a special way to each one Lord we just commit all things to you and look look at you for there's no other place to look there's no other place to go for what we have need of we just commit them all in in your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 17 says when I therefore was thus minded that I use likeness or the things that I purpose do a purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be yay yay and nay nay But as God is true our word toward you was not yay and nay for the spirit of God Jesus Christ for the Son of God Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us even by me sylvanus and Timothy was not yay and nay but in him was yay for all the promises of God in him are yay and in him amen and to the glory of God by us for he which establishe US with you in Christ and hath anointed us is C is God and who have also sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts moreover I call God for a record upon my soul that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers of your joy for by faith you stand amen Lord bless the reading of the word have your seats this evening and uh just want to uh say this evening uh I know we're just not just the people here in the in the church but you know we see the the ones on the internet and just want to say we greet you and we certainly pray for the ones that are are not here and listening in been thinking of Mike and Mary so if they're listening we say hold to them I told Mary before she left I said have you ever been in Sub-Zero temperatures and she said no and I said well you're getting ready to be and she sent me a little me I sent her a message the other day and she sent me one back saying that they had sleep up there and uh supposed to be getting snow and getting in the single digit so she's getting ready to have some fun but uh just just we just you know they're part of us and they're not here we just keep them on our heart amen but um anyway this evening I want to speak on thought on Promises of God just simple thought and brother Bram says in the message what is what is in thine hand he said when God promises anything God's under obligation to take care of his promises God always will back it up I don't care what God what anybody says about it when God says it's so it's so rest your soul body and strength upon it because God's obligated to his word amen and so uh couple of couple things uh definition of of a promises a uh couple of them a declaration that something will or will not be done given Etc by one so you make a declaration an expressed Assurance on on which expectation is to be based and well that one stood up to me because uh what brother Brandon was saying because God can make promises but if you don't accept them they're not a promise that's right they don't you any good and that's why he says an Express to Assurance on which expectation is based because that's what faith is a hope is an expectation so if you don't have an expectation of it then it doesn't do you any good right right and it says something that has the the effect of an expressed assurance and because like brother Brenham told us he said you can't find William brandham or Orman Neville in the Bible but he said what was going on during the time of their life that put his name in the book right so it's not that we you know because Aaron is in the Bible right but I would want to live the life that Aaron lived oh but I see myself in the word amen and so that gives me the because that's the effect of an expressed Assurance because that gives me the Assurance of what the scripture is because I find myself there and we we know brother R said that there was there's nothing negative in God right amen there's no God doesn't go uh I was reading something the other day and they were talking about how God created evil you know that's that's pretty bad because of somebody that has supposedly has studied this message and has studied this message and and somebody that actually had claimed to believe this that brother BR was a prophet and understood these things and then turn around and talk about God creating something I said it doesn't you know it doesn't take a genius to understand that the scripture tells us that uh there in uh I believe it was Ezekiel where he talks about he said that Satan was created perfect right so he he was God didn't create anything imperfect but he knew what would take place and he put man on free moral agency because he knew what would take place God didn't force us into anything we done it ourselves that's right see we weren we weren't forced into anything right amen so the scripture says here tells us that in him in God there there's a it's yay and amen right there's nothing nay about it and see he's he's speaking here and I I believe last time we spoke we speaking on on the book of Corinthians last time and you know what I understand Paul had his hands full with the book with the church at Corinth of of all the churches that he had to deal with this was the one he had to straighten out the most this is a group that always had the had the most problems because they didn't understand anything because they were not rooted and grounded so he had to spend all kind of time fixing the simple things that we think are simple things but because they didn't understand he couldn't Express things to them that he could express to the Ephesians or the Galatians because he had to keep going back and just taking care of the simple things to them you I thank God that he had to go back and do that because it was word to me because it spoke to me because see you know just wasn't just for their day but came a day that it came was going to come to us right and I've been listening to the the been reading in the in the church age book and you go back and you you know you start reading these things and you start looking back all through the the church ages and the different things that was going to take place and you know how how the things that crept in during the different Church ages we see the same thing today because it's the same Spirit right it's the same Spirit that's going on today we're still fighting the same battle they did that's right that's reason you can go back and see yourself in in each one of the church ages and see those things that that are brought out it speaks to each one of us he says and here it says but he said but he that which establishe US with you in Christ and hath anointed us is God because he gave us these promises but he has established us because that's what he's trying to do is establish and then he then he said he's anointed us and he has sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit so we can receive these promises s and he says in verse 24 not not for that we should have dominion over your faith but are helpers of your joy for by faith ye stand right so he understands it that you know because he said he didn't come to Corinth because he didn't want to have a it wasn't a dominion over them but it was establishing them that they stand on their own faith and he said you we're just to help you in your joy or your upbringing brother says in second-handed robe he says he said I heard the pastor say this morning he said many are becoming discouraged he said what we need brother is courage what we need is to be encouraged and it's right trials may come we never was promised to be immune from them but he will give Grace to go through them if the Mountain's too high to go over too deep to go under it too wide to go around it he will give Grace to go through it that's right just don't worry but keep your eyes on Christ for he's the only one that can take us through so we don't have to worry because he's going to make a way for us so he's he's got it all in his hands the message now this is from the message influence brother R says all Promises of God are true but they're on conditions no matter how fundamentally right we are we've got to approach it the right way now men can be fundamentally right and still not receive the blessings of God because it's approached in the wrong way it goes upon conditions right you know you go back and you look at um David when what brother was speaking of trying to do God a service you know David David had the right motive and the right objective but he approached it wrong and see you know he was trying to bless the people but in the midst of trying to bless him he killed somebody he committed it was death unto him right because it was approached the wrong way so the blessings of God because you can rece have the blessings of God you can have the promises of God but there's a proper way to approach God right God let because see if you want to know how to approach God God will show you how to how to approach him that's right so because uh one of the things that that I've covered the different places that I've preached one of the one of the main po topics that I've covered just seems like God has laid something on my heart everywh where I've went and and I've always cover been covering the new birth and I just something I can't get away from right and you know because it's so important to understand because a lot of people have just expressed something about you know you need to be born again but they don't really expound the time to express it to people to understand how how to become born again because it's not just something that just falls on you right because you know one of the problems that that I've seen is people the new birth because just being born again so easy and so simple it's just like falling off the log and other people make it so hard that you couldn't you couldn't obtain to it in a million years right and how are you supposed to have faith to reach a place because you know what he said If any man had come upon the same uh basis and hadn't reached the same place and accepted God that he had to give him the had to give him the Holy Ghost right he man came the same way and he done it one one time for somebody he would have to do it again right because he's obligated he's obligated to fulfill his word amen and so it's it's something it's you know because it's not so hard it's not so difficult but you know the thing is it's in the in the age that we live in because it's become so LAX because so simple right because people don't have a desire oh my brother BR said that he he had more desire to give it to you than you wanted it for yourself but you know what people people have lost the desire to seek for God right people people people don't have any don't have don't even know what it's like oh my and so it becomes it becomes very hard but he said it was you know he said it was based on conditions you have to meet the same conditions and it doesn't matter if you have if you have to take 10 years or a 100 if you if you hold to God and you because he said he said if you repent and I think that's one of the problems where people fail is people don't know what repent means amen they don't mean for because they don't understand get away from turn away from the things that you've done before and get before God and wait on God to to clean these things out from you say Lord I want to be covered by the blood I want I want these things under the blood because sometimes people just go to the altar because they just feel something but they really don't want to get away from it they just don't want they don't want to turn away from it but he said when if you repent and he said you're baptized brother B said he's obligated to give you the Holy Ghost that's right what it say but sometimes they don't think people take him at his word brother said that's what God was looking for was somebody take him at his word right now I read this before and I want to read it again and I read this it's one of my favorite quotes and I read it just about every church that I go to first time and I tell him I said you want to know why I believe it's what I believe and this is from a message why 1963 heart Springs Arkansas and brother Ram says I just came from India here not long ago and I heard of a woman over here she was poverty stricken her son had went to India to be a doctor he got over there and got away from his medical practice and got into another I believe he was electrical engineer or something and this woman woman got poverty stricken and she didn't have nothing so charity was trying to come and take care of her and so they invested the case and when they investigated they found out that the woman had one support and that was a son that was a very wealthy man in India and said well why don't your son support you so I just couldn't ask him said I'm his mother said and I just rather take charity than to ask my son said don't you ever hear from him so do I hear from him at least once or twice a month said hey he writes some of the most sweetest letters you've ever read so it look like if he loved his mother enough and he had plenty of money he'd be trying to take care of her instead of her going to charity said well perhaps if he knew I was this way he said he would he would take care of me but you know he doesn't know and I just feel embarrassed to tell my son like that he said and he writes you sweet letters oh some of the sweetest letters and said he sends me some the prettiest pictures you ever seen said the prettiest pict so let let's see some of them she went to her Bible and she pulled them out you know what they was Bank drafts right India puts pictures on their Bank draft you see pretty pictures she had thousands of dollars converted from Indian money into American money what was it in the lens of her Bible she had Treasures that she thought was just pictures but come to find out it was real value to her and he says and brother when you try to read of a painted fire of Pentecost and somebody tries to tell you that the Holy Ghost isn't the same today as it was then somebody tries to tell you the days of Miracles is passed that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever that they try to and they try to tell you don't believe it them's not pictures God Almighty sent that message to you that's right right did he because that's what I believe I believe he sent the message to us it's for you and to your children to them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call God is still God Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's here tonight to save the lost to heal the sick to fill with the Holy Ghost those who desire to be filled do you believe that don't you congregation says amen yes sir if you believe it then you see that's God's promises in his in this word here you can get right in there and find every promise the promise is unto you Peter said the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that's a far off don't be afraid to cash that that's a bank draft on H Heaven that's right Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever right when I go plac that's what because that's what I want everybody to know I want to I want everybody to know that I believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I don't believe I believe when he started he was the same and he's he's always the same it doesn't matter because it's not it's not uh him that changes it's us that changes because you know what the world changes all things in the world changes but you know what God don't change God has set out set out a plan in motion and he said because it by the law of God it continues on today and it doesn't matter if it's if it's a million years from now it's still going to be the same right right amen amen and he says because if you have a desire he said he's here to meet your desire whatever your need is he's here to meet it he said it's a bankd draft on Heaven because I think that's what happened to a lot of people they take the Bible and the Bible is just a bunch of pretty pictures or the Bible's just for somebody else but you know he said you got to dig in there and find the promises for you because Peter said it's under you right what he brother bam said in the church AG book when he speaking of he said that was to the Jews he said to you the Jews he said and to your children the Jews he said is them that are far off he said Gentiles and he said even as many as the Lord Our God shall call he said Jews and Gentiles come on so it's it's but but it's unto us sometimes I think we just find we just look at it as pretty as a pretty picture it's just an idea we say here this woman she carried this thing around for so long and not realizing all that all the things that she had need of laid in front of her that's right brother bam said all that we had need of in this Earthly Journey was given to us in the New Birth come on he said it was it was planted inside of you right on see the thing that stands out to me was when brother you know we quote the scripture where it says brother all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into into the church come on but you know brother mams also said all that God was he poured into Christ and he said all that Christ was he poured into the believer come on amen that's right because see we don't take it down to an individual level come on because all that God was he poured into me come on Amen it's not for somebody else because it's for me amen I'm not looking to somebody else come on right right blessings it's got to be it's got to be me that's right see the thing is when I when I get I I worry about everybody else I worry about getting me right come on M because see the thing is when I get right just like just like the the little boy that had the puzzle and he had the puzzle tore all the pieces you know he's standing there and he was trying to put the world together and he couldn't and all of a sudden he come back and he told his dad hey I got the picture together he said how did you do that he said well there was a picture of a little boy on the back see when I got one he said it was just the one the little boy he said when I got the boy together he said the whole world was fixed that's right see sometimes the problem is it's like like Jesus was saying you know he said you got something in your eye he said pull the beam out of your eyes before you trying to get out of your brother's eye amen see sometimes people are too worried about what else what everybody else is doing yeah everybody else is get because y y'all have to pardon me tonight cuz I got a few things I just want to say go ahead and it might be it might be wrong y'all I apologize but you know uh I think Hank Williams said it the best he said if you mind your business you won't be mind in mine right right you know i' heard I've heard people stand around and say would you think this person's got the Holy Ghost you think that person's got the Holy Ghost I said well do you have the Holy Ghost only we try to in Phar Phar what everybody else is where everybody else is in the St in the in the pyramid where where they at in the Statue of a perfect man have they reached adoption have they done this is they that is this open to them well you know what you know what you'll find out when the things start opening to you you'll find out where people are right but see the thing is when you start seeing these things in your word then you don't have to worry about where everybody else is see we get we get too concerned about things that are all around us and not worryed about what God's doing right here like brother said he said people people thank God for what he used to do and what he's going to do but they fail to see what he's doing right now see because I believe he said it was supposed to be an individual Affair and if it's supposed to be an individual Affair then it's not is what me it's between me and God not between God and brother dick or anybody else because what what God does for him you know what that I've got to receive the same thing because if it's a word of God and it's a revelation that I've got to receive it too right right I thank God for what brother what what God has opened up to brother brother Dale right amen what what he's what he's done it through this ministry the the the ministry that's here but you know what I've got to receive it for myself that's right I'm not going I'm not I guarantee you one thing I'm not going through on brother D's coat table that's right and nobody else is either amen you know what I tell you this much I don't want to blessing I don't want to walk around say brother Dale's my pastor I want I want to know God for myself that's right because that's what brother Dell does he comes and open tries to reveal the word to us speak the word to us because God has to reveal it to us amen but you know that's the reason he said it's like a c a grinding stone well sometimes I get over because I do it for anybody else in this whole building but he does it for me right cuz you know what I'm not hardheaded B it takes me not long to figure these things out oh my see some you know it's not everybody else it's me he said one person can make this whole church bitterly fail right he said you be you'll be a judgment you don't have to answer for it so it's not it's not whoever else in this church it's me I want to make sure that I'm right see the thing is you can find like brother said you can find a counterfeit he said can you find a genuine that's why we're looking for something that's genuine something that's real amen Jesus said in in John he said he said how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he said he'll lead and guide you into all truth right amen see if we if we receive this then he will lead us and guide us into all things the truth then that's where he said he was going to take us if it's if it's if it's a promise of God and you've received that then guess what you be you be carried in he'll lead you into truth brother Brown says in Rising of son he said now the very essence of the message that was sent was that he is risen from the dead we his beneficiaries who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that He Is Alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do this by some tradition of man we only ref reflect exactly what we're pointing to he said I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting to people to Christ but we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ he is the only one and the only one that has life that's right he's dropped down and brother says Romans 8 11 says but if the spirit of but if the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you he and also quickens your mortal body that same life them same Powers them same beneficiaries that he had here on Earth from God he redeemed you a seed that was for on of God th whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world and that Gospel Light of the Resurrection the confirmation of the word how did he know he was the Christ how did we know that he was the Christ because he proved what he what he talked about how will I know the message of the hour God proves what he promised and he talks about it right right see it's we've got to get people to Christ not to a church not to a theory because a lot because you know we've seen too many people because it's such it's such a late hour people have gotten to the message oh yeah but see the thing is it's not just because the scripture says the letter kth but the spirit gives life and that's what we need we need to have the life right it's the spirit that's going to Quicken the word right well because you know the thing is he said if he lead you and guide you into all truth and one of the things is he said that you know you cannot be uh deceived right you know I've heard people heard people talk about that you know that uh you know they're afraid to listen they're afraid they're going to get deceived oh my well you he said if you're if you're an elect of God you can't be deceived then what are you worried about right amen see people get so confused they're so afraid that's right come well maybe the problem is is they're not where they think they are oh my come on May maybe they don't have the Holy Spirit leading them come on maybe that's the reason there is so many doctrines in the message oh my why because there not the Holy Ghost leading come on right we got too many people trying to build trying to build a great Kingdom to theel trying to come up with some idea to draw people to them and not trying to draw people to Christ come on this is from birth pains I know some some of it's very you heard it many times but just what's been on my heart he said that's why I think today that we have not not so many rather genuine New Birth is because the seed maybe will sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to rot away from the old system they were in come on they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system and claim the new birth or the message of the age see that's what's wrong with a lot of people they gotten comfortable they got their own they got their four walls they live in their own little realm but see the thing is is they don't want to go beyond that they don't want to die out and come into the place where God wants them to come to right why because people are such in such a shape so so afraid but see the thing is and I want you understand this because I'm speaking on the I I'm speaking on the Promises of God I want you understand this because see that is a promise of God that you don't have to live like that right right because you know there there's something greater people people have just come to a certain point and they can't they see can't seem to understand why they can't go beyond that see it's so it's so hard to get people to see that there's so there's so much more out there God is infinite come on and he's Eternal so I mean what we have today what we can't understand that what we have we can't what God has for us we're not even we can't even put in our finite Minds come on we have because there's more for us more for God of God for us to receive that we we can uh obtain because he said he'd open up the windows of Heaven pour out a blessing that you you would not be able to contain right see there's so much for us to receive from God and then he said there would be a a message to cheer down through the endless ages amen and you know every every aspect of of God every aspect of the believer's walk you know it's God leading you that's right right you know I try to express this everywhere I go you know there's a definite experience of justification amen because you know he he said there was he said the mystery was receiving the new birth without a sensation but he never said it wouldn't come without an experience on right justification there's a definite experience of justification right it's the leading of the Holy Ghost see people people want to ask about Revelation you know justification is a revelation sanctification is a revelation it's the leading of the Holy Ghost for leading you into these into these stages that he's leading you into justification see you because he said you can know where you are with God at any time so if you if he only lead you to justification then you can know you're Justified you can know you're Sanctified see people people have just LA and the devil has taught them into believe that they received something that they received the new birth that they're born again they're all right and sometimes they're a million miles from it but see it's the leading of the Holy Ghost see problem is everybody thinks oh we've got it and nobody wants to check up right right you know I've never had a I've never had a pastor or known of a Preacher like brother Dale who stands there and say you know he said I'd rather seek for the Holy Ghost every day of my life and die and realize I had it all the time and not ever seek seek it and sit around and think that I've got it and come to the end and realize I don't have it right because people want to Pat Pat the people on the in the in the church on the head and tell you're all right see it's it's a checking up time we need to get to a place where we seek and and really find out if we got it or not that's right that's right and I know this may be simple to a lot of you but you know what if if if I touch one person in my life you know it's all it's all worth it right yes sir because you know what I've seen I've seen too many kids just walk by right because you know what I was a teenager in this message I know what it's like I know what it's like to walk around and Jack because as brother Donnie said one time talk about kids growing up just cutting their teeth on a message Pew I was that kind of kid see I know what it's like to grow up in the message but see the thing is we always you know ever since I had a conscious thought in my life I always brother V was a prophet but you know what that didn't do me any good I always always knew that this was the truth you know I never could get away from it I I went to denominational churches and sit in there you know what you can't get away from this message that's right can't do it I tell you what because I I've sat in churches and listen to people preach on the trinitarian doctrine and you know it's just like rubbing a cat the wrong way that's right there's just something inside of me that just couldn't handle that and see that's so and and so I've seen a lot of kids they they get so they get so bound up with things that are just false right right that's right you see somebody's got to stand up because Satan will always bring out the counterfeit he's always going to show you the ones that are messed up but you know what you need to find a real genuine to look at right that's why I want to be because I want to be the one that somebody can look at and see there's there's a Son of God that's somebody that's true that's had a real true birth not just some idea of it and I want everybody know as like brother Dale said that you you know you you get born again he said that's what it's one of the thing he's always wanted to give away to continue to try to give that away to somebody for somebody else to come the same way right blessing that's what we need need to Revelation right because we need to come we have young people you know Satan Satan's just he he loves to get his hands on on these kids and it's not just here but it's all over and you see it and I mean that's the great that's the greatest Victory he has is when he can destroy some kid's life some young person's life you know it's it's sad but you see the these people a lots of times I've not been to camps in a number of years but you know I've been to camps before and it's and it's not something that they spend their time preaching about re receiving the new birth but it's all about about their music and their clothes and their hair and all these different things right right you know what I've never seen a teenager that actually got born again that had problems come on you don't have to worry about their music that's right you don't have to worry about their clothes but the problem is he said we've not reached that kids have not come to that place and see the thing is it's not waiting on on them to grow up and receive it because it's something that they can receive at a very young age right and I know I know God brings up bring us in our own time but sometimes people are waiting because they're waiting for them the kids well they need to be a little older no I I want God to get a hold of them when they're young so they don't have to go through the same things that I went through yes sir see is when when you don't when you don't have to go through those things and you don't have to have those things where the devil battles you in your mind over all the things you done in the world and I thank God that that I didn't do you know a lot of things that other people did that they carry they still carry those things in their life but you know what I I'm so God so glad that God brought me from where I was at you know I don't I don't glory in any of the things that I went through in my life the things I done in in the in Sin out in the world I I'm glad that I God got me away from them that's right because you know I don't glory in any of it that's right you know because a lot of people you know they've not really come to a place where they're really ashamed of what they done but you know I'm so glad that I've gotten away from those things that I can say I know what it's like to be free because you know you go back and you look and I know what it's like to be bound and the devil's got you right where he wants you right and he and he gets everything he just squeezes you I remember sitting on a porch as a teenager and bound by cigarettes and you I just sitting there shaking I trying to quit and couldn't and just sit there and just just try to do anything to get that off off your mind but you know why I'm so glad that I was able to lay those things down and never never desired to have another one put them behind me see there's things there's things that the devil gets all over you you know those things that that people battle with lust and and different things and rock and roll country music and different things in the world and you know he he said if you don't if you don't give uh your kids to Christ he said Rock and rolls going to get him and what did he do he just turned around and he took and he took rock and roll and he mixed it with gospel it is a it is the biggest mess of Filth you ever seen and what they do they just bring it right into the churches and they feed on that and it and people don't realize it came straight out of the pits of hell is from Hebrews Hebrews 9 9:14 says how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God go he spent he sent his word to us amen and to be quickened by the word by the spirit he said to purge us from Purge our conscience he said it was a desire to do away with the desire of of the things of the world to serve a living God that we can be free from those things to be purged from them brother said in the message what is the Holy Ghost he said that's what the we don't get sealed so much he said we're too loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life to see if you're not just a little loose about things a little loose about your prayer life a little loose about your temper about that temper a little loose about that tongue to talk about others he'll never seal that car that's the reason we've not come to that place people people think that they've received something but they not come to that place because they're little Lo Lo he said they not they not got that car sealed can you can you imagine that coming to this place and the thing that that stood out to me you know we don't we don't have a a desire but you you go back and look in the Old Testament with Aaron where the high priest when he got prepared to go into the holies of holies you know brother you know everything had to be just right the clothes the way he bathed himself had to be a certain way every every garment had to be in a certain way in a certain everything proper and in its way in its place before he went in right and see you know there he was he had to take Moses's word for it that you know Moses did you make sure you got all the words right is this exactly the way it is because when he went in there it was death right and see the thing is we don't approach it the same way we don't approach it with the same sincerity because if we approach it the same way then it wouldn't then would he he would be sealing us then then people wouldn't be sealed right but it's not because people have not come to the same place where they actually have a deathly sincerity to it not realizing that the minor things in your life how important they are the Minor Details because it would if he if he missed some minor detail that high priest was dead right he didn't have a do over when he went before when he went into the holies of holies he had to be right and perfect right he was dead and it's the same way with us we have to be exactly right ex reach reach that exact place everything has to be perfect be spotless it's something because we look at him we say well I can't reach that but guess what if you if you trust God he'll bring you to that place see we look at we say you know because we wonder sometimes we we read these things and you know in the scripture where it says you know he said you know you be you'll be made fun of he said blessed are when when men revile you and say all manner of evil against you amen when they persecute you he said blessed are you right see you're you're a you're a blessed person right he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad right see he's going to if he's going to lead you and guide you into all truth if he's going to bring you to these places but you're going to you're going to be pressured you're going to be persecuted but you're blessed by it see then you got to realize you know I'm blessed that he's going to bring me to that place I can't get there on my own but he's he's obligated to bring me there yes right that I'm that I'm blessed this is from Trum me gives an uncertain sound but see when you come into a place that you have receed the new birth because it is a definite experience amen of justification and sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen not just not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost but there's a definite experience that takes place and when you've come to that place then guess what he said all the all the devils in hell are against you every gun's going to be trained against you brother says an uncertain sound it's like St training a so like training a soldier he said now A Soldier's got to learn the sound of his bugle or the trumpet he doesn't know if the trumpet goes blows whether whether to charge or to retreat and he doesn't know the difference what kind of mixed up Army would you have the enemy C would certainly triumph over a bunch of soldiers that was no better trained than that amen that's what's the matter with our churches today we're trained we've trained them on Creeds different one to the other we got to be United we've got to know a trumpet then which then which is the trumpet they say the gospel trumpet that's it the word of the Living God is the trumpet don't mix nothing with it he goes on says now army war it's always been a war we never join the church or come into a church to come to a picnic we must realize that we are coming to a Battleground we never come for people to Pat me on the back and say brother brandom you're a wonderful person no sir I come here with a shield on I don't need a shield I don't need a shield for that I come with a helmet and the armor I come to fight fight every inch of the ground God told Joshua every place The Souls of your foot Treads upon that I will give you so footsteps meant possession and when the church gets to a place that come from ises with Creeds and compromises with the word and compromises with the world I mean then it's losing ground it's taking back he said what we need tonight as soldiers to possess every Divine promise of this Bible that God promised to the church whole armor of God and to stand what we need soldiers not get a uniform for a dress parade it's always different see God didn't call us for a dress parade see we come in he didn't call us to a picnic he called us to a battle right he said he said you know I I come to get a armor I come to get into to the armor of God because there's a battle Ephesians 6 right he says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might he says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil he said for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins G about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness Jesus said he said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free right right brother bam said in the SM Church age he said no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than in his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God as seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament so you have to be GED about with truth he said he would lead you into all truth so you have the take on the truth and you I was reading something on that you know that's the basic part of the armor to hold everything together was was the loins being guarded about to hold everything into place so it takes truth because it's not just some truth but it takes all the truth and that's what he leads you into he said and your feet sh with the preparation of the gospel of peace he said it be ready to do what the word of God calls for to be shot about have your feet shot with the gospel to do whatever whatever the word calls you to do to be able to speak the word as the scripture says be instant in season and out of season be prepared you know the in the in the Old Testament the children of Israel when they got ready to leave Egypt you know they had to they had to be completely ready God calls them and tells them they had to get completely ready but when they ready to eat the lamb that when they they roasted the lamb and put the blood on the door you know they had to be ready to leave Egypt they had their shoes on they were ready to go and so that's the way you are you have to be prepared for whatever whatever the word God calls you to do right and he says above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked have faith yes sir it takes a revelation yes sir takes it you have to have the Revelation to quench these fiery darts but you know what he said because it's given to you because if you're if he because the thing is it's not with something that God's holding back from you because Paul is saying you've got to take the whole armor right he said you take on the armor of God right he said guard yourself with it right so it's something you've got to do it's something that that you've been given but you've got to equip yourself and he says and take on the the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God right the helmet protect you because we know that was the chosen Battleground the Mind God chose the M you know Satan chose the Mind God chose the heart but that was where the battle taking place he said that's your protection of the chosen Battleground because you realized it that's where you that's where the Bible going to take place in your mind and you've got and in your mind see that's where you have to confess you've got to come to the place where you confess it and think on it dwell on it it's got to be a positive thought amen because you know what if you think if you have those thoughts as brother Ernie was talking about you know your thoughts lead to words right your words lead to actions and your actions lead to Destiny so he said he your high the high priest is your confession he said is whatever you confess that's what that's the only way that he can intercede the only thing he intercedes on is your confession so you got to be equipped with the helmet You' got to come to your confession because that's what in Revelation it tells us he said he said they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony that's right it's like they said that's why they overcome brother Bram said this is a message Queen of Sheba said the only way that you can be saved is by faith he said you've got to look at the Unseen and a whole armor of Christianity is Supernatural people say how that a man can say that he believes in God and preaches in a church and says he does not believe in the supernatural when the whole armor of God the whole armor of Christianity is Supernatural amen he said what is the armor of Christianity love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness patience Faith Holy Ghost all these things are Supernatural that's what you've been G about with that you've been given Lord all these things are given to you that you can G yourself with you know I was I was preaching sometimes back and I I was telling you you go back and you read the scriptures see I have I have peace like a river why because he said I had it you know I don't I don't have any sorrow why because he took it away from me he said he carried our grief and took our sorrows well if that's true that I don't have it anymore right why because he took it from me right if he's carrying it for me brother Mark then I don't have it I have joy unspeakable and full of Glory I have patience why because that is a attribute of him and if it's an attribute of him then that's what I have that's right whether whether I whether I I I manifest it or not it's mine right it's a part of me every bit of this is me I have love joy peace meekness goodness that's who I am amen whether whether whether I manifest it or not it's it's who I am that's right why because if you don't confess it you never come to it amen I told told Brother David Sunday said you get no my sermon Wednesday night and uh I had this I had this in my notes and and he was reading it it's from the Lamb's Book of L I read it part of again he said he makes no mistakes he said he wouldn't bring you in if you wasn't worthy he knows your heart that's right he knows what you are he knows your motives he knows what you are there's traps all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble and you say God I didn't mean to do that that God you know it you're still perfect because there's a perfect blood offered for you every day and a bleeding sacrifice hanging there before the Throne of almighty God that's right I'm so glad that he knows that he that he knows where we start he knows all about us he said if you he would bring you in if you wasn't worthy see it's it's not it's not if I'm worthy or not because he's worthy right because the scripture says he that knew no sin he became sin he didn't become sinful but he took on sin he took on my sin that I might become the righteousness of God brother said he said it was the very righteousness of God he said to believe one was to believe the other and he said to deny one was to deny the other right so if I've accepted him that he's taken my sin that I don't have any sin then automatically I've become the righteousness of God right I because I've taken on what he's given me whether whether I believeing or not but you know what you confess it right whether you see it or not you confess it as the scripture tells us or brother R was talking about you know the biggest portion of our faith is mental Faith that's right he said but you've got to take a mental faith and he said when you pour the word of God into a mental Faith he said then it becomes a spiritual Revelation so you've got to come to a place that everything you say it lines up with the word right right you know I've heard people say I don't know what I'm going to do I you know I don't know how this is going to take place or what you know are all these things so we shouldn't be saying things like that right so you know what I trust God he's going to give me the answer amen because if I give it to God I don't have to know how it works because he'll take care of it right the problem is if I get myself out of the way then he can do the work but lotten times the problem is is we get in the way we hinder God from working but see you know we we don't need to say these things because we need to say what he said we need to confess what he says it's a the same thing this is from testimony of the sea testimony on the sea now I like this brother says remember you don't pet Christians Christians are rugged they are men and women of God who stand for God regardless of what anybody else has to say you don't have to beg them and persuade them and perfume them and baby them around that's hot bed hybrid plants it's no good at all they'll never produce nothing right so the thing is is now if we take if we take what he said he said Christians are rugged you don't have to pet Christians well then guess what whether whether however I go if you know my confession ought to be I'm rugged right you don't have to pet me you don't have to persuade me you don't have to per perfume me I'm rugged and I walk in that because that's what he's given me because he said if not he said you're a hybrid hot bled plant and they'll never produce nothing right then you know what I ought to say I'm producing what he's what he's given me to produce he's producing Jesus Christ in me Hallelujah that's why it's being produced in me because I'm not I'm not a hot bed plant I'm rugged I'm I'm born with a backbone no matter how many times you get run over see Shemar stood there all those times he got run over but you know what it didn't change him every time the Philistines stole everything that he had it didn't change who he was that's right the whole time he was he was a an Israelite he was he was under the Covenant he didn't change it when he gave everything to him when he allowed him to destroy everything right but you know what one day he stood up and said they won't take anything else from me see when he took on that see it was always there he always was that but one day he stood up and he took them on and his brother Ron was s about you know they made a terrible mistake said one can put a th000 to flight they only brought 600 see they didn't realize they the Philistines were terribly numbered see if we look at it we look at it all backwards when we look at it and and it was Elisha stand there talking to gazi on the mountain so he was looking at the armies and all the people that were all around and he said he said don't worry he said there's more with us than they are with them right what are you talking about he said Lord open his eyes that he can see right see how the man was on fire and all the ones that were around the Heavenly Host all around them see there was God to protect them to take care of them but see they didn't see that brother bam said if we can only see in that other realm he said we would see the angel sitting on the pews that's right oh we think it's somewhere else no it's right here that's right bless amen so he's not meeting somewhere else he's meeting right here why because you brought your lick of fire I brought mine he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'm in the midst that's right amen see there reason I read that quote everywhere I go see he's here to meet your needs he said there's a bankdraft on Heaven he said before he would let one of his promises fail he said he would bankrupt Heaven see we we fail to realize where we're standing where we're sitting yeah many times brother Dane and I have talked about how many times we've talked about people who are understanding that that when people come for prayer people are not receiving their healing what's going on something is failing something is wrong and sometimes people just yeah he said drive us into desperation he should wake us up he should R Us to a place F what God why aren't you moving maybe that's what we don't want them to move yeah we're just comfortable we just comfortable where we at we we like it see that's what happened to the children of Israel right they got to a place where they got comfortable right so God just had to stir the pot a little bit send him a little some folks along to make their little clubm vacation wasn't a vacation anymore brother say this is forsaking all he says you can expect the world to make fun of you you can expect the world to call you all kinds of unhonorable names they'll call you anything that they can call you you'll be despised and rejected Jesus because of of him being Emanuel God dwelling in him it made him so odd to his own church till his own church excommunicated him as soon as he come in they was the one who hung him on the cross they was the one who condemned him he loved people his whole heart was for people but he had to forsake everything in order to follow God and so do we have to forsake everything in order to follow God now what do I get in return we don't expect sometimes I think we ministers make it a little too much flowers for the convert Oh Come to Christ everything is lovely but you see it isn't like that saying that everything's a flowery bed of ease because no Christian the Bible says all that live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution so if you're not suffering persecution for Christ's sake then there's something wrong if the devil ain't after you he's got you that's all because as long as he's after you there a sign that's a he hasn't got you yet but if he isn't after you it's a sign that he has got you he's got you yet 1 Corinthians 10:13 says there hath no temptation taken you but such is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear it so if we're going to come to these we're going to be tested we're going to be tried we're going to be made fun of but you know what he's going to make a way of Escape for us so we going to go through these things because if if they called the man the the head of the house they called him be what are they going to say about you amen see we're going to go through these things you're going to face these things see that's a that's the promise of God that's that's what you're facing but brother Brown says in the message identification he said and now being that we have identified ourselves as Full Gospel people let's mold our character he said we're invited to be molded into his image that we might reflect his presence he said and the works that I do shall you do also the life that I live so shall you we're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his what a thing my then when we let his character be in us then we have become Sons by the by having the mind of Christ mind which is his character our mind makes makes your Chara your mind makes your character let the Mind Paul said of Christ this mind that was in Christ be in you let that mind of Christ be in you it molds the character of a son of God so you're going to go through these things but you know what you're being molded by the things you suffer see because you understand but you're going to be perfected in these things and it really struck me when I read that he said we're being invited and to be to be molded see we're not being forced into it but we're invited into becoming molded Into His Image right right see it's a great thing it's a great daughter to be molded into His Image to take on the mind of Christ to be molded into that image Jesus said he said if if I be lifted up right he said I'll draw all men to me right right see brother says when he's talking on that he said it's it's preaching the the Simplicity of the Gospel he said that will draw the people he said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men to me he said it's the greatest magnet that the world has ever seen right is being is seeing Christ in you oh my that's the greatest thing see people are looking for a Bible he said because brother said it's not into Bible We need he said it's a revelation see what what is a revelation I heard brother was speak on this one time years ago a revelation is a life-changing experience amen it changes your life it changes who you are see Peter and John they stood there and they said we know we know these men are ignorant and unlearned they know nothing they said we know what they've been with Jesus right see the ones that when they called them Christians he said because they acted like Christ he said they identified who they were it was a life-changing experience when Paul was struck down on the road to Damascus and he was sit there and he was blinded when God was able to speak to him when the ones that went out from from their own when ananas come and prayed for him and the different ones when he went to see Peter and the different ones people knew that'd been a change in him right right he was not the same Saul he had the same Zeal but he had the Zeal to the Brethren to the word of God Amen there in Corinthians when he was writing to the to the church at Corinthians you know he was telling them of the times he said you know I've been I've been Shipwrecked and I've been beaten right he said a day and the night I've spent in the de you know it wasn't it wasn't a whole lot of fun when you s and read about those things beaten and stoned that's right he said in all the perils that they've been in all the perils that he had to go through CU he had a desire to see the word of God being taken to the Brethren to the churches he's saying that people grow in the word Lord that's right said it's the greatest magnet we've had this is from the message Abraham 1955 brother speaking of Abraham carrying having to leave his family was talking about people today he said now separate yourself from among your people that's best way to do it come out from among it get away from it someone said well I still go to the pool room I think maybe I could win some of the boys he said stay out of the pole room stay out of stay off the Devil's Ground that's right he said you'll never do it that way separate yourself and show your color be a Christian act like it live like it talk like it people will believe it no that Jesus said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men to me lift him up in your life in your living what you do right he said you're not going to get people because you can't get on Satan's battlegr you can't get on Satan's ground and get anything done that's right and the thing lots of times the way we get on on his ground is we run our mouths that's right why because we talk the devil's language we say what devil what the devil wants us to say Amen we just start having a pity party oh that's good that's good that's good keep on doing that yeah see but that's not what what he wants us to do we need to say what he said what God Said what God said about us yes Lord I wrote a little something here y just forgive me about I don't be shocked and this this something that's really stood out to me don't be shocked when when people pray and ask God God for something and it get and it happens and people are shocked people in this church things have been prayed over and people act like they're shocked when things happen what kind of what kind of expectation is that you know there's there's something else and y'all just pray for me but you know it's been it's been I don't know how many years ago but you know we prayed over loved ones in this in this church people that had loved ones that were away and you know we were claiming our our loved ones and we're praying over them and we believe God's bringing them in is that just words because see the thing what comes out of your mouth is what's defeating you because you're confing the wrong the wrong confession you're making the wrong confession Y and I see just just a a one that one that stands out to me and his brother Benny you know brother Benny's been coming you know for a long time you know he was I guess he was discouraged or whatever but you know what we still prayed for him amen I've known him for a long time and you know what it it Thrills me to see him in church right you know I mean he went he went through a lot of hard things but you know what God bringing back to bring you back to church where he's sitting here see I see I see that as as a as a prayer oh answer I see that as a miracle right well because a lot of people we just want to write people off but I don't write people offen right and want and I think of sister Regina being gone for so long and and and being back with us right but there's another one I want to say tonight and I don't I don't want to offend anybody I don't want but there's one other person that me and D was talking about this the other day that really that's really stuck with me for a while and that was brother Ryan and sister Gabby coming back and I mean it's not and it's and and it's not one against the other that's right but let me tell you something I've been in this and and people that BL that come to this church and you know and I didn't I didn't say anything about it for a long time I just held my peace but I'm going to say something tonight because I want you to understand something yes Lord I've heard people that come to this church make comments about Ryan and Gabby about them not you know well I guess they'll never come back or anything like that see that's the wrong kind of confession right if you ain't done nothing good to say don't say nothing at all that's right that's right right well people just well they they never make it back they just they you know God never told me that they were coming back but you know what I never could say that he was gone that they were gone that they would never come back and you know because the one thing about it God God is Not glorified in confusion God's not glorified in fear come on exact but see the thing is when you when you walk before God and you you trust in God then you he'll bring you to where you need to be see it's what what's your confession that's it see the thing is all of us we say we say we all believe we're all trusting for one another but sometimes our mouth gets us in trouble right because we're saying we're saying things that we shouldn't be saying that's right and I know they didn't they want to expecting that tonight but you know that's something that's stirred me right why because you know what we're in a battle we've been called to a battle and that's one thing I've been saying all night long see we have the promises of God you're in a battle that's right you're going to have hard times you know what it's it's not going to be fun but you know what you don't lean on the flesh the flesh will fail you but there's something that's inside of you that'll car you right just like the just like the poem about the the man that saw the footsteps he said it was him and the Lord and he said Lord why is it went through my hard times he said I only see one foot one set of footprints he said I was carrying you during those times that's right see what what God has called us to God's bringing us to these things see the thing is we need when we believe when we say we believe we need to have an expectation sometimes I want what is your expectation right you got to have an expectation because if you don't expect nothing you don't get nothing if you don't look for nothing you don't get nothing I'm going to finish here in a minute I just got a couple of things I want to read what quick and I'm finish this is from the SM Church h brother BR says this from the church age book he said is it not is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we all we are all tried and chastened as Sons no no one but what goes through that the church that is not suffering that is not being tried isn't of God for whom the Lord loveth he Chase scourges every son whom he receiveth if he without CH chastisement whereof all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons then continuing on he says we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it he said love suffereth long and is kind Matthew 5112 says blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you he continues on he said the the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are the bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know how shall we know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us his Spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that in his wisdom allows allows to come to pass am that's my love for him that I should have joy and this is this is a quote that I want to read this is what I was telling brother R sister Gail about this is from letting off the pressure and brother says I met a woman here some time ago in a 10 cent store she was about 60 years old looked about 30 years old and I said well how do you do sister she said brother brandom I've got two sons that's doctors that are older than you are and honest to goodness she didn't look over 30 years old and said here's what it was when I come to Christ when I was about 12 years old I sat down and thought about it studied religions but when I found the true one she said I come to Christ and took my case my soul all all to him and said I've never had a worry sense now he promised to take care of all my troubles and said if he's not big enough to do it I know I'm not big enough to do it so there's what's the use of me worrying about it see that's it God promises that he would take all your cares cast your cares on him so you what are you worrying about that's right see what he said that she was so she was so happy she was so young looking why because she realized if God couldn't take care of there nobody worrying about it but he said he would take care of it so we just turn it over to him right and now the LA last one this is from the perg church age he said and then this word he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said that his word word was life he said he said that I am the way the truth and the life if any man have not the spirit of Christ he n is is is there it is he is spirit and he is life that's exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word he said so in a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips why it's the same as deity speaking right he said Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man so that's that's what it is to us said Satan cannot stand before that right so my question is are you Spirit born are you spirit filled have you taken the word into your heart do you confess the word he said because if you do that he said it's the same as deity speaking that's right see sometimes we and it really struck me people people looking they they want God to speak to them oh if brother Brandon was here to speak the word well guess what deity is here speaking amen yes sir if you speak it if you're a Son of God and you speak the word and believe right then it's the same as D speaking it's the same because it is him speaking amen so when you speak it then you believe what you say brother Bram said that Jesus walked in a realm of perfect Faith because he knew what who he was and he spoke and he walked in that realm so when he spoke he said I he said the son can do nothing of himself except what he see the father do he said that doth the son likewise so he walked in a realm of perfect Faith so he wasn't shocked when things happened he was the one you know he was the one that he never attended a funeral right that's right he never attended a funeral why because there was never any funeral that he ever went to see he had to he had to leave and walk away by the musicians come you stand I'm running out of time but ra when you know he had to he had to leave and he said he had to wait leave from uh Lazarus to pass right he said sleeps they said well he does he does well then he told him he said no Lazarus is dead but he knew he had to wait for Lazarus to pass so that he could go raise him up right so he wasn't concerned about what was going to take place and it's the same with you and I right if if we are who we say we are come on and he said that woman had had all that money and and all those things in her Bible it said right there and they were just pretty pictures to her and you know what you you've been you've been equipped all that you have need of has been given to you so if if you've been equipped with all that you have need of and that's yours then guess what if we don't if we don't claim ours then it's nobody's fault but ours right God can't do anym for us how many times did Brother vom tell him in the prayer lines when he stood there he said if Jesus was here tonight he said he couldn't do any more for you that's right you ask him to heal you he said I can't heal you he said you're already healed he said I've already done it right you know Isaiah 53:5 says we are healed amen by his stripes we are healed that's right we are healed first Peter 2:24 says by his stripes we were he healed past tense see it was already finished so he can't do any more for us than what he's already done but you've got to take him at his word on and that's what God wants us to do because the promises of God are yay and amen and they're given to us but we have to accept them God can't do any more for us than he's already done but he said he lead you and guide you he take care of you but You' got to accept him amen God bless you brother what you 47 in the red book just a closer walk with thee am you have a this evening as they sing you like prayer I am weak but th Jesus

that you're supposed to write down a piece of paper says write down all your troubles on one side and all your blessings on the other he said you'll find that all your blessings outnumber your troubles every time amen that's right because that's what happens you're you'll find out you're more blessed than you've got troubles and All the Troubles you've got they come work out for your good right there something good out of your troubles amen it's all hearts and Minds clear before we go this evening can I come say sure I didn't know what brother Aron was going to preach tonight but before the service I was just thinking about how thankful I am that uh that God brought us back and thank you Jesus thank you Father so L Hallelujah um you know me and Gabby were just divided on two doctrines over these years and uh and it just felt we were so one except for just those two things you know we just couldn't get together on those two doctrines we' talk about the word and talk about the message and when it come down to those two things we just couldn't see how eyes so we just wouldn't touch on it but we prayed and I prayed and the Lord began to deal with both of us and open our eyes about that but I wanted to say the Lord laid brother Mark on my heart right before the service and like I said I didn't know what brother Aron was going to preach but brother Mark's been coming so faithful and I know he wants his wife here and so uh shame on me for not praying for him I just never even thought about him but about that but uh U just say we should have brother Mark on our on our our hearts and and be praying for him and so many others because the truth brings division it really does and this message in general brings division between people and a lot of times and so just uphold one another you know and I think thank youall so much for your prayers that means amen thank brother Aon it's strange that he would say that because I was thinking about his wife too a few minutes ago and I thought she's so beautiful on the outside and I'm sure she's beautiful on the inside but Lord just you know bring her with for the mar it's funny that we both it's not funny that that he said two so there's two of us that was thinking the same thing so praise the Lord God does does all things in his own time that's right that's right we just don't try to get ahead of you right amen anybody else before we go let's say I appreciate all of you I love all of you we pray guys reading next this is what then prayed with both hands lifted we pray the see raise both hands pray amen
