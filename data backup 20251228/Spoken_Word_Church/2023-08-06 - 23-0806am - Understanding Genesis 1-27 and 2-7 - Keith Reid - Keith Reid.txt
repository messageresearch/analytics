to pour around [Music] thank you [Music] I want to see you amen praise the Lord amen we want to certainly thank God for this privilege of being in the house amen with Jamaica with a morning family amen we greet the family of God Amen and we're certainly glad to be here we're certainly glad for the hospitality that we've received each time we are here and not only that but it seems like my family is a part of your family amen it's a few places that I've gone to where I know most of the people and most persons who know me and so I'm no stranger to you amen as a I say this and I say this everywhere that this is a place where my early Christian life and my life as a pastor and a preacher I was taught the message of the hour amen where I can extend that um Wherever I Go and you know I thank God that um I've taken that gospel of Christ and the message of the hour you know I've been to South Africa Zimbabwe I've been to Zambia Nigeria I've been to Ghana I've been to Liberia Sierra Leone I've been to Kenya and Uganda amen amen by God's grace amen by the grace of God Amen praise God so we could tell you many things that has happened in the field and back home and wherever we go but we certainly thank God for his grace and his mercies towards us and like our Prophet says that no church no matter what it's practice it's a no matter intellectual or fundamental you want to be he said that church cannot strive until the Supernatural is made known among the people and it's something that you can talk to that can talk back to you so I said when the supernatural becomes natural in your midst amen then you know it's the maturing of the sons of God Amen praise God so amen very simple things we speak um the greatest thing that we can do is to take the word of God um by the light that the message has shown on the word and break it to the people so that our children can understand it you know if we say we preach a mystery and we think we've got a revelation of that and the younger ones can't understand it then the Mysteries us in our head amen but uh Rebecca had to know for certain exactly how Isaac is or else when she seem in the field she would have thought she had seen a stranger amen but he's not a stranger to us today we know exactly who he is and the only way you can truly know who you are is the first know who he is amen because you're a reflection of who he is amen so we're going to go to the scriptures this morning like to have my wife and um you know I greet you also from the children or you know where empty nesters you know our children live now in Canada and um but you know because of the way Technologies today we've not missed each other we see each other we talk to each other many times for the day amen and so so we thank God for that experience amen so we want to turn to uh the Book of Genesis the C chapter um Genesis chapter one and I'll read verse 26 and 27 and then we will move from there but let us bow our heads and talk to the author of the word amen our great God and Father when I thank you God for this privilege that you have given to given to us to be in your house and Lord God every time the doors are open it's not the building of God that is sacred but Lord God it is you in our lives that has transformed us oh God by Your Word Heavenly Father we pray that oh God will preach things oh God naturally among the people the Lord God they might see Jesus Christ this morning Lord remember those that are sick and Afflicted those that are without you this morning Lord God wherever the bride of Christ are gathered Lord God in your name we pray that you've been there midst this morning to feed the flock of God with the word of God and Father we thank you God to help us to move ourselves out of the way that you can be glorified today have your own way as we thank and believe you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen so in Genesis 1 26 you know it very well you could recite it and God said let us make man in our image and after all likeness and let them have dominion of the fish of the sea I want you to notice that he said and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the year and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created e them may the Lord had his Blessing to the word this morning you may be seated you know this is my third week here this morning and um you know I had to come before because we have you know just a little business that we do back home and others are depending on us so I had to leave Francine and my Kim on the 14th and she came to weeks after then when we leave here God's willing I'm going back home and she'll be going to see the girls you know in Canada but you know um she she had a ticket to come fly out of Montego Bay and um you know just share a little testimony with you and um we know there's a bus that travel out of Kingston maybe five times a day you know you have different ones going all the way to the airport so going to the airport now from linstead which for for us driving would have been just about two and a half hours really but now it costs the so small for you to take the bus and to go to the airport very convenient so uh I was trying to buy her ticket on the bus you know online to but the website was going all over the place and I didn't get a chance to do it so um Monday morning when she was supposed to um fly out Monday in the day she had I think one after some a flight after one o'clock so she had to be on the bus at 6 30 leaving Spanish town so I might call her to see if she was up and she was up so I said remember you got to get there early because you don't have a ticket you got to go to get a ticket but something said but why don't you go and check now if you can actually get the ticket and when I went on the side of the bus you know it showed me that there's no seat left on the bus oh my goodness so I I looked then that was a 6 30 bus I look at the the eight o'clock bus and there's no seat I look at the 12 o'clock bus and there's no seat so I the only seat was available two seats available on the 530 bus now or our flight is just after one o'clock so I said oh my Lord what will I do now so I called her and tell her I said Hey listen we've got to get somebody to take you to the airport you know and so you know this is the last minute really that we're going to go and um you know so she was calling the sister that was supposed to just take her 20 minutes into Spanish Town really to get the bus and so and to make new Arrangements but something said to me I mean pray and so I was going on my knees at the side of the bed to pray and you know you you have a notification in your phone and I hear it so I look and when I look somebody had sent me a text and it says so it was a scripture but then then it says but God but God and I went down and I prayed and I said but God you are rich in Mercy and you give to us exactly what we have need of and I just feel that assurance that everything is going to be all right and I got back up and I walked around I said well let me check again and I went back on the bus I went in and when I checked there was two seats there so I bought one amen you know we serve a God who uh make the impossible possible no I don't know if somebody dropped out or but that's not my business I only know that what I asked him for he gives it to me amen praise God so I call her back and says well that's all right you can take your time because you've got a confirmed seat on the bus amen praise God Hallelujah now we want to look at the word here that we've read in Genesis 1 26 and I'll go to Genesis 2 7 in a little while and I continue this afternoon to look at his condescending you know it says God created man in his own image in the image of God created in him male and female created them no God created not a man because sometimes we want to think that God created Adam no but God created man the whole man now this was the thought the expression of God that in the mind of God I want to be a father so I'm going to create man so when God has that thought that thought of God is eternal so God did not create just Adam but he created every redeemed human being was in The Talks Of God Amen and if that is not so then when we get over to predestination then we can't find ourselves if we can't find it back in the thought of God so we were in the mind of God before the world began so don't think that the scripture referred to only one man no but it refers to the whole redeem creation Now in the message demon knowledge in 1953 amen here brother Branham now putting that into perspective he said but your soul was made up before the foundation of the world when God created man in his own image Hallelujah so you didn't come afterwards amen I was spoken in the mind of God the same time that Adam came it isn't right so there is a part of me if I've got a new birth that is eternal in God Amen that in the beginning God when he said I want man I I need somebody to worship me you are part of that is that right Amen in his own image but man in his own image see and then he made male and female before he ever had a man in the dust of the earth amen then over requested an answer 1962 he said no no notice in Genesis again 1 26 God created the whales of the sea he'd done everything and made the creation made man in his own image made man not a man the whole man hallelujah amen all of them in his old image see and after the image of God created even yeah male and female created him but like that amen so we noticed then that now where are you in the beginning Hallelujah that day when God created man in his own image my expression from God was also created it's not only Adam because we think that he created Adam and then from Genesis 1 26 then he go to Genesis 2 7 with Adam but no you see in Genesis 2 7 he brought Adam from the start into expression amen hallelujah but where were you you were there hallelujah praise God so Jerry says no he said but then Genesis 2 7 Adam was first expressed it was formed taught of God hallelujah that's what he was hallelujah amen physical tangible from the pool Gene let us says from the the pool of thought that God have asked man from Genesis 1 26 27 amen so now he's carrying on his creation but at first that that first creation of man let us say but I was a part of it amen so when I say I'm a part of my savior I didn't come when I when I come from my mother and father I didn't come when I hear the word of God when God said let us make man in our image amen I was in the image of God not you the person not you the person but that Gene of God Amen that you will carry from the New Birth hey man you were already there Hallelujah so the exposition of the Southern church changes said in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the in the mind of God eternally so if you're in the mind of God eternally you never had a beginning there and you'll never added hand you're always there Hallelujah do not express until each comfort in the designated Hallelujah decreed season amen as each member came forth it become expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is eternal spoken word seed bride hallelujah amen and though as she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ amen so we're looking now where we were before hallelujah amen let us continue to bring it amen but you see we were there before God wanted it so amen but the rest of his attribute taught children should be expressed without the sexed act before that came in you were there but by creation of the spoken word until Genesis 3 when the fall is a rot amen then everything is going to be spoken of it is that right but you are before the fall amen you were before the fall amen said Romans 3 23 the Bible says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God now amen in that expression amen Paul was really expressing something that was before he was now speaking of Genesis 3. but the bride does not come because of Genesis 3 you came in Genesis 1 27. Hallelujah so you said well but I'm bound because I was born in sin and shaped in iniquity you see that's what the devil tells you but what does God say to you I brought you before that is that right you were before that amen then First Peter 1 23 being born again yes not a corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which light and abideth forever now when the fall came amen you could not come forth by the way Adam come amen and Adam was a Son of God in the Old Testament he never he came before The Fall Adam was before the fall amen the life of God in you was before the father amen but this man this is an unbeliever because he came in the fall you see so your life today is depict by who is leading you if you're being led by this man then you're an unbeliever and even if amen there's a gene that speak of you in the mind of God if you're out of your position you're in this man there's only one way to read the benefit of your eternal life you're going to step out of the flesh the Bible says he that is in the flesh cannot please God nor indeed can be so you cannot stand outside of your position and said well you know I'm predestinated seed of God and I will not be lost you're going to be lost if you're in a bachelor condition you're lost is that wrong but when you're in your position you can speak like God Speak but if you're out of your position amen and that is why we need the washing of the Water by the word hey don't let nobody fool you if this word don't wash you amen you'll never stand in position amen Moses had left them for 40 see they cross the Red Sea and when they cross the Red Sea what a jubilee they had Miriam took the tambourine and him and they're singing the dancing holy dance all right amen but but Moses though went upon the mountain to seal what God has given to them Hallelujah and the people begin to look for something else just a few days without the washing of the prophet and they begin to start to look for something else that you know what they did they took I idolatry went to the camp they began to take all their hearings and their chains and their their braces is that what the Bible said and they melt them into a golden calf and Iran said be all your God that take you out of Egypt why oh quickly they went there because the prophet was missing from their Mitch and they weren't being Washed by the prophet so now they begin to dance the the same people that a few days back dancing holy dance they now begin to dance a devilish dance see where you're going to be dancing to the right thing amen Hallelujah and I want to say to you you see people say well you know it's all right Hallelujah if we put them back and and all they listen because of the spirit of idolatry when we took them off we never put them back hello hello and anytime you see they start coming back into the house of God idolatry is also coming back amen you might not like that but that's the truth amen Hallelujah amen praise God now a dead incense somebody was dead in sin well they said we're born in sin and we are certainly so we are formed in sin because the the human desire was involved Hallelujah so therefore you're annihilated from God amen and a man that's dying is sin is annihilated from God according to Ezekiel that's what the Bible said if such a one is originally Hallelujah an attribute taught of God in Genesis 1 27 that God created the whole man Hallelujah and a part of God's thought is dead but the thoughts of God is eternal amen hallelujah and so no matter what the devil does on this side he cannot stop the plan of God in your life [Applause] what the bride of Christ ought to do is to stand in your predestinated position the word of God hallelujah no people say today well you know we put the message aside we put the prophet's voice aside or we call it the voice of God and we're going back to our Bible but we have the Bible for all these years and we didn't even know what was there it was right there written on the pages but there was no light Hallelujah and so this one said this means this and this one said that means that you know why because they're all in darkness but the light shine that you no longer presuming you know exactly what is there amen hallelujah glory and blasphemous names paragraph 185. he said now they take the scriptures from back and God breathe the breath into the nostril and he become a living Soul now I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of breath was he breathing before God breathed his breath of life into him what kind of breath he was a breathing living man well then if that be so then every animal is a living soul amen and the Breath of God brings the new birth you hold that amen so cause they breathe hallelujah amen a human soul or human soul and all together that Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the animal sacrifice him it would have been sufficient so brother the argument don't stand Hallelujah you must be born again Hallelujah but what good did the breath that breathe of Eternal that breath of eternal life amen then you become a living soul a soul that can't die now watch now we're going to get into honey Plum tour of hell but he said notice breath he said breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostril and he become a living Soul because God's breath not what nature done but what God did breathe the breath of life amen into this nostril and he become a living Soul amen hallelujah no we're looking at that portion we want to move into another Direction now now the question is when God said let us make man in our image in Genesis 1 26. who was he talking to amen who was he talking to now let us look at Genesis 1 26 again and God said let us make man in our own image after likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the year and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth Hallelujah God is one and as many titles or attribute is that right to express himself hallelujah amen at any point in time God expressed himself by his attribute amen so it's either it's title his office is attribute whatever we want to call it but his father his son and he is the Holy Ghost are you with me and has always been the same person all the time there is one God hallelujah and none else so in Ephesians 4 and verse 6 he said one God and Father of all who is above all father and through all the son and in you all the Holy Spirit amen hallelujah Glory it literally it really depends on your viewpoint on how you see the scripture now in Isaiah 45 and verse 22 the Bible says look unto me and be saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else look unto me and be saved he said for I am God therefore it's projecting God as your savior Hallelujah and he said and if I am your savior there's none else hallelujah amen so in the message Look Away to Jesus paragraph 216. he said so many of you that claim to have the Holy Ghost look and see the second person of a trinity claiming to have the Holy Ghost but you're looking at yourself I see the second person of the trinity amen when it's not even mentioned in the Bible there is no such a thing the word Trinity is not even in the Bible but yet when you look at Jesus you regard him as the the third person or the second person of a trinity and that's the reason you don't get anywhere yeah in paragraph one two one seven he said you know what he said I am God and there is none other beside me in other words when I stand there's none beside me there there there there is one God amen but we've got to look now at his expression amen we've got to get it there hallelujah amen he said no so it depends on what you're looking at if you want to put some little mascot boy an old man with beard and so forth if that's the way you look at Jesus as being some different person from God you are looking wrong you don't see it and if you will focus your mind to God's word there's only one way we can get it not by theology to God's word the tree will be one see but your ecclesiastical glasses get out of focus when you try to make him three and not one the question is who was he talking to I wanted to build that in mind amen Look Away to Jesus paragraph two to two but it depends on what you are looking at what do you see when you do look remember you can only see him as you look at him through the word where is he through the word amen hallelujah you can't look at him through a textbook you can't look at him to a Creed Hallelujah you will how you will see two or three gods are everything else in them Creed but look at him through the word and you'll see that he is Emmanuel God made flesh Among Us he said I am God and beside me there is none other he is God one God Amen Hallelujah so Genesis 1 1 says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth one God Amen hey I tell you this thank God he sent us in this hour have you ever think where you would be if God never sent us a voice in this hour we would be there in the robe choir singing God and three persons Blessed Trinity that's where we would have been but God sent us a voice we would be back there in Pentecost preaching a god like your finger amen Hallelujah Glory but let us look now the word God was translated from the Hebrew word Elohim meaning self-existing one you all know that hallelujah amen all dwelling all by himself that was what he was way before the creation of all things even man in the abducted adoption 605-15e paragraph 99 he said let me before we go any further go back to Genesis 1 26. when God made man before he made man he called himself [Music] hello him the word means in Hebrew the self-existing one all by himself nothing exists before him he was all the existence there were there ever was self-existing one well Ella Elohim means all sufficient all-powerful mighty self-existing one Hallelujah so we said then before God was God there's no textbooks that ever say that amen no Theologian ever expressed that but a prophet says before God was gone amen hallelujah when he was Elohim but before the beginning that was before the beginning Hallelujah Elohim unit plural one Hallelujah but an expression yes hallelujah amen amen this does not it's not simply plural no no it's one God hallelujah amen we're coming down to his name also so adoption 107 he said e by for knowledge foresee us knowing that he was a savior Hallelujah yet he's self-existing amen but he knows he's a savior because enemies are truth or knowledge omnipotence hallelujah amen yes there was no angel no nothing just God hello himself existing one nothing but him alone but in him was a savior well what's he going to save all of you we're coming down now there's nothing lost amen knowing that he knew what this great attribute in him would would project something about Yonder that he could save he knew that so he knows that you would be right here this morning amen God Hallelujah and this thing you're praying for in your mind right now he has already given the answer that's the kind of God we serve oh my God hallelujah that here now we are finite but he's in for night is it right Hallelujah and let me just say this real quickly and he gives us a theophany second Corinthians 5 1. if I hurtly I was in the stubborn I can be dissolved we've got an Assembly of God high up in the heavens that's not made with ants but in this we're groaning because we don't know but a house in Heaven Knows this is terrestrial but he is Celestial amen is that another you no if if he puts you here to be tested and tried and we many times talk about job he said have you considered my servant job but God said the same about you and you're looking at the present display God's looking at himself because his attributes went out and every attribute that God will come back to God that God will be all in all this trial that you're going through is nothing a glory Glory my my mama I like that yes sir we got to know who he is if we are going to know who we are amen amen hallelujah knowing that that he know that this great attribute in him would project something Yonder that could be saved could be saved could be saved you know why you can be saved hello because you're a part of God that's it this part of the creation that cannot be saved but you can be saved you can be saved not because you are created Created no there's things that were created by God that will go and annihilated but you can be saved because you are the thought of God and the Talks Of God are Eternal and so you are Eternal in God no devil can stop you amen amen hallelujah and you got to know who you are when you approach the enemy you're going to know the authority that's in your mouth amen this week we were laying hands on people and pray for them but we don't even have to lay hands if we know who we are I was born in Liberia and I was through preaching and the young people was at the altar and you know brother Caleb you can he touch me on the shoulder he said brother Keith there's a woman here that's possessed with the devil you want to pray for her I say yes amen because their 90s already there he's there and when I turn around they were holding her from coming towards me because that demon want to reach out but I didn't touch her I said in the name of Jesus Christ and now come out of her and she lose all her strength and they didn't have to hold her anymore she swiveled down on the ground and even when church was over she was still snoring on the floor she needed rest she had struggle with that power of that demon inside of her she was like a raging Buller but when God take that from her her body needed rest and she was sleeping on the ground you're gonna know who he is that you know who you are amen Hallelujah then when it did that by for knowledge he looked down and saw everyone that would accept it you know why you accept it it's not because you are bright no no it's not because you're good you even know that among your siblings yeah if you be fair there were some that should have received this and you should have been damned to him but by the grace of God somebody said I received garment I was a child and I've never left there's another one that said I run away Dave let us feel day with my life it's not because I wanted to come back but because God rich and mercy but God but God God rich and mercy for his great love weariness lovers when we're dead and trespass and sin he projected that love I see a Potter myself that's why he sought me and he bought me and made his redeeming blood amen hallelujah and then by doing so he said to say that the only way I can do it was a calm down myself and make flesh and take the sin of man upon him brother Wade everything that you committed when you went away he took that upon himself Hallelujah amen he died for me that I might be the one that's worshiped because he's God the object of worship amen that's a reason to love him right here Hallelujah amen it's not the preach I will preach to you no no no it's not your grandmother prayed all night over your soul no it's God it is God it is God hallelujah amen glory so now he's no longer hello him self-existing no no no no no no no no he's no longer an empty Nesta it's children that went out of him come back to him you understand that amen what children brother keep me Hallelujah is no Jehovah because he exists with his family Hallelujah he's manifested attributes Hallelujah the manifestation of the Son of God Amen hallelujah amen so now let us look at him quickly so firstly to say Amen if hallelui form was the first form was light called the pillar of Fire and that Pillar of Fire amen hallelujah the logos the word the Shekinah Glory that's his first birth god-giving birth to himself amen no if I was to draw this because sometimes when you look at my notes only we can understand it because it's not in words it's in symbol and I usually Express things as a pyramid so you see when we speak of the Eternal God brother how do you draw that kind of board an eternal God that filled all time space and Eternity I cannot project it I cannot draw it I cannot write that on a piece of paper amen the Eternal God amen but in order for my mind to conceive it become the logos he gave birth to himself brother Bradham said a tangible form a light a pillar of fire amen that I can look at that is why the spill of fire when we saw that we should never put William branham's picture there we put the half minute of Christ he said that the best of my knowledge that's what I saw it is him amen Hallelujah glory to God yes sir so there's a pillar of fire the logos you muscle not make any mistake about that the Eternal God cannot be fathomed with a pen and paper no the eternal spirit amen so when he said let us make man in our image it has not yet appeared but we shall be but this we know oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen I'm trying to reach you now hallelujah amen so the logos was the invisible Holy Spirit the eternal spirit made visible image and tangible that was the form he came also on the day of Pentecost amen the same God that speak the world into existence I'd like to say that same God came on the day of Pentecost and he has not left because that same God made you that day oh hallelujah amen Glory when you said I have the new birth the same one meet with you and when he met you your life could never be the same again years ago his brother Dave tautos he said fate the bottom of the pyramid you're born again experience and then you had virtue and knowledge in terms of what you want me to tell you something everything that you need was in that seed nothing excluded was in that sea that came and he begins to build around that experience amen and you said ah he's building what a glorious building is building hey can I say storms of your maturing what he was doing he was Destroy what you are thank you so when I say from Faith to Virtue he was destroying what I am [Music] you can take the horoscope and if they say you're born under a certain sign people can look at you know you and said Ah that's exactly what weed is that's exactly who he is and that they're reading of this characteristic that was your nature when the new birth begin to bring into that image oh Hallelujah can I say like this it's your six seal yeah the I'm a Gideon destroy Who You Are there is a butterfly in every caterpillar but in order for that butterfly to come out of that caterpillar that caterpillar is going to be destroyed it's got to have a I'm a Gideon so you can have a metamorphosis and you've got to have an armagedia destroying who you are because when it transforms you nothing nothing of who you were is still there Hallelujah don't let them fool you nothing of what you want but now you're coming into the image yes of who he is you can take your Bible and hold it like the prophet or hold it like your favorite preacher that stupidity yeah because that's not the image that God if that's the image that God is bringing you to oh Hallelujah brother Branham that when he looked and he'd think of himself and he saw that man in that overall he said that's who I should have been that's what I wanted that's what in my Gene but that's not what God wants God wants a picture of himself it's going to be a day when you look in the mirror it's not the picture of your daddy or your mama no not the genes of your family lineage but the picture of God amen hallelujah amen yes sir Hallelujah so the marked in the beginning time frame an eternal time creation time that's what he's doing the logos the light was not all of the eternal spirit but it represents the eternal spirit it was an emissary yeah and discharging or displaying Hallelujah Channel an outlet here's a writer of God thoughts Hallelujah the logos was the begotten son amen yes hallelujah amen now the Bible says from the bosom meaning the belly the heart of the father declaring the invisible eternal spirit John 1 18. amen amen amen so John 1 18 it says no man had seen God at any time get that clear in your head if I draw it on paper what would I put would I put the pill the picture of a square it has boundaries do I draw a line amen it's got boundaries the Eternal God cannot be represented it can't be represented come on except he reflect himself the logos that I see the pillar of Fire it come in a form that my mind can channel can understand a concept of who he is listen until that day of your change you never never can reflect that eternal spirit amen Hallelujah amen so John 1 180 no man had seen God at any time the only begotten son it's a logos which is in the bosom the belly the heart of the father Hallelujah Elohim the eternal spirit e the logos US declared God amen amen hallelujah oh we could take scripture of the scripture now amen hallelujah so the next script you know Hallelujah said John 1 1-5 in the beginning was the world that's the logos and the Word was with God and the Word was God amen now that's my mind picture of God Amen the same was in the beginning with God and he said all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life yes and the life is the light of man and the light Shone in darkness and the Darkness comprehended not when the Bible says comprehending it did not mean it did not understand it it dispel it to nothingness so light replace the darkness in other words the darkness and the light could not be together so when the light project there was no Darkness that's what it means it says it comprehend it not amen hallelujah amen it did not show that you and I are either trained the Angels cherubim creatures the serpent came first Hallelujah in expression but the word the logos the pillar of fire the Shekinah Glory right Hallelujah not the theophany no not the theophany the logos let me say this quickly to you you see the logos is like a veil and in that Veil The tiafani is there in the eternal spirit God the logos is there but until he project him the logos Veil can't come out yes now so let me say this now so when he project himself as a logos if the logo should speak of him he says my father and went from that Veil the logos the theophany steps out the theophores say of that Veil that I come from my father and when that logos that the effort remember now the theophany neither eat nor sleep but when he met Abraham he put on 16 elements and he heat with Abraham and he refers back to the he said my father and so Jesus when he came he said my father I come from my father because it's constantly giving birth to himself [Music] hallelujah amen amen praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah the word the logos was made Lord Jesus Christ I've been even before he was manifested in the flesh terrestrial visible was the agency of creation so the word is ah e person the person the name Jesus was the father's name amen Lord Jesus Christ and he received me not so Jesus was saying let me let's take Saint John 5 43 I am coming my father's name is that what he said I come in my father's name amen amen Lord Jesus Christ amen and he received me not he said if another home in his own name he me shall receive you know why they could not receive him in his father's name because they didn't know his father and neither do they know him so theology we realize no cannot recognize God and if theology does not recognize him the church and all its denomination is lost because they preach a concept of God yeah that can never materialize in a body amen amen hallelujah amen so the Apostle Paul puts it in in Colossians 1 15. he said who is the image so I'm reflecting now Saint John 5 43. amen I am coming my father's name and so Paul now in Colossians 1 15 said who is the image of the invisible God Amen Hallelujah the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are inert visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or Dominion or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him Hallelujah and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church amen Hallelujah who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence preeminence now let me say this to you that in all things he might have preeminence now in Christ The Mystery of God reveal I personally believe when brother Branham preached Christ The Mystery of God revealed he was preaching the seventh seal the coming of the Lord that he might reveal himself completely in Jesus Christ what have you to do with that right there's nothing you can do about that God revealed himself completely in Jesus Christ but number two that he might have preeminence he might be the first person he might have the leading among the body of believer listen Church if God don't have the leading in your life you are not of God he's got to mean more to more to he's got to be first person your reason for living therefore it's not your desire it's not your thought it's not who you think that you are or aspired to be if God don't have preeminence in your life there will never be a restoration back to the Garden of Eden all Redemption would have been lost can you do that by yourself I tell you before the only way it can be done is by the word of God Supreme deity has got to stand up in your life and live yes in your life everything that you do therefore you know the church the church ought not to be where we come to when we have nothing else to do you see we don't cut we don't come to call it we don't come if there's a a ball game going on we don't come if somebody's sick there is so many things we we put before the perfecting of our soul but Brethren if you look back when Israel was in the wilderness and the Tabernacle of Moses was set up every tribe their Direction was set towards the Tabernacle that's where the Shekinah Glory comes down it was a central theme of their existence no matter what tribe they belong to no matter what they do the Tabernacle was a central theme of their existence because that's where the Ark of the Covenant and The Mercy Seat was brethren they were without the Holy Ghost yes Lord of an innocent substitute for our lives but today the Holy Ghost oh the Holy Ghost bring you back to the image of Jesus Christ Brethren if we're going to leave out of here if we're going to leave out of here Christ masava preeminence preeminence first person in our lives amen it must not be just something that we do yeah and we join a lodge We join a church this is more than church this is God revealing himself into his creation and God took the cream we say the cream but God took himself and place it in the creation we walk among Common People amen but Christ in you Christ in you is a hope of glory and the only God this world has ever seen we'll ever see is a God that dwells in you and so when God step or when that logos comes out of God gave birth to himself God begot God amen so sometimes you you even talk to yourself and some of you do it more than some really and you know that's good for your mental capacity really because you know the psychologist says you can always talk to yourself but when you when you begin to answer yourself then you are you're totally gone so I could be by myself I said self or how you feel today if self ever answer me I got to go to the asylum but God but God when he saw Hallelujah himself coming into tangible being amen hallelujah it was so perfect in his expression and projection that God says let us make man Hallelujah he couldn't talk to me I was a thought but he speak yes through the logos because through him created all things amen and the devil knowing who you are that you come from God and you're going back to God amen yeah bring you through everything of this world can give to you put in broken homes your marriage is broken your children is going astray everything your life he puts everything there you lose focus and Direction and and the desires of the world this world become so cloudy your mind that you're losing where you're coming from but God the Bible says in Ephesians I think chapter two as we prepare to close amen Hallelujah praise God experience oh I'm sorry you know your own Bible you know what the page even look like amen Ephesians 2 and verse 1. and you has he Quicken yes or dead in trespasses and sin we're an in time pass you walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the year the spirit that now is still working in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time past and the loss of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others show me your hands if you have never been like that but the Bible says in verse 4 but God who could it be but Jesus look at yourself this morning and said for me to receive eternal life it has to be God when you know who you were and where you're coming from but God when the devil tried everything that he could do to you but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherein he love us even when we were dead in sin has Quicken us together with Christ by grace how you saved amen hallelujah it's the grace of God and I like what he says there in Romans he said for your predestined unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ no matter what the devil do you're gonna find your position I'm able to find my position and I'll tell you boo devil because I'm going to walk in it and there's coming a day when when even God look at me the only thing he's going to see is himself [Music] [Applause] but if I don't know who he is how am I going to know who I am en you are the Eternal thoughts of God in expression and you're going to have a little trial I know the holder you get a heart righteous in your joints and heart trouble enough because this man has got to be destroyed amen but hey I've got news for him this morning that not even dead can't stop you because that even developed the picture yeah but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wearing his lovers Hallelujah God is an overcomer you want to prove that yeah
