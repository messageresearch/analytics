========================================

all right we're going to turn to Matthew chapter 1333 right on time how many enjoyed brother Ryan Sunday school lesson about say where he is there he is he hiding from you on on God's parenting of us and wisdom that was good appreciate that Matthew 13:33 and um you know last last few times we were talking about um on claiming our inheritance and how God gives us our inheritance and how Joshua compares to Ephesians and and how your inheritance is the statute of perfect man is your inheritance and moving on up into God's blessings and how God continues to give you his grace uh uh just keeps piling on greater and greater Graces to you after you receive the Holy Ghost until you come into the full stature of perfect man and come into an image where God can look at you and see his own reflection back and uh we when we look at into God's word you know Paul talked about how this is supposed to be a mirror that we look in and and examine ourselves because the the the written word is God and letter form so we can look into God's written word and compare ourselves back our life and and see how it matches up we can read in in Isaiah and you know how he was talking about how he'll bring the people bring Israel back to his holy mountain well what makes the mountain holy I was listening brother Brown talk about this on the way to church this morning what makes the mountain holy is not a holy church or a holy building or a holy mountain is Holy because God is there God makes it holy when when the disciples came and and saw the uh Jesus on the mountain with Moses and Elijah oh this is a holy place but what made it holy was because God was there and and that's what makes it holy so um before we read this let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we thank you God for your grace to us for another hour another day to serve you Lord and to come around your word and fellowship Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll be with us and just be with the service this morning and this afternoon and just be with us today Lord that we can glean a little bit more of the precious bread of life God help us Lord Jesus uh many are sick and Afflicted Lord Jesus and I pray that you'll touch us Lord because it's written in your word and it's your desire to heal us that you PID the way we just read that you uh you were wounded for our afflictions and you paid the price for our salvation and for our healing Lord and I pray God that you'll help us to believe it and accept it be with us this morning Lord Jesus and just open your word to us we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now Matthew 13:33 this is kind of an odd scripture that um uh many people don't really know what to do with cuz it seems kind of out of place um and it's also told in Luke 13221 that's the same kind of story and um so I'm going to read it another Parable spake he unto them the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto Leen which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leaven now now we we've been think talking about uh Joshua and how the children of Israel crossed over the river Jordan enter their inheritance and they they began fighting to claing back all of their now it just started as a little simple thing they crossed over the river Jordan and they began to to take bit by bit piece by piece their inheritance until um what was promised to them that was that everything that uh Abraham could see everywhere he went would be theirs and we've got that same promise today and and the way it works is is by a little bit at a time God magnifies himself in us and and and grows now I was I was thinking about um you know today uh we we have kind of through the message everybody kind of has different ideas and different things and that's kind of how the uh the early church was when the the apostles when you know they were walking with Jesus and they began to uh Talk Amongst one another who's going to be the greatest and and you know they were there was a little biger and fighting and and uh and and uh one had a little different idea about this and a different idea about that but then when they all came together they it they were in one Accord and something happened to bring them all into the unity of the faith so that they were all together and I I believe that's the same thing that happened there is happening in the bride today and that's what will take us in the Rapture is that is that what's written here in Matthew 13:33 will that leaven in us will will grow and grow until it consumes the whole the whole thing now talking about 11 it confuses it's kind of confusing because everywhere else in Scripture it seems like leaven is used to represent something that's not uh know the leav of the Pharisees and uh I just want to go through some of these examples in 1 Corinthians 5:6 um and you don't have to turn there I'll just kind of read it your glorying is not good Paul said know ye not that A little leaven leth the whole lump now let's kind of look at this in context know you he said your gloring is not good know you not that a little leav leth the whole lump Now 1 Corinthians chapter 5 he's talking about that a man is is living with his father's wife and doing something that he ought not to do and and what that did was it brought in a bad example to the church and everybody began looking at that and that that little leaven that that one small bad thing Paul was concerned that people would look at that as an example and say well if he can get away with it I can too and and it would just begin to grow and grow into something that would over time consume and and just rot in the core like a bunch of apples when you when you put them in a bag they one apple will over time begin to rotten the whole thing and it will cause everything to just turn into a big uh mess and you don't have in the end you don't have what you started out with what you should have and um Galatians 5'9 a little 11 11 at the whole lump mhm yep turn over there if I can remember one sorry I just took very sporadic notes ah I just had to refresh my memory about what this chapter was about so Galatians 5:1 it stand fast there therefore in the Liberty where Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yol of bond bondage so Christ deal Paul is dealing with the the idea amongst the Believers that that they were justified by the law instead of justified by being born again being filled with God's presence in their life and and they they in into their among their midst came the idea that you know they had to still have to respect some of the old uh law like circumcision and and uh keeping of a particular day and things like that and uh so Paul's saying that he's using a little 11 11 if the whole lump that idea that little teaching had God in amongst their midst that they still had to be circumcised that they uh that they had to respect that they didn't understand that God was unfolding himself in a greater way that now he was circumcising the heart instead of just the Flesh and uh so he's he's he's concerned about just a little a little teaching beginning to grow into something greater and you know in the when brother R was teaching the Seven Seals that's that's one of the things you know Paul saw that mystery of iniquity start out just a little mystery just a little something that turned into the Antichrist that began to magnify until it turned into that pale horse rider just consumed everything it it uh the the whole something that started off small magnified until it become greater and greater and and that's how it is when with the Born Again believer when you when you're born again you get that little brother R talked about the little speck of that little white Speck or however we explain it and it it begins to grow and grow and grow and grow until we're in unity with God in unity with his word and we can say the same thing that he does there's not we don't look at the Bible and say well I don't I'm not 100% sure of what this scripture means I'm not sure what what what's going on here and now now if we look at go back to Matthew 1333 look at this scripture and think you know I've heard some say that well Lev's got to be be got to be bad because it seems bad in all the other references you know in the Old Testament there was the Feast of unleavened bread where you go seven days without eating unleavened bread and you know today they celebrate that by hiding the little uh the little leaven pieces of bread throughout the house and they have a little the ritual where they go and they find it uh all throughout the house and they kind of clean things out now now so what they're doing was they're going and finding the the uh the the teaching the false Doctrine just you know CU false Doctrine gets in the midst and begins to grow and grow false teaching grows until it it it begins to change the way you act it changes the way you uh it changes the direction of your life so now uh the the the Kingdom of Heaven is lik UN the leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leaven now if this leaven is bad then then the whole of the kingdom of God is leavened with this leaven and it ends up being a polluted Kingdom so it cannot be a a bad kind of living it cannot be a uh a corrupting a defiling kind of living but what 11 is is the teaching is is the teaching and uh so what happens is this this woman you know uh that scripture I read Wednesday night about the elect lady uh John would addressed his address to the elect lady there's an elect lady that's going to hide the teaching these he Mysteries of the Gospel in her heart through three pools through uh you know when you you can you can take a look at these three uh the three measures of living there's there's a shout and there's a voice and there's a trump there's a justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and it just keeps going on up there's there's three stages of justification a higher and higher and higher and and God is drawing Us by the revealing of his word and the only thing that will help us to take a body change that will help us to line up with his word is to is that these Hidden Mysteries be revealed to us and now go back to that story in Pentecost what what United them together what United them together around God's word and together in one Accord was that God did something personal he visited each one of them individually an individual visitation over each one of their heads was a pillar of fire was a little lick of fire an individ ual visitation now uh uh my my dad likes has an expression he likes to say that there's there you know the Bible says there's no private interpretation but there is private Revelation and that's such a mystery that you know in church that as the preachers preaches somewhere of the pulpit that you can catch something that the person beside you might not and maybe next time next next service they might catch something that you don't because God reveals it's a personal revelation God's dealing with each person individually and that is what unites us together with god with his word with his bride all uniting together you know that message the Oneness brother Brown talked about when before you listen to that you think well he's going to talk about um uh the godhead but he's talking about becoming one Christ becoming one with his bride right Christ joining and this is how he does it by by taking the leaven of his word that's a little bit and beginning to just letting it uh magnify until it takes you over until it just consumes you and you know if you this is maybe a strange illustration because I don't cook or anything I I don't know nothing about cooking but if you uh just to illustrate if you if you put a little uh a little leav in this building and then you would over time if you kind of let it created the right atmosphere then the the leaven would consume the whole building and now this was that's that's what Steven was talking about in his address when they they uh put him pulled him before the council he said you know Solomon built God a house he built a building but he God's plan and purpose was not for him to dwell in a building made by hands his plan and purpose was for him to dwell in a temple of Flesh now if you go back and look at in the in the church age book in the Ephesian Church age that's what brother Brown he he illustrate he just spells it right out God's great plan and purpose was for you for him to come and live and human flesh and remember the the the the three mysteries revealed in in that brother talked about in Christ The Mystery of God revealed that we're open in the seventh seal that God will reveal himself in Christ and God would reveal himself in his bride and then God would return and and bring back Fallen even back to its original condition now all three of those are around God revealing himself in human flesh God putting himself inside the Flesh of people and that's what this is dealing with that God takes takes his word and hides it inside inside his his elect lady and it begins to grow and grow until it consumes everything now now the the uh the thing is that the wife in Revelation 197 it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife ha made herself ready his wife ha made herself ready and you a lot of times we think that uh uh it's it's something that you have to participate in because the wife makes you remember that Parable in the in the Bible about the uh the the woman that lost one of the coins and she was so concerned she she went sweeping up the whole house because she was involved she was involved and she wanted to go find that that coin and get it back in her in that little thing that goes in her head and I saw a picture in National Geographic of of in the Eastern culture they have there was a lady in National Geographic they had one of those with the the coins in her head and I thought that was really interesting if I can find it maybe I'll bring it in one time but um so it uh in 2 Corinthians 10:5 what speaks about what this leevan is doing casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ now think Joshua Ephesians going taking the land uh when you sit down at your at your uh at the little take play or play Then you bring in captivity all of the thoughts that are contrary to the word by hearing the message hearing the word when you come to church that's why it's so important to come to church and to keep to read your Bible and and and pray and and listen to the T because you're you're feasting on that Lev now remember leav is not bad in of itself leav is teaching if it's a bad teaching is bad if it's the teaching of the word then it's good and we want that levven to grow and increase in our lives and I I want to keep saying that because I I know many people have a problem with that that uh that Levan it just it maybe a little Cog in the wheel that we kind of bump over that leaven is something bad but leaven is teaching and we bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of the Christ now this is why this is why the three pools now I heard brother Dale explain like this and and uh I hope he remembers and if he listens to this but he he explained it like uh the the first pool is the opening of the word and the second pole is opening a little bit more and the third pool is opening it even more opening it even more and more and more opening it Greater because it's the word of God what what justifies you is the word of God what sanctifies you is his word in in John 17 he said sanctify sanctify them by thy truth Thy word is truth his word is what cleanses us and sanctifies us and then he baptizes us with the Holy Ghost to bring the word to life and that that's what the Holy Ghost is is the birth of the word in you the birth of the word being quickened the spirit and the word coming together to make that seed that's been Bor birth in you and then through the statute of a perfect man that word keeps growing and growing the leaven uh magnifying magnifying until you come into the per stature of a perfect man that's right now so Matthew 3 1333 is the the woman is the church and she's hid she's hiding a secret message inside of her heart that nobody knows about but her because it's a perfect a private Revelation it's something personal to you everybody clear and with time the Le begins to Le and it just begins to push out and um and as it's pushed out then you begin to realize who you are and who God is and what you're doing here now I I I was thinking on this that that uh you remember brother BR pulled up beside that the mountain peaks and he saw the Seven Peaks with his name written on it now what's so amazing is not that just God pointed that out to him but that that those Seven Peaks were put there before the foundation of world that when the world was created God molded the Seven Peaks into the into the he put his name there he put He molded the Seven Peaks to form to represent the seven stages of his ministry and it it represented brother brandom and and I think that's how the the Believers are when we look into God's word then we can see ourself that was in God's word before the foundation of the world and when the Seven Seals open to you then you begin to see your name written you begin to see that you were there in God by by not not you uh you understand not not like a little person back there or or not like U because the word is predestinated eternal that's right but so let's go to um Ezra chap 2 that is Page 529 or we actually 531 I I just want to quickly read this little story Ezra chapter 2 verse 61 this is a very obscure little story that that maybe I can shed some light on this morning Ezra chapter 2 Ezra 2 chapter uh verse 61 so what what what this is talking about is that the children of Israel they came out of uh you know uh uh they were down in in Babylon and and Daniel read in Jeremiah they were going to come out after 70 years and and they came out and and and they were they were turned back to their Homeland and they were they were they began to look in the books that the Levites did who who is um who should be a priest and so they began to look into the record of the genealogy just like we're looking now into the record of God's word to see if we can find oursel there and we find oursel there by the opening of the word not your actual name written down but your the revelate god reveals to you who he is and shows you how you fit in with God's plan so let's look at verse 61 and of the children of the priests the children of habah the children of CA the children of barel which took a wife of the daughters of barel the gileadite and was called after their name now that's interesting because baral and it's been a while since I read this story but baralai was a a man of great Renown that followed David after David uh uh uh went through all of his trials and you know they pushed David out th threw him out so what they did was they instead of taking on God's name they took the name name of or the name that God had given them their inheritance the place that God had put them in they took on the name of some some great man now he was really a great man he was an amazing man there's many amazing men but I want God's name I want to be found in him I I don't want to be uh uh you know Oral Roberts and TL Osborne they're all wonderful great men but I I want to follow Christ you understand and and not and and so what what what happened down through the the seven Church ages people began to take on well I'm I'm going to be a Catholic I'll I'll be a uh I'll be a Methodist I'll be a Baptist and they so they took on other names instead of God's name and so it says in verse 62 these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but they were not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthood now there is your leavon that is not the right kind of leavon they were found as polluted because they had the wrong kind of Leon they had the wrong desire the wrong the the wrong thing had been sown in them they had they were putting their trying to take on the name of Blasphemous names trying to take on the name of something that was other than what they what was correct and the T tatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things Till There stood up a priest with urum and with thum how about that and now today we have the urum and the thumb because that urum and thumb flash to show what their name was now today we have this the urum and thumm of God's word that we can open up and see if we're in there if see what what what I whether we're part of that elect lady and if you're not then uh you know they the these priests they they could not partake of the Holy things they could not they they were in a bad situation and it's kind of like Nehemiah and Ezra when they came out of Babylon they began they knew that somewhere deep down under the rubble the foundation of the temple lay they knew it was under there somewhere and so they began to dig and now that's kind of like how we when we we look in the word you don't understand things you don't really understand what's maybe what's happening but if you just keep digging and just keep shoveling a little bit then over time you'll hit a Little Rock you'll hit a little there's a foundation stone there's something that I remember that was written of by Jeremiah or or the prophets and it begins to just come up out of the rubble till you can see it and then God begins to build on top of that just like Nehemiah and Ezra began to build on top of that Foundation that was there under the rubble and they just they build and build that's leav on top of Le God's word teaching teaching on top of teaching until it takes you over now we got five minutes so I was going to read this uh this little quote about the third pool and I'll finish on this this is Brother brandom's little illustration about uh the third pole when he was fishing and so he took and he said tie on the lure and I slap snapped The Lure on he said now throw way out now listen close way out into the deep because that's where you catch the big fish that's my thought into the deep way out into the deep not in the shallow water but in the Deep In The Deep hidden mysteries of God's word the opening of The Seven Seals yes the opening of a personal revelation to you is that's what the big fish the rainbow Tri are interested in is the hidden mysteries of God word God's word now uh you know people come along with people have come along with with speaking in tongues and and uh different signs and different things but what really interest I believe what really interests everybody here is the opening of God's word the Deep hidden mysteries of his word and he said when you do now let the lur sink down first and then said pull it slow pulling it slow because that's how the the big fish are caught by pulling it slow and steady wins the race that's how you take a body change it's slow and steady feasting feasting on the word don't try to hurry hurry hurry because so many people have Falling by the wayside because they tried to hurry hurry hurry and try to Trump something up you know uh so many people I've seen that that would just just talk to you for hours and hours about the word and then all just one little thing comes up and they're gone and and because you know just be make sure that your rock solid and you're steady in God's word and that you have a personal revelation and just take it take it one step at a time pull it slow now that's really Fisherman's technique now the same one that taught brother brandom how to fish is the same one that taught Peter how to fish because one day Peter was tossing his net on the one side of the boat and he said this man came along named Jesus and said don't cast over on the other side what was the same water it was the same body of water but this man knew something special he knew how to instruct him how to do it in a spiritual way uh by faith to do it and so uh I'm going to get Sidra a little bit just keep reading so I he said then when you do now you feel some nibl at it but don't tell nobody what you're doing keep it to yourself and said then when you when you feel it nibble again said pull just a little a little bit but not too hard he said and then it'll pull away from the little fish and when they scatter that'll attract the big the attention of the big fish when they scatter when everybody else begins to run away and say uh make their websites and things the that cot catches attend big I wonder if there's something to this I wonder if you know everybody else is saying bad things and saying this there uh brother R was all right until he began to teach when he began to teach then he got off God's word and it catches the attention of the big fish and they'll grab it and said and that's the way you'll catch it said then when they buy on the third time set your hooked for the catch and I said I understand said but keep still don't tell nobody keep steal and we'll stop right there
