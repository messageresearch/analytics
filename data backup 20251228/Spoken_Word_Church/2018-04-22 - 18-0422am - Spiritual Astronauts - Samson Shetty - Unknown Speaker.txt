sticking with his you know master standing with him wherever the prong I like that whenever the prophet he's going he's following the word prophet a man the bride of Jesus Christ follow the word

High God you see all that hey man praise the Lord here it says in 2nd Kings chapter 2 and verse 11 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire

chariot horses of fire to take him in a holler into his heavenlies hallelujah praise the Lord parted them both asunder Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven praise the Lord we are sitting in the heavenly places in Christ - Jesus almost all we are you know we are in the heavenly places like in it we are just just step into the different dimensions a special dimension a dimension hallelujah

challenges temptation to overcome the Satan's Eden praise the Lord Jordan what is that death - conquered it deadly things of denomination sin unbelief OMA praise the Lord nothing could stop him hallelujah Elisha how he went up oh my hallelujah praise the Lord and here brother Branham talked about Jesus Jesus brother Branham said the master astronaut Bible says it came to pass while he blessed them and carried up into heaven carried up the master austra not carried up into heaven hey man and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up taking up praise the Lord and a cloud received him out this out there sight hey man and also here my brothers and sisters here we see this great master astronaut he came as a man and he lived a hundred percent like a perfect man and perfect God and He died for our sins and he raised from the dead resurrected and he said I am NOT from this world and when this war were five hundred people are looking at him he ascended into heaven whoa how come the power from how Most High God he is the Most High God so he as his pork and the same power took him into the heavenlies hallelujah Amen praise the name of the Lord and here under than astronaut a spiritual astronaut st. Paul 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 I would like to read this too and just to lay my you know foundation for this message this morning so 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 1 to 4 it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord and I like this how this man of God is making himself so humble and he then said brother Branham said who that man was who that man who is that man brother Branham said is nothing but st. Paul he said right yes sir brother Branham said that man is speaking about that is st. Paul and he's not telling that I am the great person I've just went into up to heaven and I've seen all these things no no he's saying I knew a man hallelujah I like that and you a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God know it such an one caught up caught up to the third heaven praise the Lord hallelujah amen and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how did he was caught up into paradise and he heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter praise the Lord hallelujah and here we see another spiritual astronaut when when the science achievements or inventing something in a natural world it is reflecting something spiritual we all are as spiritual beings I mean we have a super sense the faith we have a supernatural Holy Ghost we have a supernatural message we have a supernatural sign we have a supernatural cloud we have a supernatural pillar of fire amen we have supernatural God in us praise the Lord hallelujah and this man is also having the revelation and he got the visions and he caught up into the heavenlies hallelujah amen praise the Lord hallelujah and of course I think I think you crash you're catching my work my thought amen we are getting into that heavenlies as spiritual astronauts not of this world just just just crossing it just getting out of it hallelujah of course we are in this world but we are not of this world amen I'm coming from India but you know I asked a brother brother where are you from he said I'm from originally from so-and-so country but from I'm so I'm by natural birds and from so-and-so country like Australia and after he said but originally from heaven hallelujah originally from I'm from heaven hallelujah I like that see we are you know naturally I'm from India naturally you're from from United States we all from different different world different different countries you know different different nations but we have different cultures different natures different customs different you know colors Oh different languages but we when we come into the body of Jesus Christ there is no difference we all are a sons and daughters of God by one spirit by one by one spirit we all baptized into one body the body of Jesus Christ we are not joined into that body we are born into the body by water in the name of Jesus Christ and also in the spirit hallelujah and we got the new verse and we got the revelation of Jesus Christ and that is it praise God hey man and amen and here another we see another an ocelot John the Revelator a spiritual astronaut revelation 4:1 says after this I looked and behold a door not a doors air door was open in heaven and the first words which I heard was it is where of a trumpet talking with me praise God which said come up higher come up higher praise Lord and I shew thee things which must be Hereafter see God always asked to come up amen if we are if we are raised in this world if we are raised in Christ we have to seek the stinks of a ball amen see always God wants us to come about but when you see about the parable you know that that man you know one who is walking from Jerusalem and going down to Jericho when you go to down down parts or down levels you know it is very easy to get down and just go and you know automatically you will fall down you know you will go like that but it is very hard to go up it's very it takes time it takes energy it takes your strength its God it must have some power you got to have some power you got to have some strength if you have you don't have strength you can't climb a mountain how could you can't how can you climb a mountain it is hard to climb but easy to get down hard to get up but it is beyond the natural rhythm it is beyond the natural atmosphere it is beyond something else poley to God God is bringing us into that condition hey man hallelujah he don't want to see you getting down getting down into the hell getting down into some destruction getting down into something but he wants you to come up he will help you the holy s--t will help you the revelation of Jesus Christ will help you the faith in God will help you hey man the Word of God will help you hey man praise the Lord it is very easy to get down very easy I was I was at one place in here in the America that took me to some place and I was standing on the top of that mountain and I felt like something is pushing me Oh who is there nobody's there but you know you feel that you know gravitation power you know you feel the gravitation you know because you're on a high something is pulling down so that man was walking he was he was just living in the Jerusalem and he just dropped down he just walk it into he's coming down to Jericho and the robbers and thieves bit him and took out all his clothes and everything and the Good Samaritan we know all the story hallelujah and here the John the Revelator when he

ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep they that is sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up caught up clora together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord brother branham in the rapture message he said he said like this shout what is that three things would happen amen in this great rapture amen he said the shout is the message which goes forth first amen shout is the message and the voice of the Archangel is the resurrection of the Dead Saints amen and the Trump of God is a feast manage of the lamp a fellowship a marriage of the land Feast of Trumpets amen praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah and the Bride of Christ we are the members in the bride of Jesus Christ and we all are spiritual astronauts those who are not belongs to this natural atmosphere just just just getting out from this worldly atmosphere into the divine atmosphere a spiritual astronauts praise the Lord I am asking the Lord to help me to give me words give me because I have learned my most of Milan English I have learned from relatives message I don't know I don't know because I have never spray I've never I'm not used to preach in this language but since nine years you know when I came first time I was told you know George and but learning process learning process learning you know we are learning praise the Lord and the Bible says there that way wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 31 and here brother Branham said like this in the countdown message 1962 I believe I think it is in 1962 September 9 he said like this in 27 paragraph Hebrews says here we read the scriptures from Hebrews chapter 11 he said Hebrews says here was made of things which do not appear other words they are supernatural praise the Lord and the supernatural is reflecting the natural see now then then the natural was eternal or it is to be everlasting with supernatural but sin perverted the natural so if that is so which I believe it is then everything is happening on earth is a type of spiritual things that's happening see it's God to reflect something that achievement of man praise the Lord and he was telling about the natural things and supernatural things and how this natural body you know when women give birth to the to a baby first thing what is it it comes a water then after blurred then after life same way the super in a spiritual way to in the spiritual in the body of Jesus Christ when we born again when we get into the body of Christ we have to get into the you know justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so he was telling all these things and you know natural things reflecting the spiritual things amen and amen all things spiritual all happening and so forth pact or type the supernatural and the natural is a type of the supernatural praise the Lord hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so my brothers and sister this morning I would like to read some course here here program said but my point is this whatever the message we have got it is from the Word of God from the message of the hour from the prophet of God not from our own thinking not from Bible College or seminary or not from any university you know even I was thinking about a man of God you know a man of God get nervous I mean not nervous but you know I feel like I'm not able I'm not going to preach I'm not able I don't know what to say I don't know what to preach I don't know what to speak but you know the people those who got intellectual like a professor scholars philosophers they can give you a nice lecture and in in some places I ask them to come and preach and they said oh really I don't know I can't preach I don't know I don't know how to preach because they're you know like are scared get nervous it is not easy job oh ma it's very it's like you know God is putting you on the spot and it is not an easy job to preach and specially in the bride of Jesus Christ you're standing in front of the elect lady oh ma you got to have guts you got to have the power you got to have the ability you've got to help because it is not by your natural it is not by your what you got from this world now it is from something from above it has to come from above hey man praise God amen but my point is my point is this brother branham said what scientific things has been able to achieve they were there at the world fair he was talking about the world fair how that you know science bring all this you know machines and all these cigarettes and you know they put some nicotine and some smoke on on the little rabbit and gods cancer and they're showing all these things in the fair Spokane I think's Washington yeah and he was talking about these things showing by scientific research what science has been able to achieve in the natural things now we are here showing by spiritual research spiritual scientists spiritual researcher hallelujah spiritual research what God has been able to achieve with people who will believe his word not greed not denomination no it's a word now to achieve scientific things you have got to work in scientific lines to achieve the spiritual things you have got to work in spiritual things how you work how you would work in spiritual things how you would work how in prayer brother Ram said if you don't have in a seven churches book I believe that is the that is the prophets book a man I love that book I read that book I study that book I meditate that book I preached that book amen seven churches so that relevant of the prophet of God said in the 78 if you have a lack of revelation go into your knees go into your room and go into the knees and lift up your hands to God and ask the revelation he will give it to you yep he will surely he will grant the revelation to us he men if we ask him genuinely with all our heart he may and praise the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord we have to come into the spiritual lines to research the spiritual things to achieve something to do something to research something we have to come into the spiritual realm we have to come into the house of God we have to come into the fellowship we have to come into the Word of God amen praise the Lord Amen hallelujah and he said up and here brother Branham said in a message 43 paragraph but I wondered if we could turn back in the pages of God's book this morning and see what the church will look like at the time the advanced achievements of the science and technology I have never dreamed about this I don't have my phone his cell phone telephone Alexander Graham Bell he invented this you know this telephone then after you know a cordless then after cell phone and now smartphone we used to have cash shirts big big cash shirts and then after the natural little cash shirts see how the technology is growing as as the technology is growing in the same spiritual rhythm in a spiritual way in the spiritual lines we have to see we have to compare the Church of God the bride of Jesus Christ is getting step-by-step up higher getting up from justification to sanctification scientific a Shinto the baptism of the Holy Ghost from the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the rapture in condition praise God hallelujah see I was one bring you know I was just yesterday I was trying to send a message to her brother and this morning I got the message and when I opened something connected the internet say just whatever in my mind I put on words and I clicked the button it went what is that traveling like a thought it's a it's a reflecting something we used to travel when William Carey when he came to India he used to travel he had traveled for months from British from England to India for months in the ship but now I can travel about 14 hours from Abu Dhabi Dubai to Chicago only 14 hours or 13 14 hours and from there you know another three hours from there another three hours almost 24 hours with layers including all this but you know what it even not in even 24 hours I'm coming from this India which is other side of the globe ten thousand miles from from other side of the globe I'm traveling I'm just I mean coming here I'm here in two 24 hours praise the Lord see here brother branham is just trying to get our thinking to observe watch how the advanced technology is developing you know and you know I was talking to a brother in Kentucky and he also said the same thing brother I want to send a message to some brother and I talked to him and he just thumbs up in the in the messenger his gesture is that okay okay I got it you know like a thumbs up so then he said wow what a fast what if fast bah in in fraction of seconds you got the message see I used to travel you know William Carey traveled for months in the ship and I'm traveling almost 24 hours to get here but your Todd is traveling not even in a fraction of seconds that means what ellebra have said in other side we will be traveling like a thought if you want to see Samson Shetty yes I want to see Samson right there don't care yeah you know it is not like know how many miles you're traveling at all nothing you know just you'll be there traveling like a thought like which is in the spiritual sea we are traveling like that praise the Lord hallelujah here well Rams at this mode and see what the church will look like at the time see the achievements that God has made how happenings always in this earth are representing something that comes from somewhere else but when it strikes the earth it's usually is in a perverted condition because it is in the world of darkness and sin right but then there is a true reverent representation in the spiritual religious of the other dimension the invented Facebook the invented Google they have invented all the internet and when when you just you just want to send a message sent it went over there it's there in fraction of seconds and he got it traveling like a thought which is in the spiritual dimension which is in the other side which is in the spiritual realm it's reflecting now praise God reflecting that amen amen and amen and amen from being in the in the three dimension then the sixth dimension as the representation in this three dimension light matter time 3 light matter time and the 6th dimension is representing hallelujah now you know in this natural dimensions I'm so glad of that the prophet of God said I'm so glad of that what a blessing what a message we have got even the denominational people that don't know what the spiritual or Sharad means they are they are in the Bible Enoch was will Shiraz not Elijah was with Shiraz not Jesus was spiritualist not Paul was spiritual Austral not Paul and John was spiritualist now we are the spiritual astronauts aren't you glad for that Saints this morning thanks to the Lord hallelujah and here brother Branham in 1944 photograph you know he said now notice now if years a few years ago the transportation was by horse and buggy not to for long not to fall echo long ago I done by driving around in a horse and buggy and on his saddle he is is is preaching on the transportation now how the technology is developing from you know the transportation they used to have we have more carts ox carts I used to travel in an ox course to the jungles because the roads are very rough you know stony and rocky and and dirt and you know you know you know it's a rough roads but the the wheels to the Ox scores are strong and the the people there used to carry us and we still have that we still have below course we still have hawks courts because people in the tribal areas in jungles in the in the remote places in the in a different areas they don't have nothing to travel they don't my automobile they don't know Mike bike or anything you know just there some people walk I was telling to a brother yesterday they used to walk 100 miles to in in the olden days hundred miles hundred kilometers 50 kilometers in olden days in in a we're back like a hundred years back something like that because they go and they walk for 10 20 kilometers and they go and sit somewhere and eat and they take rest under the tree or somewhere and then they will walk again to reach to their villages to to their cities that was the condition in the time that was the situation see so here a brother branham said now it pass a souped-up car what a difference the horse-and-buggy day then the automobile day and then the airplane day come along praise the Lord hallelujah now the horse-and-buggy days was who is just if not so if there is no prophet of God to this generation what would be you know how what what is going to our our condition where we will be you know see God's prophet is comparing their natural transportation to the spiritual transportation because we all are foreigners and pilgrims and strangers in this world Enoch walked with God a traveler a traveler a traveler and here the prophet of God is showing about the transportation about the traveling traveling from horse and buggy to car automobile from car to up in air airplane you know praise the Lord and he's comparing is typing that hey man praise the Lord the horse and buggy days was whoo that was the ending of the Lutheran age see horse and buggy race they believed in justification God bringing the church from Romanism Catholicism Catholicism he brought it into the first spiritual achievement that the just shall live by faith that was the horse and buggy days they come from to the horse-and-buggy days that ended now the next achievement man had in the way of transportation was the automobile automobile and you notice the automobile increase all the time in its power we were talking iron brother Joseph Joe Joe yesterday talking you know about you know everything if it is a horse buggy horsepower if it is automobile you know a car something it's this also they call horsepower a t-mobile key for this and that brother I'm talking the 1315 horsepower is saying that see the horsepower if it is aircraft horsepower say everything horsepower horse horse horse horse is a strength it's a power amen powerful animal to pull though the weights and Lords and wagons and stuff like that you know so carries the Lord's amen so the same way amen and we are just you know having see the Elijah when he was looking unto the Lord to go into that that up into the heavenlies to cut up into the whirlwind he was just just following the leadership of the Holy Ghost and the Lord God sent him a chariot of fire a fire of horse horsepower glory excuse me now at the end of the Wesley age brought it in by spiritual achievement sanctification which means the church raised from the justified state to a sanctified justified by faith faith into the sanctification state hallelujah praise the Lord one after one that means the church is going up higher stepping you know step by step one after one one after one you know God wants us to come up not going down hallelujah praise the Lord I'm not talking about the you know being humble and humility that's good you know we got to be humble and be humility in the presence of God that is another thing but he wants us to come up higher in a spiritual reeling in the world in the power of Jesus Christ in the baptism of the Holy Spirit in the revelation of the world in the revelation of the message of the our aim and in the fellowship in prayer praise God hallelujah amen I believe that now we notice again along came the Methodists with sanctification he was talking about you know the Martin Luther and from John Wesley see sanctification there was many of those Methodists was actually sanctified now there's a lot of them claimed it that know nothing about it yes that's that's what we see in that these denominations the Methodist Church taught sanctification they said they got down and cried and got back up said glory to God I'm sanctified that's what they learned and they're still there in that condition but they have to come up higher from Methodist from Baptist from PES material from Pentecostals amen and there went right on living like that and always did but some of those men and women was actually sanctified from the things of the world and lived a consecrated set aside life why that was the automobile age which took in more horsepower automobile praise the Lord when science achieved something by the natural God is achieving something by spiritual see something is going on all the time not only is talking about automobile age not only Wright brothers not only John you know all these things know all the time that means this time to when they are inventing all this I don't know I have never dreamed about this video calling and on whatsapp I was in Australia last year whether Gary Walker wants me to come so I you know they they invited us and I preached there you know because they wanted to know what's happening in the country of India because we you know when we had a meetings with brother Gary Walker last year the Hindus Kim of course you all know the story they cancelled our services and they told him to leave the country and human sister Deborah left you know so they wanted to know and they're the people wants to hear from me so they they paid for everything and they they asked to me to come I invited so I went there so my brothers and sisters so when I went there in Australia why I'm speaking this I don't know so when science achieved something by natural God is at achieving something in my spiritual see something is growing all time yeah this is what I'm trying to say you have to come back rewind you know so that's what in spiritual I'm initial so we lift the word where we have we have lived the word Miliband's are not going further come back to the word again come back to the word so he preached that to come back so then when we come something something when we lost something we have to in India what I do I go to the place where I lost something not I'm finding something over there but my mind's go there when I go to that place and and it comes to some of them you got that experience I don't know but I got that experience say SE c-- and and and and i went to so I want to call my life I want to talk to my daughter's I want to talk to my wife I don't have nothing and I got this smartphone I don't know how to use I just broke that phone many many times in you can see that all the scratches on the phone I don't know how to use it but I use I'm learning so when I had an accident I dropped it and got scratches and everything but thank God is working so when I hope the war SAP and the brother from India he called me and said brother here is the whatsapp you can call video calling till you can see your wife you can see your daughter's your family your church and everything huh he's alright Wow let's do that and he did and I call him see how the science advanced technology say praise the Lord so everything when the science is developing it is reflecting something the spiritual brother branham said when elijah was on mount carmel there was a television is that right he said that there was a television there was a radio i didn't understand when i read that but after i started listening to the messages i understand he got the visions that everything is caught up in the air which you can't see with the natural you know the science the technology the fourth dimension is that right the technology is the fourth dimension and 50 dimension is the hell and 60 dimension is the 60 dimension is the paradise and 70 dimension is the heavenly places Amen praise the Lord I want to watch the time - hey man because I'm not in in my in my hindi yeah you know so so my brother says this is a sanctification the second step of grace amen praise the Lord hallelujah see what man achieves on earth for they're men of things which do appear God was able to achieve something by a spirit-filled people who were hungering and thirsting and those that would stay with the world wait the word a man blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord so we just come this church is coming up higher from horse and buggy to automobile and from automobile age from from from from the from the ground from Earth lifting up hallelujah and they thought that that is it that is great see here Wesley was one of the great scientists Luther was one of the great scientists and he took God's command he said like this there didn't care what the churches said what the organization said Luther didn't care what the Catholics said he believed the just shall live by faith hallelujah faith is a revelation faith is a super sense faith is looking unto unseen praise God hallelujah and he took God's chemicals of the world and put it together and the church moved by faith moved hallelujah just moving forward moving forward hallelujah and put it together and a church moved by faith Wesley put it together by the blood and he proved it by the blood and the church called sanctified the Pentecostal believed the same Baptist or the Holy Ghost their promises to you and your children and them that far off they put all the chemicals together out of the word and they moved into the air hallelujah they moved out because they were able to accomplish such so one after one from horse and a buggy from automobile and then airplane the Wright brothers came in at the same the end of the age the Pentecostal people the Pentecostal adduce a street revival started and the people got the power from horn hi mind map so the Holy Ghost fell upon the people and they started speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit and shouting screaming jumping and all these things you know they thought that is it and the people when I was listening to this message last night Briella Braddock was preaching very you know the power of God the presence of God was so powerful and he was so it's a evangelistic message he said and he was preaching and preaching other people are screaming shouting hallelujah when they when he said about airplane and Pentecostal everybody said hallelujah hey man amen amen and they thought that oh we are so great and we came up that's good okay but that is not it there is something else beyond the Pentecostal age beyond the Pentecostal relief beyond the Pentecostal you know the experience there is something else what is that he said astronauts astronauts Clara did you notice one of these scientific achievements of camp I campaigned the other one complemented the other one and it was only in higher form say the automobile was hired from of transportation then the horse and the airplane was hired from a form of transportation than automobile but they are campaigned one another horsepower amen if that's horsepower what about God's power if that is God's if it is if that was horsepower whatever God's power whatever the Holy Ghost power the Holy Ghost power that can justify you the same Holy Ghost power can sanctify you the same Holy Ghost power that sanctifies you can fill you with his presence sitting in heavenly places in Christ to Jesus glory to God and little size that they didn't know their ABCs founded why there were spiritual scientists amen they see in the thing they believed it mandated by education the natural scientist the spiritual scientist done it by revelation only by revelation worn by education the other by revelation oh if we can just open up there's all kinds of material laying here that's right all kinds of material before something they are inventing there is a hiren in here in the in the earth copper before they they invent something you know the wires and stuff like that their copper is in there irony's in there something in there God already prepared god knows what is doing everything you know you prepared in this earth he's already put it in there and their man is bringing out those things materials and making some kind of inventing some kind of are bringing some some kind of automobiles or toys or dwara tools or whatever it's already in there praise the Lord it's already in here in the Word of God and when we receive it when we take it and that changes us that gives us horsepower Laura amen aren't you glad for that Saints we are so happy I know you are having a birthday party - I'm glad I'm glad we are it's representing the new birth you know the natural birth spiritual birth a natural feast spiritual feast amen yeah you know you know we are becoming the word and the word
