well let's just look into the word and that's how we'll see him it's good to be gathered around the word tonight with uh all the wonderful Believers here that are gathered an't it good to uh if you're sitting at home watching TV you just feel bad after if you're sitting scroll doing that Doom scrolling up social media that's what they call that Doom scrolling we just keep scrolling and you after a while you just feel bad but you get around other believers and get together and look into the word of God and you'll leave feeling like something got accomplished something got changed tonight I want to read I take a little scripture from 2 Kings chapter 13 and uh and just take a little topic called don't don't strike short Lord Jesus we're so grateful Lord for your word that you've given us in this hour Lord God when it seems like just the devil's everywhere all around us Lord of just bombarding us with with hurdles and trials and things Lord Jesus but you give us your word Lord to encourage us and to equip us Lord against the enemy against all the fiery darts of the wicked one I pray Lord tonight that these words Lord will just hit home exactly where they need to strike Lord Jesus give us encouragement Lord right here in the middle of the week Lord that you'll just be with us tonight in this little service Grant it now Lord in your name amen so if we'll read from verse 14 it says now Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said oh my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof in other words he's telling them you are the very strength of Israel he's telling them you're the one that's keeping everything together your ministry and so forth and he said Elisha Elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows and he said to the king of Israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands and he said open the window Eastward and he opened it then Elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the Lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria for Thou shalt Smite the syrians in Apec till thou H have consumed them the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated isn't that ain't that interesting how sometimes the Lord will give us give us these these wonderful little stories in the Old Testament they seem like they what what does this mean and there's a meaning to everything there's something behind each of these things open up the window and shoot an arrow out of it and then go find that era go run around in the weeds and find that era and if you've ever shot an air into the weeds it it's it's quite difficult to find I I mean we've just kind of been playing around in the backyard with Zach's little toy erors before and shot it like 10t away and how you go it's like you just can't find it but that's what the prophet told him go find that air go hunt it out and then bring it back strike it on the ground and and i' I've got a prophecy for you that you're going to Smite the syrians and you're going to always think about that when a prophet tells you something what encouragement that can be and all all these words that we're reading laying here in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation are given to us straight from God to encourage us and When God Says something you can just Bank everything on it think now no matter how mysterious it seems go shoot an error go find it bring it back grab it bang on the ground three times no matter how mysterious it seems God always keeps his word no matter how mysterious it seems God always keeps his word no matter how unreasonable it may seem to people God keeps his word if God makes a promise of anything God will keep that promise he's just looking for somebody tonight to believe him now I I believe in this present day what we're living in that God still keeps his promises there might be things in the Bible that seem perplexing that we don't understand but yet God is there to back it up if we'll just believe it if we'll just yield ourselves to him think about God being infinite then he knows all the future from the beginning and he don't make a promise L he knows what's going to happen oh you think about that that God made a promise through Elisha here that the syrians are going to be are are going to be consumed and that God was going to do it he was going to fight their battles and think of all the stories and all the things that we've heard even in this Modern Age think about Congressman Upshaw when he was he was standing there in one of the meetings and and and and and brother Brandman had the vision of him and he Congressman Upshaw was sitting there listening to the to the message and all of a sudden he realized that he was actually in a vision that he was actually and and brother brandham called him out is that how it is sometimes when you're listening to the word and you realize you recognize that you're part of the story that you're part of the story that's being laid out here that you're part of it and he he began to realize that he's part of that vision and he just stepped right into it and that's how when we hear the word we just we're just you get caught up in that stream and you just kind of get moved along with it if you can get caught up in the rhythm of the word you begin to move along with it and you become part of it that makes you part of the Bible part of the word a continuation of the book of Acts that God is still doing something today in this very hour just like he did all down through history that that isn't that amazing that that the same that the Christian Life can be the same today that it was in the life of Paul that it was in the life of the early church that God is still living and still working today just like it was then and faith faith will make all these promises a reality you think about how when when God made a promise to Noah that that no water in the sky it looked like no water anywhere and he made a promise and and Noah just believed him and he got to work he didn't just sit there but he got to work and he started hammer and building on that Ark and it rained just the same and Moses Moses down there for 40 years in the wilderness and got all uh maybe downtrodden downhearted lost all hopes of freedom but yet in the light of God when he got in front of that burning bush it made all the promises of God just bring to life and he a was able to step forth from that burning bush and go down to Egypt knowing that God was with him knowing that God is a present tense God a present tense living reality all the stories that Moses had heard his mama tell him about when he sat sat at her feet and to all the little bible stories and things about how they they had prayed for a deliverer and all those things where most mes couldn't fulfill it on his own but when he got in front of that burning bush and he heard from God himself that it made it changed everything in the light of God standing by by that burning bush everything in him changed now our prophet in this day would say why brother if we' ever come in the presence of God like Moses did why it was revolutionary to him and the light of that angel of God standing there on that mountain that day everything that he once had or thought never would happen come to be a reality and I think if men and women today would ever step into the light of the Holy Spirit under the unction of God's spirit and the light of God's word everything that God has promised will illuminate to you and be real again oh that's what we need brothers and sisters as a real experience with god well that makes us makes our heart change that makes us love to be in church that makes us love God and love one another and live this real Christian Life in a way that's not fake it it will illuminate the word to you and make it real again it will make it real just like it did for Moses when he stood there in that burning bush and he realized that God was God oh you see that's what the new birth does that new birth gives you brother Brandon would say that it takes your mental faith that you come to church with and maybe try to work things out on your own and have an intellectual Faith but the new birth will take your mental faith and elevate it to a supernatural faith I'm talking about a supernatural God living in a people that are just maybe carnal but he'll change them change them to to match the super a supernat a supernatural experience where you can believe God's word when it seems past understanding that Noah could that rain would fall and carry that Ark away that that one man and his little family could go down and deliver Israel out of the hand of the Egyptians we're believing in a supernatural God the reason Moses failed in the first place was the lack of having what that burning bush had you think Moses standing there looking at that bush burning and there was something Supernatural that was making that bush burn without it burning away something Supernatural there and Moses recognized I I need that oh well when we come to church and we get around other believers if we could just recognize if there's something lacking in our life that that's what we need to make us to make us live a real Christian Life and and and do the things that the Bible said a real Christian is going to be able I do what our failure today is lack having what the Holy Spirit has and the Holy Spirit has all good things for us and if we receive the Holy Spirit then all things are possible and not only possible but promised to us you ought to think about that to think about that that all these things written of here in the Bible that that that you can be delivered of those complexes you can be delivered of those depressive thoughts you can be delivered of things that plague you when the Devil comes and barrages you with all kind of thoughts in the night time that you can be delivered and you don't have to deal you don't have to deal with that you can give it back to the devil and all God requires of us is just to believe his word all God requires of you is just to open up your heart and let the word sink down into the good ground of your heart and hang on to it and you watch and it will produce it's going to produce something he sends the Holy Spirit to energize that word when he falls into it I think think to tonight that that's what the Holy Spirit does the Holy Ghost takes the word that's laying there on the page and energizes it to make it come to life just like just like the spirit of any speaker will take the words and give meaning to them we'll take the words and give a life to it it's the spirit that gives life it's the spirit that makes it live and takes this this dead letter laying here on the page that maybe can be questioned about and maybe can be probed at and say well I don't know if that's true or not but when the Holy Spirit comes it takes all the doubt away it takes all the reason away because God is on the scene the holy spirit is what gives meaning to the words that we're reading here when the word's being preached and the Holy Spirit brings the word he energizes that and flashes the same light of God's blessed promise and we know of course that God always keeps his promise God always keeps his promise if he can just find somebody to believe it that's the requirement he's looking for somebody that he can get a hold of some little boy Bo or girl or some man or woman that can it doesn't matter if nobody else believes it doesn't matter if the whole rest of the world believes all he needs is just one person to get a hold of and maybe sitting here tonight maybe you're that person maybe you're that person like like Jonah when when God was looking for somebody to go to Nineveh and preach and he looked and he searched all around and he found Jonah and he wanted Jonah to go to preach so bad that he followed him on that boat brother random would say that when Jonah was on that boat he everywhere he looked God was and he couldn't get away from it because God was after him and maybe tonight you're the one that God is after maybe you're the one that you're the only one that can do it you're the only one that tonight you're the one that God wants to get a hold of and and and he wants to see you respond to him to fulfill his promises in you to do something in you and to think about the promise the promise of the Holy Ghost to make somebody live for him and believe for him and believe his word and live a holy SE separated life now tonight aren't you so glad that you can be a real Christian and live a life that the world can't live many people would love to be able to live a really Holy Ghost filled life to be able to dress holy and walk holy and be kind to one another and speak good words speak kind words maybe when somebody pulls out in front of you or or or says something harsh in the in the line at the grocery store to always respond with love and kind and and and many people try to do it and they just fail because they they're lacking something like Moses realized he needed what was in that burning bush and you can't do it without the holy ghost in your life to make the word come up off the page and live and you you can't do it you got to have the Holy Ghost God always keeps his promise oh if tonight he's looking for somebody that he can fulfill his promise in somebody that he can get a hold of and maybe that's somebody as you now they had a great line of Kings in this story that we're reading of all the way back from from Ahab now you think about how Ahab lived such a horrible life he he he got yolked up with Jezebel who was was not you know not at all a holy person it was an unbeliever and halfway in halfway out and and Elijah had told Ahab how he was going to die that he'd go out in the battlefield and the arrow be shot up and it' just randomly fall in between his armor and he'd fall out on the battlefield think about that that God just got allowed that era to strike him right between the armor where where there was a little Gap and the AA struck him down in the middle of the battlefield and Elijah had prophesied that how Jezabel was going to be fed to the dogs because she did Evil all the evil that she had done and you think about in life how that how that things that you do there there are consequences to your actions just like there were consequences in ahab's life and consequences to the way that Jezebel lived the things that they did in life it just built up built up and built up until at the end Jezebel's life ended up where there wasn't nothing left but the palms of her feet and the her her Palms of her hands and her and her feet because that's all the dogs the dogs ate everything else all they left was a pool of blood and a little bit little tidbits left because all the evil in her life had just accumulated and accumulated until that's what happened and and you see the lesson to here that we can get is remember that you will reap what you sow you will reap what you sow and that's that's actually God's law that God's law is that That's the Law of nature that whatever sewn into the ground Spring's coming up and you go out into the field and you plant some corn in the ground and you wait long enough and Corn's going to come up but you PL plant a Brier and and before long a Brier's going to come up you plant some Poison Ivy and after a while poison ivy is going to come up and the same thing in your life if you sow hateful words to your children after a while your children are going to hate you and they're not going to want to be around you you s loving words to your wife and your family and you watch it will SE it you will reap peace why because you reap what you sow and what you say and what you do after a while it will accumulate accumulate until maybe at the end of your life your life will be crowned either with a crown of the devil it'll be crowned with a crown of life and your whole life you'll reap you'll reap the things that you sow through your life that's God's nature that's God's law that's that that law that you reap what you sow now even think about today tonight that that if you if if the word of God if the promise of God is sown in your heart then you will reap what is sown in your heart if sitting here tonight if you open up your heart to the word of God that's being preached and sown and you say you know what that that's the thing that I've been looking for my whole life I've been searching for truth I've been going maybe from denomination to denomination from Pillar To Post and I've been looking for something that's real and maybe tonight this is the first time when you really found something that even sounds remotely real but you hang on to that and let it be sewn down in your heart and you watch and see if it doesn't come up and produce because it's a law of nature it's got to produce because the law says that whatever is sown that is what will be reaped Galatians 6: 78 sayso not be deceived God cannot be mocked a man reaps what he SWS who whosoever SWS to please their flesh from the flesh will reap destruction whosoever sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life so tonight we're not sewing we're not trying to please the flesh are we are you sew to re the FL if you spend all of your time like I was saying earlier Doom scrolling on Facebook or trying to to see on the message threads on the internet what's the greatest movie that's been released and that's all your focus is the things that can satisfy the flesh and make you happy in your idle time oh that's what you'll reap you'll reap something that will help your flesh but I don't want something that'll help my flesh I I want to die to myself I want to die so that the spirit Within Me can be loosed and live I want to live to the spirit and that's what I want to show how how do you satisfy the spirit a real Born Again child of God the only way that they can be satisfied is by that thing that nourishes the spirit the word of God and that's why real Born Again child of God they can't wait to come to church they can't wait to open their Bible they can't wait to get down on their knees early in the morning time and spend some a long time with God because they want to feed the thing that's on the inside they want to feed their soul oh if we could just get rid of let let our will just die so we we're not so concerned with our flesh and with the things that make us happy in this life and the our own will and and all those things and just lay our lay that down on the altar of sacrifice so that God can do something with us your actions your actions have consequences so so good do good speak good oh that's what I want my life to be it's just a trail of good he's so he he said good things no matter if somebody hated him or whatever he said good things he did good things even if it was hard he did good things and how do we do good things brother Brandon would say the best thing for you to do is keep an oldfashioned prayer meeting going and keep the unity of the spirit keep looking up and watching for the coming of the Lord keep the oldfashioned Holy Spirit falling among you keep the world out seal Christ in and he would say you're letting down in prayer some way just remember as you seow you'll reap just remember that oh think about these things that maybe maybe we've begun to let slide these things that were so important to the early church those little old brush aror meetings where they'd pray all night and and you know you you just had such a burden on your heart to really get along with god oh it wasn't maybe a battle back in them days to stay away from the TV because there was something in their heart a stirring it was the Revival days back then now we know the Revival Days Are Over the Revival the general Revival is where it just seems like all around there's a Revival fire burning but now there's a bride Revival a personal Revival that you might not see in the person next to you or just generally all around everywhere you go but down in your heart there's something stirring as the word is received in you and it it something something's lit on fire with you a personal a personal individual Revival with you and don't let that Revival die you keep that oldfashioned prayer meeting going keep the unity of the Holy Spirit keep looking up and watching for the coming of the Lord keep the oldfashioned Holy Spirit falling among you I I like the oldfashioned Holy Spirit I like the same kind of Holy Spirit I that's what I'm looking for the same kind of holy spirit that manifested in the book of Acts when they when they just laid in the shadow of people that they had confidence in and they received their healing where they could take clothes from off of the body of Paul and they had such confidence that the Holy Spirit was working that they belied that God will move all because they took a cloth from the body of Paul and they grabbed it and believed it and wherever they went they people believed that believed the word that was being preached were there at the gate beautiful they they were walking by and and Peter and John just said look on us and believe and and you know they didn't have any popularity to bring they didn't have any kind of any kind of money or something to offer that man that lay there at the gate beautiful but they said look on us and such as we have we give unto you and what they had were the words of eternal life what they had was something real and something genuine to give him that caused them to have confidence in them and he he leaped up from the ground and began to walk because why because God is real and that same God that caused that man to walk there 2,000 years ago that same God is still on the S today if we can believe it because God keeps his promises he keeps his promises his promises are true Satan Satan has a lot of empty promises you know that's all all Satan has to offer he has nothing to offer but a bunch of empty promises he can't do nothing but take away and say it's not yours you can't have it and he all he'll give you is a bunch of complexes in your mind and horrible thoughts and things you're trying to get away of and nervousness and and and and just constantly looking behind your back and wondering if somebody's out to get you oh I I want to get away from all that and just have confidence that God is on the scene and God is still able to lead and guide and direct our paths it doesn't matter what all all the all the obstacles all around us but yet I know that God is still on the scene oh if we can just don't let the world reach into you John 14:30 said the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me and I don't want nothing I don't want nothing the devil has to has to offer I don't want nothing the devil has to give just don't let the world creep into you amen how do we get it out pray it out fasted out until God comes down and takes a hold that's right and what what's happening when you pray it's a sacrifice there in that Holy place in the outer Court inner Court holy of holies and the Old Testament Tabernacle in that Holy place was that little altar of incense and in the Book of Revelation it says that that altar the prayers of the Saints go up as incense like the incense that was offered on that altar your prayers are like a sacrifice that's made to God's and what are you doing you're sacrificing yourself you're saying God take away take away all my enmity with my brother God take away the way that I think and the way that I am and I'm offering it up to you and I want you to change me and speak back to me and reveal to me things that are come reveal to me what your word says and as I lay myself down on the altar of sacrifice oh brother R's saying pray it out fast it out what what are you doing getting rid of yourself pray it out fast it out until God comes down and takes a hold like when he was there praying with with uh sister Rosella that time that the the little he he could he said she was a prostitute somebody that lived in the world and and done so many things a you could unroll the LA list of the things that she had done wrong but yet he told her let's pray and she got to praying and she prayed a little bit and she said well I think I'm good no pray a little bit longer oh you got to sacrifice sacrif ice sacrifice yourself lay yourself down on the altar of sacrifice until God can come and do something with you and brother Ram would say if Noah seen a little leak in his ark why he put some pitch in it and so that's about the best thing I know to keep the leak out the world out is to stop up the leak stop up the leak is the best thing that I know to do put some pitch in it let the Holy Spirit grab a hold of your life and begin to plug up all those leaks so if you got a a leaky spot if you got imagine Noah in that Ark going around inspecting looking for leaks and all of a sudden there'd be a little gush of water coming in the ark you know to Noah with no land in sight that would be a scary thing now what about you and I when we find a leak in our life something that ain't right it should scare us it should make us it should make us just be on top of things just like Noah was and Noah would take that hot pitch you got you can't you can't just cram it in there you got to heat it up first that's the only way it'll work you take that hot pitch and you pour it over that wood and just let it soak into that wood real good and that'll stop the leak up now how you going to get pitch in your life you got to die out to yourself you got to die out to yourself where you you think oh I'm sure I'm sure I know the right way that it should go you know there's a lot of people in the Bible that were like that like Cain it's going to be my way my way or no way at all oh but if we can just die to ourself and just allow God to come and move on the scene in their lives die to our own way of thinking and die to oh you remember that story of of of when Elijah come down and he found that little widow woman and he he and he told her you need to go make me first make me a little cake and she took the meal and the oil but we always forget that third ingredient the two sticks the two sticks which represent the cross of self-sacrifice that you've got to die to yourself die to yourself and then you'll have a cake that you can live off of of then you have something real and something genuine that will nourish you and and and and and replenish you that will never run out that was Elijah's promise to that little widow woman the meal and the oil will never run out only one way to do it that's prayer prayer stops the leak Prayer Changes Things and the and the Ark the message the ark brother Brown will say now this soft goer wood when they poured this hot pitch over it they soaked it up right quick inside and out and made it a sealed amen oh you see it a seal soft soaking in the word of God Christ pouring the holy spirit head up it won't run when it's cold it's got to get hot what we need today is an oldfashioned Holy Ghost meeting head up pour down they took that soft goer wood the big Ladle and poured it on and the goer wood real soft ready then from the inside and out that pitch went through and CED it over like steel no water could seep in it at all it was a protection oh if we just get our lives all pitched up and you you know the illustration there is you take Pine that Pine pitch and put it in the gopher wood and when it soaks in real good it's not gopher anymore it's Pine cuz it's been changed oh you think about what the the effect of the Holy Ghost in your life can do it can take your broken messed up character and change you and change you what's it doing changing you to be like God oh that's the power of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to change us to where we can walk and talk and act like Jesus and respond like Jesus respond to where when somebody smites us on the face we can turn the other cheek respond to where when somebody crucifies our influence we can say father forgive them oh that's the kind of life that I want to live I want to live the kind of life like Steven did when they stoned him and he was laying there dying and he said father forgive them to think of that father forgive them that's a really Holy Ghost fi real Holy Ghost fi life where you can't tell who your enemy is where you can't tell who you like and who you don't like who you agree with and who you don't agree with that's that's not hypocrisy my friends that's a holy ghost fre life where you can't tell whether somebody likes somebody or where they don't like somebody but where you stand for the truth no matter what where you stand for the truth and you believe God no matter what no matter whether you're friends do or don't or what the situation is oh if we can just shun the very appearance of evil brother I would say the whole Pentacost the world if they do let down don't you do it you stay true to God pray up live right associate yourself with God and his people and come out from among the worldly ungodly things that the Bible says you got to get the world out oh we got to get the world out you get the isn't that a principle of getting born again you got to get the world out first you got to be Sanctified you take that take that vessel and you wipe all the mud and everything out and you clean it out first you got to get the world out before Christ can come in he just won't associate with unbelief and things of the world now King joash was king during this time and he was a lukewarm borderline believer King joash he you know you read I I think it's interesting look at some of these Kings how they they come out and they hit the ground running they get real excited and they're going to go tear down the olive Groves and tear down tear down all the the the temples to bail and things and they go doing real good and then they get to listening to the people then they get to listening to Jezebel or whatever get to listening to somebody and they start compromising now see God don't want compromisers he wants somebody that'll have a backbone and stand for what's real and what's truth now King joash was a lukewarm border believer brother R will say he'd take out a few of the high places and where the Heathen worship was and he done a few of those things but yet he departed not from the sins of his father and like that just any way the people wanted to go that's the way he wanted to go God don't like compromisers God don't want his church to look like the world oh that's why I'm thank thank God that you can be a real Holy Ghost filled Christian that don't have nothing to do with the world that you can look look different and act different what a blessing that is that that that God gave you all these these requirements of things laying here of how to dress holy and how to look holy and live holy and you you can live a way that the world cannot live oh I I thank God when I go home at night and and I you know we're we're not we're not looking we don't have all the things maybe that the world does all the popularity and Fashions and everything but I look over at my little wife crochet in there and we got a little playing and we got the Bible over on the side you know on the table and and the home is peaceful you know and you you just you you you know it is what it is and I thank I thank God I thank God for those things thank God you should be proud and you should be thankful to be a Christian don't don't look at the world and think well I wish I could if you look at the world and think I wish I wish I could be like that there something's wrong something's wrong in your heart I'm so glad to be a Chris where I I I don't have to live like they do live live this hound dog life where you're just running around anyway I'll leave that but and brother Brown will say isn't that just exactly like preachers today the way the congregation wants to do that's the way the preacher PR preaches to them I want to tell you a God sent holy ghostborn preacher won't compromise with any congregation oh could you imagine John the Baptist coming out there and looking at the king come by that had married his brother's wife that wasn't even lawful according to the Bible and John didn't hold back he just preached it because what's a preacher's obligation is the truth it's not people's feelings not people how people feel but it's the truth Our obligation is the truth and did you know the Bible actually says that one day a preacher will be held accountable for the word that he preaches because if he's if he's over a congregation if he's over a group of people and he holds back and doesn't tell them the truth and they continue living in sin that it's the preacher's fault it's the preacher's fault he's the one that's going to be held accountable and he'll he'll stand a greater condemnation for not giving the truth oh so we can't hold back you got to just like John didn't hold back John had a backbone he had Integrity he stood for something you know what Integrity is when you stand for something that doesn't matter when whether somebody agrees with you or disagrees with you you going to preach it just the same and he preached it to a King he preached it he preached it if you ever want to make a stand now is the time to make a stand this is the time and brother R will say today is a compromising time everybody wants to look like everybody else everybody wants to look like the world you go into the supermarket and you see all the Hollywood actresses and stuff in the supermarket stand and women want to look like that you see all the Tommy rot in Hollywood and men want to look like that and live like that people getting thrown in jail and doing all kinds of things in Hollywood and just a long list of the horrible lives that they live and yet people want to live like that people want to look like that but they don't want to match up their life with with the Bible you know if I was going to match my life up with anything I want to match my life up with with the saints that lived in the early church I don't want to match my my life up with what Paul said a real Christian should be and I believe that a real Christian should be a real Christian shouldn't be halfway in and halfway out like King Jo but if you're a saint act like a saint act like a saint that means not not if you if you slip out with a cuss word ever now and then then you you should repent and act real sorry for it and not just be like oh well oh well you just got a pile on the grace cuz that's just how I am no God has a requirement for a Christian a Christian a Christian should be a real genuine Christian and not just if you're going to slip up in things let's go back to the Altar and make sure that well what really what we say we are instead of something that we just got to keep throwing this blanket of greasy Grace on top of until it's just so greasy we can't hardly live let's walk like a saint dress like a saint talk like a saint pray like a saint live like a saint shout like a saint be like a saint live a saint die like a saint and go to heaven like a saint if I'm going to be a saint I might as well do what the Bible says I'm going to be a saint in other words let's be a real be a real Christian I want to I want I want I want the devil to know what side I'm on I want God to know what side I'm on I want my fellow Believers to know what side I'm on I don't want to have one fit AC foot foot across the other side of the fence and and straddling everything and and everybody look at me well I wonder I wonder if they're fixing to leave the message any minute I wonder if they're fixing to lose their faith I I don't want people to look at me like that but I want to be a real genuine real Holy Ghost filled Christian and if you're not like that why don't you make that decision because you you might be the one tonight that God is looking for to fulfill his promises in maybe you're the one that God has drawing this borderline believer in this halfway lukewarm do you know the Bible said that this day would come it says that in the lay out of SE in church age they'd be half that lukewarm a lukewarm lukewarm means it's they're not hot and they're not cold what are they that's the condition of what is it is is it a duck it don't walk like a duck is it a Christian it I wonder is it the lean Church age would be lukewarm and make God sick at his stomach till he says in in the Book of Revelation that he'd SPO it from his mouth oh how the old saints of God used to sit around and sing the Redemption Song and sing of the blood and the power of God and today these are brother rand's words it's say cold as zero nearly why cuz it's it's the it's the spirit of the age the spirit of the age is to be just halfway just well right not not really he said you don't see their faces light up no more and sing and clap their hands and raise their hands to God and praise God and pray all night and lay out in the corn fields and things people Canon said in church 30 minutes without grumbling and growling now ain't that the truth we start making jokes if the service goes longer than 30 minutes why what is it because our heart's just not in it we just get bored with church and we just get tired it's it's it's I'm telling you it's a spiritual Condition it's the spirit of the age you know you can get the spirit of America on you you can get the spirit of North Georgia on you there's a North Georgia Spirit you can get the spirit of others brother said you go to a church and you can get the pastor Spirit on you you can get the spirit of people that are around you but I want that Holy Ghost spirit that'll be real and genuine no matter how how the people in North Georgia act how the people in America act I don't want to act like other people I want to act like God said we're going to act that's right oh what a day that we're living in like the day of joash borderline halfway lukewarm blowing blowing away tossed about wind clouds Without Rain tossed about never learning able to come to the knowledge of the truth that's how joash was blown blown around by every wi the people would say you need to go this way the people would say you need to go that way and that's how joash would live his life this Old King he thought he would just go any way the winds blowed tossed about by everything never stable I don't want to be like that you don't know what you believe maybe this like I was I was sharing that little anecdote the other day about somebody in another church that was saying this Sunday is the last Sunday of the month I thought I was going to going to stay home but then I thought no I got the day wrong it's not the last Sunday of the month so I can go now come on now God don't want us to be like that he wants you to be stable and to desire the sincal milk of the word of God and to love God and to love being around his people and not just be wishy-washy well well this is have some kind of rule that you make every other Sunday I'll go to church every other Sunday I won't oh if the Holy Ghost is in you he feeds on the word of God and not on television and not on true story magazines and love books and all that that's what people that just call themselves Christians wrap themselves up in cuz that's what they're feeding on their whole life is wrapped up in things that ain't going to give them any benefit and then then then maybe at the end of their life maybe they can squeeze in a death bed confession if the doctor don't dose them up with a good shot of morphine oh my brother and sister don't wait until then you might as well you might as well give in God now while you got time a s stable sound mind to think about things and respond in a way where you can have a real good repentance and lay things on the altar rather than wait until you're so drugged up at the end of the life that you can't even think straight oh don't wait my friends oh you think in the face of all that now to show you there's a hope this Old King joash heard that the the prophet was sick and he went down to visit him this old backslid joash halfway in halfway out blown around by The Winds of everything he went down cuz he heard that Elisha was sick Elisha was sick and the Bible says he was fixing to die and he didn't come irreverent he would come with respect he had enough God about him to know that he must visit this Prophet with respect so he walked up and wept over him and said my father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof now that's how you get something from God he come to that prophet and he said I know what you are to this nation that you are the very thing that's holding us up that your words are your words are like the Chariots of Israel your words and your prophecies are like the horsemen that battle for Israel you are you you are actually like the Oracle of God when I stand here at at your bedside I I come expecting to hear something that will benefit my life and that's the way you want to get something from God not just come to criticize not come to with jokes and and just making fun of things but you come oh you see you don't read the Bible to fuss about it but you read the Bible to live it well that's how you read the Bible don't read the Bible to argue with it and say well I think it's wrong over here and wrong over there and you don't come to church like that you won't get nothing from the service but you come ready to live it ready for it to take effect in your life read the Bible to live it and he walked down with respect and he wept over him because he come and approached it reverently God had respect to him and you know if God had respect for him because he come reverently he'll have respect to you if you come reverently that's why God said God told Elijah rise up I think he's on his deathbed and God said rise up and Elijah rose up oh you think about those words Elijah rose up and they was just about ready in their backslid and condition to be besieged by another country the syrians all the enemy was all around and you think tonight that all the enemy might be around you and maybe the devil's just got your mind and the tizzy and you're all frazzled and you're blown around by every wind of Doctrine and every wind of any kind of an influence and you don't know which is up and which way's down and which way is North and which way's South but because this one man humbled himself and come down before God and said oh my father how we need you God respected it and if you'll come that way God will respect your approach too and he respected Elijah and God respected him and if you'll respect God's Bible and God's holy spirit he will respect you and Elijah said go get your bow and he put an arrow in it said open the window towards the east the East is the way that Jesus will come and he said now watch now I want you to put the era in the place and draw back just as far as you can and he did he said shoot and when he shot what happened the era went out he said Get the Era and like I was saying earlier he ran out there and hunted and maybe it took him an hour maybe it took him 2 hours while Elijah's laying up there Elisha is laying up there in the bed on his on his deathbed hunting in the weeds and the overgrown grass looking for that air now that's what anybody any sensible person would do if a prophet tells you to do something you're going to go hunting for that promise if there's a promise laying in that air you're going to get that air oh if we can get desperate sometime I wonder out there looking in all those weeds if he just got desperate began to get real desperate I got to find find this because the prophet told me there's a promise laying here I got to find it and he went back and he said strike the ground and he struck the ground three times he grabbed that a and he went bang bang bang and the prophet was wroth with him he said why' you strike it why didn't you strike it more times than that why didn't you do something else about it strike it more times now that's that's an example that's a lesson for all of us we see a promise of God laying there and we go out and grab a hold of the A and we'll just barely give it any effort at all well that's good enough that's all right I went I went to church every other Sunday I read my Bible like two times this last year he said you Struck it three times you'll only have three victories and the prophet got so upset with him he said why' you why didn't you strike it more times than that the same thing has happened to tonight in the Christian church we struck the era of God's Deliverance he said it was God sent the era of Deliverance to us the era of Deliverance is the holy spirit that's been sent shot from the bow of God's love when the eternity I love the cence when the eternity to Eternity was pulled together by the cord of love God shot the era of Deliverance into the church on the day of Pentecost and the church was given in her hand what what was given in her hand she had in her hand on the day of Pentecost the promise of God that arrow that was shot through the Eastern window that the Bible says Christ is going to come from the East the church was going to given into her hand the era of God's deliverance and that Holy Spirit would deliver the church out of any kind of a chaos it could get into why cuz God doesn't forget his promises he's going to deliver you out of whatever your situation is but what we do with it we pick up the era and strike three times that's just a backsliding king strike the era once well we'll build a church we'll teach theology we'll teach psychology and have an organization oh but that's not what God wants God wants to have a holy ghost filled group of people a holy ghost filled church that's gone all the way until that Syrian Army is completely Desto destroy that's what God wanted to do is completely destroy the enemy completely destroy the en in your life not just a little halfhazard well this will be good enough God don't want us to strike short the church world tonight is still striking short God sent the baptism of the Holy Ghost and put it into the hands of the church the era of God's Deliverance to deliver from sickness from sin from worry from trouble oh if you got worry tonight that's what that era of Deliverance is for to take all that worry away cast it on him and he'll take care of it cast that worry on him all that worldliness oh if you get a hold of God he'll take that worldliness out of you from everything else but he said we've struck short of it oh to think that every promise in the book is mine that's what Elijah Elisha was telling King joash every promise is yours don't hold back don't just have a little half hearted well I'll just knock three times on the ground and that'll be enough but all come with confidence believing that there is a God on the scene to guide us and to lead us and every promise in the book is mine because a God that made the promise is on the scene to fulfill his word and make these words come off the page God made a way for you to be delivered from everything from complexes from sin sickness oh we don't have to deal with I think comp listen I think complexes are some of the worst things you talk to somebody with a complex and they're always looking behind them to searching out to find somebody that's going to be against them looking for somebody looking for a reason to find fault because they're coming with that negative Viewpoint that somebody's going to do something somebody's going to what all these complexes and complexes we know they come from all these life experiences and scars and everything but nevertheless God can get rid of it for you God can take it away if we'll just give it to him oh look at what God has given to us don't come up short we go over to the church and we join the church and we think that's all right but it ain't all right don't strike short of nothing of God's blessings if God promised the blessing of the Holy Ghost you can have it if God promised tonight healing in your body you can have it if he promised deliverance from the devil from all those fiery darts of the devil you can have it why because the Bible said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's it Strike It Don't Be Afraid God said so I'm the Lord that Health thee strike it God said so it's the era of Deliverance it's brought into the church tonight but the church has been taught it's some historical thing and not put it down to a present day you remember when Elisha come over that River of the River Jordan and he got to the River Jordan after Elijah had gone up and he grabbed the mantle that had been given to him typ and the holy ghost that had fallen from Elijah and he said he struck the water and he said where is the god of Elijah come I remember somebody telling me a testimony of a little missionary down in I think it was South America they they had a need and they got to the river they got to a river that they had to get across to deliver a message because they were called to preach and they made that same declaration and the water parted and they came across why because God is still he's still the same yesterday today and forever we've heard the stories that brother Louise told of how they pour water or whatever in the gas tank and and drive because they had a need and and and story after story because God is still a god cancer being delivered from people and and and all so many miracles that how could we doubt to see that God is still on the scene he's just looking for somebody to believe where is the god of Elijah I think we know tonight we know the answer of where where the god of Elijah is he's still on the scene he's still that same God that came walking to to Abraham and and Abraham broke bread with him and and and and he began to reveal things to him and show him the things that would come he's still that same God that's still able what good what good tonight is a God in a history if isn't the same God tonight what good is a God that we can just read about what good is it if he's not still the same God of Miracles today if he isn't the same God tonight what good is he oh if I I want to challenge you tonight to take God at his word and believe him that's the kind of God that I'm preaching tonight what good would he be if he's not the same yesterday today and forever but the Bible says he is so if he's still the same that he was in the first church age all down through the 2,000 years that we've been living through he's still the same tonight because God remembers his promises so you might as well strike out you might as well strike out as a musicians come the era of Deliverance is filled with Mercy tonight given to the church what we ought to do is is pick it up and strike for the glory of God that's right and every divine blessing that God promised is yours by faith if you'll receive it he said I'll tell you my brother and sister tonight you might have thought this might be fanaticism or something but if you want step with God and take his promise and reach right out there and say now Lord I believe in it watch what takes place and I want to declare to you tonight if we as we stand to our feet whatever you have need of if you could take his promise and reach right out there grab a hold of that era of Deliverance say now Lord I believe it watch and see what takes place and you'll see something happen do you love the Lord let's just worship him I think we've got something to praise and worship God for he's made us different people hadn't he cuz we got a hold of something all on the altar of sacrifice late see 103
