========================================

today i faced a mountain that i had no strength to climb and the struggles of my journey left me weak open body and in mind from where i stand to the peak is a distance on my own i cannot read so this journey of a thousand steps again right here on my knees so i'll sow like an eagle high on wings so i can almost see god's face rising in his splendor look like a mountain just i may face things tomorrow i can't comprehend today circumstances so uncertain make it hard to find the strength to pray but i'm living in this promise you'll never leave me you'll always see flying high from heaven's point of view the brains war into the heavens to our secret face to faith rise again is splendor the heights i never knew a mountain just what once looked like a mountain just a hill from heaven's point of view oh my did you expect that today you didn't know when you're going to leave home you hear that a lot of things should get up in the morning we had a birthday party here a couple weeks ago never knew we was going to have that birthday party that day but we did just married don't that make you proud amen let's all stand by thee wonderful i wonder is is foreign beauty go real soon is i love you oh is my i want to see you want amen see you to see you high and lifted shining in the heart of your glory and then shining in the light of your glory amen i want to see amen and amen and amen i want to see him good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn back where we were reading this morning from romans 7. and from exodus 19 and we'll try to continue our thought and remember now the bible study will be the first saturday i was thinking this coming weekend but it's not let this be the first saturday in july remember the fellowship meeting will be the third saturday in july and remember brother quinn will be coming to be with us in august i think it's that weekend i announced i seem like the 12th this morning i believe it's 11 for the sunday service but just remember that remember to pray for wade and june and them be flying back tomorrow afternoon and pray that the lord would bless them and and deal with them there and give them a good understanding of thy word and we sent them a little message this morning and told them they'd have to listen to the tape to evening message maybe to catch on to what was going on but brother anderson's sister anna it's going to be parents but he couldn't wait he had to call and brother joe and them explained it to him brother anderson so they got the message but we pray that the lord would would be with them on the way home tomorrow amen so romans 7 is exodus 19. heavenly father we thank you lord for your grace and your love unto us thank you for everything father thank you for calvary thank you for loving us thank you lord for giving us your grace and understanding but now what we need is is the grace is there lord but we truly need understanding of you and how that you deal with us and what it's all about so we pray that you just come and speak to our hearts and give us of your love most of all forgive our sins and guide each and every one of us lord lead us by that understanding in jesus name amen romans 7 really enjoyed that song to god there is no mountains there's a little bit of hills right there to him it is because he's great didn't he romans 7 know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how does the law have dominion over man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'll be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she'll be married to another man wherever my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit under god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring it bring forth fruit unto death see the law couldn't deliver anybody and it was working in now we'll get to this later eventually and it's going to sound odd but you listen to it the law was weak the scripture said it couldn't produce right even though it was god's word it was weak in the man that it was in so you'll get that scripture seeing it'll open up see for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members bringing to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter now we go to exodus 19 verse 3 and read moses went up unto god and the lord god called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel see covering jacob israel everything's him you have seen what i did unto the egyptians how i bury you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my commandment keep my covenant so you know remember unconditional then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priest and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel moses came and called the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him and the people answered together see how everybody in union together and said all that the lord has spoken we will do moses returned the words of the people unto the lord you may be seated lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now i hope he was following with me and enjoyed the message this morning i enjoyed preaching it so if i run out of voice this afternoon i hollered a little bit too much this morning i guess but we'll not worry about it we can whisper you know all right but talking about the unconditional covenant now see that covenant was made not on conditions but there were a lot of conditions that caused that covenant to come into existence a lot of things happened and god brought it to mankind and brother branham said even with israel and that was back you know coming with the children of israel that even though they backslid and went down to egypt he said they lost the promise you know or something like that many different wordings of that first part but he said they never lost their covenant right so then when you come to this situation don't think about it even the children of israel because we'll read one in a minute we get time that even though they chose law and they you know and all but still they never lost the covenant that covenant is still waiting upon israel to be completed in the redemptive form of salvation through the 144 000 that will come in after us you know and there's still a lot to be dealt with with them but they never lost their covenant and us as the children of abraham the seed of abraham by faith by the new birth the we may do a lot of things and mess up on a lot of things but just remember we've never lost the covenant that's right and he's always good to that covenant and we'll keep it right and if you're born again that is the only one the covenant is two those that are born again are the only people that are under an unconditional covenant in the way that god wanted it to be that's why israel when her climax of her redemption is the best way of saying it they will come to a new birth or whatever you want to call it and they'll receive the finality of it until then they're waiting on that but you know god is still just sitting there the prophet of god said he comes down every day and heals the people of israel he said even though they don't receive him why because he's keeping his word all right so just remember now the unconditional covenant is always somebody came by the office and asked me today and that's true the only the only to the born-again believer is the one that's under the unconditional covenant everybody else has still got problems in you know in their doings because that's what it brought over at calvary calvary brought into manifestation i'll say calvary because that was worth it the price was paid and then the baptism of the holy ghost coming into new birth see then when that happened then you know it brought us into truly the unconditional covenant so i just go out and live like i want to brother dale that goes to prove you're not born again amen i've tried to express that to you and try to get you to look at it in the correct way of what an unconditional covenant is that even with israel even though god gave abraham an unconditional covenant he went right on offering sacrifices now if you say well it's just unconditional it don't matter what i do then you're gonna have to deal with abraham because he offered sacrifices the rest of his life and so did the people before moses came into being in on the law then they really did have sacrifices to offer and a book kept of how many they had to do but you see that way then it's truly an unconditional covenant grace is grace but let's don't make it disgrace see we strive to try to reach that as a part that talks about you know striving for the mastery you know and that thing during the scripture for the high calling and why wouldn't we want to repent but i hope you caught the point i was making this morning of breaking the difference in the sacrifice before the law was instituted to bring a a covenant for all israel under moses back then each person gave a sacrifice for their own sins and that's the way it is with you and i so just remember those things i would invite you to go back and listen to that message and those who hear this and hasn't heard it i please ask you to go listen to the message and listen you know to try to understand all right now my point this afternoon we'll be talking about law instead of grace law instead of grace but the point will be to ask you in our question which do we want which do we want law or grace now what if you'd have been standing before israel when they were in their journey and their doings and even when they had come up to this point of saying here in exodus whatever you say do we'll do you know the prophet said that they chose law so we'll read a bit of that this afternoon but do you really think that they wanted a book of rules to keep i'm just serious i want you to think about this do you think that they really wanted a book of rules because remember now they said lord whatever you say do will do right now what if the lord would have said now each one of you has got to put a 100 pound sack on your back and carry it the rest of your life you see you're just being silly no i'm making statements that when we continue the thought throughout the message even later you will understand what was going on with those people did they want a set of bondage i mean do you think they wanted some bondage to be put under you know do you think that everyone wanted to and i know i'm silly but if god would have said all right now what i want you to do is i want every one of you cut your left foot off well you know they said whatever you say to now i'm getting serious about that not silly because i'm asking you the question what do you think was going on in that situation what did they want and the prophet would say they wanted something to do and how simple is the things that they wanted to do and i ask you and i the question do we want law or grace what do you think was meant when they said it and god said through the prophet to us in this end time that israel chose law instead of grace now i've tried to get you to see it many many messages that you're in verse 3 4 5 6 7 of exodus 19 god is telling them how wonderful they are there are chosen people how beautiful he has made them under the covenant and remember when you get to here you've done had um close to 3 000 years of mankind i'm just giving a date but i don't know exactly but you know there was 2 000 before the flood you know and all those people had to make sacrifices for their sins what was they wanting to do what if god would have said i want you to sacrifice your children you know oh no that ain't the bible i'm sorry that's right uh he told abraham to do it right all right but yet what do you think they were saying what you say do will do what if you went home today and told your husband or the wife you know the husband husband to the wife and said well now honey whatever you want me to do i'll do it i tell my wife said well i want a t-bone steak every night for supper for the next three months i would probably get a negative answer out of that would don't you think so i'm pretty sure she'll tell you she would do you understand my point what were they meaning as to say whatever you say will do all right remember the prophet will be covering that they chose law instead of grace they chose love for grace now this is maybe brother dale's way of saying it but i think i can prove the point with the prophet they chose law thinking it was grace if you understand what i'm saying i'm trying to make it as pointed blunt as i can but do you really think that they were wanting a book of rules do you think that was in their mind to want a book of rules like that form what were they wanting do you think they really wanted burden some things something horrible and why in the world would not they want what god had said about them now if he called him a bunch of dirty rascals sorry dogs you know you can understand maybe that they didn't want to fit in that category but they had as we'll prove a prophet a pillar of fire the atonement to be made the grace of god to them what would it be for them to want that would come down to you and i and we would be saying the same thing by our actions and reactions until you bless god brother that i don't want no law well do you believe yeah that israel was actually saying oh give us something to do and we'll do it out of love from our heart for you lord do you really think that see they wanted something they could do in their salvation now we're going to read these things no just hold it on till we get there you know and the prophet of god said it is the nature of man and has always been the nature of man always here all the way back to try to do something to save themselves we'll read these in a minute what about adam that as quick as he'd sinned instead of crying out father forgive me they run in the bushes and made some thick leaves you know for aprons and brother branham say it now if you need this one i'll be glad i didn't bring it today but be glad to get it he said there they were in the bushes having church amen they thought they thought within themselves that there was something wrong but they knew that god was coming down in the cool of the evening right has he done every day so he said how are we going to face him well let's get us some fig leaves man has always wanted something he could do to save himself but now before we read a lot of these i want your thoughts on one thing i believe this is me brother day also are i believe it to be backed up by the message i believe israel had looked around and seen the nations around them and they seen them with idols and images and things and they saw beautiful temples they saw people slaving seemingly but yet bringing to their gods the works of their own hands and their own thoughts well then could it be that they wanted to be like them now i'm putting this up front where you when the message comes you'll see my point could it be that they were not saying give me a book of rules to live by but they were saying let us figure out some way that we can satisfy god they looked around and seen the worship of all the others in their gods but yet they saw no temples no uh set place of worship remember there were vagabonds traveling no doing this but that could it be that they would be like peter on the mountain you know what brother brown says about peter on the mountain he said let us build three tabernacles one for thee one for moses one for a lot but have you read on what he says he says we'll make one denomination and we'll call it the law for moses he said we'll make another denomination we don't get that far today i know but we'll make another one for elijah and he represents god's justice and things they want to make three denominations now that's the way your prophet describes it so could it be that they were not wanting a book of rules or regulations but they just could not accept the fact of what god had to say about them could that fit our day could that fit lula georgia we would all like to have some way or do something to be able to serve god better right isn't that the thoughts of every one of us brother brown said it people told him he used to do this and to do that evidently he must win he said it's supposed to get down and bow down and fold her hands and pray you know he says anything wrong with that no but it don't work for everybody right see that's why we want something speaking in tongues shouting believing the message we want something that everybody can agree on remember we read there in the scripture it says they all answered to god maybe this thing was pre-planned they sure got all the people together on it you know but they looked around and they saw other nations and things around them and they saw those other nations serving their god later on it proved out to be true because they said give us a king like all the other nations right see eventually when we get to it we'll see that the prophet said they didn't get what they thought they got they thought they got a book of rules and a few things to do we said they got god in letter form that's what killed them it was the word of god but what if moses would have come down off the mountain okay and go up there and get what god wants us to do and what if he'd took a scroll or roll and he'd roll that thing out you know and it went all the way to the back in fine print you understand the point we got 8 942 things that god wants you to do or not do you think they'd have put check marks on all of them and said we'll do it if they do i want to sell you some stock alcatraz for vacation home right not being silly it's truthful are you getting a point is it a thousand rules no because they didn't keep the 12 to 10. well they thought they would they knew their ancestors before about done anything but just think about it they wanted something to do to save themselves and they wanted to try to show the people the way they were serving their god and maybe even their god because remember when they made the golden calf right right what did they say we're going to go back down to egypt right was that what they said and he said we'll tell them he better not fool with us because here's the god that brought us out here they weren't going down there naked handed they were going to go back and tell those egyptians there's a god that destroyed you and he'll do it again bow down they wouldn't go back to slaves come on you'd think that's your carnal and your understanding they were going to go back it's victorious so any problems with what i said i believe they wanted to show the people around them their god and how he was and how they worshiped him and they were going to do things and not do things but when he give them what he gave them the prophet of god says it no man can keep the law now that's the words of your prophet you need it i read them off while i go there one i know laying on my desk no man can keep the law they never intended to keep what they said no no these people wanted something to make make them what if it was something for them to do it would mean nothing to do with the grace that god had given and he'd already given them grace so they certainly didn't want that they did not want a life lived by the love of god in their heart as i was trying to express this morning they wanted some way to atone for themselves all right now with that in mind let's just read a little bit and think on it if it was never as we'll read in a moment the will of god to give the law now so i know just going out people are listening and even the ones that are listening which i'm sure are basically the followers of the message and you know the prophet has said these things and we'll read them but i can read it out of the bible and read it from the prophet it's not going to convert anybody i've never tried that so i don't worry about it but how would you go down to a denominational church we're not throwing off on nobody just standing like it is and you go tell us it was never god's will to give the law what do you mean he brought him out of egypt he took him to the mountain and he gave him the law you mean you're saying that god wasn't going to do that do we believe the prophet see that puts it to where at least we we have a a mutual meeting ground that i can say do we believe the prophet you know see if he was talking organized religion it ain't who do you believe what who said what or who taught what well i've heard brother so-and-so explained it right down the line and god brought him out there to give that law i heard it before i came in this message of this that a man didn't even have a soul until the law came into existence i heard that for her this message i told a man i said well according to my bible it said and adam became a living soul he said that is right but you know it didn't stop him it didn't matter what the word said he had his own ideas we're going to find out that's what organized religion is it's our ideas now listen to this point they thought now this is me writing but now we're going to read it they thought they were right and that god would want them to think and do this way that they were asking about if not why would they want it are you understanding and i've always said it this way trying to make it straight i believe on the day of pentecost if peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and stand on your head that would have been god's way you could do all the rest of it but if you didn't stand on your head right but see they thought they were right in asking for something to do or when would they ask it and they thought that was what god wanted about a year or so ago there was a lady run over her husband she backed up run over him again naturally killed him and asked her said why did you do that she said me and god is fed up with this she didn't say she was she said her and god was in other words god told her to run over the guy and then back up over and make sure you get him you know you say yeah but that's dumb kooks what's the difference in a dumb cook in an educated coop sorry what's the difference both unscooped you know people don't understand cooks no southern language number both of us crazy or just messed up i forget sometimes i'm talking that maybe i might be going to west africa well brother joe and then one time they got an email from somebody and i believe it was africa and they you know forgot which one but richard i know he was and they didn't know what a squirrel was you know and brother ryan said he spoke squirrels into existence they didn't know what a squirrel was because in that part of the country they didn't have any squirrels so they got him a picture put it on the internet and sent it back to it so maybe we need some pictures okay all right now listen let me say this again i like to read my own notes you know sometimes see they thought they were right and that god wanted them to think and do this way and this is all they needed to do even to bring them to calvary because they surely knew a little bit about the promises in god's word of what would take place back there you know at least they knew about the messiah was promised in genesis what about 3 15 when i put in between thy seed and the seed of the woman they knew that they were looking forward to those things job was well let's go ahead now and just read a little bit let your prophet answer some things and we'll go as far as we can we still got wednesday night go ahead with number one which is i ask you to to get this message and listen to it you can't do one thing you can click on your internet on your systems you know what i mean and you can just play it on your internet the church choosing law for grace now even the title church you know he's talking about us he's just illustrating about what they were choosing law for grace e14 went from cadence there was only 11 days to the crossing they couldn't believe it because they had already seen so many great things done they were sure they were in the will of god just as our fathers was a few years ago and they were there's where they made their great fatal mistake they the greatest mistake that israel ever made was when it renounced grace marked him words and accepted law it made his greatest mistake in exodus 19 was one of the fatal mistakes that israel made the covenant that god made with abraham was completely grace but grace had provided for them a deliverer a prophet a sacrificial lamb it had provided the greatest revival they'd ever had you know moses dancing and murray and run up down the banks you know singing in the spirit and yet they wasn't satisfied with it they wanted something that they could argue about uh more i'm going to get on these same quotes you're going to read them again wednesday and we're going to bring it over to where we are i'm trying today to keep it back there all right then comparison all right they wanted a place to where they could have something to do into it we'll read some quotes later where he says into their salvation and things but see they wanted something to do and what did we use up there when we talked about they were sure they were in the will of god just as our fathers was a few years ago listen god had provided them a deliverer a prophet lamb greatest revival but they weren't satisfied with it they renounced grace in other words they were saying god your ways won't bring to pass what we think is supposed to be right when would he say they renounce grace renounced grace means you turn it totally down renounce means you publicly right you publicly renounce and remember it was all of them that come up and said we publicly renounce the fact that you saved us by grace that you're with us and we want to do something ourselves they wasn't satisfied with the prophet being there that could tell them what to do come on later they wanted a king right they had a sacrificial lamb renounce grace and accepted law now do we want law or grace well brother dale i want grace well then evidently if they thought they were right they thought what they asked for was the grace of god are you with me i mean these weren't dummies you're dealing with okay these were the religious people and what about it go back there and study some of those things about them and how god would provide a way and maybe they would be scattered out all over the place and something would go wrong and he'd just send somebody they just all come together go defeat the enemy go right back to whole windows and gardens what about a god that could warn you of everything and tell you where the enemy's coming how he's going to come down is that in the scripture who was it the man said that they got a prophet over there and said he tells what goes on in the king's chamber come on folks so what happened then grace had provided a prophet a sacrificial lamb a great revival a covenant and it was all grace but they wanted something to do why is it then when we try to talk to people about god that we tell them what to do and not to do now do you want this quote i'll be glad to bring this one the prophet said people asked how to be saved said we tell them what to do and what not to do to be saved he said that ain't the question they asked they asked how to be saved and said we tell them a book of rules now come on why is it there's so much fruit been bruised by the people of this message let's drove people away from the message instead of to the message and all the preaching 40-something years i've never had a child out of this congregation to ever come and tell me brother to hell i wish you hadn't told me that i hate you because of your preaching i've never had one yet i've had even like my wife talking someone was and this girl said brother dale had a meeting with all of us girls and said he told us we'll not do these things come on kids is that right i'm talking about kids just growed up here have i ever told you anything come on we got rue i mean uh yeah ruth and robbie and rebecca and uh julie's been around us esther's been around us all of these has been around a long time joyce i've never tried to tell you anything wrong have a get off that go to number two you can't explain to people because they don't believe it you trying to tell me i didn't live right before my kids reason ain't saved yes is that loud enough why are they not here remember your kids know a whole lot more about your life than you think they know here's where we're at this morning we read does god's does god ever change his mind about his word 65 418 paragraph 95 90 and 96-97 god permitted israel to take a law in exodus the 19th chapter when grace had already given them a prophet pillar fire sacrificial lamb delivering power but they cried out for a law it wasn't god's will but it was injected because man wanted it and he was cursed by the very law that he wanted you know that the bible says that before the law came there was no transgression come on are we in the bible amen you mean he wasn't no there wasn't a record keeper you're going to find out what he did what that law really is the law's a record keeper they didn't keep up with what everybody done until the law came into existence but when the law came into existence moses was smart enough he said hold it just a minute you keep a record joe come excuse me not joe jim jim committed adultery write her down that was never done that away until the law came into existence come on show me in the bible no before then you was condemned by this by the similitude of adam's transgression that's what the bible says it doesn't say condemned but it that's what happened before then it was you and god you and god you and god but when the law came into being and they brought them into a people it became record keepers but look cursed by the very law that they wanted it's best to have god's will now watch him that's what the thought that's what he thought what he taught us that will be done thy kingdom come then we'll be done we must submit ourselves to his will and his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is so many wants to go around get some other way when you do you find yourself going on and you find god blessing you right look brother dale look at all these churches out here look at what's going on you mean god yes god is blessing them yes sir but are they in the perfect will of god what do you say when you do you find yourself going on you find god blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not in his perfect divine will he permits his and i said but he will not he will not let it be his perfect will he said well this this we're going to make this as per you permissive can lead out to perfect but permissive and perfect can't be put together two opposites right and it'd be his perfect will but he'll make it work to honor and bless his perfect will and he said in childbearing by sex is one of that he permits it when it's perfect will so what is it we read it the first one they said they thought they were right they thought they were in the will of god now we read it was not the will of god to give them the law as i said then that's hard for people to swallow because that's the word of god you're throwing up on the word of god because the word of god is what god wanted to give them not the way they wanted it he didn't give them what they wanted he never gave israel a book of rules to live show me he said well they start doing this go back before that happened and find out they were already doing that if you wouldn't listen to what i said this morning before exodus 19 they already had to profit the things in the following rules and regulations or right before god the law never brought a savior he brought a condemnation okay remember we read this one this morning abraham's covenant number three there is not nothing that we could do to merit it's god grace that gives it to us by faith abraham believed god and it was imputed to him for righteousness the law was what man wanted know what god wanted i just don't understand that because he gave him his word don't he want us to have his word he don't want us to have his word as a book of rules he does not want that he's always come on he even got to the place that he said i'm sick of your offerings he said they have become a stink in my nostrils but said a man with an honest and a contrite heart is what i long for what was the difference in abraham and the rest a man with an honest and a contrite heart see if it just stayed that away look what it would have been you know what brother branham said it would have been i don't have the quote laying here but we'll get it he said if they'd have went on had not done what they'd done in exodus 19 he said they would have crossed over jordan into the promised land and he said paraphrasing it the millennium would have been on hand and i wouldn't be like no but it would have brought it over closer realize when they walked into that promised land if they'd went in there with the right heart what is the what is the promised land what is canaan type of top of the baptism of the holy ghost right it's not a top of the millennium because you had battles in canaan if they'd walked right into that promised land with the right attitude christ would have come right there come on he's already been spoken of all the way through look at the next one number four this is jehovah gyra 1 62 705. now the covenant was given unconditionally now israel the seed natural exchange that now what exchanged it well because they thought they were writing what they were doing they exchanged it and lost it in exodus 19 when they made that rational thing to take away the grace now is your prophet telling us the interpretation of the word yet we can't read in the word where they said we don't want grace there is no such thing in there that man says he don't want grace but his actions and reactions turn down grace and he exchanged it for a book of rose and to take away the grace and accepted law and his praise what a rational racial rational ever how you say that r-a-s-a-t-l mistake that israel made there look god after he had made his covenant with abraham grace had already provided a prophet deliverer for them down in egypt to carry out the word of abraham remember moses under the bush god said i have heard the cries of my people and i remember my promise before there was any law is that what he done with abraham then when he come to moses what did he do before there was any law grace provided it grace had provided a sacrifice for their guilt a lamb grace had provided a covenant circumcision would have already been provided he's one of those things that was coming forth kept speaking of christ right was already been provided before law grace had provided a pillar of fire to lead them following a prophet as a security that the prophet and told them the truth it was the word that he was talking about they know that god promised it and there was the filler of fire confirming it what a double security amen grace had done that but they wanted something for themselves that they could do now what does he say that is have their own creeds and denominations you might wonder why i'm still reading romans 7 and all the titles of these sermons are on the internet still listed is marriage and divorce when we got onto law and grace we're going to find out if that old denominational husband is not dead we got two husbands just lean a little groundwork but they wanted something for themselves that they could do have their own creeds and denominations and what more make pharisees sadducees i don't know what man doing and something they could do their sales man is always trying to save himself you can't do that god has already done it you just have to accept it and believe it but look what he calls now that they were doing back dire illustrating what they were doing it comes down to denominationalism it comes down to our creeds and ideas it comes down to the pharisees and the sadducees you know the pharisees and sadducees come from the group of people at exodus 19. are you with me all right on to number five oh lord just once more 63 628 morning service grace had provided everything they needed off but they wanted something to do themselves little did they know when miriam was dancing with the tambourine and the children of israel dancing with her and moses singing in the spirit but there were only 10 days from the promised land the full promised land little did they know 40 years and their carcasses would rot in the wilderness what did it what caused that to rot in the wilderness israel made its most racial decision it ever made when it accepted law instead of grace when they wanted to make some bishops in something of their own something they had to do into it what do you want bishops for god was in their midst leading them what do you want bishops for i know the bible speaks of bishops and bishops right because who was it um paul to timothy you know see paul's a bishop and he ordained elders and bishops and they're correct but he's relating to israel in wanting bishops where did nathan and cora come in at what would they say now moses moses we're all spiritual is that what they said you take too much on yourself you're just being wore out now we're all spiritual you know evidently god didn't think too much of that because the ground swallowed them up they wanted to make them some bishops i'll say this back up just one little word you'll see where i'm headed if you don't want to listen to the next two or three messages that'll be your choice what about the bishops of this message i've never heard a doctrine yet that didn't say if you don't believe our way you're lost what was it brother richard when you and i back there and come in the message there in 66 hearing of it 67 what was going on then joyce oh gary maybe all you all were young enough that don't remember but there's brother howell sitting back there we used to get together and you know what the topic was who's going to lead us now that the prophet's gone who's the elijah today to carry us over i remember we were in jeffersonville and billy paul came out there and he said i just found out who the elijah it is to take us over boy everybody just froze you write his name down he gave the page number and a paragraph and he said brother branham said it was the lord jesus christ not everybody wanted tonight the seven thunder doctrine not over into the others with it great ones they had seven men written down that was supposed to each one be a thunder you tell me that organized religion ain't here today i gotta back up back up so you might not want to hear the rest of the message okay go to number six i think it's right in it jesus keeps all of his appointments 64 418 evening service grace had provided them a profit a pill or fire sacrificial lamb a deliverance and still they wanted a law they want something they could have something to do into they want to put their hands to it how's that that was the most rational mistake they ever made in exodus 19 when israel rejected grace and accepted law and then what did they do he just let them stay right there in the wilderness do we get there we've had 40 years running around and around and around and around right how long has the prophet been gone 65 according to that we've had about 40 48 close to we bump in 50. okay he just let them stay there in the wilderness for 40 years they flip vineyards and ate fruit and they married wives and they raised children till that old generation died off in another generation come on 40 years later and not hardly 40 hours away but they had to wait for 40 years before they went over then a new leader came in joshua and they moved on into the land with the new group who's to joshua this day the lord jesus christ not you and not me it's the lord jesus christ all right a new group look at the next one god has a provided way 62 728. little did those egyptian slaves know that's israel right when they stood on the bank after seeing a great revival that that prophet came down and brought to them and they sing the mighty land of god mighty hand of god and they'd been pro protected and come out there and dancing in the spirit after the cross through the red sea and seeing their enemies drown before them all their habits and things like we'd call today drown behind them me and you the things that torment them and marry him dancing in the spirit moses singing in the spirit and so forth little didn't know that when they were only about 10 days from the promised land knowing that they were 40 years away from it why why were they 40 years away because they had refused to follow god i'd underline that one they wanted a law instead of grace and they got it so they can make their own way and have their own so-and-soul man's always tried to do something by himself and go and let every one of them perish in the wilderness and raise up a new generation and took them to the promised land go to the next one the suburban church age 1960 1206. little did they believe that the promised land was 40 years ahead of them if it was only about 40 miles but it taken them 40 years to get 40 miles but it take them excuse me but it it'd take them 40 years to get 40 miles is because they chose the wrong thing they chose to have a law instead of letting the holy spirit lead them the pillar of fire taking them on through and leading them they wanted to have something to do themselves they wanted to have certain priests and certain dignities and a little theology they could fuss about instead of just going on and letting the holy ghost lead them they were in the spirit god had provided everything but they had to have something to do into it next jehovah jireh priest in 64 402 paragraph 60. and in exodus 19th chapter israel made one of its most rational things that it ever did was when it refused grace and accepted law look what grace had done grace had furnished for them or delivered had furnished for them a prophet with a pillar of fire to vindicate him with a confirmed word was this was the sacrificial lamb grace had give them a great revival grace had brought them through opened up the red sea brought them across the cross that delivered them with the signs and wonders all by grace but they wanted something so that they could make themselves some big names uh do you get brother sewing those tapes come on hard to stay off of that sermon it's laying in the office of course that's way back there uh what'd he say now if that just isn't the people today it's just the same thing they got to be man has got to get him get himself involved in it somewhere and there is word that israel made its great mistake when it rejected grace and took law instead and uh still but the covenant that he made with them was still unconditional he never took the covenant away even though they'd done the wrong it's still the same thing today right what about it okay go ahead number 10. returning jubilee i would suggest listening to this message 1962 11 22 e46 and e47 and little did they know that they were dancing on the banks of the jordan or the dead sea and that they were 40 years away from the land they was only about five days away but they made their rational mistake in exodus the 19th chapter when they accepted law instead of grace where they turned down god's way to have a way for themselves give us something to do that's been man's idea all along right now remember it's been man's idea that's the nature of man adam expressed that in the garden of eden when he was lost instead of going back to god for grace you remember i said that one ago he tried to make himself an apron and ever since then he's tried to have something to do with redemption when redemption is a free offer of grace by god god alone there's nothing you can do to save yourself god saved you no way at all you can do it but man wants something to do into it look at number 11. i'll get two more then we'll quit this is taking the message uh demonology religious realm 53 809 a god made a covenant with man and man breaks his covenant every time man never did he's keep his covenant with god the law was never kept now if that was what they wanted and he gave it to him they still didn't keep it so it's a condemnation they couldn't keep the law now here's i have to explain this wording right here christ was come and broke the law himself oh the people look at that christ broke the law i want you to explain that when he was almighty god what do you mean prophet said he broke the law explain it how did christ break the law when he was a man that gave the law when he was the law come on the law say it every person that was born in the world by sex was condemned to death you agree with that you want scripture for it all the sin comes short of the glory of god all condemned to death but you see jesus step right across human being not born by sex except into a body gave his life and stopped that law right he broke it what not broke it like broke it he stopped its effect christ is the end of the law for righteousness them that believe he never done nothing wrong in his own law you hear somebody say that tell that smart alec to come on the little and let's talk come on he didn't break that law like break it he fulfilled it and by fulfilling it it totally annihilated the law that says you got to die right the law said you had to die paul said what i thought was like was death but jesus christ made a way that he stopped that word from being able to fulfill and we can just step right across out of this because he's already done it in your soul by the new birth come on but you see people want to get tied up and they couldn't keep the law christ was come and broke the law himself because god had already promised a savior that's how he broke the law moses provided a way of escape and then escape rather and then the people after that they still wanted something to do man they're always trying to do something to save himself when you can't do it watch it's his nature as soon as he found out he was naked in the garden of eden he made some fig aprons is that right but he found out that they wouldn't work nothing a man can do can serve can serve your nothing a man can do can serve yourself god say save yourself excuse me he's god saves you unconditionally all down through the age and what is it and when you're saved what is it you're saved by grace it's still unconditional what's the last one excuse me my past 12 go to 13. okay all right now he didn't underline these because i didn't give them to him to late but this is amazing here he him 1956 uh 9 30. uh e 34 and 35. look where we at yeah he got it come on he got it he's well hit up look moses represented the law no man can keep the law the law was given to israel because they required it in exodus 19 was the greatest mistake that israel ever made after grace had provided a lamb provided a savior and they said give us something to do that's the way of man that's the way men try to do today is to merit their salvation see you as probably did it at and whether i was right or not when i was saying they was trying their best to find a way of salvation in the beginning without it being by the grace they wanted some rules that would make them righteous enough to be saved you probably wondered so we just read it and after grace had provided a lamb provided a savior and they said give us something to do that's the way men try to do today is to merit their salvation there's not one thing you can do about it it's all amazing grace oh i love it nobody you can not by works but by grace are you saved that unmerited grace god through the righteousness of the lord jesus christ has saved you and called you by his own grace our moses represented the law he's talking about on transfiguration right now no man is saved by the works of the law but yet peter wanted to build a denomination you probably thought i didn't have a quote when i said while ago that peter said we'll build the denominations come on that's what your prophet said but yet peter wanted to build a denomination around him he said we'll just build three tabernacles we'll be one for moses let those who want to keep the law keep the law that's all right let them keep the law he said we'll build one for elijah and elijah represented not the law but you're representing god's purity his holiness his judgment god i mean excuse me elijah representing god's righteousness for his stern righteousness listen for where the elijah they said to him fifties and he caught fire down out of heaven and burnt them up he must be so we don't want god's judgment we don't want god's law the one i gave you this morning was number 12 that we didn't get i read around and said one goes to church he said i do this he said the other one goes to church it says because of the love in my heart is why i'm there that's the difference in law and grace i hope you follow what i'm trying to say man wanted something to do because he's always wanted something to do with his salvation and he's always wanted some brother i know the lord called me because i never did drink and gamble and smoke like the rest of y'all see if i'd even said that i'd say i doubt that because god don't go along like that grace is god's word revealed works or law there was nothing wrong with the law we're going to get to that it was spiritual but it was the way man wanted so they didn't get what they wanted they didn't get thy shalt not steal thou shalt not kill come on are you listening read the ten commandments show me one of them commandments is talking about something you do or don't do other than honor your father and your mother or something and remember there is one scripture you better deal with they asked jesus what was the greatest of the commandments there is no commandment it says love god with all your heart your soul your mind that is not one of the ten commandments i'm sorry that was jesus's interpolating or under giving understanding as to what the first commandment was the first commandment is what you'll have no other gods right what is the jesus said was the greatest commandment thou shalt love the lord thy god all my soul mind and being or what it was because john goes one peter go luke goes with another the greatest commandment is to love god for what he done for you and i because if you love him you ain't gonna have no more gods well i need another god another husband another idea or another thought come on brother sorry it took a little bit too long but church i'm trying to point down to where we're at but what they were back there is only signs and wonders examples and thoughts that's why i asked the question do we want law or do we want grace now i want to ask it this way or do we want law and call it grace well natural no we don't want no law we want grace and yet we want bishops and elders and leaders and now restate something i said this morning i hope you'll burn deep in your mind before the law came into existence with moses you already had the atonements being made the sacrifices was taking place there is no unconditional covenant without a sacrifice they were already doing it but they were doing it one at a time when the law came it kind of bundled it over into a group everybody had to take that land and everybody had to kill that lamb right see with man then came priest and high priest which would speak of christ yes but it was trying to tie man to flesh if anybody's ever thought here that brother dale had ever tried to tie you to his flesh or his ways or his thoughts or whatever you sure miss me a whole lot i've tried to get us for salvation for god to speak to you individually not to speak to me for you that's fine but if i speak to you sister gail you got to figure out whether that was god or me so if he speaks to you you don't have to worry about who it was right he speaks to you there's no question i want him to speak to you well yeah we got in the message and we got people see that would just speak the word well i'm gonna try it there ain't no such thing as trying it right it's whether god spoke to you or not and that's why that i do a lot of times i'm sorry because i don't want something built on this man in his ways so i back up a lot of times when god will speak to me about something i don't tell it why because i don't want you coming brother dale did the lord tell anything tell you anything if he does i'll tell you if i think you need it if you don't i'll just pray for you i'll pray that he speaks to you if he can speak to me and tell me your needs why can't he speak to you and tell your needs then it ain't no go-between of a priest or a bishop or something go ahead brother what we got understand i just want you to see jesus christ in your own experience until your soul amen holy jesus that is by yourself you you never knew sweet love and joy your only jesus is that is many of you remember this experience that i'm going to tell years ago we remember wade he started coming back to the lord lord was dealing with him and we'd always we had a little cabin up in the mountains and your regular cell phone would work there but others wouldn't work you know so we cured our cell phone we'd always take it with us in case the kids needed us and stepped a day or two and work and one day i left it out in the car i always carried on my side i was left in the car for some reason that was the day wade thought he was having a heart attack and from every form that he described it looked like it but yet he was trying to get a hold of daddy and mama that's good because he didn't he didn't need that in mama if he just called me i'd have been there to have as quick as i could have drove it wide open getting there right prayed for him all the way but instead he walked outside there at work and he said lord i can't get a hold of mom and daddy he said i guess i need to turn to my real daddy he said no lord help me the lord came on the scene and delivered him see if i'd have got there i could just prayed for him you know well he had enough confidence in my prayers that he'd believed enough confidence in his mom to believe that she'd pray and god would hear but you see sometimes i can't be there all the time i can't be there all the time and you put your thoughts and ideas in the fact that i can just call brother dale at any time and he'll be there i'll try my best to be but i can't do it you better put your confidence in god then we get a hold of one another and we got tripled quadrupled we've got plenty of reasons to believe and excel because we got everybody praying right see i want you to have an experience only jesus go ahead and fortune can't contact nobody else just go to jesus anybody have a need me her sister has been told now that she's to be a mother and we thank you father now we just ask that everything be all right no problem for the baby she wants his prayer claws to be with a contact that we're all praying for her lord we all believe in it we believe you we believe all is well and jesus is your name anybody else that have a need you're dismissed let's pray one for another remember pray for weighting them on their way back tomorrow others that are traveling just remember you're dismissed father just bless everybody give a safe journey on the way home take care of everything lord in jesus that is yeah now you
