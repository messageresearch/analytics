appreciate it appreciate anything for the grace of God just remember these pray one for another brother Luis is he still he was not feeling good Wednesday he's listening in and also he'll know what what it is but he wouldn't feeling good wins - but with all right what we're planning on doing is go back to stage one where we were a while because getting the there's a couple of cases came among us so let's just go back to it go the way we're going on our services okay so we'll go back not win Steve will give you the week there this coming weekend next weekend next Sunday we will do as we've been doing will have the outside parking and for you to listen do and all and then I guess you could have the inside if you want to come inside all right and then ever we'll leave this up here to the Bucs it over maybe 810 people like we were doing to where we won't be at taking the whole thing up you know and we can move about and how the song leaders and the musicians and you know the what do we need to run the service the way we were running we'll go back to that for a little while until things work out because we just don't want to you know we don't want to push anything so it's best to do so if you want to come up here come up you know I mean if you want to come down Stars and come and be in the services next Sunday or you want to outside all right you do our stay at home and watch it on the internet so code that's where we're gonna change this coming next this coming weekend okay everybody understand that Lord willing Wade will be ministering darwins tea you know getting everything we'll get everything scared you back and just run from that away for a while until things work out and we don't know how long or what we can do no I said wait I was asking about brother Louise well I asked about brother Louise how was he doing but I didn't announce it but Wade will be taking wins do not serve is it okay to put him in line there and get everything and then we will like I said we'll bring eight so many up here of what we hadn't run in rotation two people to run a system to fight others down stars others out in the parking lot for everyone and others at home we wave at you and say honey we don't want to do it you know being any problem okay are we settled okay let's go to Ephesians 1 and the Philippians 2 Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace and your love and to us thank you for everything and we pray that you would just bless us without understanding that we may walk in the light of your love forgive our sins as many of what we need and just cover us and let the blood Lord be upon us as a part of the body of Jesus Christ and we believe that Lord you have allowed us to enter into Goshen as the children of Israel had a place to be when everything was going wrong for everybody and and then we were in the people that were in Goshen and we get to be in that to take care of us and just bless and guide and remember the sick among us and just touch each one that's your loving grace be there and Father forgive our sins the leaders by like an understanding in Jesus name you mean seasons 1 we'll just go for verse 3 and 4 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him now chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love now let's go over to Philippians I bring this one because I know this is speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ I know that we understand but yet if the mind that was in him being you all right so now it's speaking of us okay everybody understands me we know it speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ but if that mind be in us that'll make us the same people all right so that's what we want to do first 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now if he thought it not robbery by that mind what are we supposed to do by that same mind yeah but that's just a little bit no it's not a little bit too much it's not far enough ok but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in a fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word know what has been I thought what we been talking on comparing and seeing what predestination is and looking about how that God does things how that he can predestinate things but he has to do it a certain way because if not then he would pre determining it and we know he doesn't predetermine without giving a opportunity all right because he desired that all people be saved all right so he didn't to predetermine so I'll take this one and I'll leave this one he didn't do that it looks like that in a lot of our thoughts and you read from brother Branham and he'll talk about if you was there you'll always be there you never was I will never be there you you've got a to consider but it's true that's what I like to study about what he's saying you know I'd like to get into the thoughts eaters like eternal life you say well I brother Dale I believe I always was eternal well now in God's mind that's what we're dealing with in his mind yes all right Jesus stood as the lamb slain before the foundation of the world but that would have never been made effective or had anything to do with me and you had he not died 2,000 years ago right so then we can't just put it well it's all this way it's all that away that's what I'm trying to get you to see that God does not predestinate are predetermine he except by his foreknowledge all right then see if you put if you understood my thoughts life's there Wednesday if you put predestination first then you're going to have him predetermined he's pre determinate if predestination is first all right so everybody understand that if predestination is first he predetermined it and that's the way it's going to be if he predetermined it but if you approach it by foreknowledge and let it be for knowledge being first then let him predestinate by his foreknowledge for seeing it for solid huh then it can come out to the right place that he can predetermine it you know see that's that's where we we get things in their mind and we we think it's because well I've got this quote I've got this I've got this well that's alright that's that's up to you but it ain't up to me and I'm not going to approach it that way cause they can't approach it from one thing what does the Bible say those who he foreknew he did predestinate night all right now he could predestinate by his foreknowledge and not be a respecter of person okay but now the hard part is to try to get us from the human humanity of life and being what we are to take us back in some way and comprehend the foreknowledge of God and comprehend the mind of God well and see you said well I just read oh you just you just don't make it you don't make it like brother so-and-so well okay brother so-and-so's got his we're preaching and I got my way you know you know I'm not gonna change this because of popularity I never have done it anyway it's always been and I've always taught since I come in the message I've always told the foreknowledge of God comes first then he could predetermine from that and not be a respecter of person I've taught it for 50 years so you couldn't come up and say well I didn't hear you before I never heard you preach like you're preaching now well there's something wrong with what you hear it like it was while ago when I just said brother Lewis and everybody in here thought right now for brother Louise gonna preach Wednesday I didn't say that so you you're the ones that predetermined your thoughts and was having me fixing Wednesday already setup and I didn't say it was good you change code you know all right okay when they listen so then to believe in for knowledge being knowledge before of what will take place then we can see how that God can sit back and look down through time and see that King asked for 15 years get to 15 years after the Prophet had done went and told him at your house in order cuz you're gonna die now we can understand that by foreknowledge you'll never comprehend it by pre determining thing so take everything from foreknowledge yes but I I believe always was well there be a place some of these days you'll get to that place can be made right if you have eternal life today that's why I've always quoted or thought I quoted where the Prophet said he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal but now there's the if if you have it it always was but if you don't have it it wasn't right see then that's that way we get to seeing where it is and to see that to study the self existing God of how that he existed alone and there was a time that he had there was nothing with it because of you going self existing then the word itself self existing he existed alone all right now by existing alone he had thoughts in his mind he had thoughts in his mind he was lonely he was lonely he had attributes within him that he wanted to be brought into view and only by approaching it before knowledge because he bring it to view how could he predestinate mean you'll find quotes if you want to I'll help you hunt him up for if you want to run it wild you'll find quotes that sounds like and read around them and say it he predestinated he sent her to be a senator but if you'll take that right me and you can sit down and talk about it if you take it wrong we there's something wrong with what we're saying if it's according let it be according to his mind he existed totally alone all right there wasn't nobody back there with him there was no I there were no Europeans they wouldn't know they were created and they brought in to Pais about two pies the attributes that God had within him was to bring it forth you better be careful how you bring those things because you hear brother Branham saying the first thing God created was angels and they worshiped him right now what about the next time when he's talking about Genesis 1:26 and 27 then he made God God made man in his own image he made a spirit man before he made us a natural man he made a spirit man before he made an angel come on don't you believe that his own children would be the first to come into being I don't to be enough sense out of it his children would what he was wants to bring into being all right see thins the self-existing God dwelt totally alone there were nothing with him nothing he said well I just can't understand that well I don't say that I do I just believe it because if I'm gonna believe that he was God is God ever was God ever can be garderen then his mind don't operate like ours and he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways all right then what are we talking about see he dwelt alone with his thoughts we'll get to that as we go along to the message part but I want you to hold that thought for knowledge comes first and then that way he can see and predetermined and not be a respecter of person but if predetermined comes first then you have no choice that should be sensible all right what did I just don't get the great revelation you seem to have or what you talking about well there's to listen to what the prophet said well well I heard to probably say there's no heard the prophets say this and I don't know which ones right 99% of the time both of them right in which this mean you messed up and wrong all right because he see us according to what he's trying to explain all right now remember if he's self-existing nobody existed with him we wouldn't little bitty people running around Mormon exist doctrines and things we didn't believe and don't believe in pre existence of souls because if you got pre existence of souls then you'd have pre existence of whatever you pre-existing as right did you did you follow that if you got pre existence from so then you got pre existence or whatever you are you know but I just don't I just you know that's like what is that they do it like this only Napoleon sort of back there you know well be wouldn't the pole in and stay back there I'm trying my best to get you to understand one time that whatever God had in his mind before knew all about it and it's going to come to pass the way before knew it whatever it takes whatever he does it's going to be because and that does not predetermine it and not giving you a choice for knowledge will always give you a choice and God will not override your free moral agency he allows us a choice but see then we take it and that's where we go with it and we run with it yeah but you spend you spent two or three services are talking about how God chose us that's right he chose us howdy juicers in his mind by his foreknowledge solves the problem he saw your choice but if you didn't make a choice and you haven't made a choice then you're not a Christian you must accept what he has said you must accept what he has said and receive eternal life see now you've got it in a line that you can understand the whole Bible and you can see that King getting 15 years well it's like I told you where did it change back there that we want to look at it say well he changed his mind or did say he sent him down or said thus saith the Lord you're gonna die this house in order well you mean it messed it all up just cause God allowed him 15 years to be added he died so where did that change the Word of God he told him he's gonna die he died he just put an extension in the middle allowed him a situation that was to me as I think about it like this I think it was wonderful matter of fact it's the only man in the Bible that I can remember that was given time maybe you can if we do that's all right but he was given time so he was in contact with Garden good enough to get 15 years we were to start looking things like that instead of looking at it trying to figure out Oliver do it alright but now listen pre-existence means existence before all right now if there's any such thing of me and you being in existence before then let's go find us a good Mormon doctrinal Church and start a church with them because that's what they believe with this with that with all up in heaven you've heard me tell it and it's crazy but you know I know it because it's their doctrine everybody was up in heaven everybody the world was up in heaven that's a Mormon doctrine of pre-existence not just a few so everybody was there and he was trying to figure out how to satisfy our Father and by doing that a decision was made Satan had a decision or The Anointed cherub had the decision to save everybody Jesus came up with a decision to save some of them yeah you go find you one talk to him see what their doctor knee is okay look it up on your Wikipedia and get your things look it up find it find out what you're talking about see if I'm right faint come tell me about it see I could Satan come up with a better idea than Jesus that don't make sense that's kind of like arminianism and Calvinism Calvinism so many can be saved not everybody Arminianism everybody can be saved I try to bring out something like that and you you you get all tangled I guess in your mind to try to figure out why didn't the world Utama I'm talking about one time exactly what the Prophet said questions and answers there I was reading it to you the other day he said talking about mankind he said where we spirits in other words back there he said no we wasn't nothing we was only in the mind of God and he said really usually the word figuratively in the mind of God all right sounds a problem well I got this quote where was always back there what was it tell me what was always back there what part of you was back before the world your body listen no we don't believe that what did you spirit what did you so what part of you was back there because then you could talk about pre-existence but if you don't have pre-existence then you can go and that's like I've always said you start this pre determining be careful you might predestinate yourself clean out of existence because there was a time that God dwelt alone do you agree with that all right if he dwelt alone self-existing by himself then they could not be anything there with him yeah but you just don't make me feel good well what do you own the peace I run down your backbone no you want to shout you want to speak in tongues you want to have a good time doing like that and not listening to what the Bible is saying why should it be any argument or thoughts or anything about predestination when your Bible says those he foreknew he did predestinate your prophet I gave it to you over and over and over where he said what predestination looks back to for knowledge for knowledge looks all the way the other one so this shouldn't be well I just don't believe it that way you mean you don't change me okay let me get off of myself we ended up Wednesday night talking about what what is the foreknowledge of God it would be the mind of God or his mind or his being and he dwelt alone with just his thoughts his attributes he had in his mind to be a father he had no children and in his mind to be a healer nothing was sick and all of those attributes within him that he wanted to have displayed right yeah and see like I said there amigo if he dwelt alone then he was lonely come on I got two quotes for you find a prophet where he said to what about Adam he said that's what god looked down so I had him the same as he was he was lonely he was all alone so he created him a helpmeet right where he wouldn't be alone and he said he'll never be alone again I love that so you don't take it out you don't take self-existing out of the dictionary you leave it there that's a self existing now exist with his family now he exists with his family so he doesn't exist alone anymore no matter how bad we look or what we are you know I mean I've had times you know you won't kick the kids right but you know I had never done it yet ain't throw them out the door Oh them you know wait didn't have to be kicked yeah but listen it's not based then upon the way we think it's simple to base it the way the prophets explains it the Bible explains it the prophets explaining what the Bible said that he dwelt alone within his mind in his thinking of what he wanted to be done he had desires not that everybody you know that I picked this and won't pick that he didn't go that way he had his desires to display his attributes and to display those attributes I don't you know I don't get our thinking maybe sorry I don't get our thinking that we look at sickness like some kind of a bad thing and I know it is but you know that but you being sick that means your daddy can display his attribute he had an attribute of being a healer you know if wouldn't know I wouldn't see it he couldn't see we look at being lost come on God knew the Prophet said when he created Adam and Eve that they would fall but he could not make them fall predetermine it or said it or anything he had to give them a choice but if he's God he knew the choice hmm he knew exactly what they would do but you know what that would do that would bring into his attribute that he could display as a healer or a savior who were helping him display his attributes when you're working it look is sickness no the sickness ain't displaying it the sickness is the part that you just did inherit by natural healing is the attribute there's not an attribute of sickness healing is the attribute salvation is the attribute not to being lost as an act that's not an attribute that's just the point that is used to help bring to pice what is supposed to be in don't dwell among us listen so foreknowledge is the fact of God's mind and you could go back into God's mind and see what his desires are he told his disciples in John 15 says I chose you you know ordains you he told Jeremiah Jeremiah 1 I knew you and ordained you to be a prophet before the world ever begun uh-huh where we spirits in no we was in his mind all right let's just read a few of these about his mind where we can can really get into the point okay I want to make sure you follow my point okay they can pull them up and follow him and feel it too with number three which is nothing more than that faith and he saw what he had done he saw much Satan God first begin to think oh my that's when he saw you oh let's see that be number three I don't know excuse me number four number four faith there you go now we got he saw what he had done he's talking about Satan I read it he's coming this one minute he's I'm not Satan he preferred him when he saw what he had done the God first begin to think oh my that's when he saw you that's when he saw me Amen when he began to think he began to think about being a healer he began to think about being a savior he began to think about being a father he began to think about all of these things in his mind in his mind he felt these things over in his thinking now I'm quoting brother Bronco they're all three together mind or any thinking or in his that's his thoughts he says and his thoughts returnable okay the word is thought Express so then as long as it was a thought it wasn't materialized come on Jesus died before the foundation of the world for our sins but as I said while ago if that stayed without him coming 2,000 years we'll go to bring it into materialization or bring it into reality then you're still in your sins you're still lost are you following me so then as long as it was a thought it wasn't materialized it wasn't it couldn't be yet but when God once expressed it it was as good as finished right then oh my that would make a president of Pentecostal shout think of it God before the foundation of the world saw you you wasn't Dyer but you was in his mind he wasn't there where we spirit no we wasn't nothing was in his mind he wasn't dire he saw it there for foreknowledge he could foretell that's really like in this prophecy he goes okay we're number five who is this melchester now those who Hallie tonight eternal life was with him and in him was with him and in him if he had eternal life he was with him in India sure if you have eternal life because it goes this far that way but what does he say what in his thinking okay come on before there whatever was an angel star chariot marina that's an eternal and if you have eternal life you always was not your being here with the shape and formed that the infinite God in other words this thought is mine not your being here if you're gonna put listen to let me just say these things I try to make you think by making a thought or a subject in front of if you're going to go back there as a or so why not just go back as a whole being right I mean if you don't go back as and so once you just go back after everything when all we can't do it well then you keep on dropping them out you kind of like that guy was telling me I used to talk to this brother at work and then he said duh I said well I can see one thing for sure there's not a Trinity good he said you've convinced me of that but he said there's two of them I said well now why don't you just go ahead and do away with one of them you'll come back and talk about what we're talking about there's just one true and living God you don't get it to one if you're gonna get it let's see he had enough knowledge to know that one of them got done away with so we get only how to know okay go ahead in number six which is proving his word eternal life you always was see you have eternal life there's only one form of that of it that's God you were his attribute he thought of you and knows you before the foundation of the world in his mind we wasn't dire as people we wasn't there as identities we wasn't dire as Souls that's kind of like the people of the message you know they say God give you so Satan give you so the Bible said all souls are mine that's what it says I think it's the collating for he's at all shoulder mind well let's just get him out of it do you understand see we say what but we just read the part if you have eternal life if you have eternal after not that eternal life things this into him before the world a man I agree with it but that don't put me back her Jesus has a quoted twice died for the sins of the world before the world come into existence right with he had to come 2,000 years ago in in physical natural happening and paid that price we just still all be sinners so his mind is not the fact of being reality it is to him but it's not to me in you he dwelt alone then it will get to it if we're getting time and we'll get to it on Chrysler ministry then it's mine that comes into being and as it does you see things start coming into being but just remember you better remember what came into being first who knows what could we knows what the Prophet said came into being first you waiting on me don't you there was a time that he existed alone he's by himself but you know there was a time that he came into being and I quote the Prophet God's first creation was himself now if you want to get you mind tangling up into things and get out of this stuff that we think is called revelation get into what the Prophet is saying God existed along so what was his first creation the probably said himself what's he talking about something came into being and what did he say that was he said it was the Sun you want those quotes I'll get to it one these days and for each other his son and who is his son word see we think we get it all figured out in our mind and then something happens then well I could follow that brother but I just can't follow you cut it no one listened go back and read a little bit go to number seven go back up hold it come on we missed that part okay he's talking about people in representation the priest did down no representation right which a little woman had a representation yeah but no representation in heaven see wasn't in God's thinking at all but this woman was now what's he saying the woman was in his thinking what the priest wasn't in his thinking now he thought about the priest right it was necessary for him to think about everything but it's like I keep saying to you everything God thinks of he's not eternal you see if I was just in God's mind if I just Satan The Anointed cherub was in God's mind everybody in the world is in God's mind he said no it wasn't in his mind no they wouldn't in his thinking so what's the thinking about see God thought of a little bride and he knew she'd come in to be huh he knew that but he knew it would take a long time to bring the pies go ahead go to number seven the God who is rich in mercy now if you've got eternal life or not if we have eternal life then we always were I don't mind quoting that that's no problem to me that don't put me back before the world except in God's mind or as a part of him because if I have eternal life now I'm a part of him I'm a child of him I'm a part of God by the new birth right come on then if we have eternal life then we always work because there's only one form of eternal life we always would the reason we were because we are a part of God oh and God is the only thing that's eternal man keep going just follow that orange marker yellow now we are part of God you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking there was no literal you back there he was in his thinking then you had to come into the world to be you come on but when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there whatever well when he before he ever become material here on earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he knows what your name would be he knowed the color of your hair you know everything the he knowed all about you you know only thing happened is when you be of being listener he he knew it see we couldn't come into the world as born-again believers if we did that would annihilate the Redeemer situation and it would do away with him what book of a brother brother Brad about how close to a brother on center always was eternal will read right back a bugger if you have eternal life then the eternal life you have always was eternal amen but there was a day I didn't have it now there are where the trouble comes in it there was a time I didn't have it I had to receive it same as there was a time Jesus had to come and die on earth to redeem me and you what was before the world didn't redeem you because we never come into a reality or a materialization or a time or did God had to come and give you eternal life yeah but I always was eternal the eternal life that you have always was eternal it's no problem but as I said be careful you're going to predetermine yourself out of existence because if you keep going back that away and backpacks that foreknowledge back into his mind back into the point of him being self existing you went out of existence and may not make no sense to you but if she likes a lot to me yeah but I just feel like I was back there I just feel it and brother Dale when you preach it I just don't get them to you boy well brother so-and-so it's kind of like a nothing's called a names when we went to a service one time and their sister she this brother was a preaching boy he was really going and she was up with him and she was she was running and going and next day I said sister I said oh I don't want to say anything about it but I said you was shouting about what that brothers preaching and he priest alive from when he started the whole message was this alive well I felt good well okay what does that got to do about to work I like to read and I used to it you know I got another minute but I used to love to read old western you know I could get involved with him and riding the horses and going along shooting everybody you know I could do that in my mind you ain't never been that away okay just blaming him okay but listen God's thoughts are eternal the what he thought of is not eternal he thought of Judas he thought of the world he thought her eventually has to become eternal to fulfill the word right are you following me okay let's go ahead let's see forty six paragraph what does it take to make a Christian forty yeah now a word is a thought expressed God had in his mind what to do but when he expressed it it had to become into existence it became it become a reality because it was God's Word Express and there isn't that may you take me to record this morning there isn't enough power and all hell can ever defeat the purpose of God God will do it anyhow that's what I love he's got a group of people sure that are predestinated yes because I for knowledge he knew exactly what we do and he had it waiting on us but he knew there was a lot of people in the world would never receive it he knew that if he didn't he wouldn't God huh come on let's get a little more than will quit listen Eve we have to know God's his own the interpreter what I mean attributes was his thoughts and a word is a thought expressed and then that was in his thinking and when he said let there be and there was let there be in their work and now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking he had thought he had attributes do you think no I won't back up her do you think the only attributes God had was a healer any form like that no his first attribute was to be a father to have a family you think he ain't gonna have that but you know what you explained it to me I want somebody to explain what made him choose you and reject somebody else I want you to explain that to me I've studied it for 50 years I want you to explain what made him do the choosing if we do it the way we think now the way we think we think there was something about us but I'll remind you of one thing in the Bible those that you talk about the predestinated they did have something to do with it could it be that he's looking at me and you could it be he's following her come on it is in that in the next verse in Ephesians where he predestinated us unto adoption if there's not something about the children of God that are wonderful to him why does he want him to act like him and knowing that somebody will do it somebody's going to act like a child of God why can't we start doing it brother till I love the Lord oh that's true but then we study the word and try to get it to the basis that we can take what I'm saying let's get number 10 now in his thinking what he had the whole plan knowing the end from the beginning now what he had the whole plan so God had a plan according to Christ a mystery God revealed a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve then we go to the attributes of healer Savior etc etc and we can see that all of that has been fulfilled his plan and his purpose is here now a group of people that will walk towards that statue of a perfect man and accept what's being done come on because he just expressed it in the words and those words are manifested you followed me may I say it again for you to understand Jesus Christ died before the world but that was only in his mind it was not in reality come on when he come into flesh it became a reality and it became to what would be the Savior the healer the delivery all of that had to wait until that time they come into manifestation so then what were we back there in his mind in his thinking when he thought of the world he thought of me and you but he thought of everybody I don't understand why people can't say that well I tell you what we're something special thing but one thing special about me and you and that's the blood of Jesus Christ the baptism of the holy go through the only thing that's good about me and you and without that we are no good come on keep going what are we never 11 okay remember there's only one form of eternal life an hour even our names in our thoughts were with God before there was a foundation of the world because now we put this eternal now we possess it why because it was factored in his mind before there was a foundation in the world and now we possess and to be that we have to be a part of God come on if you don't get nothing out of the message remember one time the only thing that's worth anything in you is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that makes us a part of God that makes us the children of God we're not children God call we join a church believe a prophet called we do this but we do that we're Christians and part of God because we're born again that is the only thing that can make us a part of God is the new birth yeah glory in that Park let's see the rotis on the side and go ahead a number two oil let's just read a couple throwing it on that you read before then and see if I'm taking it out of tax really are you the predestinated or no no God and we're in the mind of God and his thoughts they these are who are the royal seat are the elect of God are the predestinated for no no God and we're in the mind of God in this house and very plain language the true bride across was in the mind of God eternally that's no problem that don't make me in youth are eternally we're in his mind and his mind is eternal come on you say what button you talking about herself his mind is he turning you he didn't know that senator was gonna die it's - eternal he knew the sinners don't die he knew that there's people that would accept him as their Savior but he knew there's people that would not accept him that doubts eternal and he can add to it or take away that's what I was getting at with the man was asking for 15 years God didn't come down and predetermine this to be come back real race it wife and output another pre determining he told a man you'll die the extended 15 years he died it didn't break the Word of God and it wasn't God changing his mind he just knew he could do that remember the little girl that the Prophet spoke of and he told her she was gonna live and she's she's healed she died the next day he told God said you owe me an answer he said God let him fight it out for about two couple two or three months he said any come and explained since she was supposed to died a year before that I allowed her to live that long now are you gonna say that God changed his mind no he just permitted more time see if we think this thing is a set down stamped if it's set down and stamped walk on the church because we're either saved or loved if we saved we own the way if we lost we could never do nothing about it according to most people's thinking but if you approach it from his mind what is that no sin we had a mind to high view you know thinking about it okay the very plane line was a true Bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season other words came into the world in existence as each member came forth it became expressed and took his place in the body by the new birth thus this bride is the literal spoke word seed right and though she is feminine and designation she's also called the body of Christ it is it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him he said her destiny though he knew what she does came from the same source that one is where people don't like that one you say that and you can just feel that little clean from the same source you realize a but when he turn alive if you have eternal life you have the life of God if you don't have eternal life there's no way to have the life of God come on now is manifesting God in a mini membered body whereas once God was manifested and one number even our Lord Jesus Christ okay let's see what we got okay go ahead I keep trying to get these in or you're thinking about in his thinking remember you and the stature that you are in this morning if you wasn't in his thinking then you're not now I keep explaining it everybody was anything but he's explaining something about you personally you're not now for you there's some part that's in you that's eternal an eternal only belongs to God and then God was his thinking of you sitting right where you are now in his thinking I stood at the pulpit this morning because he's infinite and he knows all things then you were in his thinking at the beginning think about it he had in his mind let me take just a minute then we'll back up and pick up another message probably but according to Christ the mystery of God revealed God had a plan and a purpose he was going to see achieved in the back part of God's mind you know that's something we can't comprehend with the back part of God's mind see the front part is you think with it you got your conscious subconscious etc with the back part of this mind in other words back into him he thought it over he said if I make man they'll fall they ain't that something you think about God you think God ain't got no confidence in us God's got confidence in them maybe it not not be the way we want it because he knew if he made us and gave us a choice that we'd fall yeah but you just don't make it sounds a good coach I was back there and I just feel like back there and I come to it and I come to the message and I've always believed it I was eternal and then I've got the message and I know I am because I'm in the message well praise the Lord I hope you ride let's see God had a plan and a purpose he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a healer he wanted to be a savior these attributes was within him the Prophet said he was lonely so he created and as he started creating that's what I said we take it you take two different quotes there's what I'm calling the masterpiece one on Christ of the mystery of God reveal Christ administer of God reveal right around the lemes it to the basis of holding that eternal life and basing it as his thought and if that thought that he had is eternal huh then you go to another message and it'll look like that he's moving over a little bit he's not leaning over he'll under he's explaining it that's like to me why I dwelt with it so long to get you to think about it Calvinism goes one way our minion is one goes the other way as to what we look like both of them is in the Bible both of them is right but what we think of Calvinism is what makes it wrong what we think of Arminianism is what makes it wrong not what it is it's in the Bible see we should take what the Bible says and on that crisis of history he's looking at the plan and purpose of God he was going to see it displayed and that is to bring into being all of his attributes did that should make us think of what we are tonight or today if we have eternal life we have the very ACTRA beaut of Almighty God living within us the very person of the Lord Jesus Christ lives in you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that that's dwelling within you and I in the new birth always was eternal but there was a time I didn't possess that well I don't understand called is eternal it was eternal I'll quote it again Jesus died for the sins of the world when two thousand years ago but when did he really die for the sins of the world in the reality two thousand years ago we want to make it say what we want it to say make it say what the word says he had a plan and a purpose now listen this is what I like he was going to see it achieved you know what that means that means he had it and it was going to be that sounds like pre determinant it is if you leave it to him and you won't be pre determining me and you had I'm sure love for this body to be predetermined some other way wouldn't you ain't happy with it I don't know where the you are with yours or not I sure don't want to think about this as being something that he predetermined because then my brother would be right when he said if God made me the way I am said he can't condemn me for being a sinner come on you won't touch you want to approach the subject he has a good point he can't judge me if he made me wrong but if he gave me a choice I'm judge my own self he allowed me a sauce I made my choice years ago what did you do but you see I thought I knew what that choice was and I went for five eight ten years thinking that I was saved thinking that I was born again but when I heard that prophet speaking of eternal life the way he spoke of it as being a person I knew right then I didn't have the new birth what do you mean a person is the person of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the person of eternal life coming in living in your soul to bring into manifestation his plan and his purpose he was going to have a bride right it was going to bring it into being right but bringing it into being the right way and then you will not approach it wrong and you'll see that we are the fulfilment of his plan we are making manifest what he's saying but we're the endtime bride come on use this were the endtime bride thank own these things were we back there he said not this being that you are right what follow me not me I wasn't back there as a person as some identity or some thought you'd be surprised like I've always said brother run said these doctrines they come from he said you get this doctor and he said you Church it all the way back you find it dwelling somewhere else and and I remember that that about the Mormon doctrine of pre existence and then I ran into somebody in this message believed in two souls and when I ran into that I said listen to two different people explained God in two souls and both of them explained it's the same one of them was supposed to be a minister in this message but he was explaining it identically as the Mormon doctrine of pre existence he those Devils don't die those doctrines don't die they just moved from one to the other what about it let's stand together think on these things in his mind what he thought of he thought of you the Prophet said being right here now standing in these pews or sitting he thought of that don't you want to be part of that you ever get up over morning then say Lord what do you want me to do today I used to I was an absentee replacement door which meant I run run a different job every day and every morning there at 6 o'clock I'd say Lord or am I going today and I have some interesting talks with a lot of people some very uninterested talks with a lot of people and things like that but that's that was all right I'll tell you one good one there was a a guy I'd said something to him about the Bible and he looked at me and I could see he was mad and I was no he don't talk to you anymore finally he looked over he said Lord just come over and bust you wide grin I said you ain't go and do it I'll just call that bust you in the mouth I see you ain't gonna do it I've seen it busted his bubble you know so he said how do you know I I said cuz you don't know where I'm gonna hit you back or not I said I'm only one knows that so come on you know what I've been good friends I mean it was serious I said come on if he'd come over and hit me in the mouth I hope I would have had enough grace to turn the other side I was just gonna prove a point to them he wouldn't he wouldn't about to do that but you see Christ in you is the hope of glory what was in God's mind is now in reality in the bride of Jesus Christ brought by prophet heaven help us if we think you're a mile before day what about Malachi 4 luke 1730 revelation 10 7 what about like I've always tried to explain what about brother Branham no wonder the man said you've been given more than the prophets well because he was an Old Testament prophet and now don't get me with that doctor and it's over here he he took the word and put it together all the way through but then he was a New Testament prophet to take what Paul and him could take and bring it all the way through and he was a born-again believer for God to be able to speak - he was a whole lot more than just a prophet he's very close to Almighty God I said very close but he wouldn't die when he was a child of God all right listening what do we got [Music] anybody have a need are you in mind Heavenly Father I appreciate [Music] before you ever leave on please [Music] I appreciate sister have a problem Bob we know the blood of Jesus Christ paid to prize it all done there you done it now as many manifest so you just come on the scene with our sister and deliver desire to her heart for her family father we take these crack laws and we give them to her believe in you that whatever she has need of this is taking care of me in Jesus name Amen [Music] for this beer you're covered to me got a problem with her hand they want to operate but we we won't Pierce drive [Music] we thank you for it in Jesus anybody else coming last name what is weird our cover [Music] you're dwelling inside me Holy Spirit you're a calm the basis of believing you were and then whatever our brother has need of it if a finished product and we commit it to you you can send these far clothes then when you're traveling their journeys and the families and time they're in here have your way in Jesus name anybody else before they forgot and everything because he say it the wisdom the ladies family we love Him we thank you in Jesus you blame [Music] before i apprec let me just set this away foreknowledge is back there predetermines out there but I'm right here now you tell me that was the Word of God a foreknowledge all agree we you tell me that that predetermined after the Word of God and I'll agree with you but why not agree that where we're at right here you see if if I don't have my salvation I've gotta go if I don't have my healing I've gotta go well we're not gonna go why don't you stay here to believe it and say by stripes I'm healed [Music] whatever it is say thank you lord why not believe in present tense so now you know yourself what the scripture said when you spoke to Moses he said I am that I am the Prophet said ever-present for eternity so that put him right dark or as motives that standing before the bush I am that I the present tense right now is more valuable than the future or the price to realize what you're doing now but think that before the world God saw this little time God saw this day before the work well I just got up and I come to church well that's good but what about being in the very presence we're in a time part of the very presence of Almighty God living right here that's why I'm happy [Music] what did the Prophet say if I had a choice out of all the times and God said where you want me to live do he says right now right now here we are why not enjoy the day that we have a new choice in it Lord Jesus be with us as we go separate and eat our meals Lord and come back this afternoon your way to minister the word of the Lord we ask you to forgive us of our meaningful problems and help us to understand and let your light in your love be with us and father help us to be able to find ourselves in your mind and then see what your mind said which is your word and then we'll see a manifestation in our lives we love in we thank you in Jesus name you did [Music] your comforts to me all the spirit you are covered do me you need me
