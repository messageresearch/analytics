========================================

man good to have another Sunday good to be here I'm good to have our minister with us here sister Monica black she's uh she's got someone take up her duty so she's coming into what the first time ever all right where you are in the book of Hebrews have a good time in the book of Hebrews let's start with Hebrews chapter three go back to verse one we got down to 14 Thank You this it's a high level book Hebrew it just gives you everything that you need for redemption wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of my profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him can you see that it was faithful to him that appointed him also that Moses was faithful in all his health for this man was accounted worthy of more glory than Moses why because Moses did build the house Moses built and natural temple Jesus Christ came he was the natural temple he was the temple of God I for this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses and as much as he who hath builded the house have more honor than the house for every house is building by some man but he that built all things is God all right and Moses barely was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after in other words what Moses did and all of what goes on in the Old Testament was speaking of a time when the real temple was going the real man was going to show up Moses was very good Moses was the profit motive was annoying Moses wrote the first five books in the Bible Moses was a great man but he went to the grave as this man because Moses couldn't give his life and that life come back into the believer but this man were talking about book the Hebrews that Paul is talking about he's the one that can send his spirit back into you and make you him made manifest yes but Christ as a son over his own house whose house we are yeah there's that word if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of the hope firm to the end verse 7 where for now this is where we got into them last week in the interpolating he's not interpreting he's interpolating interpolated means he's going to add to it to make us understand because it would have been this look read that square for all right let's go always down in verse 12 wherefore take heed brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from believing God if I got that but Paul interpolates and tells you he goes all the way back into the Old Testament and tells you what he's talking about therefore or wherefore comma here's Paul interpolating as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in other words what they provoked God in the wounds in the days of temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do all err in their heart and they have not known my way so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest all right so now let's go back here and go verse 7 and read wherefore with all that in our thought wherefore take heed brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living console that's what happened to the children of Israel they confess with their mouth but they didn't believe in their heart take heed brethren lest there be be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but a short one another daily while it is called today and it's not today that's today well it's called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin and here for we'll stop that last week let's clear that off so we can start somewhere else next time for we are made protective of Christ if as that worthless time that lacks not the Bible studies talking about faith and believing that word if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast into the end thank you 24 says those who endure to the end shall be saved so that's what he's saying that you're going to endure many different things many different trials troubles we talked about last night we'll go through trials and ability tribulation but we haven't been we haven't been in the total persecution yet I was reading this morning in the paper it's kind of funny how you get thinking about stuff and the I'm gonna say it anyway because in the newspaper the Church of Latter day Saints have took a stand against the LGBT lesbian gays and all of those transgender they stick her stance against them and they're getting heat well the mass of this we're getting some real heat because they won't allow same-sex marriage obviously but they have the Methodist once you can bring a gay person in as a priest or our lazy and girl as the priest in the Methodist Church well the other half day so there's fixing to be a vote here coming up enough the middle of April an individual that may split that denomination in half and I'm gonna tell you that spirit is very prevalent because it's just like they said and then they did the Mormon said hey we don't want to be like Sodom and Gomorrah look what happened in Sodom and Gomorrah when they started doing these acts it's where you got all any words from sodomy sodomizing all that come from Sodom they were doing some really weird stuff in Sodom and Gomorrah and God walked them off you're so they're right there even out in the but see what we're having to cover we should not have to cover that as message believers that should be our total stance everybody 100% that we love the people and you know what they always say that we love the people we do but we're not going to be partakers of that right or are supportive that's why I say them online I don't do I won't go to Starbucks Starbucks is owned by totally gay people that said in public they hate Christian right yes so I'll never and you know white Walmart male gay people in there but I don't care it's this day took a stand so as a Christian I'm gonna take a stand you remember want to let happen cuz chick-fil-a will come out with giving sandwiches away and they weren't gonna be open on Sunday cuz they were Christian then Starbucks comes up and says well we don't believe in this Christianity stuff we're gonna you know in other words they're they're stupid is really what they call this week call this week and student people so I'm just not going to support you actually we have a little contention in the Philippines but they love Starbucks there's one on every corner over there so we were going somewhere they said let's go Starbucks this is offset outside yoga you know you won't pick a green card rather that's the best coffee in the world that's good look I'll sit and drink water on the outside and I told him what and they were on the way well okay about 15 look 15 minutes later they found another coffee shop but that's just me that just my conviction on I don't care injuries understand I'm not because my money goes directly to your money will go directly to whatever yeah so whatever their life styling is but but that and talk about our government then we come that persecution if the government passes a law that it's all right to be that then surely church and state should be separated but it won't we know that we know program said church and states them until together and then what they're going to do is is they're gonna demand that you let getting that bends in you Church and let them do whatever our congregation that would be religious persecution in and it was kind of funny the there was a bill in the house don't somebody the other day we were talking about me being a politician and a preacher and a government employee I said y'all can't telling jokes around man see cuz it always involves a politician the preacher or a regular many believe but being a politician I kind of watch things but in in the state this this state session Georgia there was a bill that come forth to give churches the right have sovereignty and of the church being a religious group their sovereign above anything else it didn't pass it almost did so that may tell you something even our conservative government may still be leaning toward letting letting church and state come together but we know it's gonna happen we don't brother Brown said they'll come together as a group and they'll come in and they'll they'll and Bible says it'll take over by flattery so it's not gonna be some highfalutin something they'll just kind of slide something they're not just look says exhort one another daily wise called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin Ghalib umbrella bottom tells us that some people even in the ranks of the message would lean toward that I don't relieve that quote maybe I'll bring it next Sunday we're brother Brown said that they will go into this system thinking that it's better for us to be together then for us to be separate look that's not going to be true right that's not the meet truth that's that's a lot of the devil we are for we are made protectors of Christ yeah we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast into the end there's a lot that's not gonna make it to the end while it is said today if you will hear his voice harden not your heart as in the provocation we just read that up at the top for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses another day two people Joshua Taylor the only two people God had to totally destroy a whole nation of old you know that's kind of that's kind of a paradox God knew that he was gonna bring them two million people out of Egypt knew they were going to turn him down and knew he was gonna have to kill him in the wilderness but anyway he still brought him out you know why because he had to give them a choice they had to make a choice it was their choice when they got out of the wilderness I mean man let these people come out with a mighty hand you're talking about one man even take the two million people which they really didn't fight at all in Egypt nothing daunted all fight for but here we are two million people looking back in a country that was at that time was as big as the United States largest economy in the world Egypt owned everything they had castles palaces they had horsemen by no number and this one man Moses with God totally wipe the whole place out and finally the people's is all ready to leave all right so that's what's happening here we got to see one thing's for sure it wasn't the people that delivered because look he had to take them I had to kill them till they were hurting the whole forty years they just kept and complain murmuring complaint some I'm going to go back to ijen but Josh when Caleb said no were more than able to take this land but with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sent his carcasses fell in the wilderness Josh when Caleb was the only to go ahead and wipe them out why'd that old generation out and bring up that's what the theme of brother Royals anniversary meeting was the Joshua generation which is the group that was raised up to take the people over and I don't think that's what's happening now not saying I'm not saying that the old group that God had to let them die and they were eternally lost no but they're it's just a type here that this mentality of the older generation that that just preaches that brother Brennan was a prophet that's not gonna take us over there's got to be a Joshua generation to come in that has a new way of thinking yes then Joshua being a type of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is what's going to take us over and then and then Caleb being a time with the bride also give me my mountain in other words when he was 80 years old he said he felt just as good at 80 as he did at 40 most of you cannot say that most of them that made a baby yet but we're getting there we're getting there you ain't do this guy's eighty-one this month well happy birthday James birthday swings here Winston Winston to be vp8 so we head that direction but door handle and all that so I'm so what I'm saying is Gandhi didn't have to let the physical people die out but he let the thought and the idea that brother Brian was coming back brother Ron Scott is coming back and do brother rounds this but Ron's is brother runs it that's fine that was ok during the journey but when we getting ready to go over into the promised land Moses I serving is dead right but I'll be with you Joshua just as I was with him so there was a transfer of power there from Moses to Joshua and then from Joshua there with all them people that were 20-year old and under that went over into the Promised Land in that but still and I remember they went to the promised land but they had to fight for every inch of ground to take that they picked up I just went through reading I think I'm in Deuteronomy and somewhere in there it gives them numbers Deuteronomy Joshua he tells that how they were placed in the lamb book well they don't just say they'd walk in and take them they walked in the head fine but I remember those people like Jericho the RAM said when y'all cross the river we were defeated you know that's what we gotta realize this this is Devil's already defeated we've just got to go into the journey but with whom was he agreed forty years excuse me wasn't not with them that had send these carpets fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so they didn't get to enter in even Moses didn't get to enter him was a prophet and he did he did you know remember he didn't speak sanderoff he smote it so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief that's the whole thing we can't enter in done now remember verse four is it's a continuation he's writing a letter to the Hebrews writing the letter of Hebrews says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it because remember Jesus gave us what a rest day arrest time not a day on the side of your son your money but a rest that we here in - come to me all you labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest all right foreign to us was the gospel preached as well as to them but the word preached did not profit them didn't profit Israel did profit them people in Egypt right not being mixed with faith in them that heard it this is my fault Israel I'd almost say the faithless but Israel every time you saw in the Bible Jesus never looked at Israelite and said you have great things he always unbraided them for being weak the Gentiles now every time he walked by Gentiles and I've never found such faith in Israel so what happened this God wanted a people of faith first he was not he did not find faith in Israel they always had to have a sign they'll always have that wonder they always have that's why they've got to have two prophets their dependence is as Moses I'm actually their dependence is Elijah's coming back well when they see that sure it will make their faith rise up but there they're just they gotta have something yeah you know the Jews have always going to have this that's why they got in a wilderness thing you know they didn't look at the miracle of the bread coming down out of heaven yeah they looked at it was just ready so give us some meat God give him for me but he killed them for giving them to me you never throw you know in other words they should have been satisfied with what they had and they didn't have enough faith because what happened to the ten spies beside the two we know Joshua and Caleb which was good but the other ten say what we don't have enough faith to make it over that's basically what they were saying they and say we'll see what to do they went the circumstances manner tall is this their this is that that this is this we can't do it well that wasn't mixed with faith Joshua and Caleb had enough faith I believe to go over right then but they couldn't go over because of the people [Music] for weebly 10 believed do enter into rest so we've entered in and I've sold we've entered into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world it was done before God they store [Music] for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day no brother alcove was this good remember he had seventh-day Adventist sitting in his congregation Joey had to cover this for he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if you shall enter into my rest in other words he stayed in one place that in one place he said this all right seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief in other words God give them a seventh day or a Sabbath to rest they do then rest oh yeah sure writing first they did but not not later on but he's telling them you entered into their own rest because there's a group of people they God's talking about if you'll enter into my rest seven days a week first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying he David today after so long the time as it is said today if you will hear my voice harden not your heart I look for if Jesus had given them rest then when he done afterwards have spoken of another day there's not Jesus wasn't speaking of a day he was says come to me all the labor heavy laden I'll give you rest there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God which is what the new birth that's the rest for the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own words as God did from his in other words like I said last night like I said before my own works I in my body in my spirit realm I do the works of God okay and what they now in my soul my soul is not toiling my soul is at rest yes your soul is at rest by the new birth your soul is totally at rest all right look you cease from your own words that's why because now you're the middleman the the soul is sealed it carries you all the way through the if you have to go by the grave through the resurrection through the body change up into the wedding supper down in the morn him four thousand years you're covered all through that and then at the day of judgment you do not stand in judgment to be judged you stand complete in him so if you're born again see your package here your deal goes all the way it's not a day and it's not something you cease from except for yourself because God rested the seventh day but remember man fell in the seventh day though really God did rest I mean - wait we think you know like like one brother said one time do you think we'll everybody's God rested on seven days my man I'm tired I'm gonna rest this day he went no more time it was when he said let there be all them bigger the stars and all the other stuff he just made a day to stop catch your breath and take off again cuz it doesn't stop the day just keep going to the very next day okay if I got that same way with the Lord he's not rested yeah but he's but we better and you know like sometimes we look at our life when we go man if this is rest I don't well but you remember the pieces on the inside we're down on the inside that piece is there and like I said before we can talk about you know I get you here and it's okay don't get me wrong people talk about what's the twinkling of an eye what's of this and you know question we have questions last night's different ones that to me if I'm born again I'm really all I'm concerned with is getting meat to the body that's it I don't care what we're gonna eat at three and a half years into wedding supper I don't care in a millennium how are we gonna live I really don't and he said well yeah you do well yeah I do but I don't cook I'm resting in here this is at rest I don't have to worry about that you look at people they they they just get real what's gonna be the new CD how can we fit all the people in the world what does it matter god someone is already done don't you think for the foundation world he knew how big the world's gonna be and how many people is gonna be there comedian okay so he made it just exactly the right dimension so he can't change it cuz he turned alright so I don't worry about that I don't know I'm looking toward the voice of the Resurrection you know me I'm that's what I'm gonna looking toward that I can get if we can get on to a place to where the dead come among us then you know our job is done because the thing inside of me like I said that thing is that capsule is gonna carry me all the way the Futurama I don't have to Bill you know we're talking about building something wing him what does it matter doesn't matter you study aboard again no nail that thing down now and yeah but we do know have to know how to get to the light chain so we don't have to pick through some of this stuff not only be picky I mean pick through you know get the things that we need but we've already entered into our rest that's one Paul's trying to tell me we've entered into arrest by the Newburgh not by works he also has seized from his homework so you and I don't ever if we're born again and have to deal with our works our work should be our face expressed but we still are human beings and we do things and do things wrong but not doctrinally by the Newburg you should be able to say amen to the word right let us the labor of therefore lamb and Paul let us labor here in arrest it looks like he's kind of it looks like he's he's let her sleep her doing enter into rest and we do its birth pains like I've been speaking my son you are linked in tonight this afternoon to if I keep you all awake let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief what works your own works will kill you you can work yourself physically to death and you can work yourself mentally today alright somewhere there's got to be a rest for the believer and it's got to be that soul part of you watch on here cuz I love Hebrews 4:12 for the Word of God is quick and powerful let's see what they work quick is living where the Word of God is living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit what was he just talking about he's telling you that your rest is in your soul you got to divide that out because our problem is in our spirit round that's where we wrestled is in that spirit realm of man and sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow that is reflection and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart are the thoughts and intentions of the heart all right neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his side but all things are naked enough know which can't hide anything go but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do little words like see you can't because you can work have your works have your works have your works but something not be riding your heart sing that's for the denominational world and all the other worlds got all backwards there trying to clean the outside person up and we did in the message for a long long time try to clean the outside of it and quit preaching on the new birth we preached on hair and dress and clothes and TVs Christmas trees and this and that and you dress you got to be so much longer this way you can't show your neckline you can't do this that's what we got to come through all right that was our wilderness journey but it's been more than 40 years since our probably so quick with a little bit slower even than the children of Israel hmm neither is there any creature that is not manifest in the south they're all naked seeing then that we have a great high priests now what's Paul he's some Isaac remember everything Paul does he's a scholar he makes his dissertation or his speech and then he puts it in a little big compartment and says this is what I was talking about because what see then we have a great Humphrey flap we're going to be judged by the high priest works not out the children of Israel were judged temporarily in the Old Testament temporarily they were judged by the high priest because if an high priest didn't go in the correct way Israel sins didn't get forgiven but if he did the right thing see same thing with Christ Christ is a high priest this one passed into the heavens and he come back on the dead Pentecost but those priests would go in once a year covered it is real sin so Israel depended on the works of the high priests well we depend on the works of our high priest who is perfect Jesus Christ that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession but we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like us like as we are yet without sin so Jesus Christ was tempted just like we were and and I want you to understand something there's therefore come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need let's go back to Jesus now he came here on earth it wasn't that sin rolled off of him like water off a duck's back because it enter into entered into his brain is his human brain he processed what he saw right I kind of think of a way to bring this I locked you long going I kind of forgot it and that's come back but for we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so the temptation came he was so human that the temptation bother it didn't bother Satan because surely didn't get tempted by God he wasn't done he was tempted by the demons that was around him all right he was tempted in other words there was a decision in his brain he processed when he saw all right now we always say let me see if I can get this right we always say if you ride a bicycle what happens science tells you when you ride a bicycle or you do something repetitive driving a car that the ends of your that the ends of your nerves in your brain come together and they lock and that gives you your memory so you can the receptors keep firing the same way so if you get on a bicycle or a motorcycle or or wait ten years you get over another bicycle you you've already got that in your brain nobody got that what about Jesus he had a human brain yet he was to hold the Holy Ghost you have in your soul today it's the same Holy Ghost that process his thoughts while he was human if I got that he processed those same things the Holy Ghost inside of him processed that because he was without sin he would stop you and I didn't have the Holy Ghost they don't stop we didn't stop it he had the Holy Ghost from the beginning that's why he could stop it but what happened when the Holy Ghost I and I know I don't want to get on the point of God having to learn something but the Bible said that Jesus learned by the things that he suffered and being made perfect I'm not saying the Holy Ghost tonight the Holy Ghost is perfection it's eternal but but it never was a human being like that until Jesus came on earth tell me what he was I mean even when he just stepped melcat so that he just stepped into a body talk to Abraham stepped right out Jesus Christ lived baby life a teenage life a middle-aged life and thirty year going up to thirty years old he lived that life what I'm saying is if he can be touched by the finger my infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin the Holy Ghost he had inside of him did not I'm trying to get this right it's not to be to learn this but remember what I'm saying it trying to try to say is you and I have the new birth today right it's the same Holy Ghost that was in that body called Jesus that's how we can handle things now as human beings it's because the Holy Ghost was a human being at one time and had to process through a human gray matter brain called Jesus had to process this that's why if we drink beer if we cursed we don't do that because what happened did that got burned out and the Holy Ghost comes in when now the problem there is we like the Holy Ghost come in but we still like brother Dale always said he hated beer but he says he got born again I was some part the other day and same thing happened this happens I'll tell you where it's at remember I told you in that motel that I stayed in I opened up the refrigerator and there with Seagram's Jack Daniels something other kind of liquor and beer all in the cabinet it was right there and you go shut the door back you know but now me before I've got one other man made me in a dream you understand what I'm saying but that thought always catches you in comes but what happens is the Holy Ghost that was in Jesus is in you now overcoming the same thing and so I'm trying to say it knows how to overcome it he did that well he's all-knowing no he had to be a human man here be a human mortal man to feel these things touched by the feeling of our infirmities the Holy Ghost inside you feels what Jesus went through when he was on earth and then that it takes care of the things that we do don't make any same thing to me that makes the Holy Ghost more more personal than just this great God up here that that finally sends this one little drop will be turn alive down in your soul and boom you're just eternal know if he learn about things he stuff we're gonna learn by the things we suffer but he's suffered them and learned them first right so being a high priest who want the high priest gets everything first they can be touched by the feeling the line furmity all points tempted so let us therefore come boldly to the throne life can we come boldly to the throne because we have the one sitting on the throne inside us able to protect us through the life that we live to where we lead them back on the Holy Ghost not on the now the old nature we lean toward the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost said this is what you do come this is what happened to me when I was when I was on earth to me that humanizes it makes the Holy Ghost more personal to me instead of just this spot that you know the day I got born again they was just whirling little spot that comes in you know dicks in here and I'm eternal know you still I wished it was that my waist it was that easy right oh it was that easy but it's not Jesus still had to live a life that he suffered all right now he's suffered persecution Thank You temple when he believed cuz look this right here no more they won't stop for every high please taken from among men is ordained for men and the things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin watch this who can have compassion on the aedra how can we have compassion on the ignorant which is the unlearning the people that don't learn because there's something inside of us there's teaching us and all them that are out of the way for the himself also is compassed with infirmity and by reason here of we he ought as for the people so often for himself to offer percent and no man taketh this honor unto himself not everybody to be hungry but he that is called to God as was Aaron in other words God called Aaron to be the high pre-night so also Christ glorified not himself to be made in high priest but he they said unto him that my son today have I begotten thee as he offset also no place that were to priest forever after the order of melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying in tears unto him that was able to save him from death that was hurt and that he feared though he were a son what we was talking about this yet learned the obedience he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey me in other words Paul is summarizing the whole thing he said remember he said the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the joint the Marilyn sold in the spirit and now that that's inside of you you're being made perfect has Christ like I said Christ had me grow in grace and knowledge being made perfect called with God and high priest after the order of Melchizedek and then we read that later on buddy we're gonna stop right here just say something from me so there he were though he were a son yet learned he will be against by the things which he suffered hey this is all talking about Christ though he were a son yet learned he'll be as month into sin and be made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and all them that obey me so in other words it wasn't it it wasn't this one that he wasn't in the tournament he was he currently have you colonel inside a bikini he became the author of our book the author of our humanity than our humanity because remember look you can't understand this guy here they tried the Old Testament they they tried many times but now when God came down into this man and became the son of man a man a man was blood they could walk through life that we see many times going through life and remember when he went to the Garden of Gethsemane he was there was something inside of him that I don't know if it feared death but he said can this cup pass from me he there was something in there that he was going I've never walked this path right here before we know the anointing left him so he couldn't die so he felt he felt more human I guess than any time in his life but yet he was the most God that was God brother Graham said brother Ram said he had overcome on the cross he overcome and Gethsemane right yes lemon is when he overcome because when he said not my will but thy will be done alright so he overcame at Gethsemane and then the cross was a culmination of of him laying it all down and said I I gotta do this in issue Manatee he had to die now the rest of him didn't die but in his humanity hadn't died to release that life that he had though who our son learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect will cover that a little bit more next Sunday question God was Jesus no I didn't suffer no no he suffered in his body in suffer and suffer in his his remember now that his spirit was just what we read back over here in Hebrews one his spirit was the Holy Spirit right if not then we need a no spit then he was just a man spirit no no no no God looks under time the divers manners spake in time past father's by the prophets happened these last days spoken to us by son whom he has appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world alright so he died inside of him was it's told was Almighty God oh yeah in his spirit realm so where was all the confusion in his human part he had a human brain that that had to filter to us what I'm just trying to explain he had that human brain had to filter through the things they had to process things the problem of you and I are the things that we process in our spirit realm is carnal just time to go just a bit listen Jesus did not have a carnal mind he was not born of sex of a woman and a man so there was nothing for him to look back and say I was born he was born right he was the Holy Ghost he was the very God Almighty in human flesh all right but he had a human part of it not to people but he had he was a body he had a brain that had to process all that what I was just saying he processed by the Holy Ghost that's what didn't let him sin because even with the Holy Ghost in our soul we sinned in our favor because we're not like him in that way we're heading toward that because the change will bring us into that but that's the difference in man him I was born with a human nature a carnal nature contrary to God he was not he was gone but he had to process things through that human and by unguided the gray matter do you have in your head he still God had the process 3 that because he was down here in the memory I mean sorry CJ still smelling here and to process that as a human being he processed all dafter a human brain that he'd never done before God he never processed that through a human brain before so he's processing the food human brain but he had at a low because he had the Holy Ghost he was God Almighty because can't separate we gotta go no I don't know [Music]
