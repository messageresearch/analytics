========================================

we didn't use it last week well what they've done is they said it [Music] they said it for somebody to come down here and watch live streaming when they come in during the middle of service in the morning so it really messed the whole thing up for me because they checked it you have to totally change it so we just changed it back so anyway so now we're in romans 8 we've been reading about romans eight we've uh had sermon after sermon preach to us about us but we're going to read it break it down into three stages of adoption because brother dale always says you have to watch peter peter wrote in second peter and to your face virtue your virgin knowledge you know it's ten percent patience these things be in you and abound they make you want to grow up into the statue of a perfect man so now what's paul doing paul's telling you how to do it peter's telling you what to do paul's telling you how to do it this is exactly the if you want a blueprint on adoption this is your blueprint this is your abc all right this is your a a is right here for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage and into fear but you have received the spirit of adoption not adopting the spirit of adoption because you're adopted when you're a baby according to christ in the new birth you're adopted into the family uh the prodigal son was a son he was born in family he was a son so you got to get born again to get in to receive that spirit of adoption you were not born with that spirit right we we had to receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry and abba is father father so we cry daddy daddy we're crying we're babies we're newborn babies like brother we're talking about now newborn babies in christ is right here the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god so that puts you in another community it puts you in another family your family here on earth is good and all that but when jesus stood up one day and said can you forsake father mother sister brother and follow me right um seems hard but still uh you know it's kind of like situations i've told you before you and and no reflection to louise but i'm going to say it anyway but you got people coming in that are unbelievers and then you stay out of church to be with them to me that's not a testimony that's not a that's not a witness because you know what they're watching every move you make that's true you know you see people coming and you know what it's good to see people that you ain't seen a long time but that's that's natural family members that's right but they're watching you jim's dad for years would show up on sunday or saturday night what he may not be doing that intentionally right but inside of him the spirit that motivated him was going if you'll go over there visit them they'll stay gone on sunday and and you know uh wha what kind of testimony do they have no we went to church that's right left her down we tell her daddy said you can go with us or you can be here when we get back a lot of times he'd go to amy's house or a lot of times he'd come to church or a lot of times you waited we got back well you know what he knows now not to show up on sunday and if he does show up on sunday or even wednesday night we're going to be a church and he does come to a wednesday and he'll come with us but see that's a witness we there's got to be a witness we we can't witness uh you know taking vacations no it's fine right but you see people when their family comes in town you know from somewhere else and they're not believers well the first thing they do is doubt church well they're going in there in their mind i know they're going they just really you know that ain't really not that different it's not that different you know we're okay being out on sunday they're okay being out on sunday we no you gotta have a witness you gotta be a witness you gotta be a strong witness how you gonna bring them in this right how you going to bring them in and you'll be gone right how are you going to do that you can't you've got to stay there is a witness of our spirit our spirit that we're the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god now what's he doing here he's showing you that you are a child you're a child of god if you're a child of god you're god's children your god may manifest in another form called a child at that point okay a baby because and if children then airs because you know what i didn't become an heir of the dale fortune when i got 30 or 20. yeah no i got it all when they when they call me by name and give me a give mama a birth certificate yeah right hey y'all right i get it all right so i said she should have never had no more kids with me i could have ever been left for ever it would have been his fun though no it would not know just right it wasn't it'd have been a little it would have been different but if children didn't air so what do you do when you come into the family of god he gives it all to you right but now in in an example point know saying mom and dad had 10 million dollars and they were gonna give me a million dollars they're not going to give me a million dollars when i'm 10. right i it's mine it's mine the whole 10's mine if i didn't have to share it with them other kids the whole but the thing about them but the thing about what god don't see he have 10 million dollars and give you 10 million dollars and then he give the next person 10 million dollars so we're just using it as an example i know we're laughing but we it is an example because when you become a children a child of god you get everything that's right but he doesn't give you a key to the car or he doesn't give you the million dollars until you're you know 18 or whatever more you know whatever more age you are because why you can't handle it that's right you as brother brown says power without character you got the million dollars that's the power that's right that's right but without character you'll do just like the prodigal son does give it to me now and i'm going out and i'm going to squander it same way with god god's not going to guess why it took 60 years to do a work of restoration so that now god can hand it to not children but mature people mature sons and daughters of god not children anymore what did paul say not being children tossed to and fro by everyone the doctrine and the slave of man and the cunning is the kindness of man in the slightest of the devil all right but you were a child when you were born yes you had full you got full rights and benefits and then what did your daddy do he come down in human flesh and he died he died to give you that inheritance because look heirs of god now that was the genesis 1 26 man see the heirs of god is before the foundation of the world if you ever was in the mind of god in the eternal section you always within that eternal section amen all right so there's your heirs of god of god back up here and join heirs with christ now who is christ we know he's anointing one but christ is what human flesh the man in his god in human flesh so what did he do he came down and gave us eternal life but remember what brother brown said join heirs with christ christ said to come here get eternal life in his flesh inherit inherit heirs means you inherited he inherited eternal life in his flesh amen and that's what we're working toward but it's not going to happen when you're a baby because you have problems you fall you know you spill your food pop of god sometimes has to clean up for you clean you up right that's why i like the the scripture that says that godhead can be explained by the things you see just our human life you can explain what god goes to especially if you're a parent you look at the kids and you go i didn't do that to you i didn't make you you know but i give you all these provisions i mean he gives you he gives us the bible he gives us preaching gives us teaching he gives us um elders and people to teach if we'll listen if children then heirs heirs of god what eternal life in our soul and join heirs with christ eternal life here if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together all right so we're coming from from receiving the spirit of adoption to glorification right here in just a few sentences but then paul so graciously tells us what's going on okay for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us in us so what happens is god's going to reveal itself not on paper not in a video right not on the tape [Music] but in us so whatever that is external has got to come in here right because it's got to be revealed in us then what do we do we display it back out from right here this is where we display it back out because what did what did uh let's get on down there for i reckon that's suffering this present time we're not worthy to be compared with the glory shall be revealed enough for the earnest earnest what earnest money the down payment expectation of the creature or the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god all right waiteth waited we've been waiting since adam fell because that's what he said right here for the creature creation was made subject to vanity not willingly the animals didn't fall that's right man fell which took everything else down okay so if the whole creation is waiting on the manifestation of the son of god it's got to start with the person that that fell man fail so we're the highest order so once we're restored they're waiting on us to come to restoration so that everything else can come to restoration right you don't have to go out there and say when we become manifested sons of god you know i'm saying i treat you don't die no more no it's just not gonna die anymore when we go to when we go even to the future we go to the future home we're not gonna have to walk out all the time ago now trey don't you die no animal don't you that no that's all gonna be not even in our vocabulary because the whole creature is going to be restored we'll talk about a look at that this afternoon we've got to talk a little bit more on restoration before we go back to the sun man man brother that we're talking about some things tuesday that we need to bring to light maybe so that we can see truly what we're doing here so the creature was made subject to vanity which in other words fail not willingly that's why the bear looks at you and wants to eat you now the tiger and all that you know that's not willingly but they willingly don't want to do that that first spirit that they got in the garden of eden was not to kill that's right but it was turned to that that's right by the um which made seventh man willing but by a reason of him who has subjected the same in hope in other words adam couldn't do it so there's another man coming a second adam all creation is hoping now listen all creation you say all creation was was looking for something i was thinking about this a couple days ago let me get this right because i want to talk about it this afternoon the whole creation wasn't waiting on jesus to come no the whole creation is not waiting on jesus to come right he's already coming left and he's still fat all right still falling didn't fat didn't fall but it's still falling who's old creation wait no us now it's not us without christ that's right christ came here to make a way for us for this to happen but the whole creation is not waiting on jesus christ in the form that he came in flesh and walked as a son of man that's right everybody okay with that because what happened as soon as jesus left the earth he didn't restore everything that's what we're going to get to this afternoon christ didn't restore everything he said elijah must come and restore all things well that elijah ministries what's going to restore everything sure but jesus said i am the way the truth and life has got to come through him but he's not going to be physically standing here when it's restored now now he will be in the millennium but that's even not restoration that ain't restoration it's still the old seventh day it's still the devil's still alive there's still days and nights and times and seasons and and all that so full restoration only comes in the in the future home that's right that's right so it'll change our mentality a little bit maybe if we and i think if jesus was standing here he wouldn't say now wait a minute what are you forgetting me for no that's not it the whole creation is waiting on a manifestation of the sons of god he was the son of man that's right right okay maybe we'll get into something this afternoon we got to interject a little something before we keep going excuse me for the earnest expectation of the creature or waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god and you say whatever you want to if you say jesus was the son of the son of god or the son of man that says sons that's right so it's going to take a group that's right all right for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope in other words they are looking for something to come even the prophets i've been reading in jeremiah ezekiel nehemiah zachariah all those small you look if you'll read them with a little bit of of open mindedness a little bit i guess and let the lord speak to you they're not talking about israel being restored that's right that natural part is going to happen but you and i have got to be restored first the prophets were all groaning and even even poor bless noah's heart uh noah comes out and he and he preaches to nineveh and and or jonah sorry jonah preaches to nineveh [Music] and they all repent they all turn back jonah goes up on the hill and steps up there and goes good why don't you do that if he goes you're walking why'd you do that why don't you just kill me remember what was jonah you know what i believe god said jonah god said jonah you started this whole thing you didn't do what i said to start with you were running for me i'm just showing you that i'm restoring you and this whole group of people jonah you know jonah really though those prophets had one thing in mind they condemned the people yeah now they wrote a restoration but when they stepped out they would condemn the people that's what jonah did repent yes repent i've been in a well for three days repent but jonah didn't realize what got him to the whale was his problem and god restored him even even though it didn't look like it but i believe he kind of tapped no on john on the shoulder and said you need to you need to think about you because you saved the whole nation or a whole city here i saved the whole nation city through you and now you're sitting up here moaning and groaning and that's what we do you know what yes but see the new birth though takes that away because all the prophets didn't have the new birth so they could condemn and have that fire in their heart like even um elisha well i shouldn't want to kill them she bears i mean kill those children right but he got a little bit in his spirit realm but he didn't have a holy ghost in his soul the anointing was off of him but the anointing was still there to honor what the prophet said and it doesn't show that but in my humanity and in his humanity i believe he really regretted that i don't believe he stood there and watched him meet the kids i believe he probably run off somewhere and cried and begged to god yeah for what had happened okay but see there was nothing to restore him there was nothing to turn him back right so we'll get into that a little bit this afternoon because the creature itself also look shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption that's what we're doing this is corruption we're fighting right now corruption of the body exactly we're not fighting corruption of the soul if you're born again we're fighting corruption in our spirit realm which is going to change our body automatically automatically it's an automatic chain because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption now what is the bondage of corruption death into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know paul knows paul is telling us we know that the whole creation groaneth and travails look at the hurricanes look at the tsunamis look this whole earth this whole earth look at um hawaii lord bless your heart and my humanity i go out for him but you know what this is what it's gotta be judgment's been called and that's the way it's gonna be they want him had much and then the philippines you see but that's the whole creation group god don't have anything to do with that that's right that's right right but you know what he does he does ward off for the people that are here that's right but there's got to be somebody i mean he without us he just wiped the whole earth off so who's he waiting on us he's waiting on himself he's waiting on us look and not only wait oh for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travail it what is travail a woman when she has verses in travail right in pain together until now when you get up in the morning you know that's true there's more pain and more today then you've got a hard acting pain if you some of you younger ones don't have pains in your body yet you've got pains in your spirit around them right got kids you got kids yeah and not only they but ourselves also who's he talking about us the whole creation groaning thing prevails in pain together until now paul looks out and sees the tornadoes he sees the lightning he sees the wind he sees the earthquakes he sees all these things so the bible doesn't leave that alone remember it goes all over the revelations and over into different places says that this you know talks about earthquakes and divers places and and all these other things destroyed by water and all this stuff and not only they but ourselves now he's talking about human the people which have the first fruits of the spirit now what's the first fruits of the spirit the manifestation of the sons of god all right everybody got that yes right because he's got to keep it in continuity he's not talking about something way over there and i'm talking about what he's been doing remember paul when he's writing he keeps his stock of what's above that's right right and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit remember we were talking about last night the sheaf wave that's the same thing listen that was christ being waved over the people but he was being waived over the people that was going to be the first fruits that was going to come all right okay excuse me so i have the dual meaning and see i can read that in a higher level that we are not only have the first fruits of the spirit in our soul you and i have been brought to a complete restoration by the prophet of god in the end time to bring the first fruits of the resurrection because paul didn't receive the first fruits of the resurrection sure he had an ant potential but he was but he couldn't come to a full resurrection a human resurrection let me put it that way because he did everybody's come to a resurrection out of but i'll read it this afternoon brother brown should have out of dead denominations out of darkness we've all been resurrected but this is talking about physical resurrection redemption of our body right and not only today but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves that's why you can take and go back to where that is where the the god with the ink horn goes through the nations in the old testament and marks the people that sigh and cry for the abomination that's done in the city now what wouldn't that be we've grown within ourselves i think sometimes we do get too satisfied with where we live and what we do and our humanity and and uh we take appeal and it makes us feel good please that's just temporary that's right that's just temporary that pill will will wear off but the gospel will never work amen but we have the first fruits of the spirit even we with ourselves grown within ourselves waiting now look here's a point i want to make man i'm doing good today i hope that's right that right but watch this right here waiting we ourselves grow within ourselves paul is saying at this point in time he's waiting now if i may interpolate and put a parenthesis not adding to the word waiting on the last church age yeah because he's not waiting on arenas and martin they're all gone uh we're not waiting on william brown the so you see how you can the onion peel the scripture you can read that scripture we've been reading for years and years and years but one day we've got to read it at a different level we got to read it at a higher level amen telling us that was something i was thinking about the other day i was reading and there was a story in it it started with and even the little our little readers who said you know jane and whatever the boy's name was jane dick and james now if you take dick and jam in spot okay and then you continue with the with the book and you see dick and jane and spot and then you see a baby well now it don't have to spell out what happened in between those years of them growing up and getting together and marrying and having a baby now but there is something that went on in between all that and that's the same thing here there's something going on in between the story the love letter that's right that's been brought to us by the prophet so there's a love letter part in there that we see because right here from from right here when paul wrote this which was almost 2 000 years ago let's just stay close to it say you wrote it in well if i had my bible i'd tell you something he wrote it in say 50 a.d well in and this is what the year 2018 it's almost been 2 000 years he wrote this we've grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption so you know what there's a whole sixth dimension right here waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body now nobody dead or nobody that's passed on can fulfill that you don't adopt you know you hate say it you just don't adopt deadly you're not the children of god now they're going to come under right they're going to come under what we're doing but somebody's got to come to authority to this right here the redemption of our body and you look at this right here and we'll stop we'll cut it off but i don't want to go any further we'll get to another thought watch him watch him get to his thought right here he stops because look he says likewise the spirit also helped with their infirmities he's dropped all the way down here to our everyday living but i want to stay up here for we are saved by hope it's no longer saved by faith no you're saved by hope that's right but hope that is seen it's not hope can you see union birth no just like mary mary hoped she was pregnant she but she believed she was but she had to wait 28 days later to go i got the angel was right i got what i you know because in your mind you you listen in her humanity she didn't we always say be it under me according to that word and she just never had a problem after that no she pondered that thing for 28 days because she's a human she pondered it she wondered but something held like abraham same thing something held abraham abraham said he had to hold he had to have faith he thought but he's like i'm dying i can't i can't do anything you know i cried i messed up abraham said in his humanity but god saw that there was a street there that he was not going to waver from that same way with mary that's why he came to america there was a there was a part of mary that just said being under me according to that word and she went on sure she pondered things in her heart because the bible says she pondered things in her heart for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope i hope we're going to go upstairs and listen to brother dale preach today now i can say that because i'm in my humanity and something may happen before i get up there but if i get up and sit down and see and he begins to speak it's not hope anymore you don't need faith for something you see that's right you have you have faith with something you can't see exactly when i got i got faith that that that my kids are coming back yes it's part hope but when they come here and and materialize in the vision or we step out of the vision into reality you don't have to have faith for them to be here anymore because remember we live we live by faith not by sight but once we get to sight in our journey when we get to sight where we can see what's going on but we can see what's happening we can see that the spirit growing within ourselves that we waited for the adoption to with the redemption our body and we know now that that can happen sure we were well you know i hope no i'm having faith but it's a hope until you see it but once you see it it's not hope for what a man saith why does he hope for it why why do you hope for something you are saying i hope i made it to church today that might have been an hour ago but right now i'm in the reality of it because we'll get into a little something that that brother dale preached years ago and that's what's kind of bringing in before bless you what we're looking for excuse me excuse me again sorry is that even jesus stood on the mountain and that's what kind of sparkman last weekend jesus said tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again this thing a vision this is reality we stepped out of that vision when i preached over in jamaica several years ago a long time ago probably 10 or 12 years ago i preached on the vision that brother brown had in jamaica of the people running up and down the mountains and all that you know well i told them i said look that was the vision brother brown was looking all who prophesied must die but they'll preach that sermon a long time ago even jesus even brother brown because the prophecy is for somebody else it's not for them it's for somebody else brother brown i'm prophesied of a group of people to come it's not for you that's what he's saying in other words you're seeing the vision you're in you're seeing the vision in other words the seals are opening you're seeing the vision but you're not in the reality of it there'll be a real group of people here same way we're here there'll be a there's a real group of people it's going to take a redemption of the body but they keep they prophesied the ones that prophesy even jesus jesus prophesied he ever died when we come to where we fulfill all that prophecy we're living reality we're not prophecy that's right okay same way when jesus said television don't understand man be risen again well that's not a vision anymore it was a vision to peter james and john but that's not a vision anymore it's a reality this is now the reality of what happened on that mountain jesus come to adoption moses and elijah was standing there getting ready to go to israel in the type but what did brother brown say they were talking to jesus about don't remember that his second coming now when is the second coming it's in the bride right now not then so it's not a vision anymore that's right it's come to a reality so when we see that we're in the reality of it it's good to look back sure but all that's what i was thinking about when i was reading all those prophets man they were prophesying prophesy thus saith the lord prophesied this prophet what it wasn't for nobody that was there it was for people that wasn't to come that's what paul's doing he said for we are saved by hope the hope is sin hope that the scene is not hope for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for it what do you hope for if you already got it but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it amen waiting on the manifestation of the sons of god to come to what come into the body of christ then come to the manifestation and then come to the redemption or to understand the redemption of our body now there's no way you can understand that redemption of the body without the steel breaking breaker no way because brother branham did do a work of restoration but that work of restoration was not hair and dress right and coming to church and doing good and being good and even receiving the holy ghost that was all before the work that brother branham did was i will restore those four things now the only time he brought those four things in was during the seals the linox man and eagle and the king's wormhole sure it started eating way back there but this is the manifestation of it this is that was the vision of the prophecy i will restore saith the lord all right because remember even even um peter stood up on the day of pentecost and said this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel well that was after jesus was dead risen went to glory come back into the people now peter's saying this is that this is that this is that this 120-3 this is that that was spoken by joel of the restoration not of just israel but the restoration of all things because remember we read it we'll read it this afternoon matthew and matthew jesus said elijah must come and restore all things that's why the jews now listen that's why i told you many times you know i've told you before the jews are looking for elijah they know elijah's got to come back before christ comes exactly they just miss the third coming and the fourth coming but some of them will get the fifth coming right right but that's what we're looking at here this is not a prophecy anymore then this is the reality we have become sons of god by the new birth we are coming to the manifestation of the sons of god see that even even the manifest manifestation the sons of god happened in the in the uh peter paul james and john they were at the faith of the fathers they were right here now remember brother brown had to come over because all this got wiped off he had to come back and and do a work of restoration but it's what gets kind of it kind of gets a little convoluted can't see it very good if you just don't pay attention but pay attention but luke or leslie were reformation inside of restoration is reformation because remember restoration is not believing that father son holy ghost is three gods full restoration is not believing baptism in the name of father son holy ghost that's not restoration so martin luther kept that caused him to be a reformer right he didn't restore the catholic church he reformed the people out of the catholic church john wesley reformed them into a method called methodist the method of worship right amen but in this is all restoration so you but inside of that come reformation so what brother brown did is when he come when that elijah come to restore all things he's the only one that's going to do that church age messenger born again believer manifested son of god right here in our own time we got all this sermon that's what he needs to do to restore all things is the body change that's full restoration to us now remember the world won't be fully restored until the future home but we've got to go first the whole creature is waiting on you and i for the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the lord's liberty the children of god so we gotta we gotta let god work in the womb of our mind a little bit and and you know bring forth not the child of luther not the child of wesley not the child of pentecost which is fine and good that's part of reference even pentecost was reformation but it's restoration because what did the pentecostal do they spoke in tongues they had the holy ghost that's what they said tones they got the holy ghost you know and that's part of it yes you speak in tongues if you get the holy ghost of speaking tongues just correct but if you don't get the old ghost of speaking tongues the devil can do that's right so you take reformation you understand what i'm saying reformation is not it's part of restoration but it's not full restoration full restoration is back to where we come all the way to where there's well here's another one martin luther he took a purgatory or an eternal hell and he brought it right over in his doctrine that's not restoration he brought father son holy ghost baptism out into his doctrine his age god winked into ignorance because god only remember the box god give him a box that said the just shall live by faith and that's it but all that other stuff that he brought out listen was garbage yeah garbage but it was or let's just say baggage it was baggage that he brought so that's not restoration he reformed the people yes but god was doing a work of restoration because he had to start with the two shoots then the then the stalk then the tassel to get the grain you can't come from this to grain no you god has to work in in science or in continuity with what creation excuse me is everybody okay with that so so you see this afternoon you'll get a little extra there that luther was a reformer [Music] because he brought all that other stuff winning that's not restoration right but it's a part of restoration because that's why you hear brother brown say two different times it was it was starting another reformation it was starting a restoration i will restore the years that the all the palm worm and all that eat what they eat it down all here and then god started restoring through reformation he winked at the ignorance of the people evil john wesley now remember john wesley didn't say well now luther was totally wrong now you're going to believe me no he he what he stepped up on luther's he still kept the judge y'all lived by faith but then he added yes now we gotta live with sanctified life we can't have none of that beard drinking and smoking a pie right listen luther was a german they drink beer like we drink water right all right but look at that's what i said before look at the witness that he gave luther could sit there and drink a beer and smoke talk about god and the people in the catholic church is going what is he doing he's just like us but he wasn't like them that's right there was a part of him that was born again that god winked in his ignorance and said i'm going to start with that but that's not it right because remember the protesting of protestant church that's where the protestant church came from he brought protestantism protesting the catholic church but now remember martin luther didn't protest everything right the catholic church had that's right because he took a lot of it that's what i said that so that's not restoration he restored the just shall live by faith no more penance no more dragging yourself down you know you can't doctor walk on nails you don't have to you know pay for novenia's you don't you just believe god and you live by that faith and that was it and god was please listen god was just pleased with martin luther as he is with us because if he hasn't started that way with martin luther king but god does all right let's go [Music] uh did church pray for my brother before his cancer he got the release last night i beat
