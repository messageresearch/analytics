with us i i got to give luis a hug but i'm gonna give him another hug after after i'm done we sure missed y'all that's right we're gonna read tonight from uh from exodus chapter 21 and and then uh leviticus chapter 25. uh but before we go let's go to the author in prayer oh god we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word lord and we thank you for so many blessings that you've given to us thank you for bringing louise and christine and their family back home safe and sound oh god and for the work that they've done laboring for you and i pray god that you'll give them rest lord jesus help them give give them a little time of rest from their labors lord we've gathered together tonight lord jesus like i was saying lord many have driven for a long way tonight on a wednesday night in the middle of the week and and we haven't come just because we want to just just do some tradition or or check check something off of a list lord but we've come because there's something in our heart that's hungering for you and we need more of you lord jesus yes sir lord i pray god as we look into your word tonight you'll strengthen your people or that you'll edify the ones that are sitting here listening and the ones that maybe are streaming in from all around lord that are listening tonight lord that you'll give them something that'll quicken their faith and make them want to be serve you even more lord than they were doing before lord jesus lord of granted lord that you you'll remember these blessings upon your people tonight we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ amen so exodus chapter 21 verses 1 to uh to 6 says um it says now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them if thou bring if thou by an hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him if his master have given him a wife when she had borne him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be your masters and he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an all and he shall serve him forever so every seven years you could go out free for nothing you didn't have to do nothing but there were some restrictions but then let's go to leviticus chapter 25 verses 8 to 10 and we'll read and thou shalt number seven sabbath so seven of these seven times seven sabbaths of years under the seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be under thee forty and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man under his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family you may be seated the lord is blessing to the reading of the word so i want to take a topic tonight from those scriptures that i just read it's time time to return time to time to go back and you know as you can read there that and the scripture that every man ever every hebrew ever every uh son of abraham there if he was a son of abraham he had a possession that was blocked out that was his and and and it it had that when that uh at that time the of the of the blowing of the shofar at the end of the the seven sabbath years that signified that it was time to go back time to return back to his possession if he had if he had got himself into a bad spot and sold out to well we'll say it's kind of hard to preach from the old testament types and the present day reality but let's let's go over to the present day reality you say you now you you've been sold out to sold out to sin and you've been you've gotten yourself in a rough spot you listen to the lie of the devil and now it's time when you've heard the the shofar blowing you've heard the trumpet of god blowing his time is signifying that it's time to return back to your possession now every seat of abraham has got a possession what we need to do though is to open our eyes to what our possession is you've got a possession you know think about them in the old testament they would be somebody get themselves into a bind and they have to be sold into slavery and they're sitting there working with hoeing in the field and and maybe after after the years have gone by 49 years they began to kind of get maybe their eyes of remembrance had kind of gotten glazed over that they maybe they'd forgotten where that little little plot of land was that was theirs but when that shofar blew it signified it was time to go back now in genesis chapter 15 the lord made a covenant with abraham saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt under the great river the river euphrates and so he gave them he gave them that inheritance abraham and all of his seed now abraham had a natural seed but he had a spiritual seed too he's got a spiritual seed and the spiritual seed is what i'm looking at this afternoon looking at if you've if you've been born of of god if you've got that same life that told abraham come follow me if that same life is living in you then you've got that seed of abraham in you and so that gives you a right to an inheritance just like those that were had a natural they had a natural seed the natural seed of abraham they had their own they had an inheritance in that land now an inheritance if when somebody dies if if your mother and father your grandparents or whatever when they die they they leave you that maybe they'll leave you a bag of money or they'll leave you a house or a car or whatever and maybe you just just kind of imagine you you go to the courthouse and you're sitting there listening to the law you read out the wheel and telling you everything you've got and maybe you didn't know what it was you had but when the lawyer is standing there reading out the wheel you've got a house you've got a money to pay off all your bills you've got money to get you out of the situation you're in then you realize your eyes become open to i i've got an inheritance i i think that's how so many times people are and when they you know somebody that's going to be a christian one day and they're out there in the world and they don't know that god's got all these like the cattle on a thousand hills every all these eternal possessions lined up for them just waiting for the day that one day their eyes will be open to realize what they have access to now i i think i think maybe maybe tonight if we could just look into the scripture and recognize what we have access to you've got access to every spiritual blessing every blessing that god has laid away for you you've got access you've got a right to your healing tonight you've got a right to claim it you've got a right you've got a right to claim the new birth if you're sitting here wondering if god loves you if he still if he still care cares about you you have a right to that because it's a right that's been given to every seed of abraham the seed of abraham has a right to these possessions now now brother brown he laid out as he was preaching about the jubilee he would he would kind of lay it out in in these patterns and it's really difficult to see what he's talking about if you don't look for these patterns another word pattern what you talking about brother i'm talking about the start and the finish now the start here the start of the journey is is these little babies being born and their mothers are crying out and and prophesying as they're being delivered about where they're going to be placed when they get to the promised land now when they got to the promised land didn't happen for a long time they had to go down into egypt and be in bondage and their children many children born but then they came out of egypt and they were positionally placed where those mamas had cried out as they were being born that they were going to be where they were going to be living now so you see there's there's the pattern i want you to think about tonight the pattern is there's a start and a finish the start is when they were born when they were being born something was being cried out and when you were born there was something in the life that was in you god was one day was going to place you positionally place you in the body with the gifts he was going to put you where you needed to be whether that was a minister or a deacon or or a song leader or a help in the church or a housewife at home cooking biscuits and telling her family how to serve god whatever that was going to be one day you were going to grow into a place where god could fill you up because you believed his word so there's a start and a finish now so so brother ram said in a type or a figure we take israel because it's the jubilee time and the church was given a portion which was christ himself that was poured out by the holy spirit and to each heart that would receive it and become sons of god there's your start there's your starting place he said when the baby was born and the mother in labor uttered the voice of this patriarch when the baby was the baby was being born and the mother and labor was uttering the voice of this patriarch and positionally placed him in his place in palestine hundreds of years later hundreds of years later there was going to be a finish where that child would be positionally placed what are you talking about brother bob i'm talking about a capstone i'm talking about being being brought back to a place where you can be adopted i'm talking about where the church the bride can be can return back to where god wanted to be from the before the foundation of the world the thing that was spoken on the day of pentecost that that life that life that god put in the church was for a purpose to bring forth a bride that would actually manifest his same life in this earth now now back in 1957 brother brown said he said when you believe on the lord jesus christ you then have the new birth when you believe on the lord now now think about that this as i preach these things there's a pattern a start and a finish he said you then have the new birth when you believe on the lord jesus christ when you believe on the lord you receive a new thought a new life but it isn't the baptism of the holy ghost boom what what is he talking about he's talking about a start and a finish he's not talking about when when you're born again there's three things that make up that born-again experience you're justified you're sanctified he cleans you out you pack the word in then the life of god comes and quickens that word and brings it to life so it leaps off the pages and now it's living in you and now you are written epistle known and read of all men but that's not the end of the journey he said now see he said you got the new birth when you believe when you believe now when you really believe when god that spirit comes wooing over you and inspects you and finds out that you really do believe and you're actually accepting what the word says that he promised it to you and you believe then you've got the new birth he said it's a gift of god that god gave to you through sovereign grace by accepting the gift that god has given to you he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life has everlasting life that's the new birth you're converted it means you're turned around but the baptism of the holy spirit puts you into the body of christ subject to the gifts for service now now we we can't get that quote out of the box out of the message we must understand it and what what he's talking about is he's talking about the same thing that in that mess if you go back and listen to the message the token he goes all this way and then he says now the true baptism of the holy ghost in other words there's a finish to the thing there's a start and there's a finish he's not saying when you're born again you don't have the holy ghost he's saying when you're born again there's more to it now there's something there's something greater there's something that god wants to bring you to a place where you cross over that river jordan just like the hebrew children when they were coming out of egypt you step across that into the promised land into your inheritance into the place that god where you know you understand what god wants you to see in the word well you understand your place you've been placed positionally he said in the statue of a perfect man he said the holy ghost christ in the person of the holy ghost comes upon you and the true baptism of the holy ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then god lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place in the adoption number three he said now after you're adopted all right after you're adopted you're placed you're placed you're put right where god wants you to be doing what god wants you to do obeying god's word the way that he wants it to be obeyed because he said you're placed then you understand then you understand after the ceremony said and you've been put into the body correctly i believe that when joshua marks those children of israel crossed and they were following the word in lockstep and they saw the water parted and they went and following after him they had an understanding as he began to unfold to them where he wanted them to go be placed do you know the bible even says that where they were supposed to go was put into a seven part book and they looked in that seven part book and they knew what their inheritance was and that's the same thing that the bride is doing today she's looking into the unfolding of the seven thunders and she's recognizing where god wants her to be positionally placed he said we find then when joshua divided the inheritance to the people each person was placed positionally exactly the way these hebrew mothers name those children exactly the way that when they were born that she their mother cried out and said what was going to happen to them our joshua our joshua the holy ghost is placing you into your inheritance our joshua's putting us exactly where we're supposed to be he said the church of god will begin to get into his place and he said that's when the phyllis that's when the philistines begin to back up when they came over the promised land and they knew what they were supposed to do they knew that those walls of jericho were going to come down they wasn't afraid of the ones that were in that land because they knew they recognized that that land that they were walking around on that land was the same land that god had promised to their father that god had promised to abraham if we can look at it that way as we walk through the bible as we walk through these promises these things that we're reading about and preaching about these things have been promised to us and we've heard a message delivered to us today to this day to open up our eyes to the things that have been promised to us that's when the philistines will go to backing up that's when the shorts will go off the hair will grow down faces will be washed cigars will be missing missing he said that's right you'll see when the holy church stands in his power positionally placed the sons of god adopted into the family of god powerful church standing there in his glory what kind of promised land are you talking about brother bob i'm talking about this promised land when you walk over into that promised land and you know where you're supposed to be you know what god has called you to be because the word has been opened up to you and now you understand he said now something somehow or other the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by god there come a year called the jubilee year that's why it's time to return back maybe this morning that you might be wondering what your inheritance is wondering if god still loves you wondering if god still cares for you wondering if god cares enough to heal you and your of your broken body to heal you if like my daughter when i go hobbling around because of my aches and pains she'll say daddy you're malfunctioning we wonder if we wonder if we're supposed to just go around malfunctioning it or not but but there's a promise in god's word there's a promise for healing there's a promise for salvation and a promise for deliverance he said if he was a freeborn and a true blooded israelite no matter who held the possession no matter who held it if it was in the devil's hands if he had lost everything it had to go back to him free it had to go back to him free and he didn't have to pay a thing you don't have to do nothing for this you this this is the greatest this this is an opportunity that it just sells itself all you have to do you think about the opportunity we've been given that you don't have to do nothing for this you don't have to work up nothing you don't have to push a penny with your nose you don't have to go tell a priest all the deep dark secrets that you've done in your life all you got to do is confess you're wrong to god and ask him to forgive you and just believe him just believe what he's done believe what he did on the cross believe what he did for you he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance why because he had a right before the foundation of the world god knew all of his children he knew you before the foundation of the world it doesn't matter if you're walking and sin if you're doing things that you shouldn't be doing if you've been sold out sold out to the devil's life but yet god knew you and that gave you a right that when you heard that gospel trumpet blown something something began to spring up within you i i i believe that i'm free i believe that you whenever you think about the first time you heard the gospel preached and you heard the minister behind the pulpit preaching and you began to wrestle something began to stir in your soul like brother and i'm explaining something began to pulsate within you and you began to realize that i'm free and those chains began to drop off and you begin to lift up weary hands and praise god because he'd done something that no man could do no minister could do no deacon could do but only god alone is the one that can set you free when you believe him because you had a right to it he gave you that right he promised it to you it's written in his word and whosoever will let him come it's a right to you if you believe it it's a god-given right by grace he by grace had inherited it and it would have been given to his fathers and handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost it he must go it must go free admit grace is provided for each individual return to their rightful inheritance we need to understand our rights [Music] romans chapter 9 says neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac and isaac the promise shall all thy seed be called amen that gives us an opportunity because if in isaac all thy seed shall be called and isaac was a type of christ and i'm in christ that gives me access to that same promise the same promise that i'm a seed of if you could really see that it'll change the way that you pray it'll change the way you approach god because you can come with confidence laying before god that i am a seed of abraham why because i believed your word and you've come and vindicated it in my life and quickened your word that i held in my heart and filled me with the holy ghost and that makes me your seed i am the seed of abraham and i've got a right that gives you a token that you can hold every every promise of god and come to him boldly proclaiming i believe what you've spoken i believe it paul said that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed the children of the promise i'm looking at that children of the promise this afternoon jesus said in john chapter 10 the thief cometh not but for but before to steal and to kill and to destroy but he said that ain't why i came he i he said i am come that they might have life and then they might have it more abundantly that's that's that promise that's the promise of the seed of abraham he's he came to he came to bl i i believe that this message that we've heard is a positive message i believe that everything that brother brown preached is something that to pull us up not push us down because he he came not to take something away from us but to give something to us to give us his life to impart his blessings to impart us his promises joshua 1 8 1 9 says have not i commanded thee be strong and have a good courage to be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever thou goest now that was a promise to joshua but i believe we can claim that this morning at joshua 21 he said there failed not all of any good thing which the lord had spoken under the house of israel all came to pass all of it came to pass that's another right that we can claim access to that everything that god has spoken is going to come to pass well all it needs is somebody to believe it all his word is going to come to pass ephesians chapter 2 says for we are his workmanship i'm i'm speaking a positive message this morning this afternoon i'm talking positive we are his workmanship created in christ jesus under good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them and that's that's the right that you have as a seed of abraham that we are his workmanship that god created us for a purpose and what is that purpose to claim your inheritance to have access to the things that god promised to you in romans chapter eight he said for i am persuaded now now this is something to quote to yourself when you get down that you gotta write when you get down and think that god has abandoned you paul said i am persuaded that neither death nor life no angels nor principalities no powers nor things present nor things to come nor height no depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord there is nothing in this this that the devil can do to you nothing in this world nothing your boss can do to you nothing the people at your job can do to you that's going to separate you from the love of god why because you're a seed of abraham you're a seed of abraham not by the flesh but you're the seed of abraham by the promise by that promised son that came that isaac was a type of because christ made a way for you your inheritance is in christ he's the one that made the way your inheritance is in him now let's back up for a second because brother ram said this day this day this is the satan's eden where the god of this evil age will come and sit down right in the tabernacle of the church and and and and he'll make people think that they're free when they're not that they're actually that they're that they're free when they're still a slave now brother braham said in all the days of our life and back in 1959 he said we hear so much today about we are free oh we live in a beautiful america we free we're free now that's that's the american dilemma we think that because we've got an american flag in our yard or we take a picture with an american flag blowing behind us they're saying good good uh uh patriotic songs and stand up at the football game and and say the pledge of allegiance that we're we're free in the sense that brother brown is talking about now now that that that's totally different he said the air is full of it books are wrote of it thousands of them but you are a million miles from being free you're not free don't you be deceived by that america is one of the greatest deceived nations and in more bondage than any place i know of now you think about how how how the devil has flipped that on his head that this america is free in the sense that the women can and and men and everybody can do whatever they want in walmart you go through walmart and you'll see a picture of what freedom has become people are free to do whatever people are free to talk however at my job they'll they use language and things because they're free they're free to do things but yet being in that in that condition they're free but yet they're they're in bondage he said they're worse in bondage than communism could put them in now that's a big statement he said communism can only hurt the body they can only put the body in bondage but when the devil comes in he puts the soul in bondage now you think about that somebody in a communistic concentration camp with eternal life on them would be free while their body is in bondage but somebody in america going through walmart dressed inappropriately dressed the way that the devil wants wants them to dress would be would be a slave now see how the devil flips it around we we think that we're so so great because we're free but yet the devil's got this nation in bondage but there's something there's a there's a gospel trumpet that has sounded to make us truly free he said you might be he said man as a slave america is a bunch of slaves you might be a slave to pride you might walk up and down the streets and go through every store in every fashion that you can see on television and go from store to store trying to buy something you become a slave to it you become a slave to your dressing you become a slave to your money that's the only thing that you think of is to make money grab and put it up here if you do that or you're a slave oh you think about this american system that's got got our got our little sisters thinking that that they that your your goal in life is to put all this max factor and thing on and dress in a certain way but that's slavery that's the slavery of the devil or to have all these men slaving away for money and spending their whole life and money i see people at work that do that some of these maybe they'll be listening in but i'm going to preach it anyway some of the lawyers when i i would leave i would work late nights and sometimes i would leave when i was back in the office i would leave maybe 9 30 at night some nights but the lawyers would still be there because they're slaving away for that money they got to get that money they would spend all their life working for that money but what good is that do you if you don't have eternal life you can be you can be living in a big mansion and living in a nice home but yet be in bondage and the israelites down in egypt they were in bondage they were they had to make bricks without straw they had to listen to their to their master go when i say come when i say arise when i say that taskmaster's whip when i was on their back and that's the same way that the devil has got people in america the devil makes you just do whatever he says to do put that makeup on cut your hair put put put all the this worldly clothes on watch these netflix movies that you ain't supposed to be watching listen to all this music you ain't supposed to be watching and he's got you in bondage when god wants to have somebody that's a prisoner to him somebody that's so sold out to him that he can fill every fiber of your being so that he can show your dreams and show your visions and have a visitation by an angel maybe one night you'll wake up like some of the young people in this church and there'll be an angel standing beside your bed standing there that's what god wants you to do he wants somebody that can be so sold out to him that you ain't sold out to the world anymore he wants some consecrated people you see the devil will tell you the devil will make you think that you're free when you're really a slave and the devil will tell you everybody is happy the devil will tell you everybody's happy with the way you are that everybody's happy that you're in prison everybody's happy that with the way that you're you got depression or or whatever it is that even god don't love you anymore but there's a way out of servitude that god give us you know what that way is and and down in egypt when moses he put a he put a bronze serpent around that pole around his shepherd's staff and he said whoever will look at this will be free from from that what the devil has laid on you you start thinking i can't break break free of consuming things i shouldn't do what you need to do is look to jesus because he's the way you think i can't break free of this this pornographic devil look looking at all the things you ain't supposed to look at on you can't you can't break free of alcoholism now what's gotten into the young people is they start vaping and stuff and they get all that vape stuff and the devil will get you to a place where you think you can't break free of it but if you'll look to jesus you'll be able to break free listen i ain't beating on people this morning i'm trying to lift you up from the place that you are i'm preaching the gospel of deliverance there is a shofar that's been blown that there's a trumpet that's been blown you think i can't break free but if you look at jesus he's the one that already paid the price so that you could break free if you look at the cross where jesus shed his blood for you look at the stripes that he where he bore for our si our sorrows and our iniquities that's what the gospel message is to do is to bring liberty to you to bring liberty to you to bring you back to a knowledge that you have an inheritance and what is your inheritance it's eternal life your inheritance is jesus christ your inheritance is every promise that we've read about in the scripture in first peter chapter one it says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you amen you've got inheritance reserved and all you got to do is like those children of israel when moses took up that staff and and put and twisted that bronze serpent around it as a symbol of sin already judged all you got to do is look to jesus look and live because god wants you to be he wants you to have a sound mind he don't want you to go through life with the devil pop popping your head with all them ideas and things that you you can't even hardly think straight you know you get you get into a place of of demonic depression or something and you've got thoughts constantly running through your mind where you can't even think straight the devil don't want you to live in that condition he wants to transform your mind change your mind so that you can think right and do right and heal your body and give you peace in the time of trouble and comfort in the valley of the shadow of death and lift you up from that from that spot of depression you think you think about when caleb there's only two that came out of came out of egypt joshua and caleb and and each of those two individuals they they type different kinds of people joshua type somebody that had a message and caleb types somebody that will sit there and listen to the message so if you're ever wondering you know what what what what am i supposed to be doing you know so many times we like to type things as a minister if you're not a minister then well sorry you don't have any types no you got a type in caleb caleb was somebody that when when he went over there he had heard that he had an inheritance and joshua told him you go take that mountain over there that mountain is yours and caleb said even though he was 80 years old or whatever he said give me my sword i'm gonna go take that mountain from the giants and so god you know god god wants somebody that'll face the giants he'll want he wants somebody to stand up to the giants and say he wants somebody that'll be identified with somebody like caleb even though you even though maybe you're old in body and weak and frail in your body but yet you'll take up the sword of the word and say i'm going after the devil i'm not standing here i'm not standing here defeated but i'm going to take god's promises and i'm going to believe that the inheritance that joshua told me i had i believe that i'm going to go take that and he did he did he took it just like david took his inheritance he did it he took it just like you ruth got her inheritance somebody a little mole bodies didn't even have an inheritance but yet she got grafted in because she had a she had a kinsmen redeemer somebody that would that would marry her and take her in now he said brother brown said let me skip over that quote i'm trying to i'm trying to keep hurrying never mind i'm gonna read it anyway [Laughter] he said he said in jubilee year in 1954 he said in our country and everywhere else men and women have sold themselves out to sin drinking gambling corrosion doing things that they ought not to do and become slaves to the devil he said i met a young lady here not long ago she said brother branham i'll give you anything if i could only break this bon band of whiskey she said i started when i was a little girl went with a boy that drank we started mixing drinks and i become a perfect slave to it if i don't have it she says i just go wild if i could only get rid of this you know the devil that's how the devil does people he'll he'll get you in a fix where you think you can't you can't get rid of it and brother and you can't he said i said you can't do it yourself but i know someone who can break it for you the lord jesus christ has come to make you free maybe maybe let that sink into your mind tonight that if you if you're in a predicament if you're if you're in a where the devil's just just constantly coming by and accusing you of all the things that you've done you can't get out of that predicament yourself you know you it's like it's like if the house is falling down and you you keep coming by and coming by the house and you say i'm going to paint this house and you just keep painting it but yet the shutters are falling off and i'm going to paint it and make it look real nice that's what the pharisees did and jesus christ told them that they were they had dead men's bone they were like a white-washed sepulchre with that painted on the outside but on the inside it was it was decaying flesh dead dead on the inside so you can try to paint it up on the outside and come to church and make it look real nice and everything but you you can't do it on your own you can try to if the house is falling down you can keep trying to prop it up with blocks and prop it up you know put another you ever seen one of them old old trailers you know that's got all that like a stack of rocks underneath the corners and you're like whoa that doesn't look like a good foundation and you know things start falling apart and you like in your life and you'll try to start putting blocks back to prop it all up and you can try to do that but yet you'll fail every time but you let god get a hold of a life and he'll he'll change it around so that you gotta you're on a real foundation not on the foundation of sinking sand but something that'll stand the test of time right you know what you know what i i what moses moses tried to prop his life up he ended up killing the egyptian he ended up he ended up causing all the egyptian people to lose confidence in him and then he lost all feeling for the freedom of the people and he went out in the wilderness and said well i'm just going to stay out here everything just fell apart because he tried to prop his own life up he tried to fix it all up and do it himself but one day he met the burning bush he met god or that burning bush and and that changed his life so much he was willing to go down into egypt and take over the whole country on the back of a little mule because he met somebody that he met he met the author of our salvation which is why romans chapter 3 says therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin it's not by the law that we're saved but it's by grace and god has given us grace brother adam said the church now is like israel god by his marvelous grace without any organization or anything else he called israel to his health he called them to their inheritance grace furnish them a prophet amen grace give them a pillar of fire grace give them a lamb a sacrificial lamb grace give them power grace give them deliverance grace give them victory grace give them all these things and they danced in the spirit and shouted and praised god about it because it was grace not something that we had done with our own self not something they had done not something we do but grace and god has given us grace to not be a servant but to be a son now exodus chapter 21 says now these are the judgments chapter 21 verses 1 to 7 or actually one to two we'll just read those these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them if thou bind hebrew servant six years he shall shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing and i don't intend to hold you along tonight there were seven years this is called like a little shemitah it was like a little sabbath of the land and every every seven years you could go free for for nothing if you were a slave you couldn't couldn't if you had married a wife you couldn't take her with you while you were in bondage but you could go free and you could go free now you look look at this now it it god god's got the a timeline set out so he's he's marking out time and every seventh every seventh year a message would go out that you could go free for nothing so there's a set time a set time that you can go free there's a set time for the jubilee message to sound there's a set time and what i'm trying to call your attention to now is that we can recognize where we are scripturally by looking in the bible and seeing what time where things fall so we know now that it's it's time to go free because now we've come we've come to that seventh seven the seventh seven times seven is 49. now a man would lose his inheritance that he could not buy it back himself so he would find himself working his servitude until a map to a master until the debt was paid off and he was helpless and under the power of his master and whipped and beaten but there came that set time that he could go free a set time in genesis chapter 17 god told abraham my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time and the next year so there was a set time for that promise to come to pass in first samuel chapter 13 he said he he tarried this is where where saul messed up he didn't tarry seven days he samuel told him to terry seven days according to the set time according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him and that's where saul messed up if you go back he didn't wait for for the time that had been set out he didn't he didn't just wait for god god for samuel to come on the scene in job chapter 14 it says oh that thou would has hide me in the grave job saying that thou that thou just keep me secret until thy wrath be past it thou will disappoint me a set time and remember me so there's a set time that you can go out of the pawn shop now now you think about down through all these seven church ages that they they begin to kind of fall away from the mess of the previous messenger and they begin to kind of go out and weird ideas will begin to come up and strange things and then the message there will be a set time for a message to come on the scene and and irenaeus will come on the scene and straighten everything up and there'll be a set time for you to go free you can go for it not all the way though you could go free but not not all the way there's but there's a set time go down all these all these seven church ages columba would preach his message and then luther as you're coming out of the dark age luther would preach his message there was a set time that you could come out of that dark age idea where you were justified because you belonged to the roman catholic church and you paid a priest and john wesley would preach his message of sanctification because it was a set time that was a set time appointed and you keep building moving on up until now we're coming we're coming up to a set time where we don't go free partially but we're turned back to our inheritance return back to return back you're fully paid the way is fully paid out of the pawn shop i gotta skip through some of these news and and ever every time every time the message will go out they're hearing they're hearing the sound of freedom what's the sound of freedom when the gospel is preached the gospel preached to bring you to to break you out of that veil that the devil's got over your eyes that it can't be done that it's not possible that that that it's just not going to work out but the sound of freedom is isaiah chapter 53 that says surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed and we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid him on on him the iniquity of us all and that's the sound of freedom and then you know all the way up until until jesus began to preach you know a a son a son there's a difference between you know brother brown told us he would describe how that you look out in the field and you see everybody working in the field and and you can't tell the difference between a servant and a son everybody looks the same but when that trumpet began to be sounded then the sun could go free now see there's a difference between a server a servant is going to get their reward a servant's got their reward as jesus taught us and in matthew chapter six he said therefore when they'll do us thou in alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they might have glory of me and verily i say unto you they have their reward so they've got their reward but a son has a reward of being able to return back to it as inheritance a servant now a servant who was a servant a servant is somebody that's just just a hypocrite they they come to church and they say well i burn a candle every night or or i'm an american but yet they're they're as in bondage as anybody you ever saw or i i stand for the pledge of allegiance or my well my parents are message believers whether you're a servant but god wants to god wants you to not be a servant not just to be coming to church and just kind of going through the motions but he wants to or putting you putting your money in the offering plate or doing the things that that it looks like a christian does or trying to whitewash things on the outside but he wants you to be a son you know that's why paul said in galatians chapter 4 he said wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ and in hebrews chapter 9 he said how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and dead works is what a servant does when a servant comes into the house of god they're just they're they're holding and they're they're doing things like like it looks like somebody does but he wants to purge your conscience from those dead works so that it's alive in you so that it's living in you not just something that you're doing because you think that the minister is going to give you a pat on the back or you won't be in trouble with the deacon but to to actually serve a living god and that's what a real that's what a real seed of abraham is going to do now he said the seed the heathen slave could not return back to his inheritance because he didn't know nothing about it see why understanding is so important when the gospel goes forth it opens up your understanding and he said a heathen means an unbeliever an unbeliever in the word they don't know what you're talking about they want to call you a holy roller they want to call you like they did their forefathers 50 years in louisiana crazy they want to call you crazy or like like paul in the ways of heresy that's the way i worship the god of our fathers pointing at paul saying you isn't that how preaching is sometimes it looks like you're a little bit crazy spitting and slobbering and jumping around and hopping up and down and some some preachers run up and down the aisles and all of those kind of things and the way and the way that uh of heresy they called it he said see the heathen don't know nothing about it though he professes to be something but yet a heathen is an unbeliever an unbeliever in god's word that makes him a heathen and you think about that now a heathen and a real son of god could be working in the field side by side and you wouldn't know it because one one is an outward manifestation but one the other has got something on the inside something that's real and brother adam said before if i want to if i wanted to be a real human if i wanted before i could be a human i had to be i had before i could walk like a human before i could talk like a human i had to be born to human now and now in order to be a son of god but if you want to be a son of god you got to do the same thing to be a human you got to be born a human to be a son of god you got to be born a son of god ain't that a beautiful way to express that if you wanted to be a monkey you'd be born a monkey if you want to be a parrot you'd be born a pair if you want to be a human you'd be born a human but if you want to be a son of god you've got to be born a son of god and if you're born a son of god then you'll walk like a son of god and you'll talk like a son of god and you'll act like a son of god he said then you become christ-like and do the works of christ then you're then you're not funny them people a human acting like a human is not funny a human acting like a human is not funny but then you put a son of god in there and it looks different because the son of god and amongst servants is going to be different amen it makes you it makes what does it do it gives you something that where you can access your inheritance that's right it gives you some what does that mean it gives you it gives you the ability to say well come what may come what may i'm going to believe god's word i can because i can identify myself back with the word like ruth and like the example i was given earlier ruth didn't possess an inheritance she didn't have an inheritance but yet she was brought into an inheritance by the work of her redeemer who she trusted in she put all of her confidence in boaz and said throw your garment over me and she put it she put her confidence in what he was going to be able to do and he told her fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest and he took care of the whole redemptive work and she began to realize that she had an inheritance she because she was grafted into that inheritance now now brother ram said in leviticus chapter 25 30 it says that if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled city shall be established forever to him that brought it throughout throughout to brought bald it throughout his generations it shall not go out in the jubilee and and if a man bought property inside of a walled city then he had one year to redeem it that back if he sold it so if you've got if you're in a walled city you can't go out if you're if you're in that walled city you can't go out but we've we've been called out and brother i'm kind of skipping through my notes to make a long story short but he said a kinsmen redeemer could go get somebody somebody that was like you could go get somebody that was in that walled city of all their ideas and all their denominational ideas and all the things that their the devil's got them hemmed in by and go get them and take them out of that walled city and you see we've we've gone outside of that walled city we've gone out into the into the countryside like the the shepherds that could could understand sheep could understand what life is could understand could recognize when the angels could come visit them we've gone outside beyond the camp we've gone outside of man's ideas and man's carnal understanding beyond the walls of organized religion and he said we haven't walled ourselves away from it so far that we got to hear what somebody says instead of what this saith the lord is i can hear what the word of god's got to say about it now is the hour of jubilee now aren't you glad that we've heard a message that's called us out of all those walled walled ideas that after all of the fighting and all the all the bickering and things for years now we've come out to a place where we can sit down and we can really we're at a place where we can receive what god wants us to hear that hear that ram's horn blowing hear that shofar blowing to take us back to our inheritance and brother said come back to your original inheritance to a real holy ghost again he said it's time to rise be sons of god in the name of jesus christ and rise to a place so you can return in this jubilee and hear the sound of the trumpet of the gospel of the word of god if the slaves want to stay in the walled cities let them stay but you're free you're free because god's called you out and you've been anointed you've been anointed to bondage not you've not been anointed to bondage but you've been anointed to liberty now um you think you think back when how daniel felt when he was looking at the end of the bible and into jeremiah's writings and he knew they were fixing to go free they had two more years left i think i think that's two years that they had before they were to turn back to their inheritance and and the angel came and visited him and laid out that plan that would lead up finally to culminating in jesus christ who would return the believers back to their inheritance by filling them with the holy ghost and paying the sin debt now jesus when he preached think think about christ preaching he preached in isaiah's chapter 61 when he began to he opened up the book and he began to read the things that were written about him identifying himself with the scripture and he said the spirit of the lord god is upon me now now let's pause just for a second now up till now the jubilee year was was always represented by the blowing of a shofar blowing of a horn so whenever whenever you wanted to go free you'd have to wait for that horn to be blown but now when jesus opens up the book of isaiah he he changes things a little bit he changes it from waiting for a ram's horn to be blown now let's see what he identifies it with he said the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek to preach he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives now he's reading from isaiah but what's isaiah talking about he's talking about the jubilee year that the brokenhearted and the captive can go free that they've got liberty and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourning and of course he stopped he stopped right there before he got to the day of vengeance to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord but he equated that with preaching so now all up until that time you had the blowing of ever ever ever 49 years you'd have somebody blowing blowing the ram's horn to signify that you could go free but now it's changed to preach in the gospel to preach the gospel so jesus is identifying the jubilee with preaching the gospel and when you when the gospel is being preached it signifies it it opens a way for you to go back to what god wanted you to have possession of and brother adam said let's go back to god back to the eagle food back to the leadership of the holy spirit back to the word of god let's go back to the fasting and praying how about that so many so many people today i heard an evangelist preaching about this recently that people have got to a place where they just don't fast and pray anymore because they feel like they don't need it anymore you get to a place where you've got the word piled in and you have a good intellectual understanding of the word and you think well i don't need to pray about what i'm going to preach about i don't need to pray about my family and you're you're getting off track don't don't it's time to go back he said it's time to go back to the fasting and praying he said why the church forgot the street meetings long ago the church forgot it's long nights of prayer have we forgotten that if we're forgotten about really getting desperate with god and getting along with god until something begins something supernatural begins to take place maybe that's why sometimes we don't see god move the way that we want it to see because we need to go back back to back to really having a relationship with god instead of just just learning about some things he said why they can't pray 15 minutes no more oh my when it does it's some little formal thing and half of them fall asleep why it's a disgrace he said today god can send a preacher and hammer that word as hard as he can and we go to sleep get up and walk out he said no wonder you're walled in the church is but it's time to go back go back what to a to a real relationship with god a real hungry yeah i was telling somebody it might have been my wife you know you look look and look around at the way things are and it looks like just spiritually the difference between the way it is now and and 20 30 years ago was just people don't care anymore they got to a place where they just they just don't really care anymore i used to used to the big dilemma was all these doctrinal differences and things where people would kind of fight things out but now you don't even really find people that really care that much about doctrine they just people are leaving the message and they don't they people in the message don't even sitting in church sometimes don't think that seem like they really care that much about about even what's being preached but i think it's time to go back to karen i i think that's what the holy ghost does to you is it it makes you care that's one of the that's one of the biggest evidences i believe is when you see a young boy or girl get the holy ghost they start to care and maybe they'll start that maybe they mess up and fall down and trip and land on their face a lot but yeah yeah you care you you get up and you care you care about the things that you do wrong i think we need god wants to see a church that cares that cares how we act and who cares how we do he wants to care he wants to see us care about whether we're captive or not or where we've really got liberty care enough to care enough to say amen care enough to open our eyes if you know i think sometimes we we care we care enough to drive an hour or some of us an hour and a half to church but yeah when we get there we fall asleep and the devil will put us to sleep and everything i i i want to get everything i can out of church if i'm going to drive an hour and a half if i was going to drive an hour and a half to a ball game and or whatever thing a driver hour after a movie or whatever they do in the world i'd want to get my money's worth and you don't even have to pay for this i want to get i want to get i want to get a blessing if i'm coming to church i want to get a blessing if i need i need something for god we we're all needy [Applause] god wants to set us free it's time to return now now see you those seven years every seven years he it's like a jubilee of the soul each of these seven years the irenaeus would would preach his message and martin would preach his message and and they'd be free the people that were in bondage that didn't know how to get born again he'd preach a message and they'd be born again and every seven years a jubilee a little a little a little midi shemitah was what is called for the soul but i'm going to close in just a few minutes so hang on with me just a little bit longer but in leviticus 25 8 it was something a little bit more now we started off we started out by there's a start and there's finish there's there's you start off by being born again but then there's there's something that god's working you up to and leviticus 25 18 if y'all could pull that back up again i read that when i started thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years under these seven times seven years and the space of the seventh sabbath of years shall be under the forty and nine years so in the 49th year there's going to be something preached there's going to be a message go out in that 49th year to declare declare a a golden jubilee to declare that a a higher level of freedom then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month does that sound familiar to anybody in revelation chapter 10 7 it talks about a message being preached in the day of atonement and what happens on the day of atonement the day of atonement is when that high priest comes forth and makes known to everybody everything's been paid for he comes out and makes himself and our high priest is christ so christ comes out he comes out and declares that everything he he's visible again on the day of atonement and the day of atonement to the 144 thousand the day of atonement to them will be they will recognize that the the the he's the one that they killed the nail scars in his hands and all the things that they did because he's visible among him he's visible in the preaching of the two witnesses what's the day of atonement us the day of atonement to us to us is when he's visible among us in his word and his people again he's being revealed to us because we've heard that jubilee trumpet again and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land into all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family now when you hear that when that trumpet was blown all across the countryside they didn't have to be there and like actually see like you didn't have to go fishing with brother brown you didn't have to be with him and be one of his personal acquaintances all across the land all you had to do was hear that trumpet be blown as long as you heard that and and and jesus we read it in isaiah he's saying the gospel trumpet is when that is the preaching of the gospel when you hear that gospel message preached even though maybe you never sit in one of brother rams campaigns even though maybe you you never saw any of the miracles performed in his in his campaigns but yet you heard that gospel trumpet blown and so you know that you can go free now this this trumpet this trumpet is it's different than than just being born again this trumpet takes you back to your inheritance it takes you back to where you're not wondering if if if you're good enough you're not wondering if this is really going to work you're not wondering wondering if you're really born again or not but it's taking you back to an understanding you're not wondering if you can take a body change you're not wondering if you've got what it takes anymore because you've got an understanding of what it takes to have a body change because the word is restoring you back to an open the full opening of the word you're not wondering if the lord wants to heal me or not you're not wondering if the lord if there's grace enough in this in the scripture for god to heal me but you know brother i'm talking about we need to we need something to take us up to higher heights to higher heights to higher a higher level of understanding in the gospel that is what this golden jubilee trumpet is for to take us back you know many of us have escaped the bondage of the world we've escaped the bondage of the world but yet our soul our souls have been sealed in by a new birth but in our spirit satan's still got us in bondage and our spirit he's still got us in bondage we're we're wondering where we're so tore up by the things we remember and things that things that we're thinking about and the devil come by and and and you see you've got to get you got to get so fortified behind the word just like eve was not eve stepped out from behind that word and as soon as she did the devil was able to slip in there and give her something but if the bride can get so fortified behind the word you've gone back to your inheritance [Music] he said the church was to go on to the full promise the church tonight should be in her splendor of glory she should be waiting for the coming of the lord instead of that she's scattered everywhere wondering which is right is this right is that right i'll join this and go over here and down that oh return brother brown said get away from those things he said when you see the trumpet of god sounding the word of god and god vindicating it was signed in the wonders that he said it would do if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound the chief captain won't vindicate the call for he said in mark 16 all the world you know what a certain sound a certain sound is when it is telling you plainly what you need to do and where you need to go plainly you need to be born again plainly what this jubilee trumpet is for plainly i you know so many times you know look back in your life when you go and you listen to different preachers and things and it would not be plain it would be uncertain it would be uncertain how you're supposed to get born how you're supposed to be born again i believe now we're we're we're at a place now where the gospel can be preached with clarity let me get off that in hebrews 11 he said because we've got something better for us and the sound of freedom the sound of what is the sound of freedom that we've heard the sound of freedom is that you were in him before the foundation of the world the sound of freedom is that there's a mystery in the back part of god's mind and you are that mystery that's what that was what was revealed to us with with this gospel trumpet the sound of freedom is the seven thunders declaring your complete redemption right that's that's what this gospel this golden jubilee is the sound of freedom is is to not be under satan you don't have to be under satan's dominion anymore you know what that's what brother brown said that the jubilee trumpet meant that when the jubilee trumpet sounded it meant that satan is finished satan can't do anything else that's what that goal if you if you're sitting if you're influenced by that by that golden trumpet that's what it means to you it means and the musicians can go ahead and come and we'll close on this it means it means that the bride has received her liberty that she's not battened down with a bunch of crees and dogmas but that she's free to react because she understands her position she knows what god she stepped over jordan into his promises she stepped over into the new corn of the land amen you know when and if you if you remember in second corinthians paul was talking about he said even this unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil should be taken away and he said now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty that's what god wanted us to have he wanted us to have liberty when the veil is taken away and you can see what god wants you to be and to do and how to act and to live and what you have access to you've got liberty amen let's just stand to our feet and just just worship the lord 172 172 in the red one you love him tonight [Music] say it to him [Music] let's worship the lord now he set me free as he set me free he broke the bonds of prison for me i'm glory bound my jesus to seek the dog he set me free [Music] he set me free he rolled upon the prison for me i glory by my jesus [Music] shalt [Music] he set me free yes he set me free [Music] [Applause] [Music] the way to god he said [Music] amen are you glad to be free tonight and if you're not free if there's something pulsating in your soul just moving there's an answer that god has given to us to make you free did you have any announcements to me yeah let's let me just pray and and then i'll turn it over to brother wade lord god we're just so grateful lord god for the liberty that you've given unto us lord jesus lord i pray lord that you'll just anoint your people tonight lord god i believe that lord things things have been said lord surely that'll edify your people lord and just help them along life's road lord and i pray tonight lord as you just move upon your people whatever chain that every spirit of ungodliness would be broken lord jesus said you'll just release your people from everything that might be hindering them lord along life's road be with them lord god and just bless them lord
