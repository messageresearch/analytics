all the smiling faces Bob got on plaid looking good buddy lookin good got that what would Paul Bunyan look at that gruff beard and looking good tonight we're going as we preach we're going to pray over these prayer cloths we got something we need to give out to to certain ones and we have another report oh and tell you real quick there's a lady in Dawsonville she's she's actually our best customer she buys honey wholesale and in sales at retail at the fancy flea in the middle of Dawsonville if you ever get up there you'll see our honey up there in the store and she does she does really well with it but anyway her husband came down several months ago with not just cancer but cancer all over his body he his back had been hurting him for a long time and he went to the doctor and Lord he had it in this on his pelvis on his spine in his gym neck all over lungs it hits you soft tissue there in the lungs anyway long story short we've been we've been just not not so much laying hands on praying but but just praying that God as we do business with them that God would bless their business well you know what blessing the business means blessing the blessing the people so we get a report today that she'd get sent June or taxes said she went the her husband went to the doctor and he's only 40-something years old and he went to the doctor and the can't find the cancer on his watch in the spine and on his pelvic bone and somewhere can't even find that cancer and whatever the whatever the mass that was on his spine his dead non cancerous nothing non cancerous right alright and the one that's in his shoulder in his stomach has just a small amount of cancer cells so this guy's I mean in October she was looking at him not making it to Christmas right Thanksgiving Thanksgiving he all he cooked Thanksgiving dinner every year and this year he could not finish it because he felt so bad but God has went and intervened and just by the prayer of doesn't matter you say well I didn't pray yeah you just just pray when you pray for us it's a connection with each one so yeah with all things are possible to them that believe doesn't matter you know you say well they're not believers I've heard of that enough my heavenly days don't get me started the bible does not say if you're a believer like a message believer it says if you'll believe what God said he'll heal you listen folks that healing angel is up there in the hospital right now in Gainesville healing prostitute sinners because God has put forth the healing anointing on everybody your body heals itself every day whether you believe it or not your body is in the healing process but God's up there right now the doctor did their cutting and all that but God had to put all that cells back together so I always when I Drive by hospital I said oh man there's got to be angels there there got to be the healing angels have got to be there to hospital because some of them make it out or some of them don't but you know what that's the prevalence of God we just leave that alone but good to be in the house of the Lord dad said sunday school teachers just do your Sunday School Sunday and then get back up here we'll try to get back up here 10 o'clock and just remember sisters y'all have done a great job downstairs it's already set up and ready to go for the weekend when many people do it doesn't take very long okay so thank God for that also brother Michael Teague just talked to him a few minutes ago he's coming up Saturday and he's looking forward to being with us on Sunday I hadn't been up here no in a while he'd bend a few ministers meetings over the years I don't think he's preached in 10 or 15 years maybe longer so brother Michael teach ones that he's he's a solid one he's one of them like brother Chris and the different ones that we have are friends that are just real solid Christians never been wild in their doctrine and actually they came to church here back in the 70s for a little while when they first come in the message so um just pray for him December 25th no service that's Wednesday January 1st no service January 4th will have youth Bible study all right we're probably gonna start about 3 o'clock this time we tried 2:30 that maybe a little bit too early but we'll start at 3 o'clock brother Nathaniel Greene will be with us brother Joe greens son will be with us during that time to just speak a little bit before we have the Bible study and we will have regular Bible study at 6 from 6 to 8 with the adults and then the next that Sunday will be Youth Sunday and brother Nathaniel will be taking my place not dad's that'll be preaching brother Nathaniel would be speaking for us that Sunday afternoon for the youth and for each all of us that are young in age and young in well anyway spirit yeah there you go and childhood yeah don't go there January the 18th fellowship meeting I know we got a long way to go through but I want to get them all out of the way January the 18th fellowship meeting here 3:30 brother Aaron McGarry from formerly from Dallas Texas but now he lives in Hickory North Carolina he goes to brother bear coffees Church but he will be here that Saturday and that Sunday to speak for us so keep those people in your prayers and pray for them brother Brown says the success of his meetings is prayer of the people not just it you know what he was a prophet but he didn't just walk up and say I'm a prophet y'all don't need to I bring everything I need no he didn't ever say that he needed your prayers just like we all need your prayers that's what we're gonna talk about a little bit about revival but if you got your Bibles turn to the Book of Psalms Psalms 85 so I'm to 85 verse one let's bow our heads and pray to the master the Lord Jesus today we stand up needy people we need healing we need healing of the soul as well as healing of the body Lord some that are lost Lord late they need you father Lord I pray that as we begin this little journey of revival that as the prophet said it's not so much as revving the music up and shouting and speaking in tongues and that's really not a revival revival is to revive what's already in our heart but Lord it also catches the ones that have not had a revival and brings them to the Lord and then they can start the revival the prophet of God said is a revival begins souls are saved because of the pull and many people are healed because of the revival that is upon the people Lord we all need you more than anything we pray tonight that you would be this full speaker that you would be the one that does the revealing father we've been in this journey for a long time some more than others but Lord we know it's coming down to an end to where this thing's going to wind up and it's brother Claude always says the Bible speaks those who endure to the end shall be saved father we pray that we will endure we will endure sound doctrine we will endure the labors of our love we will endure the healing of our body even if even if Lord our body is not healed at the moment Lord we pray that you would continue to let us yield to that healing angel that healing power that's in us it wants to heal us more than we want to be healed father we pray that you just be with us now this season coming up ward is hustle and bustle and all the different things but Lord let us not forget that as Christians you're the reason for every season not just this one we pray that you'd just be with us now season us for this journey in Jesus name we pray amen all right revival part 1 Psalms 85 verse 1 says to the chief musician of some for the son of Korah Lord thou has been favorable into the land now that's brought back the captivity of Jacob thou has forgiven the iniquity of thy people el has covered all their sins see law thou has taken away all thy wrath what feels good done now has turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger turn us O God of our salvation and caused on anger toward us to cease wilt thou be angry with us forever wilt thou draw out that anger to all generations question wilt thou not revive us again that the people may rejoice in thee show us thy mercy O Lord and grant us thy salvation let us go to 2nd chronicles and you be seated after that 2nd chronicles 7:14 what's this if my people which are called by my name now we know this is all Old Testament and it's all speaking to Israel but remember and type it speaking to us we don't do away with the Old Testament just because we're not Jews hey man we're by nature were that we're Jews by nature if my people you're his people aren't you so don't exclude yourself if my people which are called by my name now we know what name to call it's not the middle person of the Trinity we know who we're talking to all right so we need to put that in the bed get it rid of it get out that's done we know who we're talking to which are called by my name shall humble themselves now this is our part and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land now mine eyes shall be open in my ears attend unto the prayer that is made in this place for now have I chosen and sanctified this house not this building this house for I have chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there mrs. Jesus Christ forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually in other words over and over and over again you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now to get started with this I'm not gonna I'm just gonna lay a back ground and thank you all for coming and and sharing the midweek service with us and and I pray that and attendance doesn't mean a lot but it's like dad says he's when he when he starts an important series looks like people don't come to church so I just just try your bet you know what if you'll try I'll guarantee you God will do his part but if you don't do your part he's not obligated to do his Amen so let's try to be humble with this and let's try to keep this and it's not going to be a revival that's going to actually go out beyond these walls it's not a world wide sweeping revival it's a personal revival and you caused it not me not God I'll read you some clothes brother Ram said god don't start revivals man starts revivals mmm so we'll read some of this but I just want to lay a background because we won't be speaking for another we'll be here next Sunday but or the Sunday after but I want to kind of get into a groove in January maybe in and get into this a little bit more because like I said there's 24 2571 quotes I went through that brother Brown talked about revival well some of them are not pertinent what we need but a lot of them are so we're going to read them and I was telling about the Bob just to get you to get your mind in order and I'll bring that quote later on but brother Branham said he said what happened at the turn of the century was because man had not advanced so much in the medical realm that people were dying of cancer the the the death rate in the 1800's in the 1900s I'll bring this later but I want you to think about this the death rate of men men didn't live past about 45 years 45 to 50 and men died of all different things cancers and cancer was just coming up there in the late 1800s and early nineteen hundred's there was no cure there was no cobalt that was not even anything they just said you're gone you're finished well what brother Branham says he said God then heard the people's cry his Christian people that were caught in this trap cried out to God for a deliverance of that disease and diseases so about 1906 God sent the Holy Ghost on the zoo the street to bring back the gifts then there came a little bit further and here comes a man named William Branham and what was his first campaign healing campaign and and the angel told him the first time he met him he said cancer won't even stand in your way so that was in what 19 30 29 30 37 33 33 somewhere in there that he got his commission from the angel whatever day it is but anyway doesn't matter he got his Commission and he told him what he was going to do and it would be a worldwide revival but it would be a healing revival because and here's my point here we are in 2020 we get a tooth had a sore a pimple of that we got the doctor because it hello there's a CVS on every corner almost almost that's you know CVS that's what they did their own Everett their own corners they don't buy down anywhere else they buy own corners cuz they said you got to come to the corner to get your drugs you'll think about that in a minute so so but listen our cabinets are full of medicine listen in the 1800s they had a little bit of opium and a lot of liquor alcohol and that's what they got they they would do surgeries that way with those different things but you understand what I'm saying but so brother Brown said the cry of the people has always brought the revival the crimes of people brought there was no advancement in science back in the eighteen your to see some of the documentaries in in the war and this War Between the States 1860 1865 well if you had a bad limb they just sawed it off or you know they didn't try to save anything cuz they had no advancement but here you come up in the 1900s and here comes this thing called cancer and all these different things and there's they just started to name it but they had no cure for it so the people started crying out then to God because there was no CBS on every corner there was no healing campaign going around anywhere you had Smith Wigglesworth which came up into the 30s 20s and 30s and 40s when he died right there when he died brother Brown comes on the scene so God perpetuates then a worldwide healing campaign through that revival why because the people called for it the people called for that revival of healing you said all it was promised don't you think God no need to put it in the Bible that we would need it he knew we would cry out for it anything you sometimes we wouldn't cry out for things it's what you cry out for all right so let's look at this real quick like I said won't be uh won't be too long tonight let's look at the Hebrew lexicon and see what their saves now look we're Bible has many meanings excuse me I like these now revita us now look when we say that somebody died passed out whatever and we gave them CPR and they revived that's really not the correct word to use because to revive as to you already have life you're just bringing it up watch to live have life remain alive sustain life live prosperously live forever look be quick enough what God tells us through the prophet that the quickening power in the end time is what's going to take us out of here amen be quickened now this is revival so every time I say the word revival I want you to think of these words be alive listen we're not here to revive sinners sinners need a resurrection sinners need a resurrection if you're not born again today you need to be ready to be actually killed and then resurrected not revived to be revived is as you've not been without water for days and no food and it wasn't hurting some of us hey brother Aaron did they just walk in right on cue but but to revive us is okay you waited okay he wait here to what I was saying but to revive us this man you see the guy in the movies you know and he's my too fast Louise sorry he told me to slow down so you see the guy you know and he's about dead and his cheeks roll or lips all cracked up and somebody just takes him puts a little water in you know boy just perks them right up it works in the movies but but that's what we're here to do in this series that we're going to is we're going to what we're gonna give you some cool water maybe you're thirsty you're thirsty for something because look also brother branham and I'll read them later on brother branham calls a revival rain but what does rain do you see the corn I need to cut the crops out in the field and it hasn't rained and they're what they're all been over but man give it about a two-day rank good soaking rain what does it do it revives and that staying straight back up again well that's kind of the way we are we've been in this long journey in and we've seen you know you see people falling away and all these different things but there is a truth there is a revival that will happen that will wake this bride up and take us out of here all right be restored to life and health to continue in life remain alive how many of us wants to remain alive amen I know we're all dead in Christ but I'd like to remain alive because it said the Bible says the live and remains in the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep in other words you're not going to die because listen the people in the grave tonight they don't need to be revived they need to be resurrected I'm talking about the natural part they've already been resurrected in the spiritual part that's why they're gonna come out of the ground because they're connected to that resurrection they died the old person with what we bury them in corruption and we raise them in in corruption a man will never see that that's what just burns in my heart even when we and I and it it's a bad separation when when somebody passes away but you know one thing's for sure they're way better off than we are and they will ever have to die again they'll never have to go it's conquered it's done and over with we're just waiting a time to see them again never to be old again never to be sick never to be have great hair and lose it and all this other stuff amen but to be quickened be alive be restored to life and health I'll tell you something do happened to me a couple weeks ago and I'll give you the testimony later because this testimony and preaching needs to be separate but just to help you a little bit you talk to your body you talk to your body because God said never said he wants you to be sick anywhere in the Bible does that say God wants you to be sick no he knows we're going to be sick but here there's a healing anointing what brother Brown say the right mental attitude to any promise of God will make it come to pass so even the right mental attitude if you start getting the pain here and there sister Anna get a pain somewhere just deny it work your way through it work your way through it you say why that's just the power of positive thinking I kind of like that I don't like to be negative thinking I'm gonna die hallelujah by and by Lenny what that says there's no what that means continue in life so as we go through this revival we know that that it is a to a Christian it's a continual reviving of what we already have and as I prayed before and I read the prophets message he said now revival and I'll read it to you in a minute a revival is not for the center but under the anointing of the revival the center realizes and looks over and says wow I don't have that that's not affecting me like it's affecting this person maybe I need what that person's got so then you do see centers come in and get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and always brother Branham said always a revival it's connected with the healing campaign no we know it's not ever gonna be a worldwide healing campaign and I'm sorry to tell you it's not going to be a worldwide healing campaign it's gonna be an individual thing brother Brown said that won't be a public show so forget about anything that's out there it's gonna be in you and your house and when I say your house I really mean this house but I'm gonna read you a quote where brother BAM said it starts in your natural house all right let's go around here to Hosea let's see when this rabbi supposed to happen we've had revivals all down through time but watch Hosea six verse one says come let us return unto the Lord for he hath porn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us after two days after two thousand years because a thousand years a day a day is a thousand years right after two thousand years will he revive us oh yeah Paul went through a revival Irina's they all went through their revival but this revival that we're going to be in is a bride revival that's going to carry us into a body change it was not going to carry them into that and then after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight so that's what we're heading toward all the signs mm-hmm let's thinking the other day you know there's a lot of prophecy and there's a lot of things that do pertain to us and there's things that don't pertain to us the things that don't pertain to us we need to just let it go cuz I'm not gonna be in a tribulation so I don't need to know what's gonna go on during that time I don't want to know that my skin's gonna fall off my body and the birds are gonna eat meat while I'm alive that's not something I'm gonna be a part of you we got to start thinking right that this is it there's nothing else prophecy is being fulfilled daily daily we are watching Bible prophecy come to light and we're also watching what the prophet of God told us come to light we see that we're living it why because it's the vision Jesus said tell the vision to no one listen we've been in a vision we've been in a vision of what God saw before the foundation of the world we just got to make that vision reality but you know what bride don't get discouraged somebody will make it somebody will fulfill scripture and listen fear not little flock little flock maybe there's too many around it's not become little anymore we're gonna read about two children of Israel right here to N so let's go Kay let's start with the quote number one make a few comments and like I said mm-hmm we finish early we stand around talking nine o'clock anyway but that's okay that's all right cuz we're all family look and now look this is the prayer I want us I want you to I want you to read this as your prayer no I'm taking this from brother branham's the deity of Jesus Christ 1949 then watch and now start a revival in the hearts of the people this morning Lord may this be a renewing time a time when the spirit will be renewed and old father we'd pray it this way come get us by the hand each one of us and walk us down this lane here show to us this great picture that said in order here vision revealing your secrets to the Saints hearts this morning that we might see what's out here just before us now look he's seeing what's before us cuz he knew there was a lot coming we're it we're it I don't see a whole bunch of world wide revival again and bringing a whole bunch of people in and filling the pews up I'm praying that that happens cuz listen if everybody excuse me the wall right here under my feet if every person in that wall comes to the Lord we're gonna have to find a bigger auditorium but you know what are you going to leave them out I'm praying just as well as they come in as anybody else I don't care if it's your child or my child husband wife whatever but listen to this prayer this was 1949 some of you weren't even born daddy was nine years old he's a little kid when this prayer was pray been a long time but watch what he says as we walk down then Lord in the armor of God may we go as gallant soldiers to face the enemy and I think the other day in light of all those things that's been going on you know battle is not pretty a battle is messy a battle is bloody it's man against man I'm talking about a natural it's a battle but even in our spiritual battle there's something that gets wounded there's something that gets killed there's something that gets has to be left behind but it's a battle but it's the same soldiers you're on the same team okay reach and pick that person up bring them with you but look but how can we face them unless we know his tactics now listen for 50 something years we've been learning the tactics of the devil you say brother wait do you think you got him figured out I don't think I have but I think God's already got him figured out and if God's right here inside of me he's gonna help me figure him out amen and he's gonna do it through all of us listen me and brother Dale will the ministers don't have this thing figured out but God does and he said he would speak through us in the end time through preachers and teachers and evangelists and all these different things it helped us this morning to understand and show us his foregrounds there so that we'll know where to meet him for we ask it in Jesus name Amen that's the prayer that you ought to maybe put on your refrigerator if you want to look it up but look he covers everything we need for the journey and like I said before it's been a long journey I've only been privileged to be the last 20 years of it but some of you have been 4050 years I remember when Larry brother Larry had a lot of higher sister Jeanne still got hurt it's just a little different color but we were younger then and you know what you get younger and you think man then everybody thought 1977 and ever thought this and everybody thought that and here we are almost at 2020 just right on the door of it and who would have thought it but we're here for a reason we're not here because God got fooled somewhere down the road he knew this whole thing I think another day you know and I think God you know God's a person right and the devil is too and I think the gun God in the devil has conversations Satan says you seen them do that he said I knew things gonna do it for the foundation of the world but oh no I don't see any more because I hear their voice saying God forgive me of what I just did and then it goes in that sea of forgetfulness and Satan still remembers it and he just clambers for ages and ages and ages and he God says I'll have a clue what you're talking about in that great that you have a God that just goes I don't know all I see is perfection all I see is what the word said about him because you know what he can't do any different than what his word said about us his word says we are perfect we are coming to completion to perfection by what praying and studying this is not a time for us to lay the sword down it's not a time for us to lay the Bible down it's time for more and more I this thing right here has helped me a lot because you know what it reminds this old man to pray especially for his mother she's going through a battle but I believe she's Victoria we've all we all go through battles but every time I turn my hand over and I see that or I shift it I pray because it says look you some of you have won by His stripes I am healed and it doesn't stop there I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord not just I'm going to live and just be alive we're allowed now to declare the works of the Lord you need to remind God why you're here God I'm here because I'm your bride I'm here because you promised in this endtime this is what you'll do for me brother Brahma always said he said God does not mind if you remind him of his promises because you know why because then God looks back and he says you've been studying hattingh you you've been reading what I wrote yeah I think God's got a sense of humor look at some of us are you giggling about number two let's look at this one 1951 the angel of the Lord I'm reading some of these that are a little bit early in his ministry and when we see these crowds gathering that doesn't mean revival that's just the gathering hmm let's don't ever make this place of gathering let's don't ever make this place a gathering we come here to worship God to hear from God I appreciate we have not done it in a lot in the past but when we started with brother Joe and brother Lewis and brother Boyd doing the song leading and the different things they come back in the back and we have prayer to set the tone for the service that's coming we set the tone we don't go in and talk about what the stock market is doing no we go in then we pray fervently that God will anoint the song leader to anoint you and then that anointing will follow me or the preach of this here but I want that to be a connection amen I don't want to be so like Catholicism where the priest is so untouchable to where he's got no he's not infallible I promise you that neither a weak but we do best I can we do the best we can with what we've got at the moment so we preach and we pray that the song leader does the right thing you people that play brothers and sisters that play the music music don't walk up here and have everything in the world on your mind stop for one minute whiny little man and say God let me play for you not for these people let me play this for you so let that sound we'll go out in the congregation and somebody will get anointed what to hear the word come it's a word revival folks it's not I I pray that we have shouting and speaking in tongues some of you would absolutely die if you raised your hands just raise your hands it go it go [Applause] how do you say that in Spanish that's exactly right sound just right I never could wonder how a dog can understand English and then then a dog and that have a spanish-speaking family and the dog does the same thing for them and I don't I don't get it anyway and I can't learn the liquor Spanish though and he learns it just like that and when you see these crowds gathering that doesn't mean revival so look don't look for and I pray that the pews fill up and it plays a few more comments going to fill up a lot more but pray that you have an individual revival that means when you go to work you have a revival when you're driving down the road you have a revival even in your darkest moment you still have a revival that's just a gathering but a revival is when people get really right with God and pray through and starts a revival throughout the city and everything now this is 1951 his revelation came up further he knew it wasn't going to be a worldwide revival in the 60s because it happened right here in the 50s remember the Pentecostals I was looking at one on YouTube the other day and somewhere all was his name an older gentleman some of you may have he was a good preacher at this time but he's calling for a revival in this 1970s a world wide sweeping revival in the 1970s I thought dude it's already happened and you were old enough to have been in it and missed it but brother Brahim said to Pentecostals you've called for this revival and you've called for this revival he said it's here and you already missed it start a revival throughout the city and everything you see they put away sin put away their iniquity that's when I read that first verse their turn to God turn around and start back against thee on the road I challenge you to pray more and study more this next year coming up pray a little more study a little more the Bible says study to show yourself approved not me approve you approve but you know what God if God approves you you won't be deceived you will not be deceived alright number three number three the resurrection of Lazarus 1951 this is right after he preached the angel of the Lord to brother I feel real good about it anyhow what this church needs today is a good revival look not a new doctrine a new order just the stirring of what you already know about listen there should be enough we have in this church and I'm going to crow a little bit because I think I can we have took the major doctrines of this message and have proven to you that they're correct there brother Branham was not false brother random is not wrong he was the prophet that told us was straight from the mind of God I don't care what they say about dates and times I do that doesn't bother me one bit he gave us that word and it opened the book and it opened our eyes so we know where we're at what what's the great thing where we come from what we're doing here and where we're going you gotta know what we're doing here I believe we know where we came from if you're born again you can look back and see that you came from eternity the real you came from eternity didn't come from Samuel and Peggy Dale the real you came from eternity that's who I'm - and if not then it's just a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal right because you didn't come from there that brother Bram said the priest had no representation listen Jesus came to them to the greatest religious order of the day and all they could do was call him belzebub and tell him that he didn't wash his hands for he ate a meal really why does your why does your master eat without washing his hands you see help just what I mean about all this stuff that's going on in the message that's just peripheral things that has no meaning to my salvation whatsoever it's a sign that it's true God give us many signs that he sent us a prophet but them signs not going to save you Jesus turned and looked at him one day and he said you seek after a sign he said you wicked and adulterous generation you seek after a sign and I'm gonna say and add to the word I believe it's right in between the lines and he looked at him and said this sign giver is here not to sign the sign giver the sign giver is who I want I don't want to sign the sign fine give me the giver I wasn't caught up in the cloud waiting for me but I know what happened after that happened that book got open and that Christ that was in that book came into my heart and your heart and showed us an open book if you can't believe that you're living under a closed book and it's not your time you're not in that third day you're not you're still in that 2,000 years of time from church age 1 through 7 we got to be called out of that stirring of what you already know about I wrote down major doctrines listen there was a preacher stood up not too long ago in a church and friend of mine was there and he was preaching and he said we've had enough teaching now we need manifestation totally backwards the boy ain't never been taught part and I know he ain't never senator nobody that was teacher cuz you can't say that you can't say that here we don't need teaching what do you mean we don't need teach him brother I'm said teaching pleases you in the body and when you learn where you are and what you're doing here then the manifestations are going to show my heavenly days because listen this bride in this the end time we thrive on Revelation we thrive on Revelation we don't if you thrive on Revelation first and then all these other things come that's wonderful but if you go after all these other things and don't get the revelation right you see what's going on in the message just say yeah number four I like sitting I'm just I'm just giving you some key points until we start into this revival I got some really good nuggets not tonight but I'm going to hold them for a little bit further down the road look 1961 expectations look now a minister cannot bring a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival he does that pack it with him and the only thing he can do is just be loyal to God and His Word and I believe our pastor has done that amen and the ministry has done that we brought look at the people we're bringing in we don't just call people up and say hey come preach know either somebody's heard that person before and either given this or this all right so we don't bring them in here unless we think they can help you I'm we we just don't have a preacher of the Month Club we're not coming from and a minister cannot bring a revival because he can't he just be loyal to God in his word and the revival has to come by the people look in your home in your life now listen the reason there will never be another worldwide revival it's a quote for later on but I'm going to tell you now the reason the Baptists can't have a revival they have nothing to revive you can't revive false doctrine how please somebody tell me you can't revive something that's dead spiritually dead so that's why they won't be a Baptist revival or a Pentecostal revival or this revival that it's going to be a revival only to the believers the ones that are born again because that's something to revive but there will not be another now that was a worldwide revival back in brother Browns time because what was he doing he was bringing them through out of that Pentecostal age and bringing them up into the bride age or the age we're talking about so he had to deal with the Pentecost and he had to deal with the Baptist he had to deal with the Methodists and all these different things and they had that revival when Joseph Smith when he had a revival with the Baptist men they toured the world apart Wesley Luther they told the world apart when they began a revival but what happened was is is they died that when you and remember when you die you can't be revived that's my brother Branham had to come in the end time folks and resurrect this whole thing I will restore saith the Lord he come to do a work of restoration listen Elijah and the four hundred prophets they beat that altar down to nothing remember they cut their self they cried they kicked what did the Bible say here comes Elijah no eternal hell no false baptism no Trinitarian doctrine no you can't no you can't have four or five wives and be a deacon you see what I'm talking about brother Branham came the la jeunesse end time came to restore worship he came to restore altar worship that's why Elijah when he restored that altar what did God do Elijah said oh let's pour some revival on it water his revival let's pour some revival on it about three different times three poured that revival on top of what God knew he'd come down and honored that prophet by consuming the water and the sacrifice and took it up into heaven that's what me and you were looking for I want God to take me out of here that's our problem we've had too much ease in Zion we got to CBS we got we live half of your cars in that parking lot cost more than my first house hello you think about that my cell phone bills more than my first half payment that's pitiful but it is so what have we come to oh let's go to church and if we get something we do if we don't yeah we'll go do something else but you got to start it it's gotta start in your life and start in your home now revival isn't adding new members to the church is reviving that what we've already got to revive means to bring back let's go to number five what we need today is an old fashioned God sent revival clean up the home clean up the heart you said you need cleaning up what happened in sister Sheppard's dream what brother Dale has been preaching about he's pouring the water into the barrel or into the box and what was coming out trash trash trash that we have but thank God once that revival got started it burn I pushed all that trash out and just wiped it away I like what one quote will read it when brother Branham said you walked out to the and he walked out into one of the great lakes and he was with a couple of brothers and this is how profit he's always in some kind of prophetic mode okay he walks out and and the winds blowing he says about 40 miles an hour and that Lake Superior's just doing this and doing this and doing this and he said hey brothers he said Lake Superior is having a revival they looked at him and he said yeah he said there's not no more water in that in that Lake then it was in it before the storm started he said but look it's pushing all the trash it's pushing all the trash over to the side it's cleaning the lake up let's clean our lake up when we come to this in time it's not gonna be a lot of margin of error we've had margins of error I'll be out of all down through time there is no margin of error of whom you know what there was no margin of error when Jesus stood there one day and he said my daddy and your dad is not the same looking at the religious world that thought that their daddy was God and they he looked at him he said my daddy's not like you my daughter my daddy's not even your daddy you're of your father the devil you know why you could say that because he was almighty good you say well what about we can't I've already told you the great revelation is is Christ in you the hope of glory and what God prayed for us in in the book of John 17 he prayed that prayer that we would be one as him in the father a one that's got to be a revelation we got to start saying what God said not what the neighbor said not what your not what your co-worker says number five believe it's down this what we need today is an old-fashioned revival I'm reading finished reading it plain if the home clean up the heart get things ready start a revival in your home and it'll begin at church preacher don't bring it in his briefcase God sends it from heaven to the individual now what brother Brown say this was this is an individual affair with God it's what you do proves who you are look at number six let's read number six for a quick a loss of the profit mothers of old they love to raise children but all this modern America day that we're living in now I tell you our nation is simply polluted there's not a hope left to this nation as I see only an old-fashioned revival and according to the scripture it'll never be nationwide so then we're just left it'll be a revival among the people but look what he brought it more narrow it's not just the people he brought it more narrow the elect of God but it won't be a real sweeping revival take the whole nation in never was never will be so listen there's your key if you see something worldwide run away from it cuz it ain't true you say well what about what about it brother Dale's been preaching is it's kind of strange has been preaching on anointed ones and all these things are coming up you know you there God listen they may have more signs than you do we may look like a ragtag bunch they may be getting all the healings but what are they preaching they take you to another God you're supposed to do away with it amen number seven third seal now that's what the reason today that the revivals not was supposed to that the Rivoli the revivals that were supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no sir now look that's not the 63 we've had no stirring what and he's one of the greatest spear heads of the of the healing revival in in America and all over the world seven times around the world this is 1963 when the sales were getting ready to break of course this is his message right not the healing campaign that wasn't his message he'll tell you that not in the healing campaign but after the healing campaign the healing campaign got supposed to have got us to turn toward the hook the bait on the hook all right but a lot of us went after the bait and forgot the hook okay we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't all they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival no where no no now listen this is your profit no revival no where the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it now what is the thunders we've already been through that that's the voice of God when the seal breaks when the seal breaks we see redemption redemption of what you revelation of who we are and what we're doing here it'll take the desire of our heart to bring this it's not a desire of our heart then we'll just sit here stone cold and dead and you know what though there's going to be he will send it he promised it that's nice that the Lord come he comes from the Bible I'm not a prophet I'm not here but brother Graham said we have that staff the Lord to be quiet we would our big steel now this last bit and we're done let's go to Exodus one because remember any time there's a revival it has to be the people now we're going to talk about we really don't look at revivals but God was having a revival the day he said let there be why what was coming to pass was what was already in his mind it was coming to fruition he was having a revival listen I don't think God stood up there and just said I think I'm will have a can I have some light no he had a master plan he flung every star where he needed to be made a Sun just big enough to make us hot on this side of the world and cold on the other side when the world tells put the moon right where it's supposed to be to make the waves go in and out of the ocean the tidal wave everybody that one man the Angels didn't create anything there's only one creator sure the angels help but they only do what God tells him to Satan would have been hard if he'd have done what God told him to do but he tried to do something that God didn't tell him to do and that was interpret the word did he said right in the Garden of Eden Satan interpreted exactly what Jesus said or God said except for one word because God said thou shalt surely die he said not no no cus I'm gonna kill you you're surely not doesn't okay you your is yours bride yours people he created you he's not gonna kill you the whole human race died but we needed a savior cuz he was a savior we needed healing because he was a healer what a perfect plan but let's look at the Exodus now what happened let's set this forth now remember the children of Israel had their own property when j-20 Jacob when Joshua came across the land to give the land he divided it among the twelve tribes of Israel all right but back here in Exodus we're going to see though that those twelve patriarchs or the twelve children of Israel that's why they come listen you say watch the children of Israel over there the children of Israel is Reuben because there's rules Jacob never got changed his name to Israel the children of Israel came from them twelve tribes all right but Joseph called for the his family or his dad his brothers come over here because there's famine right remember when he reveals himself Joseph is Joseph's - real powerful God actually he can do whatever he wants to do because the the Pharaoh is just kind of like hey Joe you take over it's yours man Joseph's a perfect type of Christ because you did everything right except for one little thing and he did it to preserve life he's just so tell us a little while because of this you know to keep him getting killed but anyway that was human being Joseph is the perfect type of Christ what do you do he stands there he stands between Pharaoh and the people well everything's cool and fine until the Pharaoh dies and then Joseph dies because life only goes so long so let's start right here because what happened was when Joseph brought those children of Israel into the land of Egypt now remember that's not their property but to preserve them Joseph brought them into the land of Egypt so they could eat them seven years of the grain that hid stored because of the seven years of plenty their buddy got the story and that's the way it started they got fat the children of theirs won't eat for seven years in Egypt and just enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the world right because everything was fine they had plenty everything was going all right Joseph was their overseer and even if Pharaoh did get mad at somebody Joseph was saying I'll handle it and he'd go down and he'd handle it but watch this Exodus 1 verse 6 because brother Brown said this is one of the first revivals begun by human watch Exodus 1 verse 6 and Joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation I could say something here everybody's gone except us everybody's gone except us and the children of Israel were fruitful look and what increased abundantly man I ain't never seen some e.message churches with so many people you know and the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceedingly mighty why didn't have anything to do I mean be carnal they they didn't have anything to do so they just had children I mean a bundle they just get looked and waxed exceeding mighty because remember let God blessed Israel doesn't matter watch and the land was filled with them everywhere you go there's a mess message believer and there rose up a new king over Egypt wishing you not Joseph and he said unto his people now who was his people Egyptians Gentile there I mean the Egyptian people all right because he's not talking to Israel he says behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we are Pharaoh is saying look guys if we don't thin that crowd out they're gonna be a lot more of them than they are of us and they're gonna take over I'm just reading the Bible verse 10 come on let us deal wisely with them unless they multiply and it come to pass that when their father out any war they join also into our enemy and fight against us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them taskmasters now I don't think they just walked in one day and said alright y'all are going to work for us I think they eased then the Bible says come in with flattery they come in with these little easy sugar tit doctrines and you're okay in the message because you believe in the message don't you but then you got that at the eternal seed and you you come and sit in a message church every Sunday most of you and you do listen to every once in a while you listen to a tape if it falls if you ever hit the home button so I mean you know come on I'm giving you a tight because this is typing us they were in the greatest land there ever was and they became easy in fact and hectic but what's God fixing to do now watch therefore they did set over them taskmaster to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities python and Remzi but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because the children of Israel we didn't want Pharaoh thought he said look I'm gonna get make them so tired they ain't got nothing to do but go home and go to bed and sleep right I mean he's trying to say look we got to stop this but watch but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel and the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve now with rigor now they become slaves for 400 something years they remember they were already promised to go into slavery for 400 years they're fixing their bee slaves now to the task masters of Egypt that used to be their buddies several years later before that see how Satan moves in real easy all right they made their lives bitter with hard bondage and mortar and brick and then all manner of service in the field and all their service were in they made them serve was with rigor in other words they started beating them so the children of Israel is going hold wait a minute hold on we're gonna leave this and no you're not you're ours now that's what the devil does I'm not gonna like the devil out there I'm talking to the devil here okay I want y'all to start pointing fingers everywhere else let's point them around here cuz the children of Israel the type of me in here all right and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage and mortar and brick and all manner of service in the field all their service were in they were made served was with rigor and the king of Medes that speak to the Hebrew midwives now watch now what is the Midwife supposed to do what is her job is to help birth a baby you see where we going with this the midwives were to help birth the baby watch and the king of Egypt pretty smart guy spake with the Hebrew midwives that's the first person that sees a baby born okay of which the name of the one was shift from in the name of the other in pula pure now the midwives job was to Burke the baby the preachers we're charged with birthing the babies and as we get born again Satan keeps going man I hate this I don't like this I don't like all these newborn babies coming in Christ and I don't like these people that are filling up these the real elect filling up the pews all right and he said listen watch this verse 16 he's fair oh nice telling the Midwife he said when you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then you need to kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives feared God and stuck with a message and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them preach it brother you doing good back there okay all right but that's what the midwives feared God we've got some real message preachers that fear God and do not care what Egypt has to say I'll clap myself you clap if you won't do but the midwives feared God and did not as the king of media commanded them but saved the men children alive and the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have you done this thing and have saved the men she must have caught wind they say with some little Hebrew babies running around that were boys because remember this sleeves up took Moses remember he's gonna throw the two-year-olds out into the crocodile's this is what leading up to it and the myth but remember there was this is talking about a lot of babies but when God comes down to save and he saved Moses one elect he saved one exciting way with me and you and the king of Egypt called for the midwives sooner then why have you done this thing and have saved the men children a lot and the Midwife said unto Pharaoh because the Hebrew women are not as the world man I bet how to shout and fit when I saw this yesterday for their loudly some of y'all please be alive Lee loudly they're lively and are delivered even when the midwives not there therefore God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiply then waxed very mighty the elect of God will always find a way to make you three always because they're God's elect you know what election is what's an election a vote for and a vote against God voted for you Satan voted against you who swings to vote you do you swing to vote you're the two-to-one one way or the other right that's your free moral agency but oh my when I read I thought man those midwives they said these people are so strong and don't say they don't need us anymore don't get don't get that in your head that you don't need the ministry anymore but it come to a place to where those meant the babies the wives that were producing the babies we're so strong nothing stopped them and that's the same thing with me and you but see after this right here Pharaoh said all right take every baby that's to you every man child is two years old and under and throw them in the Nile and the alligators are going to eat them that's when the people started crying for a deliverer that's when the first revival of the Prophet tells us of a group of people crying out to God for a deliverer so that's the same way with you now cry out for a deliverer you say we've already been delivered you had been delivered from this yet I want to be delivered from a wretched man that I am right here this is a man I want to get delivered from love the Lord let me just give you one more little tidbit of information we're done there was five great revivals coming up from the 1700s and we'll talk about this a little bit later because I want to show you what the you said well I don't know about I don't know why how I need to act in a revival well I'll show you next Sunday or Sunday after there was five great revivals one was between 1972 the 1917 32 the 1740s started in England well that happened to be John Wesley all right Second Great Awakening was from the 1820s to 1850s you brought in Charles Finney you brought in Moody and all those different ones the third-grader waiting for us from 1875 to 1885 I'm sorry that is when that is when you bring Dwight Moody in in after the 1850s but if you'll watch most of these great awakenings happened after a major war or during a major war because the people got scared but like I said before the first great revival in the 1730's here's the commentary churches relax in their requirements for church participation and membership it called it was called the halfway covenant it allowed children of non believing parents to still be baptized in good faith that they'd be reared with the morals of the church people started crying out against that and God brought a revival anytime you see error that's when you cry out for a revival or when you see a war now we've it we've been in spiritual wars but most of these this is a street revival was from 1906 to 1915 well that's when the First World War was alright and then you got the 20th century revival which was 1910 to the 1970s which you see Billy Graham Billy Sunday they don't release brother branham but I put him in there is what from 1910 to 1970 in 1940 you had war so you got different things coming up now we've got spiritual wars that we're dealing with all right we got to all those different things but I'll read that later on but that's how and I'll tell you how each one reacted because it was a reaction of the people for what was going on around them that's what's got to happen to me and you something's got to stir us the bride does better under persecution we've not been persecuted the only persecution we got is standing number six in line at Walmart hello somebody you don't have to do that now if you do self checkout look how that world's done got self this and self-doubt now you can do self checkout let's stand to our feet musicians come I want to read you a couple of quotes they don't have but I will read them again and I just want to make a comment while they're coming in light of all the things that's been going on the past few weeks in different months and all the mm-hmm this is just my take on this watch this i brother bob you sent me that already had that because i just went through the adoption series from brother Dale was preaching the doffing series but watch what brother Bram said in light of all these things that's going on I want us to keep our mouths shut don't ask us what's going on don't ask somebody else what's going you ain't nothing but a bunch of nosy people leave it alone I do know what's going on brother Joel Forney gave me a good idea of everything that was going on and I spoke to him Monday - and he's going through a battle and we need to pray for him but you listen to this and 1960 brother Brown said an adoption series I went after a brother not long ago had one astray a young fella said to me let that Roscoe go let him alone he said if I ever get to the place that my heart don't go with my brother then it's time for me to go to the altar because I've fallen from grace I said I'll go as long as he's got breath in his body and I'll catch him somewhere along the line yes sir and I called him hallelujah brought him back but I want you to watch what this listen to this statement yes sir he's back in the fold safely now yes sir he'd have went astray it sure is the world so if brother Brown hadn't intervened he would have just kept going so I hope and pray that we don't do like what's going on in the and I say stupid people because I'm telling you what ain't nothin but a witch hunt we need to pray for people that's the only thing that's gonna help gossip ain't gonna help praying for people is gonna help pray for the people that are affected cuz listen brother Branham even tells us in what should we do with Jesus called Christ this is where he talks about Matthew 24 verse 21 through 26 what brother Dale is preaching on the false Christ's coming he says look he predicted that spirit in this system would be so much like the real thing til it would deceive the very elect if it were possible the elected we were just talking about the elect whose names are put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and frankly it got them so tied up until he said if he didn't cut the work short for their sake there would be no flesh saved upon this earth that's we'll wrap folks this is the long battle long battle and like I said we've got soldiers that have fallen on either side I say soldiers cuz I don't it's not for me to pick and choose it's for us to pray and if we can ever catch somebody to bring them back all what a great thing instead of doing like most preachers are doing now the idiots are up there condemning these people and and dividing churches and it's not for here it's not for us each church sovereign but I just want to tell you that cuz I heard some of the stuff going on different things it's none of our business none of it brother joe fornear needs prayer brother Tim hymns need prayer and the whole congregation needs prayer they need a revival but maybe it'll start in this revival right that will pray what you bear to keep your eye open because Satan's out but when Satan comes in like a flood the Spirit of Lord we'll raise up a standard and to me that standard is renewing what we've already got start a revival in your home go home and throw stuff out you don't need pray a little more read your Bible a little more listen to a message a little more I'm just asking if we can do that as individuals come to church for some people don't come half the time I'm sorry but if a house of God doors is open brother Bram said a born-again person cannot wait for those doors to open that has not changed oh yeah it's changed you know why because Egypt says it's changed oh well we're okay we watched it online I may have just a little sniffle or my cat's probably got diarrhea I think I'll stay home no fight your way to church fight your way through everything quit being lacks all of us I'm talking about me to stop being lacks have a revival you know what you can have a revival and nobody besides you'll even know it but you know what sometimes that pressure gets old fall maybe it'll burst open one of these days and somebody you that's never said any man will say Amen or if you never lifted your hands to God you'll lift your hands to God and you're not lifting your hands your neighbor you live in your hands to God you know what it is surrender and most of the time you know what this is not surrender if you walk up to a police officer and he tells you to put your hands up if you don't put your hands up you have not surrendered because you know what you may have a gun in here behind your back this is surrender let's sing a song god bless you start a revival Oh Dover Jordan and what did I see coming for to carry me home as we sing this song I want you to come by and lay your hands on these burn
