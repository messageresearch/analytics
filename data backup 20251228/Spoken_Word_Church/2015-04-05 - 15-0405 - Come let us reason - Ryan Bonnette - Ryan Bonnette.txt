========================================

all right good morning everybody good morning that's all open in word of Prayer our heavenly father we thank you Lord for this day this is the day Lord day of your Resurrection thank you Lord for your deaf bears and Resurrection for the pain for our sins father and we're setting to make that comforter on this Lord to lead us some goddess and all the fruit and we pray your blessings and the services today here and for all the bride around the world amount to ministers left to speak and are able to hear it help us with the Sunday School lesson this morning not to be misunderstood or is that she's just helped me to give this thought to the people in the way that you gave it to me father and may all be For Your Glory and Honor we pray to bless all those travel and all those who are not here today agree with them we got them and what they do and keep them safe I love you we thank you and give you all the praise for all your blessings all right so we're going to talk about uh come let us freezer I want to say right up front uh don't misunderstand me because I'm not saying that way uh I don't think misunderstood that we have to reason things to uh make ourselves get Revelation from God we can't make God reveal things to us I'm only talking about our part to do okay our part is more than just sitting and waiting on things sitting and waiting on a bus to pull up last time I talked about diligence and I gave you all the the keys about diligence about how to become diligent why we need diligence because we're soft and we're lazy we're born lazy and we're not just going to get things automatically we have to do something you know we have to work our part and God needs us halfway you know we talked about what diligence is and why it's important and uh but I left off on this one ingredient and it really didn't occur to me until afterward that I should have mentioned this and this is very important so come let us freezing part of being diligent in seeking the Lord is to set your mind on him think on his word hide it in your heart keep it always on your mind and he will begin to reveal it to you this is a vital aspect of the Christian Journey if you want to see God we must look at him let's turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus like the song says Psalm 16 8 I have set the lord always before me because he's at my right hand I shall not be moved and uh the scripture for this where it comes out of the Bible is in Isaiah 1 verse 18 come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be a Scarlet they shall be as white as snow so there be red like crimson and they shall be as wool this is all about mankind falling okay where his highest state that he was in the garden before the fall God reaching his hand down from heaven to pick mankind back up and he he does it through reasoning and and through lots of any Avenues he comes into our lives and and pulls man back up okay back to himself so let's talk about let's talk about your sin let's talk about your life and everything about you and who you are and why you're here and where you're going so come let us treason okay the word reason in the Hebrew lexicon means to prove to decide judge rebuke approve correct to be right or be right all right it means to decide so think about what uh what we must do we must decide when we hear the word we decide okay it comes into the womb of our mind and we make a a choice on it we make a conscious decision about the word of God the judge okay because also the word some work we receive is false word we also the devil speaks to us and gives us false work so we have to decide to discern between the spirits okay the judge to a judge a point to so to be right to prove to convince convict to approve tied to correct rebuke to be chasten to reason reason together to argue okay so just you know work it out within your being decide on what what you hear and then you can make a conscious decision okay so our objective this lesson is to see what it means to reason about the word that we hear and then to believe it hmm another thing I forgot to say on that last slide you notice it says uh rebuke when you hear false word come in that's where you cast down imaginations and every High thing that is also against the knowledge of God bring every thought and captivity to the beatings of Christ so you're a brief rebuke the false word that comes in okay all right oh another thing I forgot to mention on the on the objective slide okay for the random sorts of scripture himself you know when the angel of the Lord I think uh would speak something to brother Branham even then he'd go back and try the scripture right he'd go test it and see if this is really of God and God admired that God like that he doesn't want us to just take over here and say you know what that sounds good it must be right you know you have to go try it reason it out uh look at the scripture and see if it Compares okay so that was our example we should do that too uh first John 4 1 beloved belief not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby I know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist wherefore where have ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world okay like what does Riverdale always say compared to our new birth right when you hear anything at all compared to your own New Birth all right because Jesus Christ if you're born again he's come in the flesh he's come in your flesh compared to the word that you've received to the New Birth that you have and see if it rains true all right Satan wants to be God right that's been his whole goal he wants to be instead of God he wants to be worshiped as God so he won't declare that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh he'll he'll point to himself every time he'll always try to get you off the work and he's very true and how he does it we have to be you know ready for that okay any questions so far doesn't go through this I don't want to go too fast say um we have to do things and God made us halfway I'm an artist yeah maybe we can do a little bit more more explanation okay well just anything in life I mean when you want God to do something you can't just say God do it and commit it to him a good example is my wife sitting there years ago I had a loan for a wife and brother Gary Atkins was a mentor to me he came down he saw he knew I was his own wife and he was lonely he said brother Ryan God will bring the right one in his time but you can't just sit in your living room and wait on God to drop a wife for you down through the floor down you have to keep your eyes open you have to look him but don't be dating don't be trying there's no need to try one and try another and try this try that just wait on God bring it but you have to keep your eyes open see that was my part be ready do everything my part to be ready the uh you know what I would think a good husband should be be ready to be that okay be a good Christian be serving the lord and then his part was to bring me alive and his time and he Vindicated and showed me that she was the one that's one example um I mean there's many examples uh you know basically we are not called to just sit and wait on God to do everything we have to study to show ourselves approved like the Bible says we have to keep seeking the Lord Lord serving the lord walking in his word and and he'll do the rest there is a part that we have that's that's what I'm saying does that make more sense so there's nothing really in the Bible that we're supposed to just sit and wait on God to do everything we uh we're we're supposed to we're supposed to be patient and then uh and in the meantime while we're waiting on God to fulfill what he said we keep studying keep praying keep believing believing unto until it's revealed that we're not believing on two anymore it's a revelation okay uh Second Timothy 2 15 study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth but Sean profane and bablings for they will increase unto more ungodliness okay there's that false Doctrine again coming in you know Satan creeps saying very small unaware a little saying will go forth or something like that and it's just very very uh subtle right the way the Devil comes down without increase those are seeds that the devil's playing you know little things little foxes spoil the vine they start off as small little sayings they increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as thus a canker of whom is hymenius and fellatous who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of some nevertheless the foundation of God stands for having this seal to think about that but still because we know about the mark of the bees all right the mark that started there in the garden with Eve she took on the carnal mind we'll get into more of that but that's the carnal mind is imitating and Scar that's the mark of the things that's where you uh and the Seal of God is just the opposite you know the ability to believe the word of God when you make a decision to believe the word of God you're going on with God okay so didn't have their self the Lord knoweth them that are his do you see communion the Lord knoweth lamb that are his like brother Boston's on them out you're in a communion in a relationship with God and let everyone name it the name of Christ depart from iniquity okay so what are we We Are Spiritual Beings with the ability to reason and the ability to make free choice why now this is me talking I mean you may differ with this and tell me what you can do okay I'm not robbing everything and I frankly uh I used to be really afraid to say what I believe because I was afraid that somebody said Ryan you're wrong and then I'd say well I must not be born again but no I'm not really afraid of that anymore now I'm thinking let me say what I believe if you find something wrong show me because I want to be right so show me if you see where I've maybe reasoned off the word because I almost know all right we Are Spiritual Beings with the ability to reason and to make free choice why is what I'm saying because God needed to expand himself into another form he is ever expanding you know all of Heaven cannot contain God the heaven of Heavens cannot contain God he is ever expanding and becoming greater thus he needed a form to expand into him created in this image of lioness okay um he'd become a greater but not changing let me let me Express that part he's the same yesterday and forever but he can move over into other forms still the same God depressing himself and other forms moving over to another in another form okay now we are beings with a soul he can express in us his attributes furthermore he desires to be worshiped in spirit and in truth we are created to fulfill that we have the ability to reason and to make a choice to accept and reject the truth okay is that pretty clear I guess now all right the carnal mind before the fall of Man Adam and Eve had pure Minds the carnal mind did not enter man until the fall see that's just again me saying because I don't believe that God gave his great his creation his purpose perfect beings a carnal Minds because the carnal mind is to lust and it's to do all the wrong things I believe in Adam with pure minds but with the ability to reason see God gave mankind to build a reason and to make free choice this again was to enable us to reason on the things of God and to be able to receive Revelation or understand God like we do now after the fall okay so before the fall must have been I presume it would be the same way that man received God Galore came down himself and communed with them in the garden and reason with them and they could understand things about God the obvious byproduct which is a dirty word these days in the message the byproduct or unintended consequence of this is that we can choose wrong right because if you give man the ability to make right and wrong choices at some point he could choose wrong or accept false word and reject the word of God that is what the woman did in the garden she accepted the LIE from the devil and thus took on the carnal mind you know brother Brandon might be on the curtain of Tom he said that he could hug the women and feel that they were really women but there was no sensation or no I think he was meaning I assuming was being a stimulation all right because there was no sex glands there was no ability to go off in the wrong direction like that so that being that way there must have been that way in the garden because their eyes were valid they did not know they were naked so Adam and Eve had pure minds and really no ability to do the wrong things the lusting things until she accepted that idea from the devil from sacrum is that is that all right okay now like like Paul said in Romans on carnal sold understands he sold us out and Adam sold us out understand the carnal Minds so now we're all born with this Karma this enmity against God okay so Romans 12 2. and they not conform to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God I saw a part of this has proven the will of God the word his will is his word okay now this to me is how to get rid of the carnal mind all right because we're born with it we don't need it we need to get rid of it and how do we get rid of it see there it is right there again B not conform to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind we take on the mind of Christ that this mind this is Philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus who being not in the form of God thought or not robbery to be equal with God but made himself no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto the death even the death death of the Cross so he walked in the will of God the word of God it became obedient all right obedience is better than sacrifice so we're supposed to not be conformed to the world to be obedient to God killing this or doing away with this carnal nature that we've been given and Walking with God John 8 32 says truth the truth shall make you free you should know the truth and the truth shall make you feel free so again reason you study the word of God you reason it out you think about it and then hiding your heart like David said hide it hide the word in your heart God will come and Quicken it to you he'll make it alive uh John 16 13. oh where he's spiritual truth has come he will lead you and guide you into all truth that's like we're supposed to be on the next slide excuse me an example of obedient as opposed to greater than for sacrifice uh let's say I came just came into my mind to stand is that a quarter scripture let's see that's a that's a quote I think right brother obedience is better sacrifice in the scripture okay uh I'd say what would be an example of that one well what's an example of sacrifice in that reference you know I guess I'll have to look up that scripture now because I might have taken those context but I'm thinking that in the Old Testament they made sacrifices all right for him to cover it for a time but what's even better than that is to come over here while you're born again the perfect sacrifice has been made his life comes and living lives in you God carrying out his own word in you and making you obedient so rather than committing sin you know iniquity and going back and making the same sacrifice over and over again rather than that why not come over and receive a new birth and then they'll make you obedient and that'll Purge you from I don't know that's just my speculation okay because the Albanian to God right because see how big it the God will yeah because the sacrifice became a stinking it's nostril men were doing it for just uh for a routine you know for a tradition right public sacrifice say I never committed anything but they sacrificing did you need a second say that again now if you never made a mistake did you need a sacrifice in the Old Testament I wonder oh everybody made mistakes I mean that there was nobody in that in that uh you know in that realm we have Barney standing iniquity the only thing is they had to realize that they were in sin because if anybody thought they didn't make a mistake it was because the law hadn't manifested that to him yet because Paul said you know I had not known sin left to be by the law so when the law came that showed that there were Sinners so they couldn't say anymore that I I don't need to sacrifice everybody needed to for some reason or another I thought maybe if you never made a mistakes and you were two or not to kill he didn't go kill right be that you probably didn't need a sacrifice it was killed him yeah even if they hadn't murdered somebody physically Jesus came and magnified the law and now you're talking about Old Testament yeah I'm trying to see if that answers her a few if I didn't kill I didn't need to go make an offer so if I obeyed not to keep you then I didn't mean to make any sacrifice but not for that specifically maybe but up besides God we're all Filthy our righteousness is a filthy rack so there's nothing that you wouldn't need some sacrifice for somewhere that's right you know what I'm saying even in the Old Testament even before Jesus magnified the law because he came and magnified and said if you even hate your brother Without a Cause even without literally committing adultery you've made adults with it already in your heart so everybody is has come short of the glory of God by a long ways we are a long ways I had this guy I try to trap me or something I think he knew the answer to me so I say we if you're a True Believer be a Christian do you sin he's trying to Reverend said we sin every day even if we just don't ask your neighbor to go to church with you yeah say yeah listen every day as long as you're in this right here yeah right exactly he knew the answer but he was trying to see what I would say yeah he thought you'd be self-righteous or something well I mean we're all and president said we stick it to the change so as long as we have the coronation we're going to be doing things um were commanded to have uh these days a certain periods of the year and they would always accompany the sacrifice right so they were doing it as an ordinance and not seeing numbers right okay yeah exactly it's just man's carnal nature because they still have the carnal mind as we do and we're still trying to battle with and so we automatically into tradition and just doing things out of her team forget why it's there you know so I don't remember if I read that song I don't know if you read the one prior to it okay you get to be my age you're right the revelation of Jesus Christ preached 1960 1204. now bless the word the announcement of the blessing on the third person condemned the radar here it's Mysteries make okay the carnal mind shuns it because the carnal mind knows not a thing about it no wonder the carnal mind doesn't know it because it's Satan in that part of mind and Satan is exposed and Satan does not want himself exposed then he goes on to about the Genesis Revelation how that Satan tries to hide those two books it needs to be exposed he's very subtle and wants to be hidden he used to do his work without being known okay we've got to find myself in here hold on okay okay this is the man that took that eve took on in the garden okay the Satan in the carnal mind now Matthew 11 2. and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force y'all remember Bob bringing this out a while back maybe a year ago I guess and that scripture really struck something in me when he brought that out I've never seen that like that but uh basically it helps us to see that we are to fight against the carnal mind this is not some you know lazy sit down and wait on God like I said wait on God to do everything this is something we're in a battle and we're fighting and the kingdom of God suffers violence we have to be a violent Christian you know daily walking and pushing and striving don't ever stop don't ever back down and even if you fall get right up and keep on fighting again that's the point of that so second Corinthians 10 4 for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations in every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ like an Ephesians it's Ephesians 6 11 the whole armor of God you'll remember the armor of God uh the pajamas the blanket the pillow The Pacifier is that the armor of God you know that would be if you're gonna sit and Grumble my brother Joe's been talking about growing balloon line and complained like a baby you know the armor of God is Warfare armor it's armor that a soldier would wear to fight so that gives you some sort of uh clue huh you put on the word right exactly you got too many babies that's your problem yeah but uh it's a shield helmet and a sword a breastplate these are things that we're supposed to fight with so we're not supposed to sit and just take it easy we're in violent Christians is what we're supposed to be my Jacob wrestling with the answer to the Lord you know he wouldn't let that answer go until he got a blessing so we're supposed to wrestle with God you know and say God I want your word I want the understanding of it and I want revelation and just stay with God and stay in the word all right now this is kind of Juicy it's off the subject a little bit the subject is think on these things this is what brother Dell always talks about at the end of almost every sermon he says think on these things I was just going to put that in here just for more support to my argument here but then I saw something the other day within that scripture I want to ask y'all if y'all see it just read that scripture finally Brethren what service things are true or certain things are honest well certain things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are a good report if there be any virtue and if there'll be any praise think on these things is anything shout out at y'all about that whole scripture again the things that he's mentioned in there anybody raise a hand what's shouting out of them scripture anything I think it's the word of God who's whatever is true and honest and all that exactly it's worth God but specifically this just occurs to me you know here's why here's why I saw this because in a trial the trial is over here a while back where she nearly died okay the first thing one thing that I saw was that God manifested to me and is that he is perfect he is perpetually perfect I mean perfect on top of perfect on top of perfect in that trowel y'all remember I talked about fours and about deliverance and those things that I kept saying that were evidence that God was there okay I didn't directly see God appear to me in this trial all I saw was that evidence that he was there like you know uh was it Hebrews 11 1 now Faith is substantive things hoped for the evidence of things knocks things and it was evident that God was there because the things he did in the Bible he was doing right in the middle of our trial and the more I thought on it the more I began to realize how much God was there so I saw God as being perfect so then I thought well you know based on that if he's perfect these must not be just a bunch of random things that Paul just mentioning here because I always thought this was just an optimistic scripture be optimistic uh positive thinking just think on some good things just find some good things and think about it there's more to it than that so I started studying into looking into what those are that is the entire Christian journey in one verse from start to finish what serves things are true what happens first you hear the word right you're introduced let's say you're not even a Christian at all I'll just use men's example when I was a baby I was born and raised in the Baptist Church mom and dad coming to church I heard the word my Grandma sat down and read Bible stories with me when I went to stay with her on weekends and things so I receive the truth all right wasn't even today's accountability yet but the word of God was being planted to me in letter form okay the truth and then it caused me to be honest later on I receive accountability and I became to the point where the word was shining on the darkness in my life like I was telling you about the word was shine on that darkness and showing that there's sin you know no matter how good I thought I was there was sin there so the light of the words show on that and caused me to confess for all sin control of the glory of God so I was honest with God honest with myself but whatever things are just pure and lovely justification sanctification back to the Holy Spirit the love of God is shed abroad in your heart God is love so what sort of things are lovely God you know just pure and lovely think about your journey all right and then once whatever things are of good report so what do you have after you're born again the law the life of God living through is no longer I that lives now it's Christ that liveth in me so that'll help make your life a good rapport say and then the testimonies the trials the sufferings the things you go through that overcame by the word of their testimony the Bible says we stand up there and testify that's not some little thing that's a big something that's an overcoming and each of those overcoming show Christ to us so it gives a good report in our life written a pistols read of all men a good report if there be any virtue statue of a perfect man the virtues what do you do after you get born again just in case they kissing back to the Holy Spirit puts you in the pyramid in faith Foundation then you start up the virtues all right and then if there be any praise the whole point of this is for God to receive absolute praise in the life of obedient Sons and Daughters of God so the whole thing is the Christian Journey what does Paul saying finally brethren think on these things your whole Christian experience where you've been where you are and where you're going see your whole entire life think about it where God brought you from where he's bringing you to and where you are now you know I was thinking whatever they say let this mind be in you I always look at the verses about that he said let nothing be done in vain glory Lord but in lowliness of mine you know and that's that's just bringing the what you're talking about right the Christian Life he said let this mind be in you to do what it says in verse two and three what's question three well it says fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being the one of court or one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of mine Let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man on also on the things of others and that just pulls all of that in exactly that's the mind he wants us to have yeah a lowly mind not hotline of things like things that exalt yourself or exalt the devil but the low things all right and run fresh out of time see oh that just I wrote that all out all the things I just said basically I don't think we're gonna finish um say we're right here okay I'll see how far I'm get but this is just more expounding on that last verse out of the mountain faves and sufferings has thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou might have steal the enemy and the Avenger I Psalm 82 so have an alpha bags and cycling so when you come here you're a babe you Christ and then he perfected praise and then Jesus went back and voted that Christmas David that's for Jesus the hairstyle what they say in Jesus said a damn gay have you never read out of the mountains of babes and sucklings have style perfected praise he wants to be worshiped in spirit and the truth and then more expounding on that same scripture his love this is just showing okay perfect love cast out fear love and faith is the same thing when you come to Faith in the pyramid you're coming to love the love of God uh love perfect love castes out fear which gives Faith you know just in a baby form of Faith baby form of of the love of God begotten all right what time do we normally stop exactly 10 25 or 10 30. yeah 10 25. yeah yeah more on this later y'all go upstairs any questions all right okay um each other good job your family he was not safe for living room
