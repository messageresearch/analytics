your scriptures turn to Matthew 3 in Matthew 17 I hope we get over that far I will read from there anyway but just remember that remember the fellowship meeting now will be this coming Saturday at brother Tony's at 3:30 so we'll be leaving here somewhere around 12:00 if you desire to go in all of us you know to fellowship together whatever so remember that be this coming Saturday remember Richards on his way home from being with his father I pray that in order to be with him and Wade and his buddy David is on the way back in from hunting and also to remember each one of them all right now brother Joe has got a thing that we you know tomorrow is the vets Reiter is the veterans day so we honor all of the veterans all that served in the military and what he's got he's got a list of some and so we won't or whatever we want to do is if he can get them together after the evening service and take some pictures of them okay all of the veterans are we you know we have brother Larry brother James Colley brother with a dirty brother Addison brother solace for the FOB Bush if we missed any more you know I don't know of any more they were military veterans you know and all I know we we've got those so we appreciate these brothers that spent their time and all for us to how the freedom to be able to serve God and be at least a point of live in this day so we appreciate you very much praise God for you and thank you for those those times and efforts that you put forth you might not have been on the firing line but that's everything this hour just as important one is just as important to the other because if every one thing wouldn't right I know brother Larry was a cook if the things ain't right in the cooked and that the military runs off its belly well he would tell you that because he was up at 4:00 two o'clock in the morning or something getting ready for breakfast for them at 5:00 or four or something so we appreciate that but it is thank God for the freedom that we have an opportunity to serve God and be a free nation Matthew 3 in Matthew 17 anything there's any other announcements I know we generally miss them at all but just remember that father we thank you for this day and your grace and your loving to us thank you for everything and we just ask you Lord to guide us and keep us and dine understanding and let your light Lord just dwell in each heart that we may see you and want to walk in your grace Lord forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in your love that we may walk in you and just bless each one have your way and Lord show us not understanding that we may walk very unless wait and then be with them be with Richard all of these and different ones Lord remember the sick among us never brother didn't grow old rather Colley they're the different ones that are sick among us and all with things that we pray for continually for them and didn't just remember everybody else that has a sickness among us remember a wife and all of the different ones and we pray that you would just come on the scene you said it we believe it you said you would send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction so we thank you for that have your way now guide us in Jesus name Amen ok Matthew 3 now we'll read these together if we don't get there this morning we'll come over to this evening but let's go to verse 13 then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan under John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and cometh out to me and Jesus answering said unto Him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him in other words he baptized him you know he told him it had to be oh we know the sacrifice had to be clean so it had to be made ready and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and notice the reading in whom I am well-pleased are pleased to dwell now we'll go to Matthew 17 because that's the beginning of Jesus's ministry River Jordan will back up to that that was the beginning of it in in everything you know and then now we're coming to the winding down of his ministry and we start verse or chapter 17 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and brought them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the Sun and his raiment was white it's the light behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him around said they were actually telling him and talking about his second coming no I then answered Peter and said unto giant to Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elijah while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the clouds which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased same statement now of the River Jordan but look it's what's added to it hear ye him you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word so keep that in mind now do we get our thought and try to come to that point that we'll talk about here you him if we get a change they don't we'll pick it up this afternoon and take it on into the service all right so just remember these things remember this announcement the things brothers Joe wants to talk to each one of them and try to get a picture some may not be here but maybe we can cut it you know they're good at doing that maybe they slice a picture and put it in and you know make you to be standing there all right I said now we won't I don't know when how far we'll get into what I want you to think on but I'm trying my best to get you to think about when where we're at what's happening we're relieving the time that we're living right where we're at the you know I mean finding our day recognizing your day in this message all right we've had the message okay praise God for that we recognize that we believe it God sent us a prophet okay but our last message we dwell on it but we didn't I didn't get fully clear of what I want you to think on on what we were talking about on the fact that in the levites chapter of Hebrews and I tried to cover it the Levitt chapter of Hebrews covers the Old Testament Saints okay you can technically and I say that technically because all of it really applies to the Old Testament because that the thing that when you get down to the bottom of it saying that they didn't receive the promise all right so basically all of Hebrews 11 will be applied to the Old Testament people and it says they without us should not be made perfect you know you said well no that was made perfect by Jesus Christ well for what they needed was made perfect by Jesus Christ why would it say to the Old Testament Saints now and we'll read where the Prophet said it was the Old Testament people you know why would it say without us they cannot be made perfect okay now why is it that the Old Testament is dependent upon the New Testament bride see then we can kind of follow the line of getting into the New Testament and we can see that throughout the New Testament then you would how the age is coming down and everything and then you'd stand over here in the life stage and see the ending up of all things and look back and you could say they without us down through the church ages cannot be made perfect now that does not mean that we're going to raise them up preach something to do this something to make them perfect that's not the point that word dar is complete see the Old Testament Saints are not made complete you said well all right think about it now there's some that come up and differ and there's an argument about the resurrections and the things and I'm going to get into it with anybody I'm just going to state it and move on into what we're talking about in the Old Testament you know you had an emptying of a paradise yes you had things took place yes you had people raised Darwin the Lord Jesus raised right but where did it go and be real careful there I tried to explain it last Sunday be real careful where did it go now they didn't go to the seventh dimension because brother Branham couldn't even go to the seventh dimension when he went beyond the curtain of time he wanted to see Jesus he wanted to he cities they said he's higher said you can't go higher all right now then we ought to get our little petty petty thoughts out of our mind about something and settle down to an understanding that word there where it says without us they cannot be made perfect it means that they can not be complete right all right now the Old Testament is waiting on you and I to be made complete the New Testament is waiting on you and I to be made complete right so what is the thing that we're waiting on this body to be redeemed salvation is already been yes the Old Testament Saints was waiting on Jesus Christ sure because the New Testament Saints is waiting up in Jesus Christ you better get it all together we're all waiting on Jesus Christ waiting on something to happen but just remember the point that I've tried to drive over and over to you on the adoption how that is in three stages the new birth brings you a child of God puts you in the body of Christ then you got the Romans eight coming down through 21 22 23 through there that the whole world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God all right but then it goes to 23 and it says that you're waiting to the adoption to wit to understand the art to see to follow that in to see it to understand it or make it known right and see what is the thing we're waiting on we're waiting on the redemption of the body cause that's the last thing your soul is redeemed by the new birth we've had 50 years since the going of the Prophet to at least heaven we'll see that too maybe at the end of the messenger this afternoon one and see how it ties together we've had a long time God has been patiently waiting on you and I not to get an uber that's already supposed to be transferred I mean Trent and taking place and see then we're in the stage in between the new birth and the redemption of the body and that's where we're at right now and that's why we're doing that's reason I've dwelled and over to make you to see what I'm trying to say is the the you know the new birth is wonderful but we're in a stage then but in that stage to where that it would come forth and understand to wit to understand to see the redemption of the body because that's what we're waiting on right you're not waiting on the new birth and the redemption of the body has not transpired right I mean if you if you you think it your but you have your glorified body and I tell you what I I'd hate to hang around in this now this thing getting older and older and older it's going down you may think you're doing good but just remember it's gonna catch up with you all right and see they then without us cannot be made perfect are brought to the complete stage why are they crying there how long how long we go into the fifth seal with the Jews right all those things but we're going in into it seen it how long how long is all the way down through time everything from Genesis the whole everything from Genesis to where we are now is dependent upon us to that new birth is there I will cover this afternoon we'll get on predestination because you're predestinated unto adoption somebody is so why can't we believe it then we say yeah but I just don't see nothing going on well maybe that's God's way of doing it I know you don't think like I think I'm crazy and I'll take one thing about it I believe it you say here we are we got this and that and the other but those people back yonder had more than we do well I wonder what would happen if you brought them down here to where we are and put us back dark I serious I mean you know I'm not joking or play and I'm telling it the way I believe it they had one or two doctrines to exist with Pharisees and Sadducees that a little thing called hero D ins and things like that little group sling off here we got nine hundred different denominations and two thousand different groups of this message and that's probably a low number right but is it true I'm not trying to make no light of nobody I'm trying to tell it like it is to be honest and see where we're staying somebody's waiting on somebody somewhere because the Bible's is it alright and if it says it I thought we believed it supposed to be made manifest see so day without us cannot be made complete see those Old Testament Saints could never come to a full redemption of the body if it is show me where they're at show me where they are now when nobody can approach into immortality but to the Lord Jesus Christ that's why I brought around said I can't go there where he's at now that's what he said so what this mum or out you want to but just remember one thing if it is true that the Bible is true then the world is waiting on somebody why can't we believe it's us well can't we accept that it's us because we remember all these years I preached to you where it said that to wit I've preached that for 40-something years to you about it to wit to understand the redemption of the body there's never been our people on the earth outside of sections or places we'll get to a decision you're the disciples talk about the coming of the Lord the redemption of the body the things right but then you see them going down but you see somebody's got to come to the place to understand and it you say what you want to go ahead I've tried to get you to see the thing we need is redemption of the body and with that no divine healing no resurrection is that what your prophet said well everything's waiting on you and I to do what not to come up and do some great miraculous thing see we think it's waiting on some great uprising some happening some great big outpouring of the Spirit I believe in that but I believe that a poor I don't everything cause the Bible says it will the Bible tells us plainly that in the last days he pour out his spirit upon all flesh I've looked for a great move right I believe in it always have but I know too that we must get into the place for that you said well this is supposed to happen that for all right if we don't get in the right place that can't happen how many times have you heard this statement you're gonna catch a higher plane and you go down to the bus depot now that's about the way we do right you're gonna go to California you're gonna fly there but you go down to the bus depot well I you ain't gonna get there unless you get a bus to the airport right see I've tried to be trying to dis get us to think about we are what the world is waiting on it's not waiting listen it's not waiting come on George it's not waiting great manifestations of outpourings of of this that and the other and great moves that will be among that out there I've preached that for 40 years to you if a revival is going to come to me and you they're going to get to after-effects of it they're gonna have it and you better think about what it said a lot of times that there's a lot of times there's more going on out there then it's trying to go among us maybe we're the ones that's missing it when they're waiting on us but it looks like we're waiting on them know that's somebody somebody's going to make that none of them and what if I tried to get you to see where it says the manifestation waiting the manifestation the making known the Prophet said what does benefit say making known all the signs and wonders are dead raised the sick healed that can be out there but the making known is the what what did the Prophet cover it when we were talking about adoption the other day where he covered it there in the message and said it's a mystery that's been hid from the foundation of the world history of adoption mystery of adoption because in adoption you go all the way to the change the mystery to wit to understand somebody's going to make know somebody's going to preach it we've had the message we're not looking for something else right we're not looking for another prophet to come along artist somebody to come along tell us what he said we've got what he said we're going to believe it see the world is waiting on somebody to just take the word and move into it and believe it yeah when I've seen them felt well everyone this failed means one thing for certain more truth is there than you think because if you can see the bad out there it's kind of like somebody said one time they're talking to somebody you know about brother Branham being the Prophet and they said well you know he was a false prophet and the feller tone said well okay we got that soft because into what he said you just said he was a prophet no I said he was a false prophet he said okay he's false prophet we got that south now where's the true one right what's the true one going to be was it to be signs and wonders through the profit to catch the attention of the bride I know it was the opening of the word the opening of the word is supposed to catch the bride's attention the making known of God how much how many times have I said this to you if we will make him known he'll make us know who's worried about healings and signs and wonders and things to happen if we just make him known how can we make him known Oh we'll go I can raise the dead and heal the sick that ain't the way you make God known you make God known by believing his word taking what he says and staying with what he says right see then why don't we believe we're here all right see why can't we follow it like that and think about it that they do you understand what I'm saying there the whole world will read it in a minute where bread run says the world is waiting the whole world is waiting on the manifestation of sons of God he even said to mohammedans after looking for it well well he said it but see the whole world is waiting on something to take place what the new birth has come it's here it's in your soul if you're born again manifestation of sons and daughters of God is here it may not be in degree that we think about it but it's here so what are we waiting on what's the one thing the world is waiting on what's the one thing that that all of those that have died and went on is waiting on they could not come to that prominent to the promise it says in Hebrews why they died and went by the grave they couldn't come to a change of the body right didn't they're waiting on somebody to come to that place that the body can be changed the rest will follow it I didn't bring it but I got a quote where brother branham said that that's what they we don't listen to him in his way to stay I think it's the future home not certain off on it right he said them Old Testament science would raise one day and go up and says we'll fall right in line well that's the Old Testament and we follow thee what's the problem that's what he said he said and we'll fall right in line and going out into rapture yeah but that's backwards no one ain't backwards it's right see the dead in Christ are going to rise first right then we which are alive and remain to be changed so they're going to raise and go and we'll follow right behind but that's only the bride well that doesn't matter if it takes part this way or that way but listen just think about it of God raises up a standard what is it he's pouring in his spirit then those who are resting out younger in the grave are under the altar as the scripture says are crying how long Lord how long how much longer God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection and when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible among us and raise the dead and we go into rapture no there's the whole thing right eagle stirreth isn't it but God's waiting to get his church in order he's waiting on you and I may he grant the blessings waiting to get in an order here you him there's where God's trying to get his church just say to this mountain be moved and it will move Authority sons of God the whole creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting to a spot to word that the sickness will be in rise and it will be that way the blind will receive their sight deaf and dumb we pray for them now but then your command did they listen didn't say these signs shall follow them that believe they shall pray for the sick didn't say that so they'll cast out devils not I will they will if you say to this mountain not if I say if you say to this mountain be moved in doubt not in your heart what we need is adoption sons and daughters needs adoption no Chester the Great Prince when we rally there with Abraham Isaac and Jacob Jacob those who were heirs of the promise looking forward to us not to fail they're looking forward to us not to fail right they're dependent on us this morning let us not fail keep your anchor in Christ glorified Jesus how that those Old Testament Saints are looking now without us they are not perfect so they're depending on us to believe God's Word they're dependent with us to believe God's Word remember what we're talking about now they without us cannot be made perfect they cannot be complete even though even brother Branham till this day is not complete no I'm told it's truck put it right right the bodies in the grave what is that true no no you thought no I'm not telling like it everybody's in the grave waiting to come out of there right so what what's the whole story what are we waiting on the Messiah that's why the Bible says the earth is groaning crying waiting for the manifestation of sons of God the world is waiting for a man to come back into his rot estate come on come back to his right estate it is I and bring his people back to manifested sons of God like they had them in the Garden of Eden the whole world's were groaning and waiting for the hour for the manifestation of the sons of God he has no voice tonight but our voice he has no hands but our hands he has your hands and that whose hands it is there is adoption it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God of history from the foundation of the world where do we get to it if we get there this afternoon the Bible says Ephesians 1 that's your predestinated unto adoption you know what you believe God's work you believe anything he predestinate will take place if you don't you're an unbeliever the altars open you need to be up here praying to get that unbelief out right so why can't we believe it why can't we see what we're doing remember our thoughts for this message is what not to look back that's great faith builders and thinking like a straight not to look forward but to see where we're at now I probably said that was the greatest mistake that we made but not realizing what's taking place now we have but we've got so many of these that's got to be there you can be tried by have a word well I just don't understand the Bible said he would send these things among us to try to see if we'd stay with the word or go with that that's what I told you 40 or 50 years ago I said you wait'll the day come when the Methodist and Baptist is about there will be preaching and raising the dead and healing the sick and I said then you gonna run I threw it cuz you're gonna see signs and wonders and you're not going to think about the word being preached you're gonna have your signs and wonders you're gonna run eyes for those signs and wonders is it not true that as quick as brother Branham died some of those went to a certain brother to see what he was in the mess what he was doing called he had signs and wonders is that throwing disrespect now called where everybody's looking for something but it's true what about it tell me my brother tell me my sister paragraph 19 of adoption when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now well that's been brother there I've been 50 years ago Hemi remembers what I preached the last time I said somewhere about the nineteen and forties or somewhere in there a prophet came on the scene and begin to you know you can go back to 33 you can go to where you want to that fine a prophet came on the scene and begin to preach we entered a stage there of a wonderful opportunity for Malacca for Luke seventeen thirty revelations ten seven to be made manifest right until that time it couldn't be done but then when he comes on the scene with the message why can't we just walk in that message you believe it what's the problem because what did he say something of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when were there ever a time in the history that the manifest the time to deliver all nature where's there ever been a time to deliver all nature it's never been delivered right so that means it's going to be delivered the first nature is going to be me and you the first thing is going to be this made right not new we're not gonna give us a new body you have a brother so-and-so said wood I don't care what he said the Prophet said we're not gonna do it my Bible says the Jesus raised with nail prints in his hands he didn't get a new body but it was glorified huh explain it now you can't do it you can it's playing glorified nail holes just get it out forget it right understand it took place I don't know manifestations time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time either manifestation what's the benefit station we'll get down to it to meet make it known why before the atonement was made and listen before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the Old Testament on down through there couldn't have been manifestation it had to wait till this time once it have to wait to this time why is your prophet not covering that when Jesus Christ raised from the dead and came back into the Holy Ghost then it was manifest at that time why is he waiting til down come on that's been my whole point if your prophet is right then there's something missing all the way down through time that could not be understood because it was a mystery but it could be understood in this life days the mystery of the manifestation mystery of the sons and daughters of God in manifestation listen it had to weigh this time all things had been broke coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it would join him and his church together with earnest expectation the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation the manifestation what is the manifestation making known no it's the dead raised the sick healed that's making known God get it right but that's not where wait on them so you say well I see signs and wonders I'll know it's true you're right in the middle of the devil's trap you're in the devil's trap right sorry you're groaning waiting for the time of adoption and we believe that one of these days the Holy Spirit will move in not with a new birth for we received that through Christ but you'll adopt your church then we taught adoption in the Baptist Church but we taught it as long as we knew the new birth do you realize the Bible says that adoption is not for the Gentiles ain't no word that says it's that way but listen what I'm saying the Bible says the Dobson was for their Israel the Jews right it don't say it's for the Gentiles do you realize when you got the new birth now listen when you got the new birth you were adopted into the family of God you had no right of lineages like the Jews they would have had to come the same way because of the fall in the garden the fall in the gardens of the Jews under the same situation but they had a promise ahead of it that's why he came to them he came to his own he offered it to him they turned it down but we Gentiles accepted it and believed it thank God but he understand adoption was originally for Israel because they were the people of God if they would have been anybody gotten the new birth revela you know whatever you talking about new birth eternal life salvation whatever the Jesus country it was them but they rejected it and when they did it showed it to the Gentile so now what we get when we are born again we are adopted into the family at the new birth we tend to house adopted into the family at the new birth now there's got to be that manifestation and things that gap in between and then the lies to wit the redemption of the body are you following me manifestation making known I'm not trying to listen I know I talk when I talk you you don't get it I'm sorry this I'm just me and if you don't want me get you somebody else probably a lot of you would like that situation but that's alright go ahead and do it cuz let's get on with it let's get your rapture here but see manifestation is making known we think it's signs and wonders that's great because that is the way you're making God known Amen come on but that's not it because you can have the dead raised to sit healed and everything and it still be anointed ones now what are you doing how you gonna know the difference I can always say the Bible says that that it ascended among us a prophet coming and do this that and the other says if you don't hear them you're lost alright turn over the scripture just a little bit further and read where he says that there'd be things happening and said they'd be prophets come among you and those prophets he said what you've got to hear them right but if they take you to another God don't hear them you know what I love the rest of it I know I've talked to a lot of people about this and they just go haywire when the rest of that he said he said because I sent him among you my great army that I sent among you why to try you to see if you'll stay with the word dead race it healed take you to another God what do you do not the door right what you see where the bait is that God will do it he will allow the dead to be raised thus it healed and the great things happening and I've always told you one day that will come into a greater manifestation when God poured out his spirit on the bride to get her to the right place that's going to fall all over in the life day that my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters he said who Antichrist are Satan would upon my children on my children he says what are you looking for brother Dale I'm looking for a great move of God to come among us to where the Dead is register singing Amen I'm looking for that but if I'm going to ask that fellow what he preaches you mean you go you mean to deaths gonna be raised in front of you and you gonna ask him what he preaches yeah yeah because my soul is involved in this if he if he's genuine of God he'll have no problem he'll understand why I'm asking the question so he'll try to explain it but you see where did you perfectly fall right into the traps of the devil looking for great signs and wonders to take place without the word well now then without the word now who's gotta write or the Bible says it the Prophet says if I say anything that prophet don't say you come tell me cuz come on your duty by on your duty band if I say something that come from that prophet don't say now I ain't sayin some little silly word that I said was wrong no well then I'm gonna do that anyway I'm just human but listen am I reading what he says that's why I read it to you that's why I put it on Internet where it's not what I say I haven't said a thing this morning of what I think I've read to you once your prophet said now do you believe him do you believe him see I thought then that we were supposed to believe Romans 8 of the new birth verse 14 right through there and then make you heirs and joint heirs and then 21 2021 along in that would be the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God and then verse 23 would go to we're to understand the redemption of the body you realize the Apostle Paul now I know I don't go wrong with me listen but the Apostle Paul was he basically covered the complete plan of redemption whereas maybe some of the others never put it in their writings you know what I mean Peter had the statue of a perfect man but he don't talk about adoption but Paul knew all of that Old Testament tied together and he knew what the mystery was that was waiting for the adoption to understand the manifestation of the sons of God know the whole Bible was waiting on Jesus amen for Jesus to be right hey we've got your finger.this they mean what about it you don't but brother Dale if we could just get something to make me feel good this could make me lift it up and doing the greatest lifting up I could ever think about is to find out how much I love God and to find out the world is waiting on me no now let's waiting on somebody right that's why you can't get me cuz I won't put it over onto that away you don't say waiting on me see that referee Schmidt waiting on me blessed art I've had this message we're waiting on me good let's go get all that junk out of the way it's waiting on somebody the Bible says it the Prophet says it all right why can't we believe we're that would not believe with that no I just don't see it you're alive ain't you I just don't see it I just you know what quiet I'll find it you'll find it out there go up there go to Gainesville they got a great move up there games will go up tired just sit down and listen you probably see some dead race it healed all kind of signs and wonders if that's what you're looking for but what do you say in the word what does the word say about it like I said one scripture says prophet comes gives you these signs and all you've got to believe it are you lost the other one says they come and bring these thing but take you to another guard I seen it among you to try you you mean God yes God allows the devil to bring these things among us right come on but what are we gonna do we're gonna sit around and twiddle our thumbs waiting on the bus to pull up correct what we've been doing 50 years we've been doing pretty good I've been having a wonderful time for 50 years whether you believe it or not I enjoy life I enjoy the thoughts of God to where he'll just take me and you just carry me through and I look at it and I stay with Lord I can't see that he just opens it up well thank you now I see that but now I can't see that the coach is always going to a deeper thing you ain't never caught on one thing for around here if Tom fog would here he'd tell you nary I preached the same thing over and over and over and over been at forty years cuz they but one Bible st. with one message ain't with one guard and I've been preaching the same thing for 40 years but it just keeps getting higher and higher it just gets higher and higher and higher and higher and I hope that you get the idea that it's dependent on you because it ain't dependent on me all I got to do is bring the messages that's all I'm farting for me to do is to bring the message it's up to you to make it manifest what about it alright now maybe you'll get that part they without us so that means somebody's waiting on it and somebody's going to do it right because in god there's not anything that he says it's not gonna come to polish right so somebody is waiting on a change of the body right because that's the last thing you can come through the other things and pick up with it as we will this afternoon to see where it's at and we've had it scattered over 50 years where Jesus had it for three I've said that to you we'll bring it back down to that the Lord within if we can get darkness after nothing but anyhow listen they meaning somebody without us now somebody is to us I like that brother Theo Erasmus you remember him from Cape Town South Africa he preached here on God's name is not complete without us you memorize priest it J said his name is Jes Jes he said but now you put us in there and said it's Jes us so he's not complete without us your prophet you want to quote where brother Brennan said the Godhead is not complete without you well I just don't listen I don't either but I believe it I don't understand how the cow drinks these two green rice there's all these things and you swap me okay I don't understand that but I ain't gonna stop drinking meal they always try to tell us that a brown cow gets chucked at me well I never did find evidence that's all right but now listen church so they without us nowadays as they've which could mean there's got to be a group of people without us means there's got to be a group of people so now Jesus Christ is going to be made manifest in the last days through the Bride of Christ do you agree with that that's the purpose for us being here we're here to make him known we're here to manifest him are to glorify him we're here to tell the world of our Savior right you don't go out and get people now listen to the point you don't go out and get people to to getting born-again I was like I watched that in the Prophet he could preach the deepest sermon and I would be full of people nothing wrong here yeah that ain't fitting my understanding no but he he'd preach them and he could preach the deepest message and they'd come to the altar we'll see what he was doing he was contacting the person and bringing the word and then what did the prophets their ministers to do break the spell that Satan has over your eyes so brother Branham could be preaching the seals and people come in to the altar right and him dish preaching his heart out the deepest thoughts could ever be an altar coming full of people receiving the new birth why cuz he broke the spell I mean you just got priests long enough for that spell to be broke alright and you can see that spell broke over their eyes then you can see people see it and when they see it they'll believe it see that's that's all I'm trying to do is to just bring out the message to get it to work that we can look at these things and see that they're for us all right now let's take an example through the scriptures and then we'll quit all right the Lord Jesus Christ he came upon earth to read English we were I was listening yesterday thought had been set down her in the woods just this listen to one tape right after the other than one tape right after the other I just leave it plugged in my ear and this set tire I'm sitting there for hours I got nothing dudes that would look around so I just put inter taking this listen to the Prophet and you you get him to hearing him talk about you know the things that things that God wants to make himself known to you and me he wants to reveal itself to us and in doing that how does he do it and a prophet comes along like I said preachers a deep message and all that once right in the middle of that message something happens to the brain and that you go click and something starts unveiling in you that he's not even preaching about you ever done that you ever had a preacher to preach it on something in about that time you just lose him and he just keeps on talking all of the cause one because God started talking to you you ever done that it's wonderful they've never done it you know try it sometime well because the minister broke the spell that was over you and God speaks straight to your heart nobody's want you to have okay now see then you think about the scriptures that we read we read in Matthew three that Jesus was on the River Jordan being baptized the voice came out of heaven and said this is my beloved son right this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell well I see you think that's his adoption that's not whether your profit covers it so hang on he goes for three years and I'll read to you where brother Branham says the hardest could ever be for three years he preaches the gospel he goes to Mount of Transfiguration then a voice from heaven said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell here you him and brother Branham says God is gonna take this step back don't ever tried to get you to see it and I know it goes wrong because the human mind goes with it I have never tried to preach a group of people to a place to see how good they are because they know it's good enough to even talk about it right that's not throwing off on nobody's it's true that solves the problem all I've ever tried to do is get you to see what God has made you it is he that isn't there not we ourselves we're his people even to the bodies everything's all made of him and think about it the Lord Jesus now for three years he preaches the gospel he goes to Mount of Transfiguration he's adopted and he says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm police's the Doyle here you him in other words he said I'm not gonna I'm not gonna talk anymore if you get anything you're gonna hear it from him right listen we're gonna read you some things in a minute so just don't blank it out and say oh that's wrong no but then for through it for six months he had the most horrible time going from Calvary I mean to Mount of Transfiguration to Calvary adoption is to make our Father known is what I've been trying to get you to see for forty years it's not to make you known so that ought to get out of our minds and thinking it's not to make you know Normie known is to make him known then he makes us known by coming and doing the great wonders right but he it were supposed to make him known Jesus didn't come to make his own self known he come to make the father known seeing he knew was listen I was yesterday with the probably someone see he knew he had to give his life he knew he knew he had to come to die because the only way that man would ever be able to see God was for him to give his life and then let that come back upon the people to give them eternal life it's the only way what about coming into the world and knowing you understand what I'm saying he had a horrible three years in his life but then when he goes to Mount of Transfiguration instead of getting better it gets worse when he was manifested son of God coming up on the Mount of Transfiguration things got worse it didn't get better see we think it's supposed to get better it's supposed to do this and supposed to do that we're supposed to just get where we can just say it then that's how it just happens I've been in that ever since I've been in the message you know what I've always said you can't say it until you have it that's 45 years or more ago you can't say it until you get it all right and I don't mean get it by reading off the page I mean get it where God speaks in your heart and tells you to say it please to honor your word what about it but then he spent six months for the most horrible time could ever be thought of all he was trying to do was be good to mankind I used to think in the Baptist sense forgive me just going back there I used to thank for what why did they hate him all he ever done was good I mean he raised her daddy healed her sick he fed him he done everything and why did I hate him that's back in the bag beside at least thinking about it why did they hate him all he ever done was good all right here comes them they had a river Jordan right he was down there at the river Jordan this is my beloved son improves I'm pleased to dwell they don't go to hear him because he had to come through the tutorship the training and the position to come to Mount of Transfiguration then it would be hearing him not as he wasn't supposed to hear him during all that time but it meant something was going on now according to my Bible it says he learned obedience by the things he suffered and being made perfect he became right is that according to the Bible so you had three three years for him to go through that position are you listening but it got worse see when he went to the Mount of Transfiguration they started out trying to kill him what do you think about it now now I'm Transfiguration a life to fight it out with them demons and things to come to the position of the statue of a perfect man as we'll call it on the adoption of stages as we call it in the second stage then you think about it we had a little man called William Branham he has a Ohio River this is Bible son who won police the Doyle is that basically what was said about him I mean different wordings about but it didn't say here you him no more than it did to Jesus there but your prophet had 40 50 years maybe and we don't know that exact but I know one thing he said on the statue of a perfect man he said that it's been 30 years trying to get this to the people so you know you don't understand what I mean there was a gap and he fought it out with organized religions and I and why did they hate him all he ever done was heal the sick cast out the demons right he said I was listening one other day he said he was talking to the tabernacle he said they showed me one time I ever ask you for anything you know what I'm talking about what he was saying but he spent 30 40 years maybe would just amount to a Ministry of coming through the statue of a perfect man coming through the adoption on stages coming through and then one day he was taken out in Arizona taken up and visited with angels we read it from the Prophet right I didn't bring that one but I'll go back and get in this there where he says talking about adoption to us he said take him out into the desert in other words take him out into and visit him with an angel see give him something and she just see here he comes in to the opening of those seven seals Derick Jeffersonville and begins to preach looks like the world would a flock - that looks like they would have just run after that and and run to it because he had come in this ministry and the things that had happened of the dead raised Mystic Hill if they've accepted it would have been greater they didn't accept it they got worse for him till he got were in his earthly ministry preached to 500,000 in his last day two or three maybe ten or something in a trailer I believe he was adopted out there in Tucson you can think he was adopted here now but you can't find a place to lay the scripture if you understand what I'm just saying the Lord Jesus went transfert went to the River Jordan any goes to transfiguration brother Branham would go from the River Jordan Ohio River to his life and come out to word that he would stand out there and no seven seals would break which listen is the plan of redemption the seals now listen you hear this wording but listen please the seals was not to say for the redemption of the body that had already been preached for 2,000 years right the seal I mean excuse me the the seals was not for the new birth let me get it in the right order and supposed to it was not to just a new birth the new birth is preached from Calvary all the way down I mean through the book of Acts to out to 2,000 years it's preaching the new birth but it was laughte then as he was bringing those seals he got unless him less and less and less did people come to hear him the message that would show you the redemption of the body brother branham stairs marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals come on he said the rapture was revealed in the seals right did he have a wonderful time after the seals broke he did but the world didn't want it no more they turned against him he finished his message and God took him off the scene right for what reason for you and me as you see he had in that life coming down through there he had a Mount Carmel experience he fought out with Elijah I mean with the bailiff and all of those things he had a Mount Carmel experience brother Brennan said ever born-again believer will have a Mount Carmel experience so then can you see wherever you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior maybe before you heard the message you know that's okay I'll go with you if you put one time the word that the Prophet brought is the more important to me now than it was back under cause back there I just shot it up few wheels so if you go that way we go okay the new birth three stages of adoption right a new birth manifestation of sons and daughter and then to understand the redemption of the body see where have you heard of the message because they were all individuals now so we're coming so put yourself to yourself to the point you receive the new birth one day that was your adoption into the family of God as a baby you had to have that adoption to bring you in because you were not even a Jew to to have any lineages or anything I was trying to explain while ago you had the new birth come and it gave you eternal life in your soul but it didn't redeem the body it laid claim I'm in the future home so come on butter brown says he laid claim on that body when that new birth came in to your soul it laid a claim on to the that body and spirit that it would one day eventually even if it's got to go by the grave and come out it will come into full eternity why because he claimed it right there right that new birth made you rightful owners of glory because of everyone he owns we own hive of it I like it like that don't you heirs and joint heirs Paul says in Romans but listen see then you started through life you heard of the message some of you received the new birth after hearing of the message that's fine I can put monies from the end of that because when I come into this message I was in this message for two years before ever received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't have no problems with that no problem with anybody else everybody's told me you know what brother Dale you believe the message yeah I was reading six books and listening to tapes and today you ever done that I just dedicated my whole life to this message because if it's going to be a mess he's going to be a prophet that's what I told brother moe he said this he was a prophet I said tell me what he told I said you tell me you saw the dead razor sit here I didn't see it you tell me what he talked I said what he told I'll I'll have an understanding and I'll it'll be in the Word of God thank God for giving me the man that could do that that he could just quote it to me for all of those years that we stayed together that we could walk in the word [Music] what about it you ever had an experience see now you see why I preach so much on the nuber and how you had to have an experience of justification and experience of sanctification experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to have the new birth you think I just hollered and screamed in the act you know no I was preaching the gospel that we'll see this afternoon when we drop back to Martin Luther that was predestinated seed not Martin Luther not to flex now come on predestinated seed of the just shall live by faith predestinated eternally from God come on I know the message come on York to the registers not to personally country destiny eternally it's the word of seed all right so we got it in the right order when we go back to Luther and you see Luther standing iron and what he had and to see that you started your new birth right there in that same way not there with him but with justification that when God chopped off you PI since then you went to sanctification cleansing and setting aside under John Wesley's message and in the baptism of the Holy Ghost under the Azusa Street baptism because it's the same baptism right you remember the little word the other week of dispensation and why brother Branham would say he believed in a dispensation but then he'd turn around and say I don't believe in a dispensation what's he doing he's exactly right said dispensation can't change you can't change you have a dispensation of the Holy Ghost is going all the way dispensation of just really above all the way if it's a dispensation of the Holy Ghost you'll go all the way see he was saying anything that stays and right will continue home so I believe in a dispensation then it's he'd say but see said if these things fall off now and it ends and something goes wrong and you lose that he said that's not a dispensation that's you called it that but I called it that because it didn't continue I hope you caught that last week but listen and then one day you'll get to the dispensation cause now listen I believe that the Lord Jesus went through that this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell went through his life three years and then he comes out two goes to Mount of Transfiguration and says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell here you him I'm going to back off I've got him here to me don't read I'm gonna back off jingle hear me no longer you're gonna hear him but he's gonna make me manifest cuz what did I say to start with the son is not the one to be made manifest you think it's you to be made manifest boy you got a blowed up head it's not you to be made manifest you manifest God he'll make you manifest yes wonderful but just remember I'm trying to get my father manifested to you I'm getting trying to get my father revealed to you it makes it a little different when you're born without it my daddy was died not for and I just never did have a daddy as you have but one day I found my daddy that's where Wade when he went out behind that building he said mama daddy where you at I'm having a heart attack it struck him he said but I don't need my daddy I need you Lord change things I said I'm glad I couldn't get the telephone that day why I said call tonight between me and you it's between you and God so you settle these things for y'all because you got to be done okay now come on anywhere you had an experience you started off as a new birth then you're gonna have a period of tutoring and training from the new birth you're gonna have a time but through the statue of a perfect man to bring out the virtues into the individual and in one day the headstones gonna strike the church all right let's see I believe that but what is the headstone to the church what if I told you is the headstone to the jury the seven seals cause what else is it if the cornerstone is the word then the headstones got its people word right come on be sensible that's the cornerstone is the word we don't at the Baptist Church go wake up we could read they become the head of the corner but around this use it like this one day he says becomes the headstone of the corner because he brought it into more of his understanding of where he was going with it okay give me a couple of more minutes but listen the Lord Jesus went through that and came out to the message you know he preached six seals Matthew 24 he preached six healed oh yeah the Prophet preached the seals the book came alive he said what about it he said since the opening of the seals he said the Bible became a brand new book right not a different book more of that that he had read all of his life now comes into VA into being and be viewed you know and seeing the revealing of the word so you're gonna have your own Mount Carmel experience so you're gonna have a place that you got a new birth and that's to bring you into the body of Christ or adopt you into the body of Christ as a baby a new birth not headstones not anything else I see then you get to tutorship statue of a perfect lamb well one day God's gonna take you out on the backside esra he's gonna visit you with an angel and he's gonna tell you what this prophet said is right you like that well you think he's gonna tell you you think he's gonna tell you something your cousin s that or the other you know where I was at when the Lord revealed the seals to me General Motors had a job that nobody could run they couldn't run it long enough for me to take a 16 minute break I had to help the man that had to know Joe I couldn't be out he took two people to run the job when I was out to see my hands with it that day I used to Dolph in the cotton mill and do working okay when the man the boss that hard or put me through on the job he said I'll guarantee you all look at the next record he said if I can see a doll for Alva cotton mill he said I'll put him on a job because they put me on the job it was supposed to take three days to learn in 15 minutes I was doing it and told a man go take care of his business I always had the whole job at one time I could run over 40 something jobs I had that good of a memory that I was absentee replacement for 40-something people but listen when he opened that first seal to me I was picking this piece of paper up and laying it down because it matched up and I had to make sure this compared to this to this and then I lay it down her necks in Italy it had to be an order of sequences etc and I could do that job within about 40 seconds out of 60 you know what that gave me 20 seconds to write you don't try 20 seconds I'd write now and lay it down write down let that write down lately just like that wrote a whole page I don't ever do this heaven help you ministers don't even listen to what I'm fixing this life but I've got a I'll just put it I can find out something if I need it and so I I just said well Lord I want to see if this is you I turned around to the man on the other side of the line and told him a joke now I'm not dirty I don't tell dirty jokes I'm talking about a joke just told him a joke I turned right back around picked that pin up started riding it never ended it a tended to this day when he showed me he said here stanza I'm the lamb with a book in his hand and said out there goes the white horse rider he said that's two people spam and ain't no two people there's just one that's how simple the opening of the word if I hear anybody say any more about how great what it is to tell me even more than that right there I'll tell you I don't believe it because that was how simple he said there's only one I said anytime in the Bible you see two he said one of them is the devil so that's always been my goal in this message or anywhere or somebody preaching I watch what you're doing with a Godhead i watch the way you're approaching the Godhead I don't care if it's wade who it is I watch it because my life is involved right I see what you're doing with the Godhead cuz you ain't got to Godhead right you ain't got to message right let Stan come on I'm sorry what I'm just saying yeah I had an experience with the baptism with the Holy Ghost and I spent twenty thirty years studying this message the 19 in 82 so that would have put me from 68 to 82 studying this message and the Lord showed me the opening of the seals you say you try to make yourself something no I'm just telling the truth it happened and I saw it that's how simple it is to you if you think about it think about your your life going through it think about well what happened I remember this and is this and something happened don't you think about God being able to reach down low enough to get me and you and to bring us up and it just unfolded words yeah Father we thank you we just tried to make it as best we could this morning we'll continue this afternoon we just ask you to be waiting them traveling richer than all of them coming in home Lord everything be all right have your way and just forgive our sins Lord just open their eyes to the understanding of what you would have to be said in this life stays got us now as we go either natural meal coming back together to fellowship in you around the word this afternoon we love you and we thank you in Jesus name and you're dismissed
