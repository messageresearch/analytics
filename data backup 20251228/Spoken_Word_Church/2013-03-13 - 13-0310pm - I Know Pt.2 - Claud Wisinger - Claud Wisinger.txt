amen amen hallelujah amen amen all right Hallelujah over brother just remain standing there you go yeah I want to ask brother Terrence one thing does this count against my 30 minutes okay he says no he let me know before I come out here I had he gave me 30 minutes but really what he's saying is he's going to uh stay awake for 30 minutes so if you're not here the last 30 minutes that's okay brother Dar okay so we I turn myself I hate it when that happens I already brought my notes in the floor too so we're going to continue on with what I ministered this morning about I know I know part two how that yeah U but I want to like I've been saying I've been preaching on the seals for the go since the middle of November so I want to just kind of continue on there but I'd like to start with the scripture reading if we would I'd like to start in Genesis 1 1-3 I know that's a strange one but thought you weren't going to do this well I wasn't then I told him what I was going to do so Joseph just like Johnny on the spot you know so let's go ahead and read the scripture in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that word God there is Elohim self existing I'm going to say something that's going to kind of maybe sound a little different brother brandom said God's filled all space and time right now that's the best way with the English language we can describe it but God was not in space nor was he in time so you understand that brother Brandon when he preached he tried to explain it in a language that's not good English language is the worst language on the face of the Earth right so brother R said Elohim filled all space and time actually the full essence of Elohim was it was just God yeah it was the Eternal God right so you know but to bring it to our finite Little P Canary brain he said it filled all space and time right well see God you can't put God in a sandbox you can't God is eternal you don't put him in a sandbox right God is Not time he's Eternal right so we just got to take what brother Ram said it's just the best English words that we can use to explain it so here it was God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void now that was you you came from the earth you were without form and void is that right and darkness was upon the face of the deep that was us yeah okay and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the Earth right so the first thing God did was the spirit of God moved upon the Earth right right now step two and God said y said is the spoken word right right does everybody agree with that and God said let there be light and there was light right okay let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we just pray that you give us understanding oh God and we just thank you for the prophet for the fful ministry and for the revelations that you give oh God like I said this morning I can't even express in English words how thankful we are so we're just going to use our little English language and say thank you Lord be with us in this service in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen what God has you may be seated what God has established in everybody understand Genesis is the sea chapter the beginning so God started something here in the beginning and the first thing he would do the spirit of God would move upon the Earth and then he would speak right and through the spoken word it would be light right what is light it's a revelation what did he do he revealed the Earth before that it was without form and void right so now I'm going to move in to the first seal on the day of Pentecost what came the spirit right is that what came to the church the spirit right you agree with that so the way God deals with the Earth is the way he deals with you what brought you to the church one day you maybe were out in the world you didn't even think about God and all of a sudden the spirit of God moved on you in the spirit realm he said you know you need to go to church or you know there's something wrong with you you're not right and then all of a sudden that what was it it was the spirit of God that mov then you were able to come into a church somewhere and hear the word and then what did the word do it brought you a revelation that's why brother brandom and I'm going to say it again like I said that's why it's so important to have a revelation right sure is right cuz it takes the void it takes the without form away and it brings something to you that is very powerful right is that right you know what it was able the Earth was able to do the seed was in the earth sure is that what he taught but when the light came it was able to bring forth the fruit from it right by their fruit you will know them right and that's why I told you this morning and I've really been big on the last year conduct order and Doctrine so it's not enough just to have the Mysteries you know Paul said you can know all the Mysteries you can know all of it is that right and be like a tinkling symbol just a just making a bunch of noise right we understand by the prophet your life speaks louder it's a it's a voice did you understand brother man said I would that there were a thousand live voices thunders in gesture is that right right your life is a thunder your life shakes people around you at word is that right so it's very important as message Believers when you say you're a message believer you have to have the conduct sir you have to have the order and you have to have the doctrine amen and I really and like I say this morning and I've been really strong at our church on the Mysteries I believe in the message ranks right we get to conduct I've heard preachers get up and preach all they'll preach ons they hair the teeth toenails the hair you know what I mean but no Revelation no mystery so what it's going to take it's going to take all three of those things to bring to the status of a bride right amen so what we need in a in a message ranks is a balance right does everybody agree with that right y so here in Revelations when I read this I thought that's exactly what happened in the first seal yeah look when when the what happened on Pentecost was the spirit to the church is that right what happened on the day of Pentecost was the Antichrist came now I'm going to tell you in the Garden of Eden where did Satan work on E in the spirit realm right yeah does everybody brother R said in the spirit realm you have five senses that contact your spirit reasoning y right imaginations conscience affections what's the other one memory thank you memory now let me let me say something to you the devil Works in what what did I say because you can't remember it oh yeah thank you sometimes I don't know how you brother bradam said a word is a thought expressed sometimes I'll say stuff my wife said did you know you said it I said no I didn't she said yeah you did I said well I didn't think it so it's kind of contrary to what brother brother said a word is a thought you know a thought is a it's like wow how do I how do you you know you'll be thinking Moses and you'll say Noah so you're going to have to just kind of keep up with me and follow along I say something wrong you're going to go huh everybody in church go I I'll stop and I go okay what' I say you know I know them well enough I know when I'm goofed up but anyway so God sends the spirit our way right that's how God works he moves on your spirit realm first and God will set you somewhere and he'll speak the word on you and then that word that light that Revelation is going to bring forth fruit does everybody agree with that well guess what the devil works the same way see the Devil is a perverter of the original is that right in the first seal what the devil went as the Antichrist writer does everybody agree what did he do in the Garden of Eden he started working on Eve's reasoning he started working in her spirit realm and once the devil got Eve to reasoning with the word right brother Ram said eve did not disbelieve is that what he said if you put all the quot now he says something but if you put all them together brother said eve did not disbelieve Eve reason is that right Eve did not come to unbelief right if she did she sined she's lost right that's why you can't come to unbelief right now you may reason with the word is that right but that's what caused the fall so in the first seal what started the Antichrist writer that went out what did he start doing he started working on those those saints that had the original word just like Eve had the or original word didn't she said don't it's simple just don't eat of that tree eat of the Tree of Life don't eat of that tree all is well so what did she start doing she start got the devil started working in her reasoning right and what happened once she reasoned it she reasoned it away that's what's going on in the message that's what's going on with a lot of message preachers they're reasoning away the original word that was given in this house because the thing that brother BR was to do was to turn our faith back to the apostolic fathers what was the faith of the the original word brother Ram said in the church age show the church age slide if you would I'm going to be dealing with it for a while but what the church fell from was the original Worden does everybody agree with that so the white horse rider that started coming out and I said on the day of Pentecost which was right so he started right what was he doing what what did the people start doing they start reasoning with the original word that was given to the church amen and upon their reasoning is how they fa right that was because everything here is reasoning is that right what God wants you to have is faith right just believe brother R said you you don't have to explain it just believe it just have faith just believe the simple word right the original word amen but what we have among the the message people pull people to to give more Revelation like something they got that the other guy don't have so you know it's it's kind of like what we have in America you know you got to have what the Smiths has you got to have more you got to have a bigger car a better house so what they got among the message is preachers are preaching a bigger Revelation than what you got I can't preach a different Revelation at different Christ what we have to get back to as as the bride is the original World if Eve would have stayed with the simple IC original word everything would have been well do everybody agree with that right so that's what happened in the garden of e they had the original word so what the devil started doing is working in the spirit realm so now is did the brother say that white horse rode all the way to the end right right what is the devil doing now he's work trying to work on you in the spirit is that he can't get me down in my soul I'm just like Eve he ain't going to get me to doubt this message but if I reason with it I'm going to get myself in hot water all right that's right the simple thing of it is you just simply have to believe it amen and God will bring it to pass is that right but what we do is we have a bunch of people that's starting to hybrid it mix their own ideas with it that's what I told you brother R after seal he said you ain't got a thought coming right you know your thoughts as good as my thought but I ain't got a thought my thought has to be thus sayth the Lord right I have to be founded on the original word I don't have faith right anybody agree with that so there's the problem we and look every one of you in this church don't tell me and you'll say you know nobody in the church loves me you know what the devil's doing he's working on your affection right he's saying nobody loves me there we've had people leave our church say there's no love there you know what they've done the Antichrist Spirit has worked on them worked on their Spirit realm to a point they don't think anybody in church loves them yeah that you read that for oh yeah that's what it is and so the devil will make you reason with things that's what we got among the ministry a lot of reasoning going on rather than just believe it that's right so you know it's just like I said when that preacher said this and I said this I didn't argue with him or if brother bam said it then I got an amen it right so what I need to do is go back to it and say what is he saying right I simply I said I would going to argue a quote with a quote Yeah I I don't get I don't get how preachers can argue a quote with a quote does that make does that seem stupid to all you it seems Mighty stupid to me I mean if that's the kind of message we got we're going to argue a quote with a quote yeah you can't do it right it's just like I told him in in the in the you know in the scripture says you know you no man's tempted of God and then it said he tempt you the scripture says you better not tempt God right but God cont tempt you brother R said confidence what I was talking about this morning God put a disease on you or God don't let put it God don't do disease that he'll allow something to come in your life right all he's trying to do is to prove your love to him exactly he he knows you he has confidence in you so God allows these things to happen just so you'll have confidence in yourself right that's where we lack is confidence in ourselves so what the devil's going to work on is the five senses in your spirit realm that's the Antichrist does everybody agree with that amen so if he can reason with it in memory you said it where does the devil work on you you know you you've come to the altar you repented but you can't forget what you did right you might have been married four or five times I don't know how many times and the devil will work on that like you can't be saved like that's the cardinal sin it sounds like Catholics now huh yeah but that's what he gets to do with you right so what's he doing he's working in your memory right so what you got to put your guard up as a people here as a bride Church in that Spirit realm when that Devil comes to you with that Antichrist spirit and tries to say nobody loves me or your you know it says if your conscience don't condemn you ask what you will right and you know so the devil always try to put you H I'm not you know remember brother Jewel wowy wowy me I like the way he puts it what's the devil doing he's working in your spirit realm and if he can ever get your spirit realm everything else is going to follow with that you understand what I'm saying so what we as a as a bride have to do we got to put our guard up in that Spirit realm don't you let that Antichrist that white horse rider right in your life right we can see it back here in symbol look right and I was talking about there's the symbol form the mystery form and reality form do you understand the first seal it's all three of them are open you agree with that what he started writing back here in reality form he rode right and in simple form it there right and we understand that was the Antichrist spirit is that right but look he didn't quit writing there no all that writer did was get off on a different horse Antichrist still rides does everybody agree with that now look this is way brother Brandon brought it in the fourth seal and I'm kind of I'm going to scatter this bad today this afternoon okay but this guy's already preached the almost the entire Book of Revelation you can pick up the pieces right so I have confidence in here I wouldn't scatter it this bad so the devil Works in these three ways remember brother brand said he took off as the Antichrist Rider here then he comes up here and he's a false prophet right is that right then's the Beast down here right everybody do you understand that's how the devil rides on you right he'll try to get the Antichrist Spirit to work on your spirit realm and then guess what if you start reasoning with it okay the look all of you been this hasn't been redeemed yet right does everybody understand that so the devil's going to try to get in your spirit realm and get you to reason with the word you're in trouble when you start doing that right away a red flag ought to come up the next thing he does is a demon you know what a demon is it afflicts this body that's what a demon does that's what's happened to me there's a demon that's been afflicting my body since December and I've been calling out to God I don't want it you understand what I'm saying now God has allowed it to happen to whatever he's doing for me he's doing something for me when when he put job on the as sheep it wasn't to beat job down no right God was trying brother R said the reason he put him on the as sheep was to bring him a revelation so God don't do these things and allow these things to happen to you just because right so don't you get the thinking if I got this or I got that God's mad at me or here you go you start in your spirit realm start reasoning with it you understand you got a demon that afflicts your body you understand so that's the way he'll attack you and the other one is the third one brother says the devil which is the personified person of the devil right do you understand in the fourth course writer that's what's going to come down is the person of the devil does everybody understand that brother said the Beast will become incarnate we understand in the pope we understand all the quotes right and you go to Revelations 12 and I always thought and I think I've said that here you know we talk about the third part of the Angels fell from heaven do you agree we're cast down to earth we understand that right but gu what faith took him out sin let him back in as soon as Eve sinned guess what those third part of the Devils can go accuse you now don't you don't don't think so that Lon Spirit come before the Throne of God in the days of Micaiah and said let me get down lie to them guys he said go do it did he so see those Devils have a right to go to God and accuse you right but God looks at the blood and says what are you talking about amen I don't see what you're talking about amen because why we have received atonement in this hour does everybody agree with that so see what happens is you go look at it in Revelation 12 it says the devil and his angels are cast down out of heaven right you know what there's another casting outcome brother said when we go up the devil gets cast down and his demons look it's over once we go up there ain't no accuser of the Brethren man forget it when we go up the devil had forget it there will be no there will be no working on your spirit realm no your body it is over once we go up is that right and that's what brother said we go up the Devil comes down Revelation 12 don't he say he's thrown down to Earth again and he says he knows his time short and he's mad y that is the personified that is the devil right does everybody understand that that's who gets cast down out of heaven so we ain't got no accuser that amen but as long as we're here in this body he'll come every time we make a stupid mistake he goes right up Throne says look what he did amen does everybody agree with that but the blood still applied I have atonement for that right brother R said it's the blood that keeps you saved is that what he said it's the blood that keeps you saved so thank God for the blood you say that right but I'm going to tell you something you know what brother R said the blood is for you the original word sure sure that's the only covering you have is the original word if you ever come out from under the original Cur word you're in deep trouble you HB it you've come out from the Blood Cuz brother said this word is the bleeding word is that right this message I'm going to say it where you this message is your atonement right right do you realize that in every hour the message that gave that was the covering for that church that was that was Paul's religion in that hour is that right when the when the message of Paul come and it wasn't the fullness of it had the revealed part of it hadn't come right it was revealed in part you agree with that said the messenger catches the Revelation and drops it down the people well those people guess what they had rapturing Faith they took they they're bride in that hour but they without us cannot be made perfect because why Paul said he looked through a glass Darkly there's there's more than what Paul had right amen okay everybody got that so there what we have in this hour is a complete Revelation a perfect Revelation there's no shadow in it at all right what we have is the perfect light has come amen amen is that right that's what this coming in this hour and it's a secret coming it's a mysterious coming it's the coming of Revelation 10 1-6 does everybody agree with that that's where the preachers are messing it up B and they I was reading it even in the breach do you understand it said he come he come to claim right is that right you know what claim means Tru right so when brother R puts it down here he come to claim what is it he's opened up the truth of this he's revealed It All To Us is that right like I told you he came down here at the day of pente he came to Paul he came to irus he came to Mark these were the voice of God in that hour weren't they each messenger he came to them they were the seven spirits of God right is that right somebody was talking there I said you know what your new birth is revelation 10:7 right brother said the 10:7 is the seven seal right exactly is that what he said so if you're going to get a birth in this hour you got to come to Revelation 107 before you're going to get to Seven you're going to have to go through 10 1-6 what is that it's the Thunders it that were uttered right is that right he couldn't write them the Mysteries were never written right right you agree right sure they weren't they were not made known until this hour amen okay so that's why when I talk about Mysteries I put a lot of emphasis on it cuz that's the new birth for this hour right but again you got to have your conduct you got to have your order you got to have your Doctrine and Mysteries is the doctrine that we have in this house so there's a balance to this thing I see a lot of people where they'll preach the Mysteries and their life's are wreck yeah yeah see you got it brother Brandon remember in the vision he had of of the the second time they C there were three on the back row out of step and brother Brown's voice hardoll said get in step right and what did he say they would sto looking at him well the prophet the messenger and the message or one amen what has people done in this hour they've taken their eyes off the message and if you don't get your eyes on this message you understand get your eyes off the world and the thing get your eyes in this message is what you need to do and what this message do is get you in step when they got in step brother BR see them go up right they took a Rapture everybody understand and brother said what is the hold up it's the Readiness of the bride God ain't waiting we ain't waiting on God God's waiting on us we're the ones that need to start getting in step with this message right so that's why I'm telling you and why I emphasize it's not and the Mysteries are a big big part of today right that's where your birth lies you understand but you need to get it all together right this bride is going to get it all together right does everybody agree what I'm saying so I'm I'm not I'm not trying to go over here and put it all I'm trying to give you a balance on what I'm saying it's kind of my disclaimer okay that we we ought we need to watch these things you understand so we understand so the white horse rider come out and he started working on her spirit realm right what did they do it took them into here where what did they do they took dogmas and Creeds right the first thing they started doing was and you talked about the it's true they started talking what was the first thing they got off from deity of Jesus Christ right you realize that's one of the first messages our Prophet taught in 49 he got us back on where they got off over here right he's going to turn us back to the faith of the original the faith of the fathers which was the original because look if you don't have the original you don't have the atonement right does everybody understand you don't have the atonement so what they did they got off with their dogmas and Creeds here what did they do they left the original word they bound the Holy Ghost because of that right so we understand here once that happened here what did he do brother said he rose and then he received a crown well you can't Crown a spirit brother B said he had to be a person if you're going to crown him you got to put him on a per they got a pope right what did they do they put a man over him what was it what was the white horse rider he went forth to conquering and to conquer right it was a nickan spirit that went forth where a man tried to come up with a Doctrine two Lords perusia and you know what you got to come to me brother Samuel if you're going to get peria you got to come to me what happens with the with the Antichrist writer a preacher old right rise up in the ranks of the message sure well well in the early church that Antichrist Spirit it didn't come out way out there it came right up among the Believers is that right he said there's Grievous wolves working Among Us now right there in sheep clothing but there W what were they doing they were bringing up reasonings the same went for right just a little bitty say there was somebody in our church I'm going to say it's a sister but she said yeah when my daughter turned 16 she can M pant she do what she wants I said where is that in the message yeah yeah you know that's a say and you know what as a pastor when a say Goes Forth into the church I got to kill that thing yes I said look you show somebody showed me a quote where brother B said when your daughter's 16 she started painting her face cutting her hair wearing where does it say that right does it say 18 does it say 21 if that Maiden lives in your house she's got to come under the token in your house the token is this message right that's the blood of this hour it's this message so I told her I didn't tell her I just preached it you know of course I got a little church like 40 people everybody knows who I'm talking about you know I mean you preach something in our church and it's like everybody go oh yeah yeah yeah you they know who you're talking it's like I told them I'm preaching against Spirits not people right and I'm not but what it is it's a say it's a spirit that Creeps in it could be a little bitty say that went forth right but it's contrary to the message and when that thing goes that's an antichrist right and you'll start and what she she reasoned with it right somehow I don't know how she got in her head that 16 was the golden number where the girls could do what they wanted I don't see it and I so I had to go out there and just just kill it you know what I mean that's what we have to do when we see a say or Spirit coming in among the church as a pastor you got to go out and kill that thing right cuz look if if a spirit gets off on this man young man not let it stay there get off on this young man it'll get off on that young man and you know what I'll on a day of judgment he'll be responsible for this church if he let a spirit go in this church knowing it was the wrong Spirit it wasn't according then he'll answer for it and that's why I take it's a grave responsibility when you're a pastor to go out there and take care of things that's right so I was telling them today do you realize when you go and look at the the the seventh Church age it says rebuke has anybody ever seen a message like William Braham that rebuked show me can anybody think of any messenger ever that rebuked the people like brother Braham did that's right so if you believe there's a seven Church age messenger then I I believe he was brother Brown amen you know what they in man on the earth that ever rebuked the church like he did right amen that was the spirit of that Messenger to rebuke right amen and I got news for you we're still living in Le oosa if this man don't rebuke those spirits that come in he's got the wrong Spirit right exactly you so you have to rebuke those Spirits when they come into your church what it's an antichrist spirit that comes in and tries to take a hole that's what happened to Eve and caused the whole fall right amen so what the church left here they left the original word y amen is that what they left sure they left but look when a red horse rider went out okay you look at what brother brandom says under the red horse rider when the red horse rider went out we know he went out with a sword a bloody sword right right do you know the church had the original word so they had the bloody word sure so what did they combat that red horse rider with the original word the bloody word is that right so and the white horse rider come out it was the Holy Spirit and Antichrist Spirit the red horse rider that went out he had a bloody sword what do we they had they had original word word come on isn't that what they had they what did they combat him with the original word so the red horse rider still riding in this hour right you know what'll happen he'll come up he'll come up with a saying and then you know what he everybody in the church will believe this preacher when he I'm just going to use that peria okay I believe in God's presence but hey if I just preach peria yeah that's sanctification sanctification ain't going to take you to Rapture like I said let's just be honest that Rapture ain't Bru you right Rapture is in the person right does everybody agree with that amen so that's what they do then they saying and then guess what they go out and they preach in another church and another church say oh I see what he's saying you know I get it okay then they'll preach it and if you don't go along with it they'll kill you yeah go ahead go to a message Church you don't agree with them see if they won't kill you exactly that's the red or Rider right here in our midst he'll kill your influence brother said if you kill a man you his influence killed them that ain't nothing but the spirit of the red horse rider does everybody agree with that am so the red horse is still riding right amongst the message right now come on that's what it is right remember it's the bride in the church right in the church ages it says unto the angel of the church then down at the end of it it says unto the churches right there's the bride and there's the church exactly in this hour we know the difference the bride has the original word the church has the hybrid that's why she don't have the Holy Ghost we got the Holy Ghost cuz we have the original word right right so what did they battle the red horse rider with the original word right you think is a red horse rider still riding today yeah how are you going to battle him with the original word you take a quoth and show him this is what he said here this is the original word they say yeah but he said this over here yeah see they can't like I say they don't have a they can't have Hebrews 4:2 where they mix it with faith right there's where the problem so we go there then you go into the third one right the third one's a black horse rider right now I'm going to tell you that's that's a bad one yeah that's a money hungry outfit yeah did you know that it is it's a money hungry outfit it's all he is right he got the wealth he combined religion politics he he captures the wealth of the world did he not brother random said a man if I've heard heard it I've actually heard of thisen they'll pass the offering plate tithing plate the deacons will go back to the back count they didn't get enough they'll come out and say okay we're going to pass her around again you know that ain't nothing but the black horse rider right brother man said these evangelist that that beg for money it ain't nothing but the black horse rider and we got people in the message now say okay we're going to build a new church so I tell you what you go hawkk your house get 30,000 bucks or go get you a second mortgage or whatever for 3040 $50,000 and we're going to build a church yeah goad right you don't let ain't nothing but the black horse rider I'm going to tell you that ain't nothing but the spirit of the black horse riders all it is you get a preacher it's all the time panhandling for money you got the black horse rider r in your M you better watch that fell is that right then they'll turn around and sell the church and keep the money that's that's a Fe buddy you talk about a black horse rider in our M but I'm serious so we look at these things we put them back there and they're happening today they're happening right in our midst do you understand so these preachers will come up with the say they'll kill you I mean you just disagree a little bit and Buddy they won't even have you In a Pulpit they're scared to death of you they'll kill your influence right that's just the red horse riders all of this the black horse rider what he's a money hungry outfit right he wants to control everything you know is that right amen that's what he is and then you get the black horse rider he's all of them mixed up he's a real high breeded fell he's the personification of the devil oh yeah he is that's what he is does everybody agree with that amen that's what he is so let me go back and show you something brother said when Eve she reasoned with the word does everybody agree with that right she failed God gave her a substitute right you know what said D what did he give him he gave him a lamb a bloody lamb that was a substitute till the the full type of it the Lamb of God come now I'm going to say something to you and I know this going to be a little startling maybe but God when they fell here this eve fell God gave him a substitute oh yeah something a little pacifier to hold on to till the whole thing come at the end does everybody that's what I was telling you about when I say the just shall live by faith that was just a substitute now that's a hard one a it right that was something for that church to hang on to till we get down here to the end where he says it it's not as if you done it you never did it so you understand I don't have a substitute for this hour I have the fullness of the word and what I've been talking about to the church this church is a bride you have the fullness of the word does everybody understand that I don't have part word right I do not I have the fullness of the word in this so God through the church wouldn't he do it the same way he did to Eve if he dealt with the world he move the spirit on him then he sends the word ain't he going to do you the same way he ain't going to do you any different than he does if it's a work of bringing things forth right if he's going to bring some something fruit forth than you he's going to do you the same way God don't change his mind does everybody understand that that's why everybody it just kills me when you talk about Daniel's City Works they're so afraid of it it's Redemption to the Jews but yet they don't want they don't want that they want the Redemption to the G it's no different right it's not a bit different the way God does the je or if he is that he's partial right or if he did he changed his mind what kind of God do we have if he changes his mind about Redemption amen we're in trouble right so it just it just preachers that's all I can tell you preachers preachers preachers that's the problem so so we you you see what I'm saying you got the White Horse Rider red horse rider and then what happened when fell here God gave him a substitute he did he gave him a substitute part word here just a substitute he gave Wesley a substitute he gave the Pentecost a substitute they fell in love with the substitution right instead of taking the person that's coming this hour they fell in love with the substitute isn't that exactly what happened in the Old Testament right they didn't want you know John preached out there there's com today we won't have that sacrifice anymore right mad right they didn't want to give up the old substitute they held the substitute more important than the real so what we have in this message they'd rather have the substitute than the real then the Mysteries that's came contained under the seals they'd rather have the substitute I don't want the substitute I don't want the part I want the fullness of the words what I want that's what's been given in this hour is the fullness of the word amen every promise every verse in the book is mine and I want it it's mine has anybody ever seen a kid you hand a kid a toy and mine mine mine mine that's the way I am I'm just like it it don't bother me at all they're that way right you give me the Bible and I'm going to say it's mine mine mine mine and you're going to have to take it away from me right I seriously don't you hold on to this message that way you better hold on to the message that way cuz I'm going to tell you the devil's here to take everything away from you amen that's his job if he can take any first any promise away from you he's going to take it and I'm not going to let him take it does everybody understand so he gave him a substitute through the church ages until the real thing come right they couldn't take the real right they did it just like the Old Testament folks did pretty sad is it yeah so we got a lot of preachers that are holding on to the substitute and they won't take the real right remember he said the reality of it right there's a reason he said that so they won't take the reality of what we've got they want to substitute right that's what they want they say God sent a prophet you know brother Jess he cracked me up when he used to minister he said he went down to Mexico one time there was a preacher preaching there it's preached for years he said I'm I'm saying I'm preaching just what I was 25 years ago brother Jess was sitting on the front row stood straight up started hard and screaming Said Amen brother when he got home he said he is he's preaching the same thing I already preached 25 years he had moved up one bit that brother thought he was backing him up sister Peggy he was just saying absolutely you're still still saying the same thing you haven't moved up on Iota but is that what they say and they don't move up into Revelation the word see that's what we've got to do as a church move up Church come on up come up hither go up where the Revelation is right right so that's that's the problem we got they say we let's say what's said on tap and and what I use is this when Jesus was talking to Nicodemus you remember the story Nicodemus come to him said now we know that's pretty bad we know you're a man sent from God in private they can say that yeah he told him me said you must be born again he said can I call up in my mother's womb right he went carnal on him right he said you being a rabbi a teacher and you don't know these things and you know Jesus said you must be born again right and then you go back and you say and he said and you don't know these things so I thought well then there has to be the Old Testament talk about the new birth right well what does it talk about in new T Ezekiel 36 he'll give you a new spirit see that's where God works first is in your spirit realm and brother said he'll give you a new spirit de agree with the Holy Spirit right is that what he said right right so then he what he gives you a new heart right right that's the new birth it's telling you about the new and then it says and you do it right Does anybody read that little last part past the commment remember Ezekiel 30 says and do it right ain't no very many remember people in the Wilderness they said oh yeah Moses we'll do the T we'll do it they never did it no you know they never did they do it they never did it see that's the trouble we have in the message right when I'm talking about conduct things they don't do that part of it they want a new spirit they want a new heart but they don't want to go do it right right so see what the new birth is it's going to be all those things come together right right so Nic Jesus paraphrased it now people in the message would say say only what say on tap so if I said that today they say you're not saying what we hear Brown said is that what they would say right that's the point I was making they don't mix it with faith right and and I'll be honest I paraphrase a lot but I keep the continuity of what the message says right I tell the church back home I use okon you've heard me say that this guy talks in whatever Georgia whatever it is right but he keeps the continuity of the scripture right but boy if you come up with something it's just not verbatim What brother Bram said some of these preachers will look at say you're not saying what brother Bram said they don't have enough Faith to understand brother said if you got the Holy Ghost you'll amen the word right Jesus paraphrased the word if anything Nicodemus the smart thing would have said to be say Amen right right even though he didn't understand it if he'd have been smart he'd have just said amen right is that right then God would have revealed it to him instead of doing that he he starts saying he starts reasoning with it right right that's what he did but so that's the complaint I have about message they ain't got enough hold Holy Ghost to where if you pray paraphrase a quote or something they can't get it right right well like you said they're readers see it's proof what I agree totally with what you say I see that so it just irritates me now I wish you had never told me that cuz it really irritates but it's the truth if you don't say it verbatim like brother Ram said you're not saying what brother Ram said they don't have enough Holy Ghost to read between the lines it's not a love letter to them do you understand what I'm saying there's the problem we have in the message right they don't understand the love level okay okay so we understand how we understand the first seal second seal third fourth now look this one's reality this is all three forms are done you agree with that the mystery of it been made known to us the reality form of it he started his dve back here on the day of Pentecost right and we understand that the uh the so of reality the mystery and the symbol form it's done the first first seal done we understand it second seal same way right it's over third seal same way right now the force SE we know the mystery of it but that Beast hasn't taken his right yet because look I have to go up before that Ral comes down so the reality form is not here yet it's not physically here on the earth yet but the spirit of it here do you agree that that what is it death what is it organization denm and brother the four seal this is what he hits in the four seal a lot he talks about ISM he said communism fascism and what's the other one communism fascism Nazism ism is a spirit if there's an ism that comes in the church it's a spirit amen is that does everybody got that and denominationalism is a spirit right the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a spirit ISM baptism so anytime you see ISM on it it's a spirit so you have to see what the spirit of it is what drives that thing right right so see that's what we've had in the message we've had brother Braham to come and we don't have to be deceived we know every ISM out there we understand Nazism socialism communism right right we understand all that romanism right come on so anytime you put ISM on the end of it what is it it's a spirit drives that so brother man the fourth course writer told us all these things we understand what's coming up don't we understand don't we understand that Devil's going to take them to the battle of Armageddon like I said the first W the second W the third W first world W was World War I second W was World War II does everybody agree with that so we we understand that isms is nothing more than a spirit right so if there's an ism that rises up in this church it's simply a spirit right and this man has to take care of anything that's not the Holy Spirit right okay so we and it's death what follows those isms what follows denominational ISM death it's received a name is that right so we've got a name for the fourth horse riter he's dead I know what it's going to be it's just not a reality yet right until I go up he comes down now brother B when he starts to look at the the fifth seal brother Bram does something in the fifth seal I was looking at it brother Bram starts talking about himself quite a bit oh yeah I going to tell you something about the fifth seal you won't understand it if you don't accept that prophit he can he can prove the first FL he can prove the first FL by history right can he oh brother said this the seals blend perfectly in with the church agents and it doesen is that right brother brand could take the first seal the second F third he said the the black horse rider was the Dark Ages how much simpler can you get than that exactly he can prove that by history is that right fif seal is a little different yeah a fifth seal you're going to start I'm going to tell you if you don't take brother random as your Prophet you ain't going to make it you ain't going to get it that's right I know that sounds odd no it doesn't you know that the truth you got to have a prophet to guide you through that F seal I'm going to tell you brother R went strong on it everybody agree with that am now I'm going to tell you something I don't know if you thought of it let's go read it uh you got that scripture don't you re uh St Matthew uh 24 9-13 I told Brother Joseph to get it I hope you got it you got it brother Joseph there you go now brother brand said that from 249 to 13 was the the seal do you agree with that what he said now let me show you something then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hat of All Nation for my name's sake do the Jews believe in his name this is a fifth seal right see what people always what you this is what I thought of when I looked at you look at the fifth seal and brother R and what we always do is we say the fifth seal is is those is those 6 million Jews that died under Hitler and he did say that so let me ask you something if the fifth seals the Jews what's it have to do with me right you ever think of it you think of come on open up think about it if it's got to do with just those Marty Jews then what does it have to do with me right does everybody agree with that does you understand brother said that fifth seal is the martyrdom seal right the Seal of the martyrs there were 68 million that died for his name sake those 68 million died under the fifth seal righten yeah you see what I'm saying right the 68 million died under the Martyr sea the 12 apostles were Marty sure they were that's who he's talking to here right right they died under a martyr seal they died under the fifth seal I know I see you guys you haven't heard this before I know well but you have I'm bringing it a little different approach maybe the fifth seal is a martyr seal didn't he say it's a mar Dum seal and I got that when I got thing I thought well you know if if the seals are to the Gentiles is that what he said and the trumpets are to the Jews yeah so if the seals are to the Gentiles the fifth seal is totally to the Jew then there's something wrong with the picture it has to apply to us also does everybody understand the fifth seal has to apply to us so then you got to ask yourself how does it apply to the Gentiles is everybody okay with what I'm saying amen so brother Rand the fifth seal is now going to start breaking it down and explaining how the fifth seal applies to us right now we think of the Jews that were killed the 6 million I've got in my paper here I read to the church in in 1290 ad the King Edward of England was killing Jews he dismissed them from England put them on boats and they drowned out in the sea is that right you're saying okay so you know so those Jews died under the Martyr sealen they they found in Wells in England where the a whole Jewish Clan was killed and thrown head first into the well so see what did they die for strictly being a Jew is what brother R said that just didn't happen under Hitler and Hyman right does everybody understand the Jews started being look the father brother BR said the father blinded them does everybody agree with that right now what brother brand what I think is so perfect about the fifth seal he's showing how not all of Israel will be saved does everybody agree with that not one of Israel true Israel will be lost I think that's a marvelous Revelation because look all the bride will be saved do you agree but all that's bride is not bride you can sit right here in our midst and say you're bride and you're not bride I hope that's not true what I just said but does everybody got what I'm saying he said all of Israel is not Israel does everybody agree with that statement but all of Israel shall be saved and the father blinded them you agree with that the father blind but he didn't lose one of them he blinded that was Israel true Israel they had their name on the book before the foundational World cuz remember this plan that we got is the he was talking we talking about it's the Plan of Redemption as part of the plan of it was all done before the foundation the book was in before the foundation of the world your name was put on a book before all that the father hath given me will come to me if the fifth seal should give you one thing it ought to give you aurity if your name is on the book and if you got the Mysteries the Mysteries are calling your name that's on the book right does everybody understand the Mysteries are calling your name right God ain't giving you a revelation just to fluff something right no God don't do something just to be doing just beating his gums like we do most of the time God's not like that no so the fifth seal has to be of the Gentiles do you agree right it has to be but it's the Martyr seal right so we need to go in here we need to understand what is he talking about exactly brother R takes us right here to this and what really caught my K says and I thought I why why why what is it about the fifth seal that applies to us J it's a seal it's to us right the trumpets are to Israel you agree he says the same thing he preached them supernaturally underneath the seal right so what does he do he says for my name's sake the Jews don't have his name they have the testimony of the word right and they what it says under the fifth seal he said they died for the testimony that they held it was the testimony of the word but it was not what they held the law the Jews stayed true to the law and they died because of it made them A peculiar people and nobody likes somebody different right that's why they want to kill you cuz you're different right you're a peculiar you're a one-of a kind people they don't like you they didn't like the Jews they're not going to like you they really don't want us here and one day we're not going to be here thank God for that that's right so ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name sake right that's not talking about the Jew do you agree with that that's the Gentile but brother use this passage of scripture to bring it to us right now look 68 million Protestants died a martyr's death go read it under Fox's book of Martyrs right brother so look what is if it's a martyr seal now look at the way brother B when he starts to really break it down he said Uriah Smith Barry l or Barry L that's a Bic player I used to follow B I love baseball play for the was L I told myself there didn't I that came back that's my that's my memory there's that thing you got to watch out for Mr memory okay so under under the mar seal there were 68 million Protestants killed right right now those 6 now brandom starts explaining something under the fifth seal which I thought was real we were talking about and you hit on I told him I said you're hitting on what I'm going to talk about and what I really said it was timeout quit you're taking my fire you know you know you can take a preacher's fire if you ain't care of well you can that's why you don't want a song leader get up here and carry on in the Pulpit right he's supposed to be a song leader okay thank you right Jess used to tell me that you got mad let me tell you what happened our church one time I used to go up and start C and I got to and I sang that uh you know uh about the dove on the wings of a snow white dove and I said well did you know and when I just come out said well brother Claud stole my fire that's what I'm preaching on tonight so you step behind the pulpit there's an anointing there right as a song leader you'll get an anointing and take his fire it's why you need to be careful that's why brother Ram said you don't want a song leader carries on right is that what he said okay I believe everything he said the little things the big things Amen in between things I really believe it I don't believe brother R was just throwing fluff out your hor I don't think he was filling space on pages I do not believe that I believe it we'll come under the conduct of every quote of this message right it'll it'll bring value you understand right so these were killed for his name's sake we understand under the fifth seal everybody everybody's read to they died for the testimony or not the testimony of Jesus Christ for the word of God right they didn't know Jesus Christ they rep the Aton exactly they didn't know the Christ at all did they so this right here under the fifth seal is talking about us Gentiles we're the ones that died for his name's sake this 68 million you either believe you claim to be a Christian and they killed you right right you claim to be Catholic life was good you know of course they had brother said they had it easy right they claimed to be they took him out and killed him we claim to be a Christian and the devil's every devil and hell was aim at us right everybody understand that it talks about the trumpets you know it says the river your fredes right brother said they're already loosed so I don't try to go explain the trumpet I believe a lot of it's already been done right right now can I explain every minute detail of it I don't can you can you put a quote with every one of them I can but a large portion of those trumpets are already fulfill brother said all seven trumpets sound under the six seal man exactly is that what he said yeah okay a little more to that than what you think too I might bring in a minute so it talks about his namesake so they were martyred right brother BR what he then what he started to do and he said okay remember Uriah Smith he said he believed that the only altar there was in heaven was the incense altar right that's in chapter 5 of Revelation where the oders were poured out on the altar right the prayer of the Saints so he could see that so brother Rand in the fifth seal of course he does soul sleeping that we talked about too don't believe in Soul sleeping here that's right they're not sleeping right amen they're not they're in the sixth Dimension they're not sleeping everybody understand that brother cleared that doctr out so in the fifth seal what he's talking about it's a martyr seal 68 million of were Marty so brother Brown then what he starts doing watch real careful how he he starts explaining about the ones in the sixth Dimension they're under the altar of Jesus Christ they died for the testimony of Jesus Christ exactly now they died under the Martyr seal but they didn't stay under the Martyr altar they went to the altar of Jesus Christ so Brother renam Talks of three altars in the fifth seal it's the incense altar the altar sacrifice Jesus Christ and he talks about the martys AL do everybody understand that so this is the way God does it through the church if it's a Jew that died now he's not going to lose a one I think that's beautiful guys they were blinded in part the fullness of the Gentiles come in so if they were a Jew and they stayed true to the law they stayed true to what they knew right then God put them under a martyr altar the Jew the Gentile the 68 million that were killed under the fifth seal right he put them under the altar of Jesus Christ now we don't have to wonder brother am the fit seal told us that what did he do in the fifth seal he said remember that 92y old lady that was saved in one of his men he went up there she had a white Rob right see they're not going to go to the white Throne judgment they got a white Ro what would be the purpose in sending people in the sixth Dimension that's under the altar of sacrifice to the white Throne what are you going to get there right is he going to condemn them is he going to give them eternal life there they already got it they already have a white Ro is everybody got it so what they did brother and that's what I said this morning there a reason I said it brother Ram said when they cut Jesus off at the crucifixion right he quit dealing with him as a nation right right he's not going to deal with him again as the nation until he sends him two prophets to then it's over for us right yet there will not be another Gentile saved once he goes is that what he said that's right what I said it's what he said so what did he do brother said he'll save individual Jews that'll come what under the testimony of Jesus christly what did he do on the day of his individual Jews does everybody it was indvidual Jews on the day of PC were saved the Jews were already the nation was cut off When They Crucified it that's the point I was making it goes right back to the fifth seal is where it'll take you back to look when we chopped him up on our conference room he quit dealing with uh with the church ages now he brought us into a bright age now he deals with us as an individual does everybody got what I'm saying he's not going to deal with Lula church as a church right Luther he could deal with them as a church right right you see what I'm saying but he don't deal with us as a church we're in the bright age he deals with you individually that's why the point I was trying to expl if you're going to understand a fifth seal you have to understand he deals with you as an individual right forget the church deal okay remember Luther was a reformer right you go look up the word what did he do he reformed a church all he did was create another organization he didn't but the ones that followed him did exctly Brother Bram did not create an organiz brother random was a restorer he was like you said He restored the altar your heart it's not going to take me to a church it's going to take me to a rde right exactly that's what this message does I'm not trying to create a church Glory brother R wasn't trying he didn't even want them to call it brandom Tabernacle he wanted to his name so disassociated with the church right he said don't call it to brandom Tabernacle but they did it so he went along with what they did see it's not the church it's the bride we're in the bride age does everybody got that right forget the church those are lodges over there if you come here and it's a you say I belong to the Lula Church yeah I belong to the Spoken Word Church you're belong to a lodge exactly all you're here for is the Breads and the fishes you better come for one purpose and that's that the reveal words being preached in this church is that's your mate that's the bright Ang EXA amen so we understand under that fifth seal is the Martyr seal anybody that gets marted goes under that seal yeah anybody if the mar seal that's what he said that's not what I said what he said but if you have the testimony of Jesus Christ you're go to the altar of Jesus Christ the Jews went under the altar of the martyrs does everybody agree with that explain that yeah I did I just want to go over it one more time you did good you did good I know I got 30 minutes ter but hang on bu that was 30 minutes that was 30 minutes ago I know so what does when the fifth seal opens does everybody agree with that that's right when the F fifth seal opens what does he do he leaves and he comes down to the Martyr altar yeah and brother and I he didn't say this and it seals he says it later on he pulls those Jews out from under the Martyr Altar and puts them under the altar of Jesus and he gives them white robes you agree with that they're under the Martyr altar but they don't have the Holy Ghost how could they have the Holy Ghost when all they had was the law right exactly amen does everybody agree with that so what brother Ram said they were under all those Jews that were killed through the church ages they were blinded so God didn't lose the one don't you think that's wonderful I think it's wonderful right not one of Israel was lost all of Israel shall be saved and the fifth seal it's proven his word to us right so every one of those Jews that were killed under martyrdom through the church Ages were under the Martyr seal he comes down when we go up then he goes down deals with the Jews in the fifth seal the first thing he does he talks to those Souls that are under the altar right under the martyr's Altar and what does he do he moves them up here he tells them who he is they recognize Jesus now they don't just have the testimony of the father they have the testimony of Jesus Christ they're given white robes now I'm going to tell you something they don't go to the Judgment either right why would they go to the white Throne judgment if they got white robes insane to do that what would they be judged for he already said they're good I'll give them the White Road they were given White Road is that right then he goes down and he deals with the 144,000 what does he do he gives them the white Ro what is it it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost he gives them eternal life is what he gives does everybody understand that so the 144,000 will not be at the white Throne the martyrs that were martyred through the church ages the true Jew to stay true to the law will not go to the white Throne that's right exactly amen oh those are going end up Millennial yeah exactly every one of them right every one of them end up in the millennial amen when I read this this time I said oh man I was excited about cuz now what brother R does he explains the different altars to us nobody knew that before the fifth seal if you're going to understand the fifth seal if you're going to understand he grants eternal life you're going to have to take your profit to do it right you're this is what's going to split people that's what's happening out in the message that's why people are falling away they never really believed brother R was a prophet right they never did if they believed he was it's just like me I am so committed to believing even though he said this over here and this over there I was going to drop out of the message are you going to drop out a message to Mark how many quotes do you read in a week that's like that exactly I don't know about you but as further I go along the more Revelation I get I read this one and that one it goes I mean I literally my eyes bug out I'll say Okay Lord Brother brand was your Prophet you're going to stand by the words of your Prophet I do not believe your prophet's word will hit the ground right he's an ambassador you send an ambassador to a country if that Ambassador says some there the president of United stat has to keep it now not this one this guy we got in I he's a thug might as well tell you the truth he's a Chicago Thug everybody he's put in is a Chicago Thug right I'm going to go there yeah I know already here so but when I got to looking at this and all that time I preach I preach four or five times on a fit sale never fully understood and I'm not sure I still fully understand this is the understanding I have today you see what I'm saying we think think think think if the seals are to us yep it has to be it has to apply to us right and then you have to ask where does it apply to us now we know is that right now we know with the fifth seal Y is everybody okay with that now then let's talk about we understand the church and I'm go to the six trumpet now the six seal if I'll do that then I'm going to stop I'm only in aren't I I'm doing pretty good I'm doing pretty good ter no you're not he said man some people you just can't make them happy right now so let's move the six se we understand the sment seal brother judgment seal I call it tribulation seal I like to call it the Redemption seal cuz the Earth is redeemed under the six seal right Israel is redeemed under the six seal right I like the six seal I haven't started preaching on it yet right but I'm going to now brother I'm going to show you something when brother do everybody understand that this here show me the church age chart Again Church age chart Brother Joseph I'm going to say something blow your socks off a little bit okay which I kind of do that does everybody understand this is the Feast of Pentecost yeah right it was what 49 7 7 what happened here every seven there was a trumpet blown on the S the these people entered into their rest and there was a trumpet Bor BL Paul was the trumpet if a trumpet give an UNC Paul was the trumpet to this age the people that accepted that sound went with him and they entered into their arrest does everybody agree with everywhere here that's the seven trumpets right right sure right brother Brandon preaches the Feast of the trumpets and he mentions the seven trumpets it has nothing to do with the Feast of the Trump trumpets right now that's going to sound a little hard is now let me tell you why okay let me tell you why this is the Feast of Pentecost at the end of it when that Mighty Angel come that was the Jubilee or the shout does everybody agree with that we have entered into 50s right yeah which is the Jubilee remember the quote brother Ram said when the Jubilee come you can throw down your hoe right but until that happen keep hoing exactly I'm not hoing right right I've entered into my Jubilee I've thrown mine down ceased from my Works does everybody understand we're looking for something to happen when it's already happened I ain't holding I'm like Ruth I'm resting it's a relaxing time is that what seven seal he said relaxing time what was it the coming of the Lord what was it when he indicted him here he end the church agents were dying I'm going to be honest God don't Church forget it he's on the outside look at that amen but out here in the bright age when the Jubilee come here's you owed no man nothing right right you didn't have fornication you you went back to the original right right does everybody understand that right at the Jubilee you went back to the original at the time of this we go back to the original Faith that's what literally turned our heart back right everybody got what I'm saying that's where at now look when this trumpet blew this trumpet here the Jubilee blew in the Tabernacle first yeah that priest got on an old donkey and rode him for a year through the land I believe that's why he's riding this Trail again if I'm going to take that quote and put it in the Bible I'm going to put it there you saying I'm taking a lot on myself I believe it did he on when that Jubilee sounded he blew in the Tabernacle around preach the seals in the Tabernacle first right is that what he said right the Lord promised him he'd go to the Tabernacle first that goes right along with the scripture that ain't a mistake exactly so what did he blew the trumpet there then that that priest gets on that donkey and he rides it through all of Israel right and he blows the trumpet through Israel and everybody that's hoing ters when they hear the sound of the trumpet they throw it down look I've heard the sound I'm not going to hold Tas in right forget the t hold is over for me right it is come on let's just be real about it I understand what preachers are saying when they say but if I've entered into my rest I've gone back to the original I get my original possession my and what what did he do down here to do brother said he come here to to Proclaim right what was rightfully his exactly has anybody ever looked up the word claim look if I know that brother you do woodworking I think don't you if I if you were doing it for a house and they didn't pay you you'd go down and put a lean on their house right right now that lean is the truth that they owe you money right right so you got a claim on the property right look when Jesus come down here at the end time to what claim his property exactly it's what did he do he opened the seals which was what the Thunder's truth right and he proclaimed it in all the land he proclaimed it what did he proclaim the truth has come and I could go free there's no lean against me there's no sin there's nothing against me that can stop me now so forget the potato ho I'm through holding containers right really I am right right amen so this was brother get the quote up I gave in uh questions answers in 64 on 08 30 I think so brother Bram when he's preaching on the seven or see this is what we think in our mind we think when brother br's preaching on the last trumpets he's preaching on the seven trumpets yeah no he's not when he's talking about the last trumpets it's two trumpets to Israel the Feast of the trumpets was two silver trumpets that were blown in Israel right does everybody understand what I'm saying that's what he's talking who are those two trumpets Moses and Elijah to Israel so brother Ma look what he says here I want you to read this like the other day now brother M is preaching this requ 08:23 he preached the seven Trump or the Feast of the trumpets 07 707 you agree right now 7even is the equal July is equal to October mhm so he was preaching the Feast of the trumpets when the October the 1st of October is when those two silver trumpets sounded which corresponds back to our calendar in in July does everybody got that right if you don't he'll explain it he say right like the other day I got something mixed up now he's saying that's why I told you if brother BR mxed up messed up Daniel 70 weeks he would have told you right brother telling you here I messed something up in the east of the trumpets that's what he's saying is that what he's saying listen as I read it like the other day I got something mixed up I happened to hear it and I caught it right there and it's on the tape right and I'll probably hear from it right when I was talking about the seven trumpets I said it was seven trumpets I was referring to the Pentecostal Feast the Pentecostal Feast is the long Feast of seven Church ages right so when you're talking about the seven trumpets it's talking about the church Angel the seven trumpets you agree sure I said it was a I was referring to the Pentecost from the Pentecostal Feast until the seven until the trumpets there was seven sabbaths seven Sabbath was between the Feast of Passover to Pentecost Pentecost penty means 50 right right right right you see which made the 50 days see but what I was referring to being that I said that means needs of seven Church ages when you're referring to seven trumpets is referring to seven Church ages right when brother man's talking about the feast to the trumpets he's talking about Two Trumpets right what is those two trumpets going to bring Israel the atonement right what did they leave off they took the law that's why I told you that Elijah that comes is not going to turn their hearts back to the apostolic father they never left the law right they have kept the law so he's not going to have to do that work that's why they doing three and years took us 2000 right right that's right am we messed up the law so bad it's pathetic right that's what I hate people you go to any denominational church tell me if I'm right they'll say oh that was under the law I got a guy that comes to our church he was married to but before he came to our church now he's coming real good saintly brother I love him to death but his wife wasn't happy with him so he went to the preacher there in his nominal church and said well I don't believe God God wants you to live unhappy so you put him away you divorce him yeah not a bit of scripture for that the law don't mean anything to these nominal churches the law convert look the the law of the Lord is going to convert soul is that what it says the law right so you say you say you've had a change your Nature's we say that right well if you don't believe the law how you going to get a change right that's why brother R had to send us back to the original the law why we left the law the law meant nothing to us Gentile right everything was Grace right right now what they preach out there yeah sloppy Grace yeah that's what they doing message churches yeah oh you believe the message that's okay brother SEL you can wear high heels this long you can wear the splits up here that show your underneath clothes you believe the message that's okay see they won't preach the law anymore the law is nothing to people it's ridiculous the law is that's what's going to keep order in the church that's what's going to keep you bride materialy you know we got cut and pter in the message they cut out what they want they paste in what they want okay on that tape if you happen to get it or anything on that tape it should be that the seventh month after that brought in the Feast of trumpets exactly and look on the Feast of trumpets it was two trumpets that m not seven you agree it was two two silver trumpets what is silver type Redemption right what is those two people going to bring Israel to Redemption it's going to bring them to atonement does everybody understand that so when that Moses and that Elijah starts blowing their trumpet Israel is going to be gathered together all of Israel right it's going to be 144,000 that other Bunch over there I think there's about 2 million in Israel now if you go look at their every once in a while go out there and look at their that's not much is it no not much at all you know Under The Trumpet of the angel now those angels there were Heavenly Angels yeah right you said it in the room to me and you're right I caught that in the last day there's a Heavenly Angel and there's a messenger Angel right when you're talking about those seven angels and the Seven that those are Heavenly Messengers do you agree right the only two Messengers that they get those two prophets exactly and they're going to blow those two trumpets so to Israel look Israel's going to be in the Feast of the trumpets it's going to be two so if you're worried about seven trumpets we what it is we just don't understand what he said right that's right right you agree with that we just don't get it that's right we don't Hebrews 4:2 what I says we don't mix it with Revelation right right we don't have faith in it thing we need to go back brother says listen to what he says same thought over there went the seventh month after the Feast of Passover feast of Pentecost then come the feast after the sheath was brought in way you see then remember the sheath turns into a loaf for bread after that time when the Sheep of one sheep then all goes into one Lo right oh it's a great teaching there you agree with that I didn't touch the edge of it and have to catch that on your tape right and remember he said it I said it a little while ago right what did he preaching on 07 this is ' 08 now he's gting something right this a 7 months after that count off 7 months January February March April May June July this is where he preached right the Feast of the trumpets it'd be July 7 months which represents the full seven Church agent exactly some Minister might pick that up and then You' have it you see there all right right what brother Ram's saying is he said seven trumpets in the Feast of trumpets it's not seven trumpets right Two Trumpets two do everybody got what I'm saying you'll clean it up after I'm gone there's the mistake people make they don't understand when brother brand was preaching the Feast of the trumpets he was preaching on two and he told them it's the atonement that they bring him does everybody agree with that so see what what's it trumpet it's exactly right it it is it's under the seven trumpet those two right that's exactly what it is but it's the two right that's what's going to bring about and I'm going to show you something I'm a typologist brother random said in uh adoption last book he said if you're not a typologist you won't understand your B exctly I didn't say it now some people go overboard we had people come to our church and said the USS Oklahoma sank at Pearl Harbor cuz they were in shallow water so our church was in shallow water that's taking your Ty a little far that's not a typologist that's just plain ignorance now that's what he said now you got to laugh at that don't you that's that was funny but anyway wow so any shut up see way so anyway where was I at now where was I going huh NOP typologist oh yeah okay so so I don't even know where I was going that oh I am a typologist I really so we understanding the fifth seal so these 144,000 are going to die under the Martyr seal right is that right but they got the Holy Ghost they got their white robes right so what what the fifth seal really starts breaking down for it shows us the different enemies right it it it shows you the bride it shows you the foolish origin it shows you the 144,000 it shows those are good to the bride right it what the fifth seal does is start breaking it down who's going to be over there right and like I always say five is the number of Grace right absolutely that's what it it's talking it's Grace Through the Ages is what it is right so brother Randon breaks down and puts us under the altar we understand when he went be and he talks about it when he went beyond the curtain of time they had white robes on right you agree right and when he said I want to see J he's a little higher so that shows you that they were under the altar of sacrifice of Jesus Christ under his altar brother BR then the F talks talking about Joseph he said he brought his brothers to his altar right he didn't take him to Pharaoh Pharaoh had his own altar exactly right now in the type we understand Pharaoh had many gods oh yeah you agree right Joseph didn't right Joseph never left here o Israel the Lord thy God is one right that's right right so they took those those brothers and they put them under the altar right Joseph's alter what brother random said look at how he says it and like I told you and he put him in order then he revealed himself under that altar right exactly that's what he's going to do in the fifth seal he's going to reveal himself Joseph to his Brethren y under the fifth seal EXA is everybody agree with that right so that's what all the brother BR starting to break it down for the The Sixth Seal I I'm not I'm just showing you a little bit of it to me the Sixth Seal there's where the gross eror is in it they try to they try to I you know they try to explain the seven trumpets right they're Heavenly Angels at Trumpet is that right right and these things that have come a lot of them have already happened on the earth yeah right they're looking for something to happen when it's already yeah exactly I agree six of look it says a third part of the men will be killed does everybody understand that 6 million Jews were killed there were 18 on the earth at that time is that a third part of them if that's the trumpets to them it makes sense right so a lot of what we're looking for to happen is already happened exactly and we just don't you know it talks about the moon would be this and that and the other right brother Brandon showed that on the seven Church ages with the lunar deal right right there's all sorts of these things that have already happened we're looking for them to happen right and people brother R said the only thing you ought to be looking up for is the rapture right right so we got people looking for brother brand to come back yeah really what in the world are you thinking brother I'm not looking for brother to come back if he comes back I'm going to say yay I'm going to get a body change if I see him walking around I see I'm going to say whoo right he ain't going to preach me a message to get it he's already preached the message right when he comes back I'll say all right let's go buddy that's right that's right right said that'll be we'll see him Y and look I told the church in in the first Rapture there what CF has seen them they at the off I don't believe they will this time no I don't believe an unbeliever will see them no no if it's a mystery coming right if they seen them is it it's a secret coming and there's one place brother B actually says what I'm telling you if it was a secret why would he make some unbeliever out there see him what you think God's just frivolous or what I got to go yeah so man if you see some of the ones that have went on walking in our M you you know what you better do you better say hea we going right right we're going right we are out of here is that right that's what it's about right and I really believe and if I don't see them it doesn't mean you'll necessarily see them you may not see one of them but if somebody in church go hey I've seen brother on over here you go y but you know your preaching is about over right the book opening pounding this in their heads right open it up stuff it in shut it right it's over for us right amen so people look go people in this plane got a plane ready the plane can't even fly anymore so they're going around to people now to say get your Visa card so you charge so many thousands on it so we get this plane where it'll go FF FAA approval so we can fly it they can't even fly it anymore it's not legal don't have the right instruments in it there's your black horse rider again done you for money give me your Vis give me your bank account everybody so we see these seals it's just it's obvious to us right can some preacher come in full I told him if somebody can come in if he's afraid of some preacher coming in and preaching something to fool all you he didn't do his job you think I got a fear while I'm not I don't even listen to guys that preach while I'm gone I got time soon as I get home I got to start studying for me to preach and if they say something wrong people tell me anyway Welly I got a cell phone and it will light up quick and you know what they've been Faithfully taught I know if somebody tries to pull the wool over their eyes they will be out in the parking lot on that preacher they'll be on their cell phone did you know brother preach this this why won't they do that with you happens to me but you know what that makes me feel good it means my people are taught what positionally places you teaching right teach this man is positionally placed in You by teaching you the truth right so we thank God for the teachers for the pastors for the five Ministry in the church right right so I'm going quick how's that but I'm just kind of giving you I mean I'm just hitting the edge of what I gave in the church there is so much in those seals honestly I told him and he was telling I can stay on the fifth chapter of Revelation forever well sure it's the Plan of Redemption right amen it's Eternal does everybody understand I the same way I preach eight sermons I said I got to quit I said I have to quit I'm never going to get on the rest and I I asked her I said I got to get out of the fifth chapter I can stay here for months and months fifth seal he said I could preach months and months on you know what he said that's what he said so what I want you we know there's no doubt I know what the first seal is I know what the second seal is I know what the third I know the fourth I know the fifth I know the I know the seventh right seventh let me say this in close the seventh seals three parts right right he said the first part was the coming of the lord well that's Revelation 10 1-6 right the second part I preached to you yesterday what did he preach yesterday the six seal which was what Redemption right right wasn't The Sixth Seal isn't that Redemption underneath that seal what did he preach to him Redemption he gave them the Plan of Redemption right and he said now the third one's unknown tongue right if I said Thunders would that mess you up if I said that would it am I changing what he said it's an unknown tongue he wasn't allowed to write it right that's the third part of that seven season it's the Mysteries the coming of the Lord what did it do it brought it to where our Prophet could preach the mystery of God right I say it this way at our church to bring better it's the mystery of the word right right right if I say that but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God exactly the mystery of the word should be finished right that's why I can sit here and tell you today and preach a message I know and you can take amen that's right like I told the brother and I believe your birth is that seventh seal right your birth is revelation 10:7 right it's those Mysteries that's called your name and that's getting you ready for a Rapture amen and the Very Mysteries that you have is going to call them all the way up Through the Ages amen yes sir they don't have a glorified body I tell the church this if you're going to meet him in the air and he's got a glorified body you're going to have to have the same body you agree with that amen right abely you're going to have to have a glorified body to go if you're going to go where he is right then you're going to have to have the same body he right cuz those in the sixth Dimension are in a theophany they don't eat there if I'm going to go to a marriage supper I got a different body right if I'm going to be eating and drinking there just like he did with right then I've got a different body I believe I'm getting a glorified body at the Rapture and I believe I could forever be with the Lord in that glorified body right is that right that's right CU he he's not a little higher in I got the same body he is there's not a dimension in the world can hold me in amen and I'm going for that glorified body is what I'm going for is that right right amen that's right God bless you okay brother Terence I'm sorry he left he told me might have to leave so he's hoping I'd get done before he

got over to that six seal you'll notice he's talking to them two prophets he said I had to get up and walk out of the room he now you go check your six seal he said I had to get up and walk out of the room that's what he said cuz he knew that there's going to be two prophets Y and he knew they were going to go to Israel sure see they get the trumpets yeah you notice he said I'd already preached it

the same as the seventh trumpet seventh trumpet to Israel is the same as the seventh seal is to the bride go home and read the seventh trumpet exactly to it says the kingdoms of this world have become
