========================================

[Music] - I desire this evening to see him it's good to be back home I tell you what we had a good time over the weekend yeah with the Monica's family and the church down there and by the way he did a fantastic job I tell you what we found out something if you give brother Wade two bottles of water no he did he went about two and a half two and a half hours and it was fantastic he was preaching like a house on a windy day a house on fire on a windy day yeah and we had a good time but um let's go ahead and turn over to the book of Revelation chapter 9 and I'm gonna take I'm gonna take our topic this evening boo devil and you'll see in a little bit why I kind of got this from this scripture this this is a little bit meaty Scripture and I know I know brother Wade's I'm gonna get on the trumpet everything all right well we want to read Revelation chapter 9 verses is yeah there you go you fixed my my type over there there's supposed to be 12 to 18 anyway all right let's go to the Lord in prayer well God we're so grateful to you to be able to gather together around your word to see the Lord Jesus we lower the ways we look around we see all these demonic powers and things seems like they're coming against the Christian the Christian faith in there against the the bride and this day Lord Jesus but we know God that you've given us something to combat every demonic spirit everything that the devil throws every fiery dock Dart that has thrown our way God you've given us a shield of faith in the sword of your word to combat these things Lord Jesus and I pray O God as we as we look into your word this evening Lord God that your quicken it to us Lord and calls us to realize who we are and what you've given in to us and what sort of things were fighting against so that we might be prepared in this our Lord Jesus we ask these things we ask your blessing upon the reading of the word Lord and upon this service tonight and invite you Lord of God to come and and take your abode with us Lord Jesus make this a real church service we pray tonight and I ask these things and I hope your blessing upon this service tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Revelation chapter 9 verse 12 so let's start right here 1 woe is past and we know a woe is a world warming so one world war war is past let's just kind of read it like maybe a newspaper here and behold there come two more woes two woes more Hereafter in other words there's coming two more world wars after and the sixth angel sounded and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel earth had that runt which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates now I want to call your attention to some interesting things here in the scripture first is that there's a loosing and there's something there's some things that are bound in the great river euphrates when the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a gear it prepared just for exact moment in time to come on for to slay the third part of men that's a lot of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand that's two hundred million two hundred million and I heard the number of them and thus I saw the horses in the vision and then that set on them having a breast place of fire and of jacinth and a brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued three things fire and smoke and brimstone fire and smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths you may be seated the Lord is blessing to the reading of the word so as I you know this this dish trumpets good you know the last few times I've been preaching I kind of got into the kind of a pattern of how everything's laid out in the Bible how you start off and with the there's all the different feast days you starts off with a Passover and goes on to unleavened bread and the firstfruits Pentecost and then now we've been celebrating or Ellen do the Feast of Pentecost for seven church ages and then down at the end of things then it winds up with these last three feasts the Feast of Trumpets a feast of atonement or the Day of Atonement they're recognizing who this high priest is as it comes on the scene and the Feast of Tabernacles the body change or going into the Millennium all these that Andy at the end of the Feast of Tabernacles you go into the eighth day the holy convocation going on into the New Jerusalem the eighth day of the holy convocation but but I kind of drop back a little bit to this this particular feat this trumpet because I believe it kind of it kind of identifies something that that many of us are dealing with today you see in case you look at the trumpets and ain't no brother Brahm taught us that that the trumpets really are for Israel because they're there to bring Israel back to their homeland but yet when brother brown preached the Feast of the trumpets he would say things like especially about this trumpet he would say you know it it Unleashed something to natural Israel but then something to in the ecclesiastical realm to the bride if something began to unfold in the ecclesiastical realm to the bride and what what what you'll see is happening is that 200 million demons were Unleashed as they as they make their way through will say it's through society through through the ecclesiastical renown through the through the through Rome and through all the denominational children of Rome all making their way out until to try to attack the bride try to run it after the bride trying to the World Council of Churches trying to bring out all of these things I'm trying trying to get at the bride and God God defends the bride but just taking us out of the way you see the the bride and so he gives us he gives us a defense in the hour of trouble he gives us away when when the enemy comes up like comes in like a flood hey God the Bible says that he'll raise up a standard he'll come in and raise up a defense and what is that but what is the banner what is the banner that he raises the standard that he raises it is the word and so the defense against the demonic power the defense against the things that you see in your workplace the things that you see at school the things that you see really even in church that we're going to talk about a little bit because the Devils are were originally worship angels and so they like to be in church they like to situate themselves right amongst people where they can get in an atmosphere of worship so that the thing that the defense that God has given us in this hour is the Word of God and then this I think this trumpet is really significant because in this hour there's such a demonic power that comes against the bride that comes against the the the the children of Israel to drive them back into the homeland this such a demonic power has been loosed but now you think think on the flip side think about such a power that God has unleashed through the word that he's given it to us if we'll just open ourselves up to receive word for our day to allow it to have dominion in our lives then that can have that you can be delivered you can have a power in your life to withstand everything that the devil throws against you maybe bring to mind that quote that where brother Brown said that that a man can get so close to God and still the devil doesn't know what to do with it and so you really you see in this in this trumpet you see you see the devil throwing all that he's got at Israel at the 144,000 he's throwing all that he's got in the ecclesiastical ring home at the bride but no matter what he does that God raises up a standard to defend he raises up and he raises up his word now let me let me drop back here a second because you can see methylate was bringing out the other day there's there's these gaps in here that are so important but we're reading now that there's a world war and then there's another world war the sixth trumpet and then there's a gap between that sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet when it sounds it's a voices in heaven were heard they said they declared that the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ in other words the ever the whole thing is wiped away but between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet something between the second world war and the third world war something special is happening and I believe what's happening is that you see there's these three things that take place first the revealing the preaching of the gospel and then that word that period the preaching of the gospel takes preeminence in the people that have been preached to and that is what is taking place now that preeminence of the gospel and the ones that have heard it and you and I those of you sitting here the word is becoming preeminent and you to give you power over coming power to everything that the devil throws at you and then the third thing that happens is the taking away see you've got the revealing the preeminence and the taking away the shout the voice and the Trump and the is the thing that's happening right now is that it's something taking place between the gap between the sixth and the seventh trumpet between the sixth seal and the seventh seal there will be a 144,000 that that come to preeminence that catch the revelation of the two witnesses and become the living manifestation of that word that they have heard just as you and I are becoming the living manifestation of the word that we have heard which makes you God in flesh for this day so we see we've got we've got here we've got a scene set up we've got Euphrates an army of horse horsemen widespread death spiritual death will say demonic power sweeping the land and you know the fourth seal shows a perfect Church with the Eagle anointing ready to take flight under the sixth seal we see two million deep demons loosed at the river Euphrates because why the 100 to get the 144,000 back to their homeland so that they can realize who Jesus Christ is and meanwhile the bride is recognizing who she is but she's also recognizing the tricks of the devil the tricks and traps of the devil you see all through Scripture the Bible tells us about how it is structure sin the way that the devil works it talks about how you come in like flatteries you're coming with with just a really small little thing that seems real insignificant James chapter 1 4 verse 14 it says but every man is tempted when he has drawn away of his own lust and enticed first this starts off as he's tempted and then he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death it starts off with just a little saying and before long it turns into you're actually performing a deed you're actually doing something and then the next thing that happens is well you're making a doctrine out of it and to have a doctrine you have to have a prophet a false prophet in this case a false prophet that can preach that false that false doctrine that can preach that doctrine and then it goes on to the actually manifest state manifesting that that what started out as a saying as the incarnate false prophet the incarnate thing and you see on the flipside God is doing the same thing you with what started off as just a little small thing where you first maybe turn the side to a little a little corner mission somewhere and you heard the gospel preached and you began to be justified and you really you realized that that you were a sinner and you came to the altar or maybe knelt down beside your bed at night and God began to reveal himself to you and the word began to take flesh today and you and you came to a sanctified condition where you you realize that that unclean spirit had left you and one thing one thing led to another and before long you came to live in a state of a living reality where the gospel was not something what you were wondering where the message was right or not but it became something that was steadfast and true and you where you didn't you are shaken by every wind of doctrine you are shaking you knew that the message was right you knew that God was real and then it becomes you keep moving on and on that what started off it's just just one little word Hebrews 13:8 one scripture that you heard Galatians 2:20 and it began to move on and grow and grow until you become the Incarnate Word for your day you become God made flesh that you see as the bride is becoming more and more like God as she looks into the mirror of God's Word and sees herself becoming more and more like her father like God himself she's becoming more and more equipped to withstand the wiles of the devil whatever the devil throws at her she could say listen it comes by experience to when you look back through your life and see all the tricks and the things that the devil's thrown at you and then you can see it moving in other people's lives experience is talking and you can say that's the devil you can identify him and say that's the devil moving and then it God equips you with how to approach the situation how to deal with a situation how to know what to do he's given you patience and knowledge in that hour he's given you tips to know how to approach others that maybe don't see things the same way that you do because he's equipped he's could quit the bride in the stage to withstand 200 million Devils that are coming after the bride I think you know one thing I know the kids that they had a wonderful time at the Louisiana camp this year and one thing that really struck the kids that struck me or we were we were kind of we got up Sunday morning and estra had texted mama and she said my goodness that was a devil that was manifested several devils that came into manifestation at the camp and and brother Aaron was there and he could tell you more about it later and everything well I was not because we were with brother Wade and whatnot but what it what that kind of thing does for the young people I believe is to cause them to realize that when we're coming to church and everything a lot there's a lot of things going on that you don't see there's a room that you don't see and maybe you get into a church service like that where things begin to be manifested and the devil begins to speak and the kids are sitting there listening to a devil speak back to the ministers and you begin to realize that there's more going on there's an unseen realm remember how brother Branham said we're looking to the unseen we're looking to a realm of faith a realm that's beyond the natural things that we can see there's something beyond just this mortal flesh that you can reach out and touch something beyond these things that we can we can touch with our natural eyes and hands and and our natural senses but there's things taking place in a realm that yet you're not even maybe aware of so maybe I want to call your attention tonight that the devil is here in this church right now sitting on the pews next to us but there's a God that's more powerful than anything that the devil can do there's a God that's able to deliver us from all the wiles of the devil but there is a devil the devil is real the devil is moving but God has given us a cooler equipment to be able to know what the devil's tricks are to be able to know how a devil is cast out how can yo you delivered everything how can how could anyone be delivered of the things that that so easily beset us how can you be delivered of alcoholism and cigarette smoking how could you be delivered of a lustful spirit how can you believe deliver to pornography if I'm looking at things that you should not be doing and look at the devil what make you think that there's no way out of it he'll chain you down to those things and look the problems the problems they kind of let me say this the right way as you go up the mountain the devil approaches you in different ways he'd approaches you in different ways to correspond to your immaturity as you go up this mountain where first of all first of all he was approaching you through through lust and and and and alcohol and cigarettes and all of those things watch as you move up the mountain he begins to come at you with different things and part of the Christian journey is to realize what he's doing when you begin to recognize the tricks of the devil when you begin to see what he's doing then you'll have an answer and the only answer the answer for the tricks of the devil's lies in the pages of this book and if you don't get into the pages of this book you will not know how to approach the devil you will not know his tactics you will not understand you'll have no knowledge of how to defend against him because see it is not by power or by might that's that's one of the may be the tricks of the Devils or just that made it a trick of just being a human a deception of just being a human as you begin to think that in your in your Christian journey you think while it's taking a long time for me to healed and so you begin to fall back on your own design on your own works if I if I can't be healed if it's taken a while for me to be healed maybe I need to take some more vitamin C maybe I need to go take some more all these pills and things maybe I need to go get a big old horrible prescription from the doctor and you begin to fault that ministers do this to listen you begin to fall back if God will come up on the scene and use my lips and use my body to speak maybe I can fall back on my own intellect maybe I can fall back on my own self if you begin to do that in your own Christian life if God won't come back on the scene for me maybe I could just do it myself but it's not by yourself it's not by your powers not by your own works it's just by the power of a living God that comes to a real word listen when the angel came to getting in and said you're gonna defeat the enemy as one man and getting in said how he gathered up a lot of people and and all the people forget the angel beginning to dwindle him down until there was only 300 left and I wonder if Gideon looked at that and he said well I thought that I was gonna do it by my old works by my old might by my own power but God had something else in store for him God was gonna show him that it's not by his works it's not by him it wasn't by his works the same thing with Samson everybody thinks Samson with this great big old huge like Arnold Schwarzenegger or something but brother Brent told us that Samson was a little pipsqueak he was a little somebody that a little seven of the brains running down the back of his neck a little mama's boy that within himself he had no power he didn't get in go out there lifting weights and everything but when it came time for him to lift up the gates of the city he ran over there and by the power of a holy God it wasn't that man that was holy running around committing adultery but the power of God in that man could come up on the scene and lift up those gates and carry it because you see it's not our power it's not our works that will save us it's not you trying to give or get rid of that that lust demon or that that whatever it is that you struggle with it's not you trying to get rid of the complexes and things that the devil is trying to overshadow your life where you're even afraid to come into the sanctuary and fellowship around other believers because you are afraid of what other people are thinking about you listen that kind of stuff is the devil that is the devil getting upon people and so and trying to sow discord and trying to get it impregnate people's minds with thoughts that thinks that to separate people to hinder the church service what we need is the power of the Living God to come down to get down inside of us and begin living through us and begin working his way out remember Moses thought that by his own works because of all his education because of all the things that he had inside of all the things that is maybe even as mama had taught him and she taught him right but he thought but that all that was going to save him that all that was going to deliver that children of Israel but it came down that when he was not equipped when he killed that Egyptian finally he met a pillar of fire remember Elijah Elisha by his own works but when he got that mantel on him and he said where is the god of Elisha and it wasn't himself that part of that River but it was the power of the same God that was with Elisha that came on the scene and part of the waters for him and he stepped across listen it's not by our own works that you know who will get so wrapped up and the things that we do that we can even start to think that like like Sarah sitting there in that tent when when the angel the Lord said why did Sarah laugh and brother Branham said God would have killed her except but yet she was a part of Abraham because she was a part of Abraham God could not kill her and because we are part of Christ because we were wrapped up inside of him he's inside of us and we're inside of him and so that that gives us protection remember the lost wife didn't have that same kind of protection that's why she was turned to a pillar of salt as they were they were leaving as she turned back but listen I'm gonna go off on a rabbit trail come on now let's read in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 verse 12 where Paul Paul was warning of the things that the devil will do he said but what I do that I will do that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that we're in their glory they may be found even as we for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works because you see what the best thing that the delicates that can imagine it to do it's just it's just so alive just like you did to Eve in the garden that's what I was talking about earlier the devil here where did where did that where did the demons originate they started off as angels and angels angels are associated that they're ministering spirits their worship angels they're associated with worship and so that angel that when the Angels became perverted that that Lucifer wrapped his old dragon tail around and around a third of them and pulled him to his side when they began to be perverted they they they're still like to be around worship they still like to get into a church atmosphere they still like to get amongst people and try to influence the worship service and hinder the worship service and the best way that they could think to do that is to get into a false prophet and begin to hinder the worship service by hindering because what what the devil's aim is to do is to cause people to disbelieve the Word of God to cause people to begin to sin to cause people to disbelieve Hebrews 4:12 says that the the answer to that is the war of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword because what the Word of God goes out and it begins to preach against things that are in people's life and it causes the devil to bubble up and react because listen we're we're in a battle now it's a spiritual battle when the preaching of the gospel goes forth it because of the spirits to react it causes a reaction to things you see even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in this sight but all things are naked and open under their eyes of him with whom we have to do and you know what happens when the preaching of the gospel goes forth maybe many times that spirit of a complex or whatever will be on somebody and their feelings will get hurt and they'll begin to feel like they're getting preached on or whatever and they'll begin to maybe spread that thing to somebody else I feel like you know that they go outside and say I feel like that the preacher was real upset today he was real mean today and that complex will rise up and instead of getting delivered that person will baby that spirit I believe what we need to do is if you can realize when there's a problem in your life and and repent that's what the preaching of the gospel is for is to lead us to repentance to lead us to the altar to lead us to a confession because you know brother Branham said unless you confess unless you repent of your sins that devil has a right to stay right there if you don't realize that you keep babying and everything the devil will stay right there keep hitting in the church service keep keep messing with your spiritual wall keep preventing you from moving on keep preventing you from growing up in grace and knowledge you'll you your spiritual fellowship with God will stop right there until something is done see how does how does the devil get cast out many many times you think well we need to get it we need to get into some different kind of church services then we have around here if we could get into a church service that was real dynamic with a great move of God then things would really happen but see that's not the way that the devil comes out the devil how does it ever come out in Matthew chapter 18 verse 16 when the even was come they brought unto Him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick with his word he cast it out and you know many times that's so hard for us to believe so hard to believe that that is the way that God casts out Devils that you know even just listening to the things that went on a camp the devil would not come out until that brother or sister confessed that there was something wrong the devil would not come out until the word was brought to that person the devil will not come out until the word is preached the word has to be preached because the devil cannot abide in the presence of the word that's don't you realize that's what the seven seals revealed the seven seals revealed the word has gone into you the word has been packed into you until the devil has come out the word was kept puts put into you until as sanctification the baby formed sanctification the unclean spirit went out and the word just keeps piling on until you go into a more mature form of justification and the devil leaves The Devil's coming out he's riding away listen I believe that every born-again Christian in here has an experience where you can look back and remember when the devil went out you could remember when your desires changed you could remember when that unclean spirit went out see you see we always were looking at kind of the attributes of the devil and that's one of the attributes of the devil is he's got to have somebody that work through and so yep maybe maybe we all have an appropriate amount of concern this evening because when the devil goes out of one person he's going to look for somebody else to get into remembering the prayer lines and things brother Branham would say don't look up because your eyes are the gateway to the soul and the devil will either get in at one place he said you can cause that devil to come back on that person by disrespecting the service would you realize that when a devil comes out when a devil comes out and listen when we come to church we're not many times people come to church and they think that we're just kind of coming to church to get together but we're coming to church like we're coming to a hospital we're coming to be delivered of sickness we're coming to be delivered of spiritual infirmities we're coming to be straightened up we're coming to be patched up we're coming to be we're coming to be tended to by the medics so that the medic can say something's wrong with you and and and then the person says well I realize something's wrong with me now patch me I'll tell me what I need to do to get better listen I believe sometimes we we don't want to hear the truth presented in the way that it should be we don't only hear it preached in a way that we're where I was preached in a way that you need to die out to yourself you need to give up and let God take a hold of you repent repent of all the things that you've done confess your sins so that God could come in and make a new creature out of you but instead instead what people hang onto ER or we want to hang on to little feelings and things instead of a revealed word instead of a living reality instead of a steadfast hope lying down on the inside of your soul let's read first kings chapter 22 verse 7 there we go the times creeping up on me again I'm not even through my first page that's all right no I wouldn't bother we'll be fine first Kings chapter 22 verse 2 says we talk about casting out Devils and what the devil does when he gets in amongst the people and it came to pass in the third year that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel and the king of Israel said unto his servant no you there a month and gilja desires and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria and he said unto Jehoshaphat will that go with me to battle to ramoth-gilead and Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I am as thou art my people as died people my horses as thy horses and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel inquire I pray thee other word of the Lord today then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said unto them shall I go against ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I forbear and they said go up for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king four hundred prophets that they were trusted in to bring them the word of the Lord and it was only one man in the land that could bring the true word of the Lord hey listen you start reading the message about how brother bro talked about how it's honing down time and how it was going to get so dark in this last stage that he said I left a little light and so you began to look around is there anybody you can almost get despondent is there anybody preaching the true message of the gospel that preaching the truth is there anybody that has the real Word of God and what I mean you know there's so many today I'm just going to preach it that's so many today that are preaching that you must be born again you must be a good Christian you lay aside the waste so every easily beset you but how many are preaching I'm gospel that will take us into a body change when you look around and search for somebody that I preached it real true gospel little skin The Devil's hide then lay lay waste to the devil that'll clean you clean up lives and that will get us to a place where we can take a rapture it looks like it we're just about in the same kind of condition that they were and you see why and they in a moment because in this story it was because way up there in heaven and the scene God said who who can go down and a lion spirit came up a line spirit came up and got up amongst all than me and you see what heart what harm the devil can cause what harm one false prophet could call when he gets in amongst two people listen just one one little sister sowing discord one little sister preaching a false doctrine to our children or one little sister preaching a false doctrine to our family and saying stuff that ain't even in the Bible like you can't be saved unless you do this or that you'll never be saved if you came from a bastard Union you'll never be saved unless you divorce this spouse or whatever listen all that junk is tommyrot and you can send more souls to hell cause more people to leave the message through all that nonsense some little person trying to trying to be you can turn yourself into a false prophet real easy get into a condition where your you think you're doing good but instead it's the devil working in your life listen I'm just gonna preach somebody saying something that they feel is helpful but then turn around and years later that's caused people to leave the message cause people to feel like that all hope is gone because of one careless remark what's one little thing that was just slung out just well I'm sorry but there's no hope for you because of the way that you came into the world I'm sorry but there's no help listen to all this there's so much of that stuff going around it just makes my blood curl just about just one false prophet could lead more Souls a hell if just one word off in the beginning started the whole thing see what one word off can do now I'm sorry I'm sorry but I don't think there's grace for you I'm sorry you know what I say to somebody that has heard a message like that from a well-meaning person cuz you need to come to church where the gospel is preached so that you can hear the grace you listen whenever you see the word truth in the Bible just about every time it's preceded by the word mercy mercy and truth mercy in truth if we just if we were just confronted by the word truth we'd be slaying every one of us would be killed every one of us if we stood before truth but God gave us his mercy he presented his mercy to us and I thank God for his mercy that is given to us he died on the cross so that we could have mercy He gave His life so that we could have mercy and the only thing that you the only requirement for their mercy is to believe on Him they died for you [Applause] that's reader let's keep reading verse 7 and Josephus it is there not a prophet of the Lord besides that we might inquire of him and the king of Israel said in Jehoshaphat there is yet one man Micah the son of imlah but who may we may acquire of the Lord but I hate him for he does not prophesy good concerning me but evil listen I spent many times people hate the very thing that will deliver them from the thing from the weight that the devil has put on their back from the all of the cares and the complexes and things they hate coming to church because they feel like the devil is didn't feel like the dead that the preacher is preaching on them they feel like listen many times that is the greatest mercy that God can give on to you it's for a preacher to preach upon the waste the things that are in your life to expose the devil let me skip down here I'm running out of time let's skip down to verse 19 or uh yeah verse 19 and he said and he said hear thou therefore the word of the Lord I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left and the Lord said who shall persuade I have that meeting he may go up and fall at a Rhema for Gilead and one said on this manner and another set on that manner and they came for the spirit and stood before the Lord I said I will sweetie could you imagine this conversation going on up in heaven one said this and another said that and then out came a line spirit to say I will go and and spread this thing down there and the Lord said unto Him where with and he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt persuade him and prevail also go forth and do so now and and we read the rest of the story but listen what is your defense I guess the false prophet what is your defense what kind of defense has God given you in this day how are you to know when a lying spirit goes forth it says something that caught that is contrary to the word your defense is the Word of God that's why I'd Ephesians it says to gird yourselves with truth to take up the shield of faith and the sword of the word to put on the helmet of salvation and put prepare put on the the feet of the preparation of your feet the preparation of the gospel of peace to prepare yourself against the defense of these things to make yourself ready so that you are prepared and they are when these things come upon when you hear some kind of thing going forth because look look see what the devil does his tactic is to make it so that you don't see clearly so listen to many times you look at somebody that you know is it's got a devil working in their life and they don't see things the way that they really are the conversation that they have the way that they that they say things it's like they're they're living in a distorted reality they don't see the love that others project they don't see the help that others want to give all they see is that somebody's out to get them and that's why brother Branham said that God has given us our selves in this day he's given us ourselves to open up our eyes like that balm that Jeremiah was talking about is there no balm in Gilead physician balm the kind of eyes that will open up your eyes by removing the devil and that's what the preaching of the gospel does the preaching of the gospel will cast out the devil so that the devil can leave and you can see and then you can believe and you keep moving forward listen I I think that's maybe the thing in this hour we don't realize when the devil is moving we don't realize when the devil is getting among us just like Peter didn't win in Matthew chapter 16 verses 23 to 24 when when Peter was talking and it looked like he had a good idea you don't have to die and everything and Jesus turned to him and he said get thee behind me Satan thou art and a fence unto me listen maybe you feel like you've had a lot of things preached on you and nothing's done to you but you've never had the Lord Jesus say you are an offense to me you've never had the Lord Jesus himself said get thee behind me Satan and look Peter didn't realize that it was Satan motivating him Satan himself motivating the his thought process motivated the way he wasn't the only way that that would get off him is if somebody spoke to him direct and said get out of here devil for thou savourest not the things that be of God but those that be of men this said Jesus and his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me and you know I went I went through all the messages and things where brother Branham talked about what the devil will tell you the devil will say yes but it's written in the scriptures and it'll say he said to Eve surely you'll not die now these are all things I just went through finding and the message where brother Rama said the devil said and he'll say that's as far as you're going and he'll say if thou be the Son of God like he said to Jesus if now but if you really say that you're a Christian won't you do a miracle if you really say that this is a Church of the Living God why don't we see all kind of people falling out in the aisles and running around and stuff why don't you do me a miracle that's the Bible so this is another thing he said that's a Bible scholar so I better give him some scripture that's a Bible scholar so I better give him some scripture and he said I'll make him curse you to your face about job all these things that the devil will come listen think about that that's a Bible scholar so I better give him scripture and defy scripture scripture you better have more than just a head knowledge you better have a real revelation that a revelation of the word that's just given it God has given in this hour look at that clock everybody doing all right y'all y'all are hanging in there pretty good with me hang on there just a little bit longer because look look I was saying earlier about the devil will approach you with different tactics as you move up the mountain as you keep going up let's look at some of those tactics like let's read quote number 9 and the mrs. expectation and how today that we've got away from that he said that they got they go to church and this woman she went into the church out there we're starting out a real little baby for him she's done a very good job she was a piano player my sheep she was a piano player and she probably thought that in her spirit she she had something you real spiritual going on and after a while she began to notice the women in her neighborhood begin to dress immodestly how they get out and move their yards with him a little old clothes on you see that's the same problem that Jehoshaphat had he got around all them unbelievers and went down into the battle and just about got in trouble remember how the story of Jehoshaphat goes that the men were looking for Ahab on the battlefield and and they saw Jehoshaphat and they were running after him and then they realized that what they have so they went running after a-c-c out listening to other people getting into the Mount wrong Society can let us spirit jump on you and you'll be on all kinds of trouble she began to notice the women in her neighborhood begin to dress him honestly how they get out and mow their yards with them to low clothes on I hope there's none of them here tonight and it's a disgrace to you too sister God be merciful to your sinful soul what else would do that but an evil spirit of lust you don't want to think that but that's exactly the only person that ever stripped their clothes in the Bible was a maniac let's go quickly divert to number 10 he's talking about evil spirits and what what let's go on up on up a level you hear the gospel and you come to church and you want to be a Christian let's see what the devil does there and the only thing that kept me from being a saved when I was 12 years old because of spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little while longer they see what the devil does he distorts your reality he just he's telling you just wait a little while longer you got plenty of time to go out and have fun to get amongst all your friends and listen to all the tommyrot that they're telling you missing up you're not just your spiritual life but your natural life too telling you all kind of bad advice and you can listen to all that and just go completely in the wrong direction wait a little while longer that's the reason you wasn't saved when you become the age of accountability a spirit you got in a crowd and that hovered over you and kept hanging over you you wanted to do right there's not a man that's got is right mind but wants to do right but there is something won't let you do right and what will deliver you of that this is the same thing that will diva delivery of all the other spirits is here in the world of God preached and I'm preaching tonight that now is the hour of deliverance now is the time to deliver dove delivers don't don't wait another moment just open up your heart and receive the word for your age but let's keep let's keep moving on up let's go to number 11 in Revelation chapter 5 number 1 and he said I got all kind of letters that's coming in the last few date now here we're going to get into something something a little bit higher up because now he's talking about people that believe his message now he's talking about people that believe that God sent a prophet and and he's gonna call it out you got a devil on you people that are sitting in message churches believing that he is a prophet friends of yes and he said I got all kind of letters that's come in the last few days and calls from different places so saying that I was Christ brethren that is a horrible disgraceful ungodly lie of the devil see I am your brother and he goes on let's read on down down to verse quoted paragraph 38 and I wondered if it would have been some enemy of mine it would been all right but I would have just laughed at it and went on when it come to be precious brothers precious sisters then that's what hurt me and I said Lord the great thing is - great I'll just have to walk out and let's keep reading on down to the next highlighted area he said now wherever it is it's a spirit on precious people many people has asked me that but it's a spirit but I hope that today that it receives a deadly wound and will die out quickly so I can return back to the ministry listen you think you think just because you're sitting in a message church and believing that God sent a prophet you're believing a message preacher that God that a devil can't come on you listen I hope that that ought to be proof enough you can be sitting in a message church even with a new birth down inside of your soul and a spirit of jealousy come upon you a spirit of enmity toward somebody else you can start thinking hateful thoughts through somebody and what you need to do that's when you that's when you need to think before you take communion because brother Branham said you have no right to take communion and if you're not living the same life out there that you are here at church everywhere down on the inside out in public it's all gonna be in harmony and so when you get an enmity with your brother and sister because there's a spirit on you or something then it's time to take make it right before you come and take communion it's time to come and make that right and then he even said that he has spirit on what brother ball hold all now let's read let's read quote number 12 where in the word became flesh and I kind of combine these two together I want to ask the church one more thing before we get someplace to study in the scriptures that is that you'll pray for me I've developed a critical spirit and it holds sent me thinking about being haunted by a critical spirit and you know that's a bad thing you know a critical spirit a critical spirit will make you judge your other people without any evidence it'll make you jump to conclusions and you remember you remember brother Brent when he was talking about temperance he said temperance one of the things and that is not jumping to conclusions you go back and look at the statue for perfect man and so listen if you start judging everybody just because of the way that you think it is the way that you think you you're so critical and everything the Bible says you the way that you meet it out is the way it will be meted back to you the way that you judge others and you go tattletale into everybody else I think that brother I think they got something against me and that just stirs up a big old thing in the church and the body of discretes a big old schism and then you really are stirring the skids of Boston and it holds hit me he said I told my wife yesterday the first time something happened now and I was sitting in the yard and I told her she had a reminded me and I told her about it I said honey I've got to a place till I become critical of people I don't want to be let's keep going down to the next quote because that was in the morning and then in the evening he said this I'm not going to ask you how many made the consecration but I made me believe many of you did and myself I did in my heart Lord take that critical spirit from me now I listen a prophet of God asking to be delivered from a critical spirit asking for people to pray for him listen I'm gonna say this about prayer I believe you you start talking thinking about brother Branham in the prayer line and he said demons would call to one another for help demons would call to one another for help and listen a sane of God can call for help too and that's what we do when we put the prayer quit self referred to brother tears to read that's what we do and we go out in the parking lots they remember me in prayer we're calling for help we call for help from one another and we go at night when you're laying down or in the early in the morning whatever your prayer time is and we begin to call out to God interceding for one another honor on the behalf of one another we're calling now for help to one another one we're crying out to God and I believe that's what a real Christian should do is you enter in on behalf of one another because you love one another and let me tell you this that will get rid of all the devils because there's perfect love that casts out fear person perfect love it's got really is what gets rid of evil spirits didn't that what the word is that's what the word is it's love when love comes in and he said it myself I did in my heart Lord take that critical spirit for me now I don't criticize people out to their face but in my heart I do I see a lady walking down the street I'm especially that is she's not dressed properly I say isn't that awful and my heart I don't say it nobody else after all that's her business and he goes on well listen the reason that I feel compelled let's go on to that next quote pull that quote up the reason that this has been on my heart lately the reason I felt compelled to preach this sermon tonight but it's really because of this quote the things that brother Adam says in this quote now look at this I'm I have to magnify it now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shoes the book of Revelation that we're just reading from shows how that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and power how does he do that because you think you just come in to church you just come into it to a thing instead of dying out to your sins coming here to the heart of the spiritual hospital to be delivered of evil spirits to grow up into the admonition of God to be formed in His image and look he said it exposes Satan revealing his works what does his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army now that's usually where we stop reading that quote when we when we talk about it we talk about when we can realize what a what God has done for us that we are the Word made flesh that the Son of Man is revealed in this day that all of these things and we stop right there but listen there's more to it if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today is when Christ withstood is every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes the Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it us but we will prevail over them do you see what he's talking about he's talking about a church that has been built up to a place that when the devil throws fiery darts enter they're just sticking her shield they just bounce off they can't penetrate they can't get to her because she recognizes the tricks of the devil and what I'm talking about is some believer that when somebody comes and tries to soothe discord they recognize it and turn it down listen I don't want to listen to that I don't want to listen to you talking about somebody else I don't want to listen to you talking about my pastor I don't wanna listen to you're talking about in another Minister I don't want none of that feel that none of that Tommy rod because it'll just go just weak in the church and it just soso schism and sow discord and listen you can cast out the devil from your church from your assembly from your home by an approach like that because that is love the same kind of perfect love that Jesus told Peter get thee behind me Satan listen that was love a lot of times we want to make we want to rap love do a little Hallmark card that we can distribute blow them undo a little psychological package but love is the word of God love is obedience to the Word of God expressed whether it pierces whether it cuts whether it hurts I want that kind of love in my life let me see goodness gracious I'm gonna have to skip over some of this I'm trying to get to that scripture that I first read in Revelation let's go to Zechariah chapter 4 verse 69 and it might take you a while to find that or whatever that's alright I'm just going to read it because listen this is a little scripture about about God building up this statue of a perfect man man not by your own works not by your own efforts but by the power of a Living God and then the answer is speaking to me this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts who art thou a great mountain before is the rule thou shalt also become a plain how your lie I know y'all I wasn't the world is it got to do with casting out Devils hang on say no and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it so he's talking about he's talking about laying a foundation and building up building up this thing out of the earth building up this mountain out of the earth just like New Jerusalem it comes down from God out of heaven onto a mountain that came out of the earth where God comes down on mount Olive's and sit puts one foot on the mountain and it's cleaving into and out of the earth just like this mountain is coming out of your and then New Jerusalem comes down and sets on and what is in New Jerusalem in New Jerusalem is a river of life because when Jesus talked to the woman at the well he said I'll give you well Springs of everlasting life I'll give you well Springs of water in New Jerusalem coming out of that room we're going down into five different branches is a river that goes throughout that permeates every part of that city you say what's this got to do with that chapter in Revelation well it's got something to do with that river Euphrates because you see that river Euphrates is the antithesis the opposite of this river of life that is in this New Jerusalem City this river of life that is flowing through you let's read oh I'm trying to finish let's read quote number 18 and blasphemous names we're sisters Shepherd she dreamed a dream and she dreamed she was up on a mountain and in this mountain the best I haven't gotten the paper before me but I think it's like this she dreamed that she saw a Rock box like a framework sitting right on top of this mountain and her husband was just behind her she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on sleeves rolled up baling the most pure water that she ever seen and pouring it into this box this rock box sitting on top of the mountain and the rock box would not hold the water and it rolled right out of there just bowled up all the trash and sticks and everything in there and bowled it out and rolled down the mountain because you see that River of Life that New Jerusalem River it was pushing out all the trash in your life that New Jerusalem River is is pushing out all of the demonic influence all of the demonic and power are everything out of you everything everything that would hinder you you see and she start down there where I got a highlight and she saw five streams of this pure crystal water not contaminated by the things that he had went through still pure and clear coming swiftly then it slowed up then almost fading out and she was wondering would it ever reached the bottom of the mountain five streams and she's looking at a statue of a perfect man but there's a mountain in New Jerusalem where we will live that John saw coming down from God out of heaven like a bride of doing for a husband because that is the bride that's the bride as a spiritual a spiritual look at the bride it's the same thing in Revelation chapter 22 and it said and he shows me showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb and then go to number 21 the future home and it said and all up and down here will be the redeemed there will be the houses of pure gold that will be avenues and parks and gardens and the river of life coming trickling out from the throne and running down through little chasms chasms and over the terraces and the tree of life will be blooming in every yard and bear its fruits 12 times a year a changed fruit every month a tree of life coming out and look look then this sixth trumpet we just read about a river another kind of river we're talking about demons bound at the great river euphrates this griever Euphrates that if you go back I'm trying to hurt here this river Euphrates that you could run back all the way to I don't know where the natural river started but I know where the spiritual head of this river started it started in pagan Rome and Pagan Babylon way back there when Nimrod began his kingdom and it moved all the way down a river running all the way down spiritually a spiritual river all the way down through pergamus where a duelist had his little kingdom set up as he cared in the mysteries from ancient Babylon and he then he analysts the third will over all those mysteries all of those things that he the kingdom that he brought back from Babylon he willed it over to the Roman Empire because you see just like the the spiritual river in New Jerusalem wove its way down through all of the bride through every every fabric of that city every fabric of your being this city is woven and ran all the way back from spiritual Babylon all to the all the way to the prison Dave come on my voice and you got two hundred thousand demons bound in this river that were loosed loose now under this trumpet loose now and where they loosed loosed under this rule this the spirit the the influence of the of the Roman system and all of our daughters going into every fabric of society so that when you go into work you see the devil's you see the influence that what it's doing is it's trying to unite everybody unite all the world system into a place we can close your church doors we can put you out where you can he can bring you to court for sayin things that don't match the system of the day let me read some clothes brother Bob I don't know about that let's go to number number 23 where brother Brian said the handwriting on the wall so Babylon just said in that great fertile valley valley there and it was surrounded it irrigated by the Euphrates River and the Tigris and it was a great agricultural center and Babylon was a great city and it's approximately 120 miles around the city 30 miles each side that would make it a hundred and twenty miles around they say that the streets in the Bible city of Babylon was some 200 feet across the walls were 80 foot thick and practically 200 feet high they could run chariot races around these walls with the chariots and the gates were made out of brass and the goat those gates then will be 200 feet across and a ride in the center of the city set the palace and the palace was the throne sounds like they're trying to imitate something and through the center of the city came the great river euphrates if you'll notice it it's the city of the devil for it's designed after the City of God as the River of Life before the throne and in this city they had great swinging Gardens off the rossignol and he said thought he could build these big walls up walk wide enough he could run a chariot around them and the great iron gates and the things that he built put the river right through the middle a type of heaven swinging Gardens and his throne right by the river like the river Euphrates and like the river of life in the Garden of Eden and the river of life in the kingdom of God and what happened it fell because it could not stand let's go to the feast of the trumpets quote number 25 there is that Roman Empire bound there by what the ecclesiastical powers which Rome pagan Rome became papal Rome and was bound there in its traditions of Christian what part of Christian listen they were bound that pagan influence where before it was a pagan army that would run through killing everybody and they were but there they were bound by the Christian ideas by the Christian tradition that they couldn't just go out there and kill everybody but then here under the 6th trumpet it was loose to the Jews so what that Roman listen to you if you ever watched a video of Hitler preaching he preached like a Pentecostal preacher because he had that anointing of these devils on him you see that the things that these these Devils unleashed they they began to kill and slaughter like how it says that the horses breathed fire and brimstone and smoke and they took him into the furnaces and they killed him what was smoking with brimstone with fire and they shot him with guns with the brimstone and they killed him because of the influence of these demons of these demons powers that had been loosed from that Euphrates River loose that were bound all this time and now our gonna be loosed on the bride I see that's why it's important to know it's important to know the tricks of the devil it's important to be able to recognize how the devil comes against you because when the end of comes in like a flood which is what he's doing now he's coming in like a flood a flood of false doctrine a flood of everything that he can conceive you man can conceive oh and their carnal mind you've got to have a way to withstand there see now I'm having trouble stopping just give me a little bit more I'm winding down I think before I am I am the face of the trumpet quote number 26 he says now the ecclesiastical realm has been opened from the natural revival of the old pagan rope pagan Rome went forth on those Jews which has always been their enemy the lion with teeth and everything has stomped down and broke out the people Rome always been God's enemy and it was turned loose in the same spirit by the dictators of the world because the religious system was still holding now it's been loosed what is it done in the cunningness as he said he come in the flatteries and what has he done he's bringing the Protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of Antichrist upon both of them bringing to them to them to the slaughter just like they did to the other the other in the hour to call the bride how loosed in the ecclesiastical church spirit and I'm gonna stop on this the musician can go ahead and come forward loosed upon work not upon the denomination's upon the bride but here you'll get it and here's really what I'm coming down to here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time the Bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see it any sense ministers can't you see that brother and I want to put this question to you why will the bride not go through that time when all these demon powers have been unleashed all of this deception all of this false word all of these things that are coming against the bride why were the bride and not go through that time because she's been equipped because she's been filled with the power like girl the word she's been filled with a message birthday she's been filled up and she knows how to resist that thing she's already been sanctified she's already been such a justified she's already been filled by the power of God and she's been cleansed and made spotless by the blood of the Lamb so she don't have to go through that she does not have to go through that thank God for His grace thank God for His mercy let's just stand and we'll just let's just go to the Lord in prayer before I turn the service over I hope y'all got something out of that if you if you have a need if you want to just lift up your hand and we'll just take it to the Lord the Lord God I know I was maybe a little bit long-winded tonight Lord Jesus and I pray you'll forgive my your server Lord God I pray Lord that you'll take all of these disjointed words Lord Jesus and put them together in the hearts of your people Lord Lord so grateful Lord for the mercy and the grace you've extended to us in this hour of God to be able to escape the things that are coming upon the face of this earth and I believe that now more than ever Lord God you're increasing our faith Lord Jesus we're maybe once we were we were hoping Lord God but now Lord Jesus I believe that your bride knows that we are going to escape the things coming on the face of the earth because we know Lord God that you are making a spotless church you made a spotless bride Lord because you're looking down and seeing the Express image of your person you're looking and seeing a masterpiece that you've formed by the word by the preaching of the gospel Lord God we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace in this hour Lord to us Lord God Lord about giving us power against Devil's power to cast all the devils in our life Lord Jesus power Lord God overcoming power Lord Jesus Lord God you overcame Lord God and now you've given us power over come Lord Jesus everything that this world throws against us Lord Jesus and Lord God you saw every hand lifted up Lord raised little god because every one Lord you you made us a needy people who need you Lord Jesus and you see the needs you people tonight Lord God you know Lord God whatever purpose whatever need is whatever problem is and each of the people's lives Lord Jesus and Lord your scripture says as you sit your word to heal us now Lord God and I pray O God that the word
