========================================

okay I was thinking this morning about something to do and thinking about something to do and thinking about something to do I just think this is what we're going to do we're going since we did a comparison and we got some good notes back on the internet about the comparison between the future home and the Millennium I think we're going to do a comparison on what is the Son of God and what is the son of man M cuz truth be known probably in the message of the hour there's not many people know the difference or where one started and where one ended or where one what this one does and what that one does now we know for a fact that it's both God right okay there's not two Gods it's not this one he become that one and no he was God all the time okay so but there is a time where the Son of God begin and there's a time where the son of man begin right right as far as we're concerned now remember when I say we're concerned it's from what we see not what God is or what God sees because he was the son of God before the foundation of the world back in the eternity but he was not the son of man cuz he didn't have a flesh like he had down here on the Earth right so there's where we got to show the difference he was more real as a Son of God than anything but we're going to see the not the difference I don't like to say the difference cuz there's no difference in God right but the contrast between son of man Son of God because it's probably one of the most ill taught things in the in the message seeing people that believe that Abraham was the son of God by birth like you and I which there's no way he was cuz he didn't have the new birth right this man didn't die to release this life yet right to come back into the believer I don't understand it's just that even Baptist would tell you that that the blood of bulls and goats the Bible tells you doesn't do away with sin it just pushed it back so you can't be a son of of God in your soul until all of that's gone right right but we still got people and I meet them in the message that when you say that Abraham was not a son of God by birth like you and I it just they go cuckoo all right and want to argue and then they get into predestination and then they take predestination as I was always this seed over here and there's no way I could be this one over here well let's let God look at predestination that way but to you and I he looked by for knowledge right what you would do or wouldn't do and therefore he could come here and predestinate by what you desire that's right and I was thinking this morning you know I prove that Cain brother R said Cain had a choice the Bible said Cain had a choice because God's not a respector person he's not even a respector persons with with the devil right Satan you were born perfect Ezekiel 20 right 28 28 thank you Ezekiel 28 I look at sister Trudy because I always forget that but she showed it to me one time and I've always kept it in my Bible so Ezekiel 28 he said thou was born thou was created perfect so what did he do he made a choice right Satan made a choice cuz God made him to be the anointed chub right he become the Devil by the choice that he made all right cuz God didn't create evil that's right right he created a person that could become evil big difference cuz if God created evil then he could not come up and say you live like the devil all your life I'm going to put you in hell you couldn't do that right okay so I think we as in this room understand that but there's a lot of people listening maybe on the internet that we need to uh we're not trying to change anybody's idea because you cannot ever change anybody's idea God has to change your idea EXA right God has to reveal to you I can't reveal nothing I can just spark your interest for you to sit down and think about it and and look up quotes and look up scriptures and and let the Holy Spirit put it together um I can't put nothing together God's the one it has to do it so let's start and let's look at the Son of God turn to Genesis 1 and I'm a little ill prepared U my plant manager died last night at 2:00 in the morning so been kind of thinking about that a little bit so forgive me for not having all my scriptures lined up but maybe I can pull a few out of my head or God can bring them to our remembrance he said he would right right all right even if you have a scoffield Bible if you don't then I'm going to read some what scoffield said but and the first part here in Genesis we're going to look at God all right now what does Sun mean something begotten from all right something begotten from I'm the son of Samuel Dale because I was begotten from him all right now let's read in the beginning God created the Heaven Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters now the abis Scofield bible you can look in his commentary brother brandham was not the first one to come up with these words of Elohim and and self-existing God and all that it was the scholars knew that way back before brother random got here because I believe the Holy Ghost moved on people before the prophet got here it just took a prophet like brother brandham to put all that together and make it right they had they had the right sound but the composer had to come to bring the music together you can have all these you know different C's and B's and D's and a flats and all that but it took somebody to sit down and write it down and say hey this is where an A flat goes this is where you change this is you know he was the composer which we know it was the Holy Ghost in the man that was the composer not the man but he did yield himself so much till God could use him in a mighty way let's look at this son of God when you think of Son of God it is not the man that walks the shores of gall in that fullness of the person all right there's another part in there all right now we can say the man that walked the shores the shores of Galilee was the son of man with the Son of God in him right okay because he kept yielding to a higher power or to his father which his father was the one that was inside of him because remember he said he dwell in him right and I only do that what he says so the Son of God was the creator we know that by over in the other scriptures but let's look at what scofi said that word God in the Greek or the original translation is Elohim it's the English form which is God the first of the three primary names of deity is a uni plural noun formed from L which is strength or the strong one and Allah to swear to bind oneself by an oath so implying faithfulness because remember even Scopia watch this this unip plural this unip plurality implied in the name is directly asserted in Genesis 126 what do genesis 126 say let us make man in our image and in our likeness and let them so it's unip plural in the form of if we say I'm the son of Samuel Dale that's one person that's me there's nobody else can be that but in God if all of us were inside of him and all of the things that he was and still is was inside of him then he could say let us make man because what was he doing he was expanding himself he's the Creator we're not or Samuel Dale couldn't create another way Dale right but God can create as many sons as he wants to just like himself cuz that's what he's doing now Bible says he's create me Sons what unto himself but now watch we'll keep going on and he's not a see this is where scoffield gets sof say thus the Trinity is Leon in Elohim now let's change that word to trunity cuz brother Bram used the word Triune Triune is not bad Trinity is three Tri is one 2 three all right triun being is three attributes of the same being so you don't have three gods in in the Trinity you have three Gods separate individual personalities trunity is Father Son and Holy Ghost this man right here that says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth there's where he stood he was Father Son and Holy Ghost all bound up in one God then his attributes begin to he wanted to be a father is the reason that he had children all right his desire was was to have children right all right but I look in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth verse two and the Earth was that foreign void verse three there's a difference in verse three and verse one verse one say said God created that means he took something from nothing and made something with it right now verse three did not say God created that light God said let there be light in other words let there be understanding right let the light shine on something that's never Shone on before because you can't create God God is always light now you're going to see in a minute this is not the sun and the moon and the stars no no no he created that way over here okay then in verse 16 and God made two great lights one to shine at night one to shine day that's the Sun and the Moon that we have now all right but when he said let there be light and there was light that was not a creative act he was light all right so that that Son of God the Creator God was always light he was always God there was no darkness and the Bible said there was no darkness in him at all remember that John John 1 in the beginning was his word he was the light of the world and in him was no Darkness at all right so now and God saw the light it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and he called the light day and the Darkness he called night cuz see you can't create day and night how do you create day you don't create Day Day is when the light shines night is the absence of I mean night time is an absence of light so you didn't he didn't create day and night it just become that did everybody understand that everybody got it me I can see it in your face it's just I I don't see where what's the problem it's the result the day and night is the result of what he created is that right could you put it that way even Einstein proved that the absence that Darkness was not a creation he proved that Darkness was just the absence of light understand okay but let there be light he said that let there be he didn't say God created light cuz he can't create light he is light right that's not the moon and the stars in the sun he created that in verse 16 that's his self that's his own sustaining he's letting it be known people it's not like it's not like God never was any of these things he always was these things he called it day and night do what in verse five he called the day and night that's what we just read I know he called the light day read the footnote at number read the number four footnote that might help no let's stay right here just hang on a minute that's what I thought the word day is can be used as a solar day or there is a day of atonement and a day of judgment which is not a 24-hour day all right day was when it was light M Darkness was when it was night mhm my Bible ref to Psalms 336 and9 and Psalms 336 says by the word of the Lord what the heavens made in all the host of them and by the breath of his and name he and doneand right right but do you see what I'm talking about they God cannot create his own light he was light thank you he was the light of the world now did he shine when he was on the earth I don't believe Jesus was walking down the road at night and he was glowing right come on people we got to get out of our caral thinking but inside him was the very light that I'm just now talking about that's what this light was it was not a created light a created light we're we're looking at the sun and the moon and the stars yes God created that we're going to see that in verse 16 but this light in verse three he did not create he just said let there be and there what I mean it was always there what's God doing God showing that he is light and he called the light day okay so he named it and he called The Darkness night he was just dividing what was now you're looking at it is thinking that that darkness is the night like our night time my Bible has it in capital letters so is that talking about uh daytime and night time no folks it's a revelation it's not what we read that's right it's a revelation day is capital night is capital God is not making the daytime and the night time that we're looking at right now that's why I want to get into this okay that Son of God was the Creator God but he always was light and the Darkness is the devil that capital N I G HT is not when we go to bed at little ni GT remember what daddy always said about capital being in the middle of sentences and that's for God to bring out something he was separating because when did the devil fight with God during the creation nope before the foundation of the world this was already settled but when Moses was writing it he had to show how God was progressively coming closer and closer and closer to you and I right so he said the D capital D a y is the light and the capital n g HT is the other guy cuz there's no darkness in God he's always light I just wanted to read something I found that help help me with what you was talking about it says light not the sun which was created on the fourth exactly thank you but some fixed light mhm which was always there there thank you in some Bibles it will explain that and here it may too but I just didn't have time cuz see it even talks about the day of the Lord the day of the Lord is not a 24-hour period the day of the Lord's been happening since the foundation of the world right but that Capital Dy is God's light that never goes out and that night is the absence of God which is the devil the night the darkness that covers all of us because remember you and I must type this earth right you and I must type this Earth we were without form and void when God created us in the womb of our parents or moms cuz that was God doing it Satan didn't do it right but even the Bible says right here it says and the Earth was without form and born in darkness little day was upon the face of the deep what you and I and our dark sin we were without form and void we didn't know what to do we had no shape sure we look like human beings but what were we we were born in sin shaping iniquities pass from our mother's womb and liar but God is showing here through Moses we got to understand that Moses wrote this and Moses wasn't standing at you know at the foundation of the world Moses was seeing a vision and just like uh sister Trudy said somewhere and even brother Bram said that was not the Sun and the Moon that was created in the fourth day all right we're still in the first day God is showing I am light and in me there's no Darkness at all and whatever is darkness is not of me then he begins to what start to create cuz see right here finish verse 5 and God called the light day capital and the Darkness he called night capital and the evening and the for morning was the first capital da ym regular day started evening and morning that's why we proved back when we did the um uh that's why that um the Jews start their day at 6:00 in the evening because the evening and the morning was the first day they start their day at 6:00 p.m. and run it till 6:00 a.m. in the morning okay or they run it you know to the next time next 24-hour time up to the next 6: p.m. so that's why because they because they they believe they Creator evening and the morning was the first day all right and God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the water let it divide the water from the waters and see he's already created the Heaven and Earth so this is just coming out of the heaven and coming out of the Earth all right and God made the firmament now he made it and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so that's the atmosphere and God called the firmament what heaven Capital H and the evening in the morning were the second day all right so now this is the Son of God so let's we're not going to talk about the creation we just kind of you know get that as a foundation all right but who is this guy that's doing it is God Elohim self-existing there's no one there except the angels and the devil and his angels that's all there there's no sons of God as far as you and I standing around God because the prophet told us that we were nothing before the world we were nothing before we were born before we were born we were not anywhere except in the mind of God all right A lot of people don't understand that but let's kind of we're going to spend a little time on this let's break it down a little bit you say how can that happen happen say if I were going to have excuse me honey 10 kids if I was God now this is how simple God is if I was God and I was all knowing which God is right he's all knowing he knows everything is going to happen every birth is ever going to happen in the world he knew it before this time we're talking about right here right now if I was all knowing and I knew I was going to have exactly 10 kids where would that be that'd be in my mind right I could name them I could know what they look like so why couldn't God do that God knew ever because his mind listen people we only use about 10% of our brain and some of us don't even use that 10% so there's 90% of our brain that's laying dormant because of sin because of enmity absolutely but if we were all knowing like God you know I think about this is God shows us an example I used to know a person that knew seven languages uh heard of a person that knew 23 different languages well where was that at that was a human person and they knew that where in their brain cuz they didn't come from anywhere else it come from what they stored up in their head and they could sit there and talk you know Japanese and Chinese and Vietnamese and and English and Spanish and French and German they could hear it in one language and speak it another now an America I mean American if any um sinner could do that guess what God can do he's 10 billion times better than that so what we do down here shows a little speck of what God is all together all right same way with children if I knew when I was born and grew up mom had me so I'll have this superhuman perception that I knew I had 10 kids I could go ahead and name them cuz I see them I know they're here once what's in here remember what brother Brown said a thought is nothing until it's expressed but I still have that thought in my head right that thought's right here I can't do away with it this is my thought and if my thought is eternal it's going to have to be expressed cuz I can't keep it up here if it's Eternal now you and I have thoughts of what we're going to do tomorrow what we did yesterday and it's a what they call a fleeting or a passing thought God don't have a passing thought I wished I would have done this I wouldn't know every step of his thought process is eternal and it will come to pass because it's coming to pass right now this is God's mind right here CU it's not something God thought of this is the thoughts of God if it was something he thought of he wouldn't be ever presentent right because it mean he went somewhere and thought about something and then he showed up over here this is the mind of God being played out right now right right now okay and so is this this is to mind this is what God had in his mind and this is what played out in the mind of God and now it's become a reality that's for knowledge that's his forn knowledge he fornew therefore he could predestinate everything that goes on down here but if I knew how many kids I was going to have and I knew that I was going to have every one of them because I was perfect I could go ahead and name them right and what I'm getting to is is that people have a real bad problem with job when he says Where Were You When The Morning Star s together and the sons of God shouted for Joy well we weren't all around the throne praising God in glorified bodies but we were in the mind of God doing the same thing because that's what's going to happen when we get there okay so we we can't bring God together we like to keep him out here like in a journey you know from here to here God's Journey is just like this he's already finished the journey because I'm want to set this basis cuz we're going to talk about when the sons of God shouted for joy and and it's going to be what the mind of God got what God had in his mind he knew we would be shouting about the Plan of Salvation when we got here therefore to him it's just as real job stepped into a reality that's more real than what we are here but I don't want to get we don't want to be confused we want to stay you know let's stay on the line but we do want to bring some of these things out so God created all this Heaven and Earth now on the sixth day what did he do and God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the fou of the air now did God create us I don't think so we were there in him but because brother Brandon said if you have eternal life today you always did have eternal life and eternal life always was eternal that's why they call it eternal life so he said let us make man in other words develop right if you make a cake you're not you really you're not creating a cake you're putting the ingredients together cuz the Cake's in the ingredients God just took all the ingredients and said okay we're going to have man he's going to fall I'm going to come to Earth these people are in me and then one day I'm going to give my life so that I can release them they're going to still be born in sin cuz it can't happen any other way but now I'm putting my cake together let us make man he wasn't talking about every man that walked the face of the Earth you remember that right Genesis 126 is not every man that walked on the face of the Earth Genesis 126 is every Born Again Son of God by New Birth Earth because if you are then you're God made manifest in another form Adolf Hitler was not God back here made manifest because Adolf Hitler did not acquire eternal life all right he said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have demean over the fish of the sea and fou of the air cattle and over all the earth now all the Earth Adam remember was an amateur God he was the god of the Earth all the Earth why did God make this Earth for you and I to rule and rain over all right and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image see there he created man now watch in his own image that don't have to be that creation there it's right here right here because this man's going to go into Genesis 3:16 right this man is going into flesh right watch in IM as God created him male and female created he them all right a creation inside of itself because remember those people were not created and you and I weren't in the Garden of Eden right as people but we were in this Mind Of God we were going to come forth all right watch Wait so these are not theop that he created these are not theop so you had a beginning your theophany had a beginning if it did then you're bound for a different place right your theophonic now we know that Sinners have theophanies but not like this one let's talk about this man right here let's go back to the mind again Donnie fush God knew he was coming God knew he'd receive eternal life God knew before the foundation of the world that that would happen so he didn't go ahead and create Donnie faush Donnie faush always was in the mind of God because remember if you weren't in his mind before the foundation of the world you're not going to have eternal life now right that's right well if you're born again you literally are part of God exactly thank you that's what I'm getting to that's great that's fine yes but see that's if that theophany when you're born again you're are you're literally God you're this man that said let there be light or let there be whatever literally if you're not you're a second person that's right that's what we're coming to people we think that we're we think we're over here and God's over here and what's dad been trying to preach that's right he's here if you're here and you're born again he has to be here he can't be anywhere else that's not friend people on the internet say he's only here in L Georgia but if you're born again right if you're born again that's where God is that's not where he was or wants to be that's where he is ever presentent right here we're going to have to stop this might get better than I thought but do you see though how some people look at it and they they get it messed up you can't get Son of God messed up right that's why daddy preached on it for about 8 years remember that picture that was on the wall when I got here in 1998 it was still on that wall and it didn't come down for just a little while you know after I come back but he' been preaching it since' 91 or ' 92 about the Son of God and who the Son of God was CU if you don't get this guy right forget about this man okay all right just pray pray that God will help us all of us may we'll all learn I believe I believe we will
