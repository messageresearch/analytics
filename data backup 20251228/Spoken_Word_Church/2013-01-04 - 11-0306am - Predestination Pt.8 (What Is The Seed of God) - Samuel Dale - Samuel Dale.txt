going to sing a song in just a minute but I was thinking something you know this morning and you know if you want to know the the weather forecast you generally turn on the computers now and you can just run it through and see what it's going to be for the next month whatever but I got to thinking about that you know you don't never want to call the devil about what the weather's going to be he'll always give you a bad report right it's either too hot it's too cold it's too w it's too dry it's too this it's too that so don't ever ask the devil what the weather report is you know you call God to ask what it is that's right all right and he says well it may be hot today but said that's good for the bringing the seed out and make them grow it may be wet today but said that's got to have that for the moisture it may be a little windy but you know that's to blow away all this old pollen you know and all this stuff so now which one are you asking about the weather report I like that you say what in the world do you mean I mean why is it that always you know you we saying we're feeling so bad we're so down we're having so many troubles and I know we do true we do but when you call me what do I say I said well everything's great right no matter how sick I am what is it everything's great well you know now let's just sing that I am blessed because the other day I was going down to see brother going pick up brother Ray go down to see brother da and I stopped to get me a biscuit and I said to the ladies they young this real young girl and I said uh she said how are you doing today I said I'm doing wonderful I said how are you she said I'm blessed right and I thought you know a young kid saying I'm blessed so let's just sing that let's sing I am blessed all right I am blessed I am every that I now don't sing it the way the world sings it when I wake up in the morning they say till I L which means you're only get blessed dur the day we saying when I amess now shake hands for one another and tell each other you're blessed I am bless smile on your face every I I am when I wake up in the morning when I lay my head see that's oh I amess one more time I am blessed when I wake up in the when I lay my head to rest I am bless oh go ahead and tell the doctor that one time go in and tell him like I told you the other day I told that and I said if everybody felt like I do you'd be out of business do he just he laughed he said well I'm in that business but why can't we just keep a happy face and say I'm blessed things starts going wrong and say well it's for a reason right amen because I thought we believe the Bible that said all things work together for good to them that are the called according to his purpose amen I asked said something like that to a lady one time and she said how can I be blessed when this is wrong and that's wrong this I didn't say no more because see she never knew what I was talking about she didn't know that I was talking about we're blessed right used to talk Johnny on the phone and say how you doing she said well the Lord woke me up this morning so that means you're blessed you know we don't have to make it up see the world's making it up right you know they're trained to say I'm blessed well why can't we say that we're blessed why can't we do okay you can go to your seats now all right to see everybody in the house of the Lord GL to have Matt and BB in the Butterbean with us and so we glad to just do that I think it was a little boy I saw one while ago I hadn't seen before so we always say you know when you come that you're you're you're you're just you're welcomed as a visitor but when you you know you're here one time you just uh you're not a visitor no more you're just part of us amen so just remember that remember to pray for Brother Dean cuz sister feggy had talked to her this morning and said he was was really hurting real bad so remember that just keep praying that the Lord would would take care of those things by way of announcements now remember that um this coming weekend will be the ministers meeting up at brother Jal Hughes right and I imagine it will be way probably going up and I won't be going because in June will be going because they can go over to his her fathers and see them but anyhow remember that and just be much in prayer then the third Saturday will be the fellowship meeting at brother Tom kaines so remember that if any of you want to go let us know we'll try to make arrangements all right now here's the schedule for a while and we got a lot of it so remember it uh April the 10th which not 10th and I'll through there brother Claude W singer will be here with us uh for that weekend so remember that all right now April the 23rd and the 24th will be the Easter weekend and brother uh Jim Pinkston from Witchita Kansas will be here preaching for the Saturday and the Sunday service and then we'll be having a dinner together and on that dinner you know you this we're asking the sisters to make a a good Easter dinner you know for that time all right then may the 21st and 22nd that'll be the fellowship meeting weekend here at the church May the 22nd 21st 22nd brother juul fory the Lord willing will be here preaching for us on that all right then on the July the 4th weekend which this year will be our 40th year being here but it will be on

that weekend because we will be having a cater dinner for you to show our thanks to you about the the doing and and being the Lord willing October the 30th I'm announcing this way ahead of time because of contacts made uh brother Ron Spencer will be here with us preaching and we do not know where it'll be Saturday and Sunday but I know it'll be for the Sunday uh weekend all right then we may have one in March uh it is unscheduled as of now a brother from Kenya is I'm contacting him about it the brother that was here a year ago or sometime you know with brother Roger and he came from originally from Kenya he's some where else now so uh we're going to see about getting him to preach sometime there in March about the 27th but anyhow that's good enough schedule at least you know we've got a plans to be here for the whole year if the Lord don't come take us away if he does we'll let set in heaven and listen to these brothers preach a while and they take care of it okay all right I think that's all the announcements I miss any all right let's turn to Ephesians 1 and Matthew 19 Ephesians 1 and Matthew 19 Matthew says that little boy is going to be a Matthew going to be ace Matthew or Matthew Ace ain't figured out which way going yet on it but he says that's going to be a little boy and if it's not it's going to be Matas I guess or something he's already got it figured out that name Matt is going to be their you know for sure and all of that but okay all right so that'll be in Matthew 19 father we thank you for the day and we love you and we surely truly know that we are blessed amen what a wonderful thing it is to know that we are Christians living in an hour in a time when the world is falling apart and everything is is going to powder and to see the world and the way it's going Lord but to realize that we knew way ahead of time what's going to take place and we know that we're programed to know these things and to see these things before they come to pass so there's no surprise to us to see how the world condition is existing now and Lord we just ask you to help us and give us Grace to stand within the hour of the time that we are to stand upon this Earth and to be the Bride of Jesus Christ we ask you now that you would just come and Lord as we speak your word that you would do as you said in your word you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destru ction the prophet was reading the other day said that you did not have to heal to prove your power but you did have to heal to prove your word so then we depend upon your word and we thank you and just have your way now forgive our sins lead us in thine understanding and keep us in Jesus name amen all right remember those announcements and brother Joe's got them on the computer if you need them to to be able to follow uh therein okay Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself Accord according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ now let's go back to Matthew because the thought will be coming from here to this point and it'll be from Matthew 19:16 and this is actually the Rich Young Ruler Etc coming to Jesus and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I don't know how far we'll get with the notes and using them and things but we will try to to cover as much as we can now this last weekend we were talking about the germ of life and we know and realize that no matter what anything does uh they can make a a grain of wheat it looks so perfect and it makes just as much bread makes just as many cherries and cereal and things like that as you know anything with true life but the one thing is missing which is the germ of life because science cannot create the germ of life I was talking to Brother Richard Wilson this morning and it really just struck me up in the morning I were thinking about it and uh you know you can take science today can take the ever what you call it the egg from from the female The Germ from the male or whatever you want to call them great big word sperms Etc and uh you know they can take that and they can actually put it together and and really put it into another person you know and have the third party producing the birth of a child well now that is beyond anything uh sensible as far as our reasoning thinks so it's actually a miracle to think about what they can do and your prophet of God said that man has broken into God's laboratory all right now they cannot create life they cannot make the woman have the baby no matter if she has the egg they can't make the man produce a child no matter if he does have the germ it has to be brought together into the condition in existence to be able to bring forth you know a a child all right now in that then if the germ of life is not there you heard the prophet over and over and over talking about these things that no matter how much the the hen can lay no matter how many eggs but if she's not been with the male the eggs will not be will not produce because that they're not gerti see they do not how of The Germ of Life all right now The Germ of life is so small until science cannot find it now you say well now they can do this they can do that but they can't find the germ of life now you can look back in there and see a bud coming forth yes but you cannot find the uh you know the The Germ of life right and this is what's so amazing that actually The Germ of life of a gat you know how small a gat is you know little bitty minute pain you know that the germ of life is the same size for a n as it is for an elephant you know see we you know we look at something and try to figure it out it can't be cuz you can't see the life of the The Germ of life for the elephant no more than you could find it for the nap or the the small sugar that we have around here that you know it's just almost impossible to see it you know and things but you know what it still has a heart it still has the ability to live and Etc because God gave it to it but my point of what I'm talking about is that germ of life if it's not in you and I then you know we would not be here naturally see and we are the multiplication of that natural germ of life and the prophet said as we were trying to cover there you on I don't want that away from your mind I wanted to stay with you that if we don't have the germ of life he said there's no way that we could have ever have or come to eternal life all right we'll get back to some of the things because it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally right from God it's the word of seed right see and if we don't have that then there's no way to ever come to eternal life now it's always been in man like the Rich Young Ruler as reading there man has always wondered about eternal life of course now in the message they got the answer we always had it you know we always had well you know then that way let's just take this old Bible that we've been reading and talking about Nicodemus and Jesus said you must be born again and all this that and the other let's just burn the thing and just chunk it away and forget it you know because we've got such a great Revelation now until we don't need the the Bible or or or anything and and and we don't need the message or the hour that the prophet would tell you that you must be born again see we just don't need that if we always you know have eternal life so that's what we want to deal with is a point today about that but I want you to think on it this way that that germ of Life the only way that it can be in us without God being a respector of persons you know are able to land and who would receive it and be like in the The Parables of the the you know to the disciples there that they were talking you know about the seed falling in the ground this goes here that goes there you know cares of Life taking it but the word says there one of them says they took the word and they held it right you know they held it in other words they cherished it so what's the difference in all of us all of us have an opportunity that's right as I've tried to make it plain over and over God doesn't do anything according to his own wanting of desires he does it according to his forn knowledge so never get away from that thought that's right because the prophet said what predestination or election either one you cover looks back to for knowledge that's right all right so then as I covered to you over and over for knowledge must be first right that's right if predestination means the destiny of mankind upon the Earth and I believe that is exactly the way God done it but he predestinated it not on the basis that one person could be saved and another person couldn't be saved right he predestinated it on the basis of that he fornew right all right now he fornew who would want to be saved yes and who would not want to be saved that's correct all right now everybody follow that cuz I want to make sure you follow that what I'm saying on this germ of life before we continue on in thought see because if God doesn't Forno then what kind of a god do we serve right well maybe he might know some things well then you got to maybe so God that's right y you don't have an eternal infinite all knowing God Amen your God is your own belly you say no it's not well your belly is run by your mind so that's whatever it is in other words you're in it for the money you're in it for the the uh whatever the popularities the the things that you desire instead of being in it to try to help somebody see about God you see like I said everybody's always wanted to find out about eternal life and if you're wanting to find out about eternal life then it means that one that there must be an eternal life to find out about right number two means that you don't have it right that doesn't need a great Revelation does it that just simply we believe in it and understanding it as human Mortals mankind has always wanted to find out about God in his ways so you know and we're wanting to go as the old Indian called it to the Happy Hunting Ground the the this group calls it a great big thing here and this group calls it that way but everybody wants to know about eternal life well that means as I said number one there is an eternal life to do because you could not want something if it's not there to pull it and number two is that you don't have it right well brother D what about the quotes of the Prophet well all right what about it you know the point is that he can't make one thing in one place and something else in another so you know if we leave it Al long enough it'll come together all right and and we can understand it but what were we talking about the germ of life God's for knowledge allowed him to look all the way down through the time on earth right and as it did then he could see who would want to be saved and who would not want to be saved h and in doing that then he could determine or predestinate then which is Destiny determined or set beforehand see see there's nothing wrong with predestination amen you approach it by the forn knowledge of God and then you can can walk upon that and that's what I said though in the message there the other day I said we're afraid of for knowledge cuz see for knowledge has to do with knowing what you will do we want want it to be upon some form of some magic trick that we've lived like the devil you know all of our life and all at once right before we die we want to over you know and the last few hours Maybe not maybe not too many hours cuz we don't want to go too far with this you know but maybe the last couple of hours that we're living we can click over and live like God you know and then we just step over into glory and and just have a wonderful you know that's that's our thought see we're afraid of what we are and what we think you remember I tried to get that point across see we're afraid of forn knowledge because it does determine and is dealing with what you're doing but see then by God's for knowledge he would be able to look down and see who would want to be saved see and like the little woman at the whale that would you know say we we you know in other words the prophet said like it he said she knew the scriptures she says we know the Messiah right comth she knew the Bible you know she she had studied that much of it and she knew it and like he said then because of the religious system of the world that didn't have anything to hold her she turned into being a prostitution you know and went out the wrong way because there was nothing in the church that was any good right and you look around what is it in the churches this that's worth anything oh yeah big programs big this big givings big going big doing y yeah but what about the word right amen what about the word that's right okay now see then by God's for knowledge he could actually put in you if he wanted to I don't deal with that putting in you and the seed sticking man wants to draw it out cuz that's what tantalizes people's mind right amen you know I mean it tantalizes the mind to take a draw and to be able to draw something there you know and then put a spot and then oh I can relate to that you know but what do you need all that far when you just believe God's word that's right all right and see then what is that germ of life now as I said it's no different for the elephant than it is for the NAT so it's not something that you can find right it's not a spot because there is no way if if the germ of life in a a a peach or whatever you know a person or a human The Germ of life if science can't find it then it can't be a spot cuz if it was a spot they could find it right yeah you you're thinking with me just sensibly see then people wants to deal with some kind of something put in you I had this down in here yeah that's what Napoleon says you know walked around you know he thought and reincarnations and believing and this and that and the other you know thought he'd been here before and that's what people thinks you know well it's just some way that I believe now your Prophet said that it's totally gone from your mind right all right now you if we're going to believe what he says then we can't come back up with something to say well you know I just believe I feel like I was before the world now the prophet said it's gone from your mind right now we're going to believe him about acts 238 but we're not going to believe him about that well I'll tell you what do I just kind of believe I just kind of feel like I D see now you're getting into a propped up you know situation there's no need of it that's right the devil will come along slap you for a loop and you you you can't stand on a propped up thing but but the word of God that stand there and I told you I use the law of elimination we're talking about that last night in the Bible study a little I use the law of elimination in in I like brother hter used to say if a equals B and it's it's common sense to know b and a is the same thing right you that's that's sensible that's no problem right but you see the law of elimination it says to me like this quotes from people see I always was eternal but then the law of elimin ation sets forth in me to wonder if I always was eternal then why would I seek after eternal life right right and why would the devil have such an upper hand about me you know in the doings you know if I always was when I quote of the Prophet amen I believe it and I know I believe he knows what he's talking about that's right right but according to the law of elimination if I have something I don't need it right sensible if I always was eternal then Jesus Christ never had to die right there's no reason for him to come into the world right but yet he did come and that law of elimination then eliminates our ideas cuz you'd have to rewrite the Bible as I said about Nicodemus you'd have to say that Jesus said to Nicodemus just Nicodemus all you got to do is just know who you are you got to believe well he done a pretty good job believing he put his life on the line he put his job on the line if they caught Nicodemus coming to Jesus what do you think his buddies would have done with him all right but the the point is I'm trying to get you to see that God can look down and see that you would want eternal life that's right and if you want eternal life no then it would be necessary that he had it there for you okay it would mean that he'd have to provide away and he has all right and he provided that way through Jesus Christ Christ Our Lord see and there's a lot speaking of in the scripture run a little reference sometime on eternal life you got probably about um 15 times that it talks about I'm talking about eternal life you know and see Jesus said one day he said search the scriptures for in them what he said you think you have eternal life all right see mankind as I said he's always wanted to deal with it his thoughts has always been not to to he wants to live in this world yes and he'd love to live in this world eternally you know and never have a thing but he knows no matter what you think about yourself you can look in the mirror and you can you can stand in there and you can do like this and like I told you there's more muscle strained by people looking in the mirror than they are lifting weights and that's not a joke that's a truth cuz you you know but you can look in the mirror and you can look up there brother col can look in that mirror and he can say man I ain't a day over why you li he just lying to himself I can still do everything I could ever do you're lying you're dying so then the point after a while see you may PP yourself up for a while you know and think it's doing pretty good but in after a while reality sets in and then what do you start thinking about life after death right it changes from living to life after death and then you start realizing hey I better be concerned about the future you the Rich Young Ruler you've heard the prophet he was a great man done all these great things but one day he got a concern about eternal life that's true what about me and you so what is the germ of life this God's for knowledge as I said down and I know the quotes of the Prophet that's fine but quotes will kill you that's right if you don't have a revelation now science cannot and your Prophet gave it about five times I was looking this morning he said science can't find the germ of life that's right well science says they can't find it you know I mean I I don't understand the germ of Life do you yeah I mean we got a beautiful garden and you know there's not a weed in your garden and you go out and you say well the neighbor he's cleaning out his chicken house a lot of people wouldn't know what that is but just cleaning out a building you know and putting the compost upon your ground you know and uh you'd say well you know man I've got a beautiful garden there's no weeds whatsoever but they say that chicken litter as we call it here in the South you know that it will really grow stuff good we make the statement it'll grow grass on a rock and that's about true you know if you get a little moisture to it but you know you go put that on your garden and the next year you got all kind of weeds right now where' they come from you didn't S no wheat seed right I mean you didn't go out there and say well I need some crab graice and I need this and see the chicken now the chicken itself never ate no crab GP right right that's right they didn't feed crab gra to the chicken but in the ground up seeds was crab gr seeds that's why you get it right and there's no way to see it within would we want a comparison to try to make it that I was born with this seed in me I asked a brother a simple question one time CU that's the way I like to do things I like to ask what I think is very simple question and I said the seed was it where was it at in you you know that's just a simple question if you say you were born with this seed in you where was it at was it in your body you got a lot of that from Mom and Daddy and Uncle a and all these other things and genetics and your soul right see when the prophet is explaining that you have a seat in you he's not explaining that there is some word tattooed inside of your soul Spirit or body or somewh right he's not trying to describe of some something that when that baby was born that the Lord was right there to go you know but he didn't do do it in the other now you're getting into see you're getting into God choosing right and we're supposed to believe that God didn't choose by his desires cuz he desired that everybody be saved but now what did the little woman at the well have that's right gave you a couple of quotes where brother R said one of them said she had representation of predestination and then the other said she had representation from predestination that's all now he said that that religious Pharisee he had no representation of predestination that's right but yet the religious Pharisee knew the Bible of what he had to the letter that's right right so inside of that Pharisee was the complete Bible as we call it right of knowledge but yet he had no representation all right but the Apostle Paul and I gave you that quote where one of them had it by head knowledge and Paul had it by The Germ of life so what was the difference in Paul there was a great man that religious leader that high priest in the days of Paul if you could have touched him in any form they would have killed him right sure true you could bring up anything against him it would have killed him but here's the Apostle Paul killing the Christians causing them to blaspheme he said in other words making them deny Jesus Christ right and yet he had to JM of life that's right the little woman at the whale look at her and look at all the people around the great people wonderful time you know but yet she had the germ of life was it a spot down in her was The Germ of Life a spot or a seed right was it somewhere down in your inch square compartment a man wants to talk about thinking that's where the soul abides you know in the heart of a human that is in no other animal is there a little bitty seed somewhere in there that's just floating around is it a speck of dust is it a a a grain right or is it the fact that God forew which one is it that was the point I was trying to get across which one is it that's right and you say well brother Dale you don't believe what the prophet said about a seed being you're a liar right that's best way it say it cuz I believe it well you you turn it down you don't no no I'm trying to put it together with theti Bible in the message of the hour that's right I'm trying to get it in the right place I believe in that seed but what is the seed of God I thought the seed of God was the word of God right I thought Jesus the son of man SED the seed of the word amen and this is a hard one to swallow he swed the seed of the word which was the law right that's what your Prophet said right he said he so the LA yeah but the law brother was dead law spiritual according to Paul right but that's what I'm trying to get you to see what is the seat of God it's the word of God amen then did you have a word in you or you did now here's what I do believe that you had a connection to that word amen amen like I said if I ask you what scripture is your favorite one W would say Genesis 126 maybe brother dick would say another scripture over here you know I've heard him talk about the the the fact that we've got to be pregnated by the word so maybe his scripture would be be it unto me according to Thy word you know from the scriptures but see mine would be Malachi 4 because that was the one that held me to bring me into this message because when I read it the first time I said there's going to be two prophets come before the end of the world I couldn't get it straight but that's held on to me see all right but that's a connection to the word amen I didn't have tattooed inside of my brain somewhere cuz if I did Satan had that messed up so you sure don't want to die and the best way you'd want to do is put it in the in the soul and you know and brother random didn't say the inch square compartment was the soul no you better get your quote right he said science says it's possible that may be the abod of the Soul you better get your quotes in the correct order the Abode of the soul is a lot of bit different than than to say the soul is your you know the in square compartment is your soul all right now so the word is the seat of God Amen the little woman at the well now boy I got into it one time I quoted that to a brother and I thought he was going to fight me about it and brother Phil temp and I was standing there life and and this brother I mean I I just all I quoted was one thing that brother rown said that that the that you know that maybe she got it from her mother sitting on her knee and you know when he was little you know like a u Moses you know remember sitting on his mama's knee and I know the movie and how they portray it he didn't didn't know it till he about 40 years old you know but that ain't exactly right but anyhow he uh she told him said you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter now I'll take that see I don't care what the movies portray or whatever else does or how he found it out and what took place I'm sure he didn't find out a lot of things until wa later on but you know in that little Fell's mind was always I am not the son of Pharaoh's daughter right I'll call her mommy I I'll do the best and honor her but she's not my mother cuz I I hear it in my ears ringing you know all right so when I said that to the brother about you know that that maybe the little woman heard it from her mother boy he let me have it he said I'm tired of this Catholic Doctrine know you know me pH bold looking at him what the world you talking about he said I'm tired of this old Catholic Doctrine said had to get it from her mama you know it didn't don't on me until see the Catholic Doctrine about mother you know mother mother mother mother you know they worship mother instead of the son you know I started laughing I thought brother phield was going to fall over the floor you know and cuz the guy was accusing me of being I said go talk to brother brandom about it he's the one that said them things you know but still all right that's his business I don't care but listen I thought the Bible said Faith cometh by hearing that's right and hearing by the word that's right so I simply asked the question is it the word that you everybody says you're born with that is given the new birth or is it the word you hear after you get here that's all the simple question I've asked because if you say it was what was was in you before the world then you don't need the new birth you you don't need it like people talking about but my point is this what is that germ of Life all right so that little woman at the well in her sinful condition but yet she recognized him cuz when he when he told her her problems she didn't say you religious Pharisee get out of here you know hypocrite no she said you're right I've had five husbands and one I'm living with not mine she knew he was right she said we know that the Bible says a prophet will come he said I'm he that speaks to thee that's right but she never there was nothing else ever said now listen here's another point we'll cover right here because people quote brother ramus saying see that word she had in her come alive all right now that's a quote now what does he mean when you take the law of elimination what does brother Brandon mean well brother who are you well I'm me so who are you but that's all right but what does it mean when brother brandom would say that that little woman at the well said when that light struck her said that seed came alive did she have eternal life okay we've took the law of elimination and said what there was no way she could have eternal life that's right because Jesus Christ the scripture said had not been glorified he had not been crucified that's right so how could you have eternal life right are you listening right yes so then you've given the woman eternal life and every situation in the Bible where that things would happen and the word would be quickened to people you're giving them eternal life would that be true are you giving those people did the little woman at the well have eternal life because the the seed came alive read to Prophet I didn't mean to go this way but read The Prophet's message you I'll be glad to send you the quotes on that he said when that that seed was laying there he said it was quickened the life y so the seed that was laying in her was quickened to life what was that seed she told you what it was she said we know that when the Messiah cometh that had held on to her from mother or somebody cuz your Prophet said she knew the scriptures now you argue with him some way she knew that a messiah was going to come even though she was not of the lineage of the Jews she was a Samaritan a half Jew and a half Gentile but yet she was looking for the Messiah to come What Was Made Alive what was Quicken to her come on it was Quicken to her that he was the Messiah right right he said I he she throw her water pot down went into the City and brother R said he never done no signs nowhere else and that whole city believe what she said cuz they could see such a drastic change in a woman from one day of being a prostitute and many husbands and all kind of things and all that once well almost here preaching the gospel right right from a personal experience that he never had to do another sign and the people believed you haven't never noticed in the Bible it says that many people believed well did they when they would believe did that make them eternal life that's a good Baptist Doctrine I went have believe and come on listen I know how to what the prophet's talking about so let's keep on going if you want to on that your new birth does begin when you believe I said begin I didn't say it was completed it begins when you believe cuz you got to believe that's right you got to come to justification you got to believe you got to do those things okay but now get the point that little woman then that seed or whatever you want to call it that was laying in her whatever way you want to make it it came alive but that didn't give her eternal life that's right well bless God I'm going to believe it did well all right but show it to me in the Bible show me how it could be done before Jesus Christ died now listen this is what my wife said the other day and she didn't know I didn't know I was coming this way but she said you better explain about them Old Testament people now they won pass the Testament people wouldn't lost right if you took that from the last message I was trying to preach about it those Old Testament people wouldn't lost now folks come on that's right they were looking unto right that's right and when Jesus Christ came see they could enter into Paradise with him right right because you know he made the way now the Old Testament Paradise was the bosom of Abraham now it wasn't a big fat belly right it was Abraham's Faith right faith of Abraham in the Seed of Abraham provided a place for his children to abide right you know are his people and it's not a physical it was a spiritual condition that's right and you can't see the spiritual condition so now get what I'm saying the little woman at the well if you're going to say she had a seed in her brother R said that came alive right she did not have the new birth that's right she had faith for the time you remember that message a year or two ago I don't know how long it's been I preached on it fa for the time you can be healed brother R said see that was laying there and them people they were healed he said she had faith for the time in other words you can have it like that that David went out there and he said bar lion giant whatever it is you can't kill me because the prophet had already anointed him to be king and until he become king he didn't care for the whole world like I said he they said he had five Stones they say that Goliath had like four or five more Brothers he decided okay I better take enough I may need him cuz he wasn't afraid why because it had already been quickened to him that he was going to be king y amen and there's no way to stop it but did that give him eternal life no all it could give him was what Lord Thy word have I hid in my heart my soul nothing work that I might not sin against thee when he died it provided a place for him to live in yep until Jesus Christ could come forth and resurrect that's right so then what are you saying that germ of life is the forn knowledge of God that you would accept the word I believe that that's right amen amen he didn't have to put it in that's right right those are statements right to get us to think that's right exactly amen instead of just throwing it out as a blanket for everybody to grab and who to hold on to no you look down and through time and he seen you would want it he had it provided for you amen Jes now that doesn't do away with his predestinated plan that I was trying to cover at the end of it cuz that's what I want to get to you know when your Prophet said it was in him to be a father it was in him to be a Healer it was in him to be a savior he never gained him attributes when he got here so as far as he was concerned he had children amen as far as he was concerned sickness would come into existence he had that in him that's right like I tried to get you to see on the message back there maybe not enough time on it but the scripture said we read it there in Ephesians that what we were predestinated in him chosen in him you know if we were chosen in him then we had to be in him that's right it wasn't him choosing what's out there from work that's right the chosen was in him but just make sure you get what I'm talking about because see There's the link of what I'm trying to say that we look at predestination and we just say well if I was predestinated I'll be there if I want I won't there ain't nothing I can do about it now that's a lie of the devil that's right amen now if you don't want do anything about it that's exactly right right amen you know if you don't want to do nothing about it you're exactly right you lost and you're always be lost that's right amen that's as sensible as can be see we want to look at predestination and things and looking at to try to find something I've seen them draw out dots and preach that God give you a soul and Satan give you a soul now Satan can't create right to law of elimination no matter what beautiful things would come forth from Li law of elimination Satan cannot create amen that's right he perverted our soul amen he cannot create one amen right that's why I believe your soul is real am that's see they used to say it's just the nature of the spirit well brother R didn't say that he said it was the nature of the spirit that's right you didn't say just cuz when you put just on her you make it messed up that's right what it is but see your soul has got to be more real what you are amen cuz that's what you really are we'll get down to that but all right just's come on just for a minute and then we'll quit see then that little woman she had the germ of life right that's right would you agree amen but what was it would it not be what the prophet said that it was her representation by predestination or from the predestination that he knew she would want and recognize him as the Messiah and the others would turn right see I believe the little woman that the well was in the upper room you know I ain't got no quotes for that but I just do I believe she went I believe I believe that's where she got eternal life see so I believe that's where Mary the people want to call her the mother of God that's where she got eternal life you know what she gave birth to him right but to show you how far off it'd be then what would she be giving birth to cuz when she got over there so far you know she begin to say your father and I saw you see she denied the Virgin birth if it was not for the grace of God she wouldn't have been in the upper room if she had to took the Bible said she took the things that pondered in her heart amen she was troubled over the things that happened read your Bible but you see it was not the birth to the little ROM at DW for her to recognize the Messiah right it was not the new birth to Peter when he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and brother R said The Father revealed that unto him that's right sure that didn't give him the new birth that's right amen true it held on to him long enough till he could get to the upper room and sure fought like everything to get out of there you say what do you mean well he denied the Lord Jesus right I'm sure he sat in the upper room saying I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to be here I have rejected him and denied him I need to go out and do like Judas and hang myself right sir God and he probably would have but God had a plan that's right we ain't got to them yet but God had a plan cuz inside of that man was a gift predestinated eternally listen like we're talking about last night them gifts can be in unregenerated people exctly but they're still predetermined eternally right that don't make the person Eternal that's right sure flat don't but Peter see had to go to the upper room right and receive eternal life amen no matter what his confession was no matter what had been made alive to him let's see if I can get another one then we'll quit I'm going by memory this morning so forgive you had two on the road to AAS have you ever read that real close what happened there was two on the road to emus right and Jesus got in there you know and he made out like he was going on you know and he wasn't doing it he knew he wasn't he he going to eat with him but you they said come on eat with us come on spend the night with us eat with us here you know come in here with us and and and dwell with us right and as he did he began all day long brother R said I forgot how many hours it three or nine I forgot how many hours need to call Brother Ernie on that I was talking to him last night yall just pray for him and they have a lot of problem because his daddy and his mother and his brother and all that had a lot of problem so pray for him you know you've seen it on the internet and things his mother's uh you know having to a lot of broken bones where she fell and his daddy's cancer in his uh I believe he said lungs now any how they found cancer and you know and then his brother now he's he said he had a a kidney stone was big as a quarter some of you had him what big as a small pee and you sure flat don't come out they had to put a tube in him to be able to rupture it you know or Bust it to make it to come out because of the tube but any have to pray for him cuz what I'm saying is brother Ernie could quote that to you real quick he'd say it's 9 hours you cuz he remembered I can it's either 6 or 9 hour sermon they heard right and when they got through you know they said well you you you've talked a lot about these things and we believe them but said you don't seem to realize that Jesus died yeah he said you don't seem to realize that he had to Die the Bible said he opened their understanding of the scriptures did that give them eternal life he goes over and appears to the disciples when the two the two got back you know and you know it says again he opened their understanding of the scriptures what about about him and what he come to do and they're still over there just a few days later saying you going to restore the kingom right exactly see it wasn't a new birth right but you see that's what people wants to say these people we've born of this seat and when the light flash it just flash and I come alive you know like the the uh who was it come on just hitting me um the was it da the man that was in like his 90s when he was converted somewhere in one of the brother he said that light flashed across sir he said when it did he struck the water amen that didn't give him eternal life he probably already had it right see you're people are thinking and you're thinking in your mind that there was a seed laying down in there and then that seed Was Made Alive well I'm trying to show you that that seed can be made alive on many occasions but that's not from New Birth right you must be born again Amen to have eternal life amen the gift of God is eternal life right through the Bible says Jesus Christ that's right see then what is it the word can be made alive in you I was called a 2-year Theologian and I told you my experience I didn't CL a going to come in this message that gave me eternal life to just come into the message right when I came into this message I saw I didn't have eternal life but everybody else said you come into the message prove you had it I bet people to tell me that you come into the message didn't you so yeah but I didn't have eternal life right and I saw eternal life for two years and it in those times that I would read six books a day and listen to two tapes I just rejected my wife my family and T and it just saw I done was read and read and read and studyed cuz I knew how far we' missed it right and the way we was going I was seeking God and one day then it was all quickened and Made Alive two years and I sought the baptism with the Holy Ghost well you're just that it's just your stubborn all right all right but you don't got it right and you know what never denied the word you know all that knowledge I had he never denied a bit of it when he come in to indwell me you know he started making that alive to me amen that's right like way said when he come back to the Lord you know he said Daddy watch this I said just he said how come I know all that right I said because you read it when you were 10 years old when he 10 years old he read the message like everything it was laying there but that didn't give him eternal life that's right see the little woman at the well she had representation from predestination God looked down and Shout she'd want it and it there it was that's the seed that's in you not something put down in you like a spot and you know well there it is I found the spot you know x-ray the other day looked down into my heart and found a little bitty spot the other probably cancer now you don't like that right cuz you think I'm joking I'm not you better go have the thing checked because the seed of God cannot be seen no the seed of God is more invisible than the germ of natural life if the germ of natural life how canot be found by mankind how can you find the word of God outside of God bringing it to you that's right and I believe that there was something different about you yes sir I do I believe that if you go back in your life and check it you'll find out there was something about you different all of your life yes sir I've told you about it that I'd go out in the world of sin and do wrong and then come home and and feel dirty why because I remembered when I had met met God back there not as a new birth but I knew there was an eternal God before I ever come into this message cuz I had met him I seen him I know but that didn't give me eternal life how much word was quickened to me in all of those years that I could stand on when the two old man told me he said come on up and has long later come on up and preach for me and I just a young convert and I said I can't see what you're talking about sir I said brother maybe it's me you just pray for me I just can't see it he said well come on up and be with me and I no fight out with him I just told him I couldn't see it you know if I can't say something I can't say it that's right I just tell you I can't see it I ain't saying I ain't going to see it later when I said I can't see it that means I just don't understand it you see but God's for knowledge he looked down through and what is the germ of life God's for knowledge to see that you would want that right and he'd have it for you right why can't you look down and see I accepted it and then you can realize then if you accept it like I did for 2 years I accepted it let alone all those years before then but I accepted it you know but what one day he accepted me am a lot of difference amen that's right you can go a long time seeking after God sometimes I know what everybody other people teach you you don't have to search you don't have to seek God you don't have to do this that and the other you just got to believe it you got to out somewhere to get to a place where you can believe it believe what I a even got on the message today cuz the very first thing is that I've got in here is that we must make sure there's one thing for certain that what that the word is planted perfect and pure and unadulterated because only the word can be birthed that's where the trouble's at people trying to birth denominationalism and ideas and Mankind doctrines amen right yes sir instead of taking God's word amen and believe in it what did the prophet say he said false prophets produce false birth right true prophets produce true brother oh brother I'm trying to make them a prophet see that's all the mind can go on told you I'm no Prophet I'm a born again Son of God but I am not a prophet of God in this message we talked about that last night in the Bible study I do not have the characteristics of a prophet so I do not say I'm a prophet cuz I know what I'm not so don't you get in your idea that I am you said but the word comes the word comes to the spirit field the word supposed to come to the entire five-fold Ministry you mean you tell about evangelist yeah the word supposed to come to him to go out and evangelize where the trouble is it don't come to him he goes out and evangelize him the teachers go out they don't come to them they go out to teach what their own Doctrine right and it produces what church is full but false bir that's right go talk to him about the word and see if where're it's right or not that's amen if I deny the word then that's one thing for sure I've got I don't have the New Birth come on musicians come on I just want to make sure you understood what I was saying those Old Testament Saints they had a confession of their belief in God and that's what was holding them and provided a place for them to live in when they would pass own right yep amen and we'll get to it later where you talk about it like this you know what they had a soul it was not into full maturity of the theophany back there for them but it did give them a place to go a theophany because of theh is eternal life amen but you see what do you think about it if God is calling you then why not F follow him yeah but look what I have to give
