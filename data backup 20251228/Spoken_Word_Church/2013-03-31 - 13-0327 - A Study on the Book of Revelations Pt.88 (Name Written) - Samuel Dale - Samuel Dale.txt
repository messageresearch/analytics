which God gave unto him to show unto his servant stains which was shortly come to pass and he sin and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God in the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw did you see that read us today they hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein while for the time is at hand now let's go back where we were reading there last Wednesday and uh Revelations 19 starting in verse 11. and I saw heaven open and behold of my horse and he had set up on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he's a judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself now remember that no man knew it nobody knew this name this bit he himself and he's closer the vegetarian dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth go at the sharp sword remember how we were trying to bring out the other day people to believe that literally we're going to come back and fight a babble we're going to have a ward there's going to be a battle of us riding down and do it but notice where the sword comes from go back to the two witnesses in Revelations 11. and out of their mouth precedes fire this is not a form of just a battle of peoples because we'd be glorified just like he is and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with him he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he threaded the wine crash of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty God he hath on his Vester and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords you may be seated before that is blessing to the reading of the word now I was trying to explain something there and I I've tried before to explain you know and I'm not a theologian I'm not anything of a form ninth grade education but I I can read you know and and I believe that's what that we fail to do is reading with understanding we try to read to figure things out instead of just reading to let God explain it to us because he's saying what he means and he's meaning what he says and he's not changing it or anything he's just saying it but the Bible is so beautiful and back up I don't know it's been probably 10 years ago or something the Lord began to show me something about the writing of the scriptures and I've tried to explain that and you know to you and I down through the time and uh you know in doing it it's it's kind of like you know you've got in the Bible you've got the seven compound names of Jehovah all right now a lot of them are not even written out you know maybe Jehovah vijayra Jehovah tishka knew is really written out and you know as he speaks it but you've got to go to the commentators or the the people of writings and then you you can see that that that's what that's talking about that's right you know it gives the definition of it whereas we're reading it from an English form that's been translated from a Hebrew you know our Greek form of the Bible and as we read those things then we're we're limited to our English vocabulary in their ways but God has ways of doing things so you know when you're reading it the seven compound names of Jehovah well each one of those has a special reference to the people of God the Healer the Savior the Redeemer our Banner uh you know uh our peace our righteousness amen and all comes from bringing down to us words that you and I couldn't read and uh but thank God for those that labored and brought it we were watching that video the other night of the what is it the indestructible Bible or indestructible book that is out if you'd like to see it and it really explains the coming down with the Bible the writing of it and bringing it down and and the things and I would suggest that you get it and it comes on down to showing uh the different ones as they brought it out for you and I and you thank God you know for that I mean you ought to them because you know they are looking at things and trying to translate to us what this was said in Hebrew or in Greek and and bringing it down to the English language and it's very horrible language to start with because of our problems with it but see they had things dire that you can go to languages and like in us you know bored you heard it you know uh come on board pay your board I'm bored with you stand on the board you know all that one word but when they were writing the Greeks and the Hebrews and I that doesn't have a 14 different combination meaning you know it wasn't done that way it was brought down for our understanding and that's what I was trying to do Wednesday night to express a little bit to where that we could see it but to see it by Revelation not to just talk about wordings or how this is spelled or that is spelled or what goes on you know but to look at the Bible and that's what I want us to do I've always tried to get us to do is to read the Bible and let God speak to our hearts read The Prophet's message let God speak their hearts hear the tapes and things let God speak to our hearts of what those things are that's in the word right then we find out it don't have to be changed added to or anything it doesn't have to do anything it's beautiful I mean and it's it's a marvelous Bible or book Amen to express God unto mankind because that's his ways of doing it now everybody don't pay attention two things because uh that's not their thoughts or ideas but I've always watched in the writing of the Bible and you'll see that there'll be uh instances or cases whatever you call it that were it will be bold print you know and you'll see that it will be in a capitalization form of of all of the words like God will be g-e-o with a big D you know and and think and it'll be Lord will be that way and then right below it it'll turn right back another way you know and you you just look at that and you say well well you know that doesn't mean anything to me it's just the word god well it meant something to them or they wouldn't have put it that way married to burning bush if you'll notice in your writings it'll say I am that I am well that's in bold print right and brother Randall says that is jvhv now he'll say jvhu or jvhv no just use it both ways and he'll say they can never pronounce that amen he said nobody has ever been able to pronounce that name amen and said the best they could do was Jehovah you know from that and and bringing it out but the scripture says by my name was Jehovah would I never know right and and you know even if it's writing I had heard it before or even this video about it that when those scribes would write you know they wrote the Scrolls they didn't have no printing presses and different things you know they had the handwrite I don't know those writers when they would come to the word god they would stop go take a bath wash totally change clothes come back and write that word God because it meant so much to them all right see if we had that much reverence and respect about God's word it might change us a lot right you know about it but now in doing that see I've tried to explain it that way and I know that I don't have no way to express but what I see and I was trying to use them some of them later said well you need to explain that and the others said you know what you were saying was not right you know and I was using what would be known as the to me I was using the uppercase which would be bold uh letters with capital yep you know like g-o-d with a big D see and then I see that you would see the word God in another place and it would be g-o a little reverse small D you know and uh I use uppercase and lowercase and they said that wasn't the correct way but that's brother Dale's way okay that's my way of trying to decide to you and especially they said I was incorrect when I got into the New Testament with it to showing that that you know the name of Jesus Christ and all and I said that's a middle case because it's not lower and it's not upper it was the way they devised to write it but that's right now the main thing I want you to do is just think and I know now I'm telling you no so I've checked it so you know some said well my Bible don't read like yours about the italicized letters or the different things well that's true all right now I use a Scofield bible a 1909 which is the first that I know of a Scofield bible there is no 1611 Schofield Bible the Scofield wasn't back there you know that's right you kind of come on well later a few hundred years later but the the Scofield bible then it will change from and I notice I checked with wage and he's got to he's got the 1917 right all right see there's there's about three different Scofield Bibles that's right all right but the 1909 is the original now if you'll remember the 1909 was the one they chose to send out the spoken word if you wanted to buy it right because that was the Year brother random was born all right that was fine and all the doings but I'm just telling you that if you got one of those Bibles get it down and look at it and you'll see that it shows what I'm talking about right but I have the Scofield Study Bible which means he's put a lot of references in in his own footnotes all right but see I've had people to tell me say well I've got to Scofield 1611. oh yeah so I just took it up on my hands one day and I called schofields Jonathan publication everybody yeah and I just asked him well I guess they thought this foreign as far as I know 1909 is the first Schofield Bible all right but now you get some of the others and it won't verify some of the other you know Bibles Thompson Channing there's no difference in the wording right it's just an expression right all right and in doing that then see I tried to bring out some things but the main thing is to see the revelation of one true and living God that's it right all right now I'll go through this in a minute but see back in the beginning he would be called Elohim and that would be self-existing yep all right let's see once he created man right and came down into a certain positions there with man he would never be known as self-existing amen right yeah they could put the word down right but it would always say something that would make it show up in a deeper meaning and it would bring out that he is not self-existing anymore right because actually the word Jehovah means like a father with his family that's what it actually means and see that way then he'll never be self-existing and even after all time is over with and everything he'll still be father with his family you know because that that's the point that he's wanting us to see he's wanting us to see how much he becomes in relationship amen with the seven compound names of Jehovah each one of them has a relationship to mankind that's right Amanda to express God to me and you he's our banner and he's our Earth righteousness he's our peace amen thank you all right but that's in different places in the Bible you know you know then you got to look through and see that and you said well how come we need this well you know I believe we need to understand the revelation of God Amen all right now in himself revealing himself to you and I am but then the point that I think that you ought to at least Rejoice about is to realize that when it finishes up in Revelations 19. which is when he comes riding back into the Millennium that we just read that it's totally in bold type form to show and capitalization that when we come back riding with him he will be King of Kings yes amen amen and Lord of lords amen because everyone who's riding with him is of the same the same God that's right and see the prophet of God said it like this I didn't bring everything but he said God wanted us to be amateur Gods right little God a little Messiah we know and realize that we'll never be him to take his place that's where your Catholicism comes emcee right right that they say you know to take the place of God we we're not trying to take the place of God right no we're trying to be what we are supposed to be for the hour right right amen now notice brother random I'll read these in a minute but I'm just giving you a little lay ahead he said if the Lord spoke to him and showed him the Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new they made an outstanding statement I'll read to you in a minute he said Jehovah the old is Jesus within you in the Holy Ghost of this day is the same if he was Jehovah the only Jesus of you he's still got to be Jehovah the old and Jesus of the news right amen that's what I tried to explain the other day I guess it's confusing about you know Israel in her joining too but will never become the bride of Christ but yet he was married to her yep and he brought it out and how many wives do you have in the Bible in other words when you say Jehovah the old that's Jehovah was right you look like that's a bride over there and then another bride over here well you better remember that some was in that group over here once he walked on the shore to Galilee wound up over here right right so then don't get all these weddings and and deals in your mind don't get all of that actually just think about what's going on me and what he's doing and how he's revealing himself to come down through and that's all that I've ever had any interest in trying to do is to get people to see what he's saying about you and I right now how many times have I made this statement The Book of Revelations is the bride's book amen if you want to know where you're at and what you're doing you see why they told us to stay out of that book right you see why they took that book away from us and all of the things because they knew if we ever read it we'd find out it's talking about us right man yep I'll get to it over one of these days you know when it comes over in Revelation 21 and 22 right through there that John will describe the city yeah and it's exactly the same as he describes the wife the bride's wife he describes a writers to say Mr City amen why because once we get there right will not only be his bride well not only be his wife will he will be his brothers and sisters yep right we'll be his offspring amen we'll all be in the same race amen amen because that's what it means Aaron in the scripture when it's talking about The Offspring it means race Nation man people amen see God doesn't separate us from him once he joins with us amen there's no separation once he gave you the baptism with the Holy Ghost he's not going to take it back that's right right amen thank the Lord because the very purpose of giving it to you is to bring us to the place of being his offspring amen right right and Paul could slum it up and say it's no longer I that liveth the Christ that liveth in me he saw who he was by what God had made him nobody was naturally born because he didn't see that when he was a right Pharisee of the Pharisee and the Hebrew the Hebrews you know all of that that he's told about is his first life you know for doing it was after his new birth man after all I'm trying to get you and I to see is to look at the Bible and read it and like I've always said and he remembers when you you got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen all right you know you read the Bible before then but the word the little word m-a-m-e you know name it didn't Stand Out did it you knew it was there you read it they were like but then all at once when you begin to see the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whatever where you're at old and you it would say it's not him you get back on the Old Testaments his name is in here my name is amen look in that way see we're looking at it and seeing God revealed that's where you your Trinity runs it all see and takes it over the wrong way but the Oneness went over the other way you see the problem with the Oneness is the basis of them carrying it over to the point that they believe that Jesus was the last manifestation of God right yeah all right but see I don't agree with that yeah right okay I believe we right now amen in this day are the life manifestation of God then when we leave out of here there's an Israel to be saved right amen you know 144 thousand they will be brought into that place and they'll be the amorphy of God see that's all I'm trying to get us to look at is to see Who We Are see what the new EST made us Lord will we get to it Sunday about the first resurrection and seeing what he has made us amen he's made us according to Revelations chapter 5. that he's made us priests and Kings amen that's the bride and glory after the Rapture right amen but yet those are not illuminated by capitalization or or higher order of writing but in Revelations it is you know the 19th Chapter see because it's it's the process is still in in coming forward right sitting in the 19 chapters we were trying to cover the other day about the seventh verse it says the marriage of the Lamb has come and the wife has made himself ready right well that happens here while we're on Earth amen right not something how do we get up there so here on Earth we've got to get prepared all right but it's not brought into full manifestation until we we joined with him so much and then when we're coming back riding with him and you can't separate you know right I'll read to you in a minute whatever names he got we got that same name amen that's right yeah we're Miss Jesus now but if he gets a new name you know we're going to be missed somebody else right if there's a new name because it'll have to stay that way for us to be one with him yeah that's why then I've always just try to get you to see the one God see where Jesus would say in you now that's not hard to understand is it especially after knowing you know the denomination would teach it that way let me buy the new birth you know you could say I in you but what about you and me because Jesus put the same emphasis on the last part of that verse that he did the first right uh in you and you and me right amen now if we don't see how that we become one here you remember what I was talking about the other night about the wedding and the time that the prophet said you and I would Unite Here with him through the revealed word amen and then we'll go to the marriage of the Lamb that's why I try to emphasize that is to to not leave it and and I gave you the quotes for the prophet said we're already married to him that's right by the new birth but that's not the end of it right it's going to be a marriage of the Lambs is that two different weddings then no it's just different stages of the same people right right same groom it's just different stages but see we're uniting with him here amen because that's where we're making ready but then after all of that said and done then you get into chapter 19 of the 16th verse and he's coming back writing and we just read right up above our that's a group of people with him all right but see then to look at it see then you can read the scripture and you can see that it was God's plan from the very beginning right right to bring it down to where that he would show his plan even before it was made manifest amen in that way the writers then when they would the the one spring and forth more Bibles like Schofield didn't write another Bible he didn't come forth with another translation the Thompson Chain um different that's not another translation that's somebody translate that somebody put him down into letter form and then putting comments with it and things like that it's not the writing of a new Bible and your study reference Bibles is just giving you more understanding of why this is so you know in a white show and and I put it up front and I repeat it two or three times if you can just see in the Bible that there's a lot of times in the Bible when the very God of Glory is speaking almighty God himself speaking then there's times upon earth when he uses man to speak it's the same God in man right right man you remember the prophet what are you saying or in Hebrews where it said in saunderton dollars matter he's paid by he said that's incorrect he said it should have been in right is it because he wasn't just speaking by them that could be a Balaam that could be a or anybody speaking but when he was speaking in them but I said Moses was God to the people right amen right that's what the scripts are saying will you be God and Aaron to meet your profit right right but see that way we can read those things now with understanding to be able to see what's going on but it's speaking about us amen he's trying to show himself in relationship to his people and here's a point I'll say over and over when you can see him speaking from heaven you'll see that they'll they'll put capital letters as I say but then when you start dealing with man on Earth it lowers it down right and not always use this look out for the letters because it means god is down here doing something right amen and if you'll notice in in the New Testament the only time that it says that that the the name Jesus when he first said you know we call his name Jesus there's two scriptures there call his name Jesus that's in great big bold letters right amen that was God Of Heaven telling them what the name is that's right but then when he gets down in the next chapter it says Jesus is blue lower top of cash you see Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ is not written out in great big bold letters and mind because God is down here that's right amen so just read your Bible and look at it like that but you can see what's going on and you can see then it's not just a man speaking it's God speaking but then you can see that a man speaks and God uses his voice right amen but it's related to what's happening on Earth and showing it down here where we're at all right right so look over in Genesis now he can get Brothers Johnson them some of this so I'm not trying to put it up because I checked it and I knew that if I put it up by that it would wind up with a lowercase because they're copying they're not using 1909 all the way through on your computer systems tonight it won't bring out what I want you to see but remember now you think well he's just changing things to make a Doctrine well I want to see you man after I get through I want to see you bring it and show me a trinity or a Oneness right without the word of God because it won't work even the writers know better a lot of those things we were talking about the Beast and the image of the Beast is like Scofield have a lot of good foot I was on this thing amen but they knew a lot of that I don't go along with every one of his footnote but when he's telling me the definition of a word I listen so look at Genesis 1. he said in the beginning God created heaven and the Earth now if you've got a Scofield bible it'd be very easily for you to follow along see but if not then you'll have to just take what we're talking about I guess until you get one to look at it but as I said now you're here I'm dealing with a 1909 version which is the first Schofield version and the other versions tangents of time of some of this the not the spelling but the capitalizations or the higher orders and things but not checked it in the 1611 because a lot of people say I've got a 1611 Bible are you looking it's about that thick yeah absolutely it's about that square and in the 1611 Bible is the book of Maccabees and the things into 1611 if you've got a big one it's that's what I'll show you now there is some toxin change now I know world is you can still possibly pick up a 1611 in certain cases that will be a regular Bible like this you know form a Bible it won't be the great big anybody said I got a 1611 Regional well you got one about that thick about that big I'll be glad to show it to you Church gave it to me a few years ago because I've said so much about 16-11 Edition you know he looked it up and found it all right let me glad for you to look at it but notice it says in the beginning God now that is an English word all right and notice it's not the Great Big D on the end of it it's not a great big letter because man now is fixing to reveal himself I mean God is going to reveal himself to me well and he's joining himself down to us we look down in your Scofield you guys it says the word God there is Elohim so you would read it in the beginning Elohim but you know you also read John 1 1. and I'll give it to you off of the uh Mighty God unavail where brought around says it John 1 1 should read in the beginning with Elohim Elohim was with Elohim and that wasn't him whatever him and that was him was made flesh and dwell a moment amen amen he said that would be the way you would read it in the correct understanding because it would show the same God right amen uh this is that with him back here which is derived from the word the English form God he said first of the three primary names of deity watch now it's not covering obesity form is in Europe plural noun form from e-l strength our strong one and a-l-a-h to swear to bind oneself by an old Joseph so implying faithfulness right now it's the word Elohim but why didn't they Capital that one as much because that's where he's doing it right he's revealing himself now there's about 32 times in Genesis 1 so we're going through the Bible a little bit tonight Genesis 1 is about 32 times the word God is used and each one of them would be the g o with the reverse D part as we would call it in my terminology okay the lower case all right for understanding purposes you start off chapter two look at it you start off chapter two in this verse two verse 1 tells you the hell the Earth were finished and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made the little case of God and God blessed the Sabbath day and Sonic divided all right that's on that case so remember up until there you're using the word Elohim now the word Elohim from the word that would be like e-l or e-l-a-h it's not coming up to the self-existing point he said well it's just the word God is telling him it's self-existing now it has a meaning to it just like Jehovah Jireh means the Lord our sacrifice Jehovah NASA is our Banner it's a different form that's being expressed but if you've got a Scofield bible especially if you ain't then you'd be glad to let you have mine later and let you look at this but look at it verse four these are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the Earth in the heavens Lord God capital l o r d ude he said he made the heavens and the Earth that's why I love the fact that we were standing behind on God has been gone it was a Vindicated Prophet amen because we would read the scriptures and wouldn't have been able to follow them and keep it straight right because now here this Lord God is the creator but according to the Bible all things were made by Jesus Christ come on believe not by the flesh man right right but by the word amen God all right so then the prophet expresses it he said that was great self-existing one and said out of him came the Halo logos and begin to create so now your Bible is correct and all things were made by Jesus Christ who is the word and that's right not Jesus a flesh man but to Jesus Christ with his word see if they can just look past that that's why he says to those disciples in other words if you could just look past what you're looking at you'd see who I am that's standing here that's right but they couldn't do it they had no hope whatsoever without him dying and coming living in them for them to be able to even express amen right but remember now translators that brought us the Bible doesn't translate by revelation they translate by words see now if they got in there with their own ideas it wouldn't have worked out too good about all of the translations and then right see they'd like to have the book of Maccabees and all them things and you know and it wouldn't work but then it odd that it picks up and look at your Bible if it's not you look at mine it says the Lord which says God please now we're good Schofield says the primary meaning of the name Lord the capital l o r d Jehovah is the self-existent one now there's your Elohim coming up see literally as Exodus 3 14 he that is who he is therefore the Eternal I am but h-a-b-a-h from which Jehovah or Yahweh is formed signifies also to become that is to become known thus pointing to a continuous and increasing self-revelation combining these meanings of however we arrive at the meaning of the name Jehovah he is the self-existent one who reveals himself right now that's a man giving you the definition of a Greek word or a Hebrew word a nucleated see it and how much of that what the prophet said he's a self-existing one but Jehovah will read him it he says like a father with his family amen now Genesis 2. you remember Man was created in Genesis one so now he's not self-existing he's existing with his family brother said he'd come down in the corner of the evening what the great Lord God would come down in the cool of the evening now from that part there Lord God capital l o r d four and g-o-d in a lower case is what I'm calling it is used in expressing all right when you get on over to where that God appeared to Abraham I'll read you in a minute where the Prophet said you say that is God somebody asking me he said that's exactly right yep because it uses l-o-r-d in the capital form um the self-existing one is now existing with his family but a very amazing thing happens when you get on over the first time God in the capitalist reform that I talk and show it the way I say it must of the man Abraham after in chapter 14 he had met Melchizedek and called him Lord all right you said well the capital thing doesn't mean anything blue Dale well jump over bypass one two three four five and go down go down number six Brother Anderson because we'll get back to those in a minute this is from a message be not afraid if he's 65 1962 three or eight and a zero six twenty someone said to me not long ago said brother random you don't believe that that was actually God standing there eating the cake now who's that melchizing it right 14th chapter I said I'm sure do Abraham called him Elohim that's right anyone knows that capital m o r d and they didn't even do it yeah that's why it gets me when he said Capital that's not capital l-o-r-d yeah at least they could have hit that little end on the top to make it come out in capital letters you know but they didn't do it nice arguing with them they just didn't see what he was talking about they had they would put it up there yeah when I when I put Lord when I spelled Lord I put it in bubble letters me look oh that's what I mean Abraham called him Elohim that's right anyone knows that the capital L O R D which is translation David in the Greek Elohim which means a self-existing one or was it showing their Jesus said as it was in the days of Silence you'll feel it made the coming of the son of man what is it Elohim God appearing in human flesh yes Church Hallelujah Joy Christ Jesus was said in Saint John 14. he that believeth on me the works that I usually do also capital letters mean a lot they show how God Appears in what he's doing now you you go back and you read it but it's using the word Lord God from chapter two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen and when it starts off in chapter 15 going in your Bible after these things verse one the word of the Lord capital of a warranty came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God right now remember he's talking to Abraham and Abraham said Lord lower case God uppercase that's the first time it's used in the Bible of an uppercase the word god you know with bringing out what you're seeing all right what does that mean go down and it says Lord Hebrew Adana I don't know a gun or a donut the primary meaning of a Don a Don or a d-o-n-a-i it's master and it's implied in the Old Testament scripture both to deity into man the latter incidents are distinguished in the English version by the omission of the capital as applied to man the word is used of two relationships master and husband showing the relationship between Christ and the believer and so I did it comes to Abraham and then instead of saying Lord capital in the smaller God it changes run around because the emphasis is later on what's Happening God is coming down to Abraham the father of the faith to set a stage that you and I can be the children of God I didn't say he paid the price now right I said he's sending a stage to reveal himself so he takes it up into the uppercase and shows you who's talking now the self-existing one truly is now existing with his children now from there on down you'll find from God going through basically the Old Testament part you'll find the Lord the word Lord and you'll find the word God but you don't find the word God in capitalization too often in life because man couldn't understand you figure out the word Elohim and they could talk about an eternal God and David could write in his psalms about the Lord God go back to the Psalms and look at it and stop in Lord God on your computer sometimes I'm going to run you through a lot of references and David would be trying to sing in the spirit but just remember what I'm talking about that when God starts speaking to Abram he's speaking to him from up and down right you know he's Eternal he's Beyond tensions of mankind so the best you can say is he's self-existing he said but I've already tried to tell him in the writing they wrote my they don't want to exist anymore and Abraham realized what was taking place and the writers realized what was taking place that God had condescended calling down out of his loftiness or whatever you call it the height of Heaven and he's coming down just like he did in Genesis I preached on it years ago you can take the Book of Genesis drill chapter 1 and preach five years off of it because each one of the Creations there will reveal God in man the animals are things that are revealed the moon the stars Etc you can just go on and on and on preaching off of just a little word god but get what I'm talking about me the great God is Genesis 2 and 4 says Lord God Made To Heaven and the Earth and that God begins to condescend that's the only thing I'm trying to get you to see we know all about these smart words but it is odd how they plan up may not mean a thing to you but one of these days you'll realize why brother random will be talking and he'll say that to Elohim the self-existing one they didn't say that's Jehovah that's right but that was little crying in the Cradle amen trying to get us to see who it was and then a Prophet come along and he'd say look Jehovah the old he's a Jesus to the news look at number seven what your Prophet had to say about Jehovah what it means adoption 1965 515 E I got 100 he gave man Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existing anymore are you reading it right he exists with his family amen Elohim now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his Emily see and then it odd that he developed it through and showed it to Abraham that he would really come down to beat Jehovah that the self-existing one would come down and have a family thank you naked Mansfield to run around said Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new let me look at number look at number 10. this is the one I liked look at number 10. which is who is God preached in 1958 15 paragraph E9 and then raise it up to the bottom you're talking about how that need to realize the presence and granted you know that Jehovah the Old Testament Jesus of the new the Holy Spirit of this day now if they don't click in your heart what he's saying he says he's here today do you need this quote exactly like he was when he walked the shores of Galilee outside of the Corporal body but never took the Corporal body right but he doesn't need a body he's hearing you and I amen see did you hold the oldest of Jesus unto you that one that spoke to Moses from the burning bush says I am that I am amen isn't it odd Jesus come over and said before Abraham was right I am yeah there's just one true and living God it's revealed even in the right adding another word man right in showing who he is and what's going on but coming to Abraham the great father of faith you're showing him that he's Elohim Jehovah he's going to have a family he's going to have a family to exist with amen upon Earth all right Hebrews 1. let's read that one I checked that one and it does turn out to be different the other writings but Hebrews 1 is what I get the Hebrews God who at Sandra times and in diverse manners spake in times Christ unto the fathers by the prophets I just told you probably said that that word by is not correct it means in see he was in those prophets speaking and then watch the second verse knows what I like these last days spoken unto us by us about going off is a different in a set of a man sit down and say God told me to write this if God told him right it's going to be right for God's energy now he spoke to us in his son not by a son all right yep it was any son Jesus Christ right now when that whole true to be then that then the prophet could in the last days that he would not be speaking by right but him amen and wouldn't it be that we would be the bride of Christ that God is in US man that's the only way we can understand is God being in us not God being beside us right or Bible us it wouldn't work out but in my Bible see it says our God you say well that's just because it starts to send us off well over there where it says God is a spirit my Bible uses DOD reversity because it wasn't emphasizing the point marriage emphasizing who's doing the talking the very God of Glory he's not using an angel that's what we think about a lot and there's a lot of emphasis in the Bible where God used angels to speak and Prophets Etc but when he stood there on the shores of Galilee and said I am that wasn't a second person that wasn't a prophet right that was God himself amen declaring himself who he was amen unless you believe that I am he right man then it could be that in Revelation of 1916 shows perfectly what needs to be done is that true no Brother Anderson come back to one two three four let's go back to what we did the other day all right First Timothy 6 15 which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only Pope and take the king of kings and Lord of lords oh that's not capitalized the first K is and I gave you even the definition from Strong's 135-136 I'm pretty sure is one and one of them shows that total capitalization shows it to be God himself speaking the other can be us speaking to each other it can be God delivered through a prophet it could be an angel of God coming down to deal with you and I that doesn't make in God right brother Brown was God to the people Moses was God to the people but not the great capital right he would have been in a lower case Revelations is used three times remember the other day Revelation 17 14 says and they shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings and later with him are called Chosen and faithful as I said in chapter 5 when it shows us in glory it says we're Kings and praise those are not capitalize because they're still part of the mystery to be done amen you're going to have to have a ride into the Millennium and to do that the wife has to make herself ready once you make yourself ready she's worthy to ride back with him why because it's the same material I know this is the current way of looking at things which you know to me it wouldn't have mattered by knowing what I know now understanding knowing what I know now it wouldn't matter to me if any just said there was just one riding on a horse but if you read by verses 11 12 13 14. amen and who are they look Revelations 19 16. and he act on this Venture on his time name written king of kings and Lord of the Lords so you can't separate the bride from Christ when it comes to riding back into Millennium you can't separate her when she's in heaven she's Kings and Priests but the whole story is not finished until we come riding back that's right so we're coming back to what did the prophet say into the Millennium on a honeymoon effect the bridegroom and the bride come riding into the millennium by being all the wedding all of the things all the marriage suppers and all of the things are finished Armageddon has transpired because you've been called 144 thousands he's been called and but you see Church that's not Israel as a nation that's writing on that order uh right amen that's not the nation of Israel as we get to Sunday the prophet said it the Millennium is to the nation of Israel we're just there on a honeymoon it's promised to them but they'll never be his wife that's right they'll never be the bride of Christ why because they turned it down right right you'd be surprised how much that's mistalk through that area see people just read something and they think well that's just what it is you know this is that we come riding back with him you can't separate him from Hurricane I mean you so you some of you've been around here with me and my wife for at least 40 years what if I come walking in with some other boom might be like my nephew was he was sitting in the cafe one day he looked over there and I said a guy I'm sorry for him but my nephew said said he looked a dead ringer for you brother Dale I feel sorry for him for having a look at the way but so his wife she was you know he was kind of backing up you know he didn't want to say nothing his wife was a little bit Sterner Things She Said I'm going to fix him because their set looked like me with another one and you it wouldn't be so she gets up to go over there and walked up to him and start to say she recognized it wasn't me what's my point if I come in with a different looking woman you know most of you here would know the difference and say something's wrong yeah why because we've been related together so long they say you get to looking alike look around that food out of my shoes living very moment in my room maybe another 10 years just kidding but listen what about the Bible being so specific that it would explain the beautiful story of the relationship between God and man that God has made a way right that we could be his offspring we could be his brother we could be equal and what does the Bible say co-equal ity is that true the Romans join Aaron amen amen what about it what a beautiful story that after all of these years we begin to good picture Prophet had to preach all those years and all those sermons for us to get the picture together and now we can see a beautiful picture of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and when you see him you see her when you see her you see him right the Revelation 19 16 when they're coming riding back all of that is total capital letter yeah all of that is emphasizing that God and man has become one the story of redemption is over for mankind you know what I'm talking about the bride the wife that's a hard thing maybe to understand but that's reason I tried to use the word Jehovah selling compound names with Jehovah describing the one Lord Jesus Christ when you think about it we're his brother we're his we can be a servant the Bible can speak of us as servants and get it confused people will with the the Jews that servants they can call it service he he's our father he's her husband there's no human terminologies in mankind to be able to comprehend that but How could somebody be your father but do you think some of those things are going to be done away with no according to my Bible when we enter the millennial reign it'll say that God may be all you know run around I'll give it to you place that it's a millennium these places the future home because the next thing for you and I after the Millennium is who go to the white throwing judgment to sit with him on the same throne not before the throne but on the same throne with him she's never separated no more everything is wonderful to see him we spent a lot of time talking about him and that's wonderful we need more time but then he's trying to talk about us he's showing us to the world listen that's my bride right that's my wife Paul gets over in the book of Acts and he says to the unknown God that they were talking about and they left a little spot Maybe for One in case they missed it said the one we don't know his name Paul said let me talk to you about it he said even your report say that we are his offspring yep we're his race we're in the nation the children of Israel will be a natural Nation but they rejected the right of being the Bride of Jesus Christ he said well this people downtown didn't have anything to do with it that's true but by the representation of predestine you know of representation by their mom and daddy Israel just like you and I didn't have anything to do what happened to the Garden did we we wasn't there to cause the fall but because of the follower here right right so dude you could stand up and say I I didn't reject you that's why he's going to give them eternal life because they didn't reject him but their representation did the ones who cried out for his blood represented all Jews they'll be in the Millennium the prophet said but you won't be there that's the wife of God because it won't be no Jehovah was right and Jesus is bride and that's why I like that quote the Jehovah the old is the Jesus with the new and the Holy Ghost is now meaning what the very one among us today is the Jehovah the old man that's right and the Jesus of the new that walked Ashworth of Galilee amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is living in the hearts of the Saints I believe that given us eternal life right Zoe God's own life amen you can't separate him and her God won't allow that right do you understand what I've tried to explain for all 40 something years talking about God didn't even try to use natural things to show references run around and said whatever that name he has will be the name she had amen mm-hmm whatever it is would be the same name number 15 Brother Anderson Revelations 3 about 12 or somewhere right in there versus you get a new name this is page 318 of the churches book The Philadelphia Church age I will write my new name upon him my new name when it all becomes new then he will take upon him a new name and that name will be the name of the Bride also amen what that name is how you pronounce that word which means you can't figure it out right there's no way to understand yep because there's no way to understand jvhv right you see where I'm going back there's no way to understand jvhv there's no way to understand that but see that and remember we read it to start with only the one who gets the name will know the name you say are you looking for a new name of Jesus yes but maybe not in this world what that name will be what who would worry about it only one thing for sure my name right now is Miss Jesus amen whatever his name is and where it changes or whatever my name's going to be the same but what about you right see that would that's not a divorce and getting another wife or something it would have to be a revelation of spirit given so conclusively that none would die tonight but no doubt he will leave that Revelation to the day when he desires to give that name for it suffice it to know that it will be more wonderful than we could ever imagine could be more wonderful it will be more wonderful same message and excuse me pergament Church age page 211. he said we are Christian that's a new name our names will change we're Christians it's a name common to all of us but one day we will have another change Willow Willis uncertainty receiving your name it could be that name would our true and original name written in the landscape of life from the foundation of the world he knows the name right but we do not one day it is good pleasure we will know also but everybody's looking for a new name of Jesus the quote page 283 of this first seal let it be revealed in the Thunders you're looking at it it'll be revealed in the Thunder um you know the Thunders are beautiful things because it is the voice of God Amen the Thunder is the voice of God but you know that voice doesn't speak to everybody it's only going to speak to a chosen people amen the only chosen people would ever know what his new name is and if you knew what it was according to what we just read you couldn't tell me what it is amen you might be able to show a manifestation right but you can't tell me what that name is look out how many years did it take after we came in this message for us to realize the name of God is Jesus amen sir come on be honest how long did it take before you got around to reading that and believed it that the name of Jesus is the only thing God ever had right amen right how many years did it take before you came to that understanding when no man can call Jesus what the Christ accepted me by the holy ghost or call Jesus a curse you see that's why if you'll notice in what I was giving you'll go back to Matthew and you'll find it learn the first verses when they said and you shall call his name Jesus that was a Heavenly being delivering down to an Earthly person what a name would be it was not a an Earthly person receiving it it was not even a prophet to receive and give to the people it was God himself declaring what his name would be The Only Name God ever had is Jesus amen but yet brother Brown you want the corn on he said there was many Jesus's in the days of Jesus walking the shores of Galilee sure now you want the rest of it but he said there's only one Jesus Christ that's right there was only one of those jesuses that were surround her that was the anointed God the Messiah didn't you say Jesus Jesus brought around said and not get nothing right if you don't know who you're talking to you that's right you remember the little woman that come up to him and said not some day even have mercy on me yeah he said you ain't got no right to call me that you're a dog LeBron said he didn't approach her correctly I mean he didn't she didn't approach him correctly right see if you could have said Son of David you wouldn't even listen to her that's right when she said that's right Lord but said the dogs eat the crumbs the master's table you realize she was going Beyond just looking at him is what he was and she was seeing almighty God standing before her his black sister had he writes on one day to the point when he wrote around him and said so she said that ain't nothing but the truth the holy spirit said give her what she desires you see waiting to say Jesus Jesus and not even be talking about almighty God but there's only one Lord Jesus Christ amen but you know what it takes all of that to do he takes all of those Jehovah javares Jehovah Jeske news and all that all of him Yahweh um Ava ever had all those words we used while ago except existence all in those terminologies to come out to be the one person well what about a man that could contain or manifest all the things the Bible said that's right no wonder you always a cheese or something here but he's a holy ghost now if we just believe it he's the same yesterday today and forever Brown said that's where Eve messed up she didn't believe in Hebrews 13 8. I thought all she done was just took the serpent and had a baby he said she didn't believe him to be Hebrews 13 8. the week believe him to be Hebrews 13. all right the same God that walked ashore to Young these the same God here tonight he knew about a new birth you see why it's so important all right come on brothers let's stay back on these things I just want to make sure that was right uppercase lowercase I may not know my cases but I try to know God right I may not know how to put it down into language and to human people to understand but um I believe that same God that come down spoke to Abraham is that same Lord Jesus Christ they said I am you know the book of Acts when I believe was Stephen explaining the uh doings of coming down how they're rejecting what they were doing wouldn't it Stephen that when he finishes up he says this was the one Speaking of Jesus Christ because this was the one that was in the burning bush that spoke to Moses yep the same Lord Jesus Christ that created the world yep come down to speak to Moses come down to speak to Abraham come down to speak to all mankind and come down to speak in his son not by but that don't finish because see this is the end of the time and he's still speaking all right the same color amen thank all these things anybody have any distinct on these things on CE I said oh thank you oh here will be come the whole yeast survive when you say that you are the light create new thing right Jesus Jesus foreign foreign
