========================================

thank you for coming out tonight on a Tuesday night and if we were in a boat we would be sinking in this direction I told him it brother bi-lo that's a man they all it must have been these are the coolest or the warmest spot everybody said over on this side it was a big old church - and I mean everybody was over here and it was one person here one over here so I like balance right brother Donny I like balance listen y'all pray for each other coming back from Kentucky the the I don't know what the states are gonna do about these roads but man there was just traffic jams everywhere and I know there's gonna be traffic jams tomorrow and June is gonna be leaving going to her dad's and me and brother Danny's gonna do a little hunting Thursday together and then pray for them coming back because then the roads people are crazy crazy on the highway this is an insane world so let's try to get out of here if you don't mind let's try to leave this place and when we come back again and bear with me because our computer crashed up here so I'm gonna have to read some quotes off of my phone so that's why it's up here but we want to try to see something that to conclude this fourth seal so just keep us in your prayers bow our head please or Jesus thank you for this day that you've given us to come back and your house a little earlier than the middle of the week Lord on a Tuesday night it feels all right it feels refreshing feels good to be in your house father we pray now that you'd be with us and take care of us you be the active participant Lord you'd be the one that does the speaking you'd be the one that does the revealing because without you Lord just be people gathering together for no reason at all but Lord we've come for one common goal and that's to take a body change to destroy death something that no one has ever done on the face of the earth except the Lord Jesus himself but Lord you commissioned it you told us we could do it you gave us the equipment you gave us the word you gave us the trumpet you gave us everything we needed to get out of here so Lord we pray that we'll be all be attentive for a little while Lord and listen to You Father be were the ones that are sick bless the ones that are sick the building you take care of them Lord all the colds and flues and all the different things people are having or do we were buchen in the name of Jesus Christ we do not have to have that amen we do not have to have that and Lord you healed us at Calvary the prophet of God said if you were standing here at the pulpit tonight you could not heal us because you already did it at Calvary if either with your arms stretched wide and when you said it's finished you meant what you said Lord we pray that you just be with us now and take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit be with the missionaries on the foreign fields Lord give them fruit for their labor father just be with us now take care of us in Jesus name Amen and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth he may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word there by all rights a man ma'am and I like that because I wanted to find this quote where brother where I'm said it and I couldn't get it worded exactly right but brother Branham says talk we were talking about you know death having to be destroyed and he said see there there goes death and held together so well we don't listen as bride of Jesus Christ those two words should not mean anything to us as part as far as fear is concerned amen because death and hell we have no part with that Jesus Christ said in Revelations that he had the keys to death and hell and then the devil don't have the keys to death and death and he'll bow you know what we we give him all the glory for having death and hell in his arms well he don't own nothing he owns zero amen that's what we've got to see for you know brother Branham I asked him said but brother Branham what about this change he said it's just a change it's just a change he in other words he couldn't explain it any better than it already been explained or he would have explained it better right that's what he came to do came in to give us the love letter the love letter says we will be changing we're gonna talk about that tonight because the Bible says we shall all be changed and then but we're gonna background just a minute for those that that and I say those I say me that needs a little refresher course on what we've been speaking them because remember there's four things it's got to happen we'll read them later on because I want to break them down but let's turn to can you let him pull up Johnny leaven we were talking about Jesus Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day well okay we're at the resurrection of the last day but jesus said I am he brought an ever present opportunity for them to have right then I am the RET in other words I carry the Resurrection with me amen so as I was telling the people in in Kentucky if if we go back to being heirs and joint heirs then what is our problem saying I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me now not just in meat weight Dale you got to believe in the God believe in the God that we serve you got to have faith I'll read it to you in just a minute we're brother Browns says we got to have faith but then he says faith alone won't do it faith alone won't do it you gotta have faith virtue knowledge temperance you got to have virtue faith knowledge Spade temperance faith patience faith godliness faith brotherly kindness faith and love which is the epitome of faith hey ma'am Jesus had to believe his own Word and if he if he's not exempt from it neither we but we got to believe our word we got to come to a place to that stature of a perfect man is a leaving living breathing as brother Dale was talking about in in travail brother Brown said a living breathing instrumentality of God when our feet move God's feet moves when our hands move God's hands move see I just wanna you know they kind of looked at me a little cross like some of you do the same here when I said we were more tunas than we were anything else and we are we're pushing everything on Jesus and he's going to do all this he gave the Commission to you and I he said I whatever I have I give to thee I am the resurrection and the life I've come from God I go back to God eat my flesh and drink my blood all those things he gave us those things and said look in other words you got to take part of me because that word there eat doesn't mean eat that means consume it means to it means to take in and then because what happened when I when Eve and Adam ate the fruit they eat it they didn't eat it right they / took of it in other words they / took of the act then that was the eating part and then when it says John told John to eat the book it didn't mean to eat the physical book it means to partake of that and when you partake of it it becomes nourishment to your body and then when you partake of this it becomes nourishment to what that inner man the real you the one that really makes a difference jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live now look at that though he were dead that's not dead in the grave that's dead in trespasses and sin yet shall he live because I live you live also you saw what we've got so many millions of people in the grave they're more alive than we are that is just a shell that there that they left they left the shell here and took the real person somewhere else and then so that's what the problem is he said well they're all dead and gone well no they're not dead they're not dead yet because remember in the Bible when when the Pharisee said told Jesus said they might our Father to eat manna in the wilderness now when jesus said they were that was a different date when Jesus said you're dead when Jesus Christ says you're dead you're dead and brother Brahim said that translated to eternally separated from God that's how harsh that was they were eternally separated from God now that's the death remember the Bible says don't worry about the guy that can kill this thing because God can only bring a soul and God can only kill a soul amen Satan cannot kill a soul he has no power to do that he didn't bring it here he perverted it when it got here but he didn't bring it here so he has no power over that I've said many times before you take a saint that's getting ready to pass over to the other side I just and I'm not glorying that people pass away but I just like to be standing there and about in the in that dimension with them as they get ready to pass that poor death angel will have a look on his face like he's never had before because he's never had to deal with a live wire like like he's fixing that I have to deal with he's having to deal with an eternal person they just stepped out of a body and he don't he don't get that opportunity much most of his opportunity is is he's going to take them in change to that fifth dimension hello he's going to take them into that fifth dimension for condemnation but when he sees that like brother Brown said you know what death is our slave death takes us to God the death angel I he's just for me out the death angel would justify the death angel I just wouldn't put my hands on a believer because he's going right straight into that sixth dimension he's eternal as he ever will be he's eternal is he ever gonna be amen oh that's good I love them third Exodus watch new show ever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe this now this now the problem was is they were pushing it like I said like we do they were pushing it somewhere else pushing it off on somebody else Marcus in other words Martha said Lord I don't believe you can do that right now but now I know that my brother will raise in the general resurrection right but jesus said I am the resurrection whatever you think is going to be there if standing in front of you here amen and where is he today where's the a brother John he's sitting right there in that seat they Church setting in hey man it ain't crowded either ain't three of you then two of you there's one of you that's our problem when we get the new birds we really don't understand what we get I don't think you get God you get the resurrection you get you get the Creator you get the person that said let there be that's who that if not you got a second person like I said here we go right I hope yeah one day one day we're all going to get this statement the reason we can get a revelation is that the person that wrote this book is looking at the book again the very reason we can get around why there's other people why does the devil can't even understand the Word of God because you don't have the guy that wrote it looking down through his eyes who was that that was at church was it your daddy or who was it said devil somebody in the message said devil if you're gonna run around in my head we fixing to read the Bible and if you're still up there you're gonna see what I'm reading and it ain't gonna be good for you that's why I like it if the devil is gonna roam around in my brain I'm gonna start reading something that he don't like amen but you know what the one that wrote it is inside of you that's the deal that to me that's the whole seal the seal put him in put Satan out and you're done you're sealed I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live we were all dead remember we were all born dead we're more alive now than we ever be that all right say ma'am we're more alive now than we'll ever be whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe it's down there now the third accident excuse me 1963 let's get through these and then we'll get to the end I don't want to be too long tonight so that's the way it is again today God is calling his elected people and they are elected now and now they elected for what for a resurrection now look to have a resurrection you got to have two people two sets of people living and going on amen so now we are elected what for a resurrection and what kind of a sign is he's showing them resurrection sign now remember even though jesus said now watch this this is how powerful it is in the end time and we'll get to it in a few minutes what brother Brown said about this but when Jesus was standing at the tomb of Lazarus he knew he was going to resurrect Lazarus I am the resurrection and the life there's in other words there's nothing gonna stop me from doing this nothing no devil in hell no death nothing everything's got a part but it's only temporary it's only temporary because lives are resurrected not in a glorified body Lazarus resurrected it no sure he got change oh he got to change all right because Martha said Lord he stinketh well he doesn't starting corruption but God reversed that process showing that he's going to reverse your process same way with Abraham showing you can reverse my what about the three Hebrew children I was thinking about this the other day what a body change you know we worry about this body change being a brand new thing the three Hebrew children got thrown into a fire that was so red-hot it burnt up the other people right their clothes were even their clothes were even anointed and the Bible says and the Bible is real specific it says and you couldn't even smell with smoke on them you know you think well you know I think well he got in the fire now because I smell him no the Bible says not even his clothes not even their clothes now what kind of a body changed you put your body in there God changed their body but it was only a temporary change God had to change Elijah's body he had to change Moses body because they went somewhere in their human body hello right Philip got translated he got a body change because you can't just translate I sure wish we could have translated ourselves from Kentucky all the way back to here for all that stinking traffic we went through was gonna try to get here time enough to hear in the back ok time enough to be here for the first service but I mean the beginning of the service but we couldn't because the traffic I would love to be able to transport myself but it would have only been temporary anything we have dealt with before has just been temporary even though jesus said I'm the resurrection in the life in other words if you believe in me you'll never die now Lazarus died again Lazarus was only brought back to a spot he was probably swelling up and I was thinking and they said his nose offense look God had to bring him a temporary resurrection you and I we've had temporary resurrections we've had people raised from the dead we've been part of that ourselves to see people raised up from the dead we see that Jesus raised several people from the dead the prophet of God raised several people and you don't know what I mean Jesus did it but through the Prophet he raised those people up from the dead they got a temporary resurrection but if time goes on that same man that I held in my arms it was dead he's getting older and he's getting more feeble and he's probably gonna just pass all but he had a temporary resurrection that's not what I'm even talking about this 4-cyl death in hell shows their self leaving leaving the same death in hell power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed after him they left they left the building they left the building and that for sale we're going to see but now we're going to see though when we come into the fifth seal the fifth seal is going to show to me how this works okay you got four seals and then we take a rapture you say well it's letting the rest of us for for the Jews that's exactly correct but you and I have to get the opening of that seal you and I have to get the opening of the sixth seal and you and I have to get the opening of the seventh seal right so we have to get that to get the fullness to take a body change because remember when Jesus stepped out of the tomb and said all power in heaven and earth has been given unto me now there's the spot because when he come out of that tomb that body that he was in went through a change but it didn't change and he walked back out and looked like that again or that one whichever one doesn't matter we looked he didn't look thirty something years old he looked 50 something years old he was so young Mary Magdalene didn't even know who he was the people in Emmaus didn't even know who he was amen they didn't know who he was because he had changed back to his original his original condition that's our whole part to me this message brings us back to our original condition amen I figured somebody tried to call me while I had this stupid thing up there welcome teams denied I mean people call young Hughes you know they know not to call me in Wednesday night so they call that's why I turn to put it on silent I knew somebody called booth devil not the person that called he's a nice guy so what are we elected for though we've got a resurrection sign the son of man give us the resurrection sign but listen to me you and I have to carry the rest of it out everything else has been temporary till the Son of Man walked out of the tomb and said all power in heaven there's been given to me in other words I do not have to go back to being an old man again I do now I have been changed and I'm done I'm finished and all if you don't believe it touch me give me some fish cuz I believe Oh doubting Thomas probably looked at me and said a fish is gonna hit the floor soon as he eats it right cuz then we think of a ghost we think of somebody has no substance they saw him walk through the wall and then and you know they probably said that's fish go hit the floor no it went into something very solid it became a part of Jesus what do you think that's going to happen we even when we have a glorified body we're going to go across the curtain of time and we're going to eat grapes and we're going to eat apples and we're going to eat whatever and it's not going to fall through and it's going to what it's going to become a part of us to me folks that's this this is what to me all these examples are showing us how simple because be honest with me we've all even in the denomination we're even in this message we have put the body chain way up here and we're right here doesn't matter how good we are and if we live with good life we're Christian yeah we believe the message and we are filled with the Holy Ghost and we are part of the statue of a perfect man we're trying our best to grow up but still we have put it so unreachable Jesus just walked over to him said I'm here all power in heaven there's been getting under me and I give this unto you you are a recipient of what I have done-for-you believe us now this but it was the son of man I'm not gonna get done gonna get finished let's go who is this son of man what he's the one that sowed the seed when the Son of man came on the earth he had one purpose in mind he sowed the good seed he sowed the ability for me and you to get here and have a chance to be saved now he knew who we were he sowed ever good seed because he knows what good seed he's got you and I don't know that because by the power of transformation though we were this right here this is the seed of the wicked one produced by holy parents but still not the way we were supposed to come but the tares are the children of the wicked one but now this is talking about the tares that's the children that never come to nothing the good seed is the children of the kingdom you and I are the children of the kingdom amen you and I are the children the kingdom Happy Thanksgiving Matthew 16 verse 13 when Jesus came to the coasts of Caesarea Philippi asked the disciple whom to use men whom do men say that I the Son of Man a.m. they said some say you're drunk nella there wasn't he paying attention to what Jesus says because he said whom do men say that I the Son of man I am they said some say that thou art John the Baptist well they knew he went John the Baptist cuz they saw John and him some he lied you know there may be another's Jeremiah one of the prophecies there now hold on who do you saying I've been with you for three and a half years who do you say I am Simon Peter Peter says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God in other words like we've always said that Peter got that revelation from God he didn't come up with that himself or he would have not denied him three times at the crucifixion and he would have not went fishing when Jesus was resurrected they didn't have a revelation really who he was please they didn't but he said thou art the Christ in other words I see something in you that no other man can do you know Peter said die alone have the words of eternal life he just said blessed are You Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed that to you in other words he didn't get it from us flesh and blood but my father which is in heaven I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will try but shall not prevail against them now that is a 2000 year promise if we had the church age there somewhere it's a 2000 year promise that the church is going to be built on the revelation that you are a believer that Jesus Christ has died for you came back give his life to you if you accept him and you become a Christian is that just kind of by that's the basics of what we get no one no one ever brought it so strong as the prophet of the end times to do with your body something to do with your spirit realm no the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that's what he built his church on and he was well pleased with that God was just as well pleased when he came down to Martin Luther and gave him the baptism of the Holy Ghost as he did when he gave it to me or you amen but Martin Luther had a what had a mandate to live by the Box Wesley had a box Pentecost but you and I ready just a min ago you and I have been elected for a resurrection amen elected to destroy death because the fourth seal tells you that death is destroyed tells you that hell has nothing to hold on you the fourth seal tells you that it's done tells you that it's finished when we take a rapture listen we're done there's no more development after that oh well yeah God goes to Israel in it but listen we know how to stand before a white throne judgment Oh hallelujah that's things giving enough for me don't have to go to hell I already been there we lived in part of it most of us life amen but don't have to any of that doesn't that to me listen that should take the fear out what do you fear what do you fear if you're born again you should have no fear brother Branham when he went across that curtain of time he said I come back he said I always had a little bit of fear about death he said Lord why would you fear that that's what our problem is let me ask you a question have you ever sat down in the quietness of the evening or sometimes when you didn't have no nothing else running through your brain it's hard for most of us but have you ever had a moment know come in sin have you ever had a moment when you just and I'm going to be real real plain I have sat down and thought about eternity and I can't get a whole grasp on that because with so much time creatures how can we get to a place where we'll never cry never have a pain I love you never have a bad thought about kids or family we've never been through that so it's something new it's something and you fight that in yourself do you know what scares me I think of eternity and I'm like man that's a long time we're so much stinking time creatures till we go to Mars just gonna be today again and then you know ten thousand years from now just you're not even a second older Kathy hallelujah you can go to Japan like that travel like I saw but see that but you know you know what we have to do though with all that the Bible says cast down reasoning because what I'm doing is I'm sitting there reasoning the thing out reasoning the thing out when we should say okay Jesus you've been through every bit of this you've been in this dimension of hell you've been in this dimension of heaven you've been in this dimension in a in a in a body that was dying this dimension when he come in as a baby suffered through 30-something years of his life died went through death a horrible death not just death a horrible death survived survived and came out pretty good so he's done now now where is that person one more time where is that person brother John he's sitting right there looking at me that's our problem Jesus is over here we're over here well we can well that was good he'd come out of that tomb know you know what's going to bring the people out of the tomb is the same feeling not feeling you understand what I mean but the same thing is going to come over us they came over Jesus and it's going to bring them right out of that tomb because he's already here residing in the vessel that he wants to reside in he's pleased to dwell in you if he's pleased to dwell in you they something you got to do hey alright say man so he built the church on the revelation that if those that believe in me shall never die never perish but have eternal life but I can't think of a stronger time to be in as now to where we can really believe that God can change this thing this thing as long as what he's already done inside you you understand what I'm saying all the other church agents we went through that remember the porter they would come up they would go through their church age they would die off another church age messenger will come up take them through the church age did he'd die they'd start dying off they'd come back up and come to another church age come down come to Pentecost comes up brother Brown said this is it we're either going to hell or we're going to heaven there's no in-between we're not going to another church age that brother so-and-so in this day in time mister so-and-so he's gonna give us another message this is it that's why he said our mandate is to get the people out of the ground and they gotta have a live people to get the dead people out only might come dead people sleeping people remember why I been reading in the book of Acts again I told him I said think about this if you want to know how the Son of man Act read Matthew Mark Luke and John that's all you got to do then when he left when he left if you want to know what the Son of God acts like read the book of Acts because that was the act to the Son of God inside the people then go over to revelations and read where the Son of man has come back in the end time the beginning of the creation of God and you and I are a continuation of that creation everybody okay proving his word let's read this and go on proving his word in 1964 after nineteen hundred years the church aged past no watch this brother Brian was telling us in 1964 and all the things he prophesied of Luther Wesley we just went through and seen it brought out moon come down brought her down the Lord brought it on the board here for us and showed it and come down himself and confirmed confirmed it to be right after or not you see where he's standing he's standing in his positive place he know God's revealed that because God came down and vindicated him so whatever he had to preach about the search agents was true I don't care one another any other man says about it all right and he didn't either after 1900 years and we're at the end of Laodicean church a we're at the end of the Leveson because remember the messenger comes at the end of the age okay all right cuz watch even when brother Branham came on the scene listen to what I'm saying catch this when brother BAM came on the scene he was preaching the Son of God revelation getting the faith of the father's back which was not the Son of Man revelation that was the son of God revelation that the church was built on they had got so far off of it till he had to bring them back to where they started at brother Dale's preaching on it now but now watch now this is something different when those seals open that was the son of man revelation no man had ever preached that before he promised now we're at the end of the layout of century and he promised that's why you got to remember the Laodicean Church ages what age number seven that's not an eight that's seven seven seven is 49 you're still in the old order of sevens no rapture in that okay but now watch he promised in Luke 17 thirty that this same son of man he promised it would be revealed in the days like it was inside him upon the earth did he do it doesn't have to come to pass that's impossible now remember it doesn't say no he's not saying again and he doesn't say it's impossible he's fixing to say it's impossible for it not to happen now remember he comes in three names son of man prophet son of God spirit son of David in the Millennium but in between this conjunction now according to his own words well I said brother Branham had to work through the Son of God revelation to get us back to a place that the son of man could step out hey alright with that in the days now according to his own words in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed reveal himself is what not son of God son of man will reveal his self in a different way because the Son of God revelation cannot bring a body change son of God don't need a body to the certain of God is the change when that man stood and said let there be light he hadn't changed since then he needed a change but now the son of man came down on earth the born as a baby hey man son of God inside that baby but the son of man was on the earth doing the talking doing the what sowing of the seed he needed a body change I read them I read that up it in Kentucky where brother Branham said Jesus Christ inherited something he didn't inherit eternal life in his soul or his spirit he because he was Almighty God he was eternal but his body had a beginning and the inheritance that he inherited I wish that I brought that quote the inheritance he inherited he didn't keep it most of you now here in the building most people in this world would that Veda went through that they to come out and said all power in heaven earth been given unto me and blessed God I got it you ain't and I ain't giving it to nobody not God soon as he got it he was so happy about it he started giving it to you but he had to wait according to his own word listen our God is according to his own word he had to wait 2,000 years to have somebody on the earth that I believe that same thing he believed to change their body I just got that that's good it does happen every once in a while but he'll reveal itself in a different way listen you and I have to be a different group of people and you don't have to make yourself different you just start talking about the Son of Man and what the Son of Man revelation is and how brother branham message was in two parts you'll see if they believe you or not real quick not saying they're not Christians I'm just saying some King some kid some could take the Son of God revelation and some can take the Thunder man revelation because that revelations the son of man you've got to have that to change your own body brother Dale can't change your body I can't change your body you got to have it already inside of you to change your body you do it's your choice john 6:53 we're doing it jesus said beylerbeyi I saying to you except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you whosoever he is my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me dwelling in me and I him that's pretty personal as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven you see what two people Israel got they got God but they thought this is getting bread and they just absolutely got tired of it after a while that's like most people around the message they been in the message 30 years now they're getting tired of this man huh they gonna go find them something else right they loathe this bread they're being preached to every Sunday so they're leaving them spirits didn't die back to info' them spirits just came over they came over on the Mayflower I shouldn't say that because that's Thanksgiving but they created the Thanksgiving part I made a complete idiot myself one time it's only one time half of my life right I made a complete idiot myself there was a guy from Norway come to our business and he was talking you know it was the day before Thanksgiving and I said oh I see you're gonna be going from home on Thanksgiving he looked at me and he said that's not my holiday that's yours remember Thanksgiving is an American holiday it's not it's not celebrated around the world like other things on I thought well okay alright so I took my foot out my shoe out of my mouth and I went back to work yeah so just remember don't last anybody any foreigner everybody don't laugh Jerry cramp don't last any foreigner about Thanksgiving that's an American holiday now they may have their things giving day but it ain't same day we have ours okey-dokey just that's just a life lesson I'm not gonna lie more charge rate for this but I'm gonna charge email they said you got plenty of money this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat manna and our dad and I swear he's still not dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever what he was saying is the father is a man and they died you eat of this bread you won't die all right let's go and finish reading in first Corinthians at 11:24 and when he had given thanks he brake and said take this take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me and after the same manner he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament that's why you and I living under a New Testament the Testament of the blood of the what testator because somebody had to die to give you this amen this is this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me instituting the communion but now not just the communion to me when you take that communion you've entered to me you've entered from the Old Testament into the New Testament you're honoring the New Testament he said this is the New Testament in my blood this is a New Testament in my flesh when we come up and take communion now we're not see how the Catholic took it to one extreme that it's the literal body it's not the literal My heavens how can you get how do you somebody to believe that that little wafer they turn it into the flesh of Jesus they do it right and they believe it maybe we ought to become believers like that but not believe in that right take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remember so you eat eat partake that's our problem we everyone no one listen no one down through the churches has ever been able to eat like we eat no one has ever been able to partake like we partake no one no one has been able to sit in a congregation as you're sitting tonight and it doesn't matter put anybody up here not just me but to listen to something that's going to get us either get us out of the grave or not put us in the grave you win either way you win either way this message is going to get them out of the grave ain't gonna keep them from going to the grave now don't mean the letter the message either the letter killeth but the Spirit give us life all right let's go to revelations 3:15 still trying to recount yeah I just go to Revelation 3:15 just going go and pass that one will cut it short a little bit Revelation 3:15 and then the angel church that allowed to stands right these things that the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God oh my god being created according to that he's the beginning of the creation of God who is that that's the son of man that's the son of man the beginning of the creation of God when God spoke into a womb without sex without any kind of emotion without any kind of feeling he entered into the natural womb of a woman with a seed not with anything else you understand what I'm saying and created in the womb of Mary created a body for him to live in amen that's the beginning of the creation the God that's the way you wanted it had there not been a fall but in other words genesis 3:15 said I'll put enmity I'll come back and I'll take this thing all the way back to the beginning of the creation of God the way it should have been that's in our church age I know that words are neither cold nor hot skip all that going through we know I don't even like to read it as me as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door of the Laodicean church kalesu he's talking to behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my what in the days of the voice and opened the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me now remember I read you that quote where I I've always thought this but I want to brother branham to be the one that tells you this in the feast of the trumpet number four know that it's the loosening of this ecclesiastical spirit now twenty years later after that war now you know what he's talking about it's not about World War two 1964 is basically 20 years from 1944 that was the second Second World War now 20 years later after that war we see the loosening of the ecclesiastical spirit now he didn't say prosecute demons and religious religious ecclesiastical spirit what under the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to the Jew we'll get into that in the seventh seal look at the moon darkening out what under see it drawing out the son of man being drove from the church he was drove out of the church but he stood at the door not and I didn't read the rest of it to save time but he said you'll sit with me in my throne not on in Bojan in not on if you're on the throne you can be on the throne with the devil but you can't be in Jesus Christ and be the devil ah Satan don't even have a throne God said heavens my throne Earth's my foot's - where's the devil's part he'll get his part those remember brother Ram said hell was what a bottomless pit he had no foundation so Satan's got a house that ain't gonna Alleluia ain't got no foundation but the son of man was drove from the church but thank God we had a prophet to come in the end time and steer us back in the right direction steer us back in the way that we should go amen now let's go to first Thessalonians and everyone we're going to marry to two passages of Scripture together here but I would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep all right I would not have you ignorant we now understand there in the sixth dimension when when Paul wrote that I don't think he knew that now he might have went across the curtain of time and he might have done but he never come back and said I went over and I saw these people and I touched him and they called me brother and it's the sixth dimension now brother Branham did that but no one else did I'm not saying he did maybe I said that wrong I'm not saying didn't but he didn't like granny used to say he didn't explain it he didn't splain that like brother Brown explained it brother Brown explained that where he could go over there and touch him people cuz remember brother branham had the same idea that everybody else did floating on a cloud with a heart oh there goes brother Nevel and he said at one time he said I can't shake his hand he said because we had passed through each other oh he lost that revelation didn't he we went across the curtain of time and he said in women hug me and he said they were women you understand what I'm saying but there was no feeling and no emotion as it was in this dimension well I would not have you ignorant brethren that's what I'm telling you we are not ignorant of what's going on we know we've been told for now fifty or sixty years we've been told how it's going to happen but I wouldn't have you ignor brethren concerning them with your sleep thank you Paul then what you're asleep that you sorrow not you know the only thing we sorrow for is just separation a part of somebody's in your life and now they're gone that's the human part but if they're born again dear Jesus they ain't got to go to work thank God pay no taxes they ain't got to get up in the morning and worry about going the bathroom worry about going this and going to the doctor Lane a doctor in the sixth dimension unless he was born again and died and he's in it and he's out of a job once he crossed an Ice Age dimension he's out of a job Rock brother they know doctors in heaven don't need them listen but there are some good doctors I believe it'll be in heaven I believe that did you know brother Brown talks about brother Sam Madera that Sam Adair I don't know if he ever got born again but he's sure sure like the guy you know and the guy really helped brother brown them and he helped him you know he'd be given eternal life I believe anyway for we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him so you got to be asleep in Christ right for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain thank God we are a we at this moment we are a we we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord Himself where is he he is sent a second person and sent a third person or a pope or a priest or king he came himself for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout hey pay attention the voice of the Archangel you're hearing it now and I'm not saying me I'm saying you're hearing that voice now because the voice is in the bride you're hearing it right now and the Trump of God that's what we're waiting on because I'm gonna read it to you in just a minute cause it comes back to that Trump over in Corinthians so we're going to marry these two together not all right mm-hmm then no for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout boys the Archangel Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first before we get a change in our mortal human dying bodies there's going to come a voice a revelation that's going to come from inside and it's not going to matter what's on the outside that's our problem this is all circumstance I'm gonna do what God said and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so she ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you know what man has comforted their self all through two thousand ages there's going to be a resurrection one day there's going to be a resurrection one day we're going to see our loved ones again one day but they were never told how they were never told how cuz only the Son of Man knows how only the son of man knows how and when he come back in the end time through a little prophet named William Branham he give us that revelation he told us the reality of what is on that side what's on this side and how to get the two sides together we've just got to keep going and going and going and going look at number 5 on the rapture message brother Branham said the word rapture in the Bible it's not even used at all we just put that word there the Bible says caught up being caught up now I'm going to skip this for time because just finish at the end of that semester call me in now I want you to notice a great thing taking place there's three things that happens before the Lord appeared now we just went through them a shout a voice and the same time it's like three or four pages of reading so let's just skip on through that remember a shout a voice and a trumpet now we we've been taught it's the message so the shout is the message but I want you to understand something that's not all of it the message come then there had to be a voice behind that message and then the Trump of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first but now let's go let's go to first Corinthians skip 4 time mm-hmm keep going where it says first Corinthians goes remember here we are let's go through this real quick and then we'll be finished because to me this puts the punctuation mark Paul is answering the question he says so also is the resurrection of the Dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption that's why we have to put them into the ground because you have to put the seed back in the ground now the person's not in there the body's there but that body is connected with that person that's why I don't understand why people think we're just gonna get this all-new body why do you need that scripture then it is sown in current what not your soul your soul is not corrupt if you're born again that's talking about your body but it is raised oh no by the way that's not raised we just going to get another one that one's just going just completely right away now that's what most people believe in this message that is not true that is a lie according to the Bible it's a lie that would be real easy for God to just throw this one away and give us a brand new one but what a great miracle would be that the one that I was walking around in for 58 years one day changes which is the greater I think that's greater that's a greater mystery or that to me that is the mystery because I'll tell you what Paul's gonna tell us what the mystery is it is sown in dishonor what we came here by safe it was sown in dishonor but it was raised in glory it is sown in weakness obviously it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there's a spiritual but they're connected you're not gonna raise you're not going to raise in somebody else's body God give you that body and thought enough of it to resurrect it he taught enough of his own body to do that how in the world is Jesus going to raise in his own body and then you're going to get something else I brother boy the greater miracle is right here that he can take this thing and change it and I'll live in it for an eternity I'm losing my voice in a minute there's a natural body and there's a spiritual body so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul the last man Adam didn't need to be made a living soul he was a living soul he was the only living soul because Adam is somewhere in this earth his body dead body now he souls over in another dimension we know that the first man Adam was made a living soul the last man Adam was made a quickening spirit because when Christ came out of that dimension he was in and he stepped into that body that was laying over there in Jerusalem that had been beat to a pulp beard had been pulled out stripes all those things that happened to that body when that spirit quickened that body it changed it to whatever that body the Alpha new body looked like same way with me and you that's why we got the people downstairs that's when we got them at 18 to 20 years old that's the next thing you're gonna see that's what they're going to look like why because we already planted it in corruption but God when that quickening spirit that they live here on earth with eternal life in their soul when that thing comes back into the body it's going to change that thing howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural why because they committed I mean they committed the act and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord from heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy that's us and as is the heavenly such also are they that are heavenly as we have borne the image of the earthy listen this is the last time you're gonna see this guy in this condition and I prayed that if I'm not saying that to be you know prophesied but this guy right here in other words what I'm saying is we have borne the image of what our parents brought here but somehow in some way God made it look just like your theophany you ever thought of that brother Brown said he bred this one hello brother I'm said this he bred this one to this one this one to this one and this one to get to get you there don't tell me you're not elected to be ejected his brother and he says as we are but we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God this flesh and this blood cannot inherit the Kitt's not an inheritance it will become an inheritance remember Jesus got inheritance you not get the inheritance in this now this I say brother flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption they're separated they're either separated by death or by what we going to get a body change with behold I like something struck Paul behold behold ah I looked up that word because it looks kind of weird that doesn't say show look at it don't look at me that says shoe punch Senor lo Strong's Concordance it'll tell you what that means behold in other words I give or I open up a mystery behold I open to you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye everybody's made that whatever you want to but if you look up the word twinkling it's an instant and that I doesn't mean this I understanding in an instant that you understand what's going on hello in an instant when you understand what's going on at the last Trump now watch at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound that's two things brother that preached on this a long time ago I wrote in my Bible it says at the last Trump message for the trumpet shall sound through you you are the trumpet the Trump's gonna sound it's already sounded it's the message the Trump has sounded but the trumpet shall sound you and I with this message and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must I love that word must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is what Adam and Eve got in trouble for eaten the wrong fruit they swallowed the wrong fruit somebody is going to swallow the right fruit death is swallowed up in life Oh death where is your sting grave where is your victory all right let me read this quote we'll be done brother Brown said God doesn't call anyway 724 1963 for the trumpet of God shall sound and those who are asleep or resting shall wake up first take on immortality first by what the trumpet sounds listen they're not just going to automatically walk in front of us there's got something happen there's got something happened but it's got to happen on this side because death still reigns over here that's why they won't come here I mean please don't take me out of an eternal place and put me where I was weird after that but if I know if I know for a fact that those people that are standing in this dimension has destroyed death I'm gonna come back and see them with no reservation whoops uh how you get this name back all right here we go then we which are alive at today musicians yokomo at that time after they have done raised up see then we shall be changed in a moment a twinkle of an eye and meet with them and then go up to meet the Lord in the air be caught up together whether you sleep whether you don't whether you do or whether you don't wherever you're buried if you're not even buried at all you're coming anyhow there's nothing can hold you you'll be there I said brother down if Jesus doesn't come into my great great great grandkids you'll still be there in a moment just exactly and we'll be there before they'll ever be changed they're waiting on you and I to come to a revelation that death is destroyed and once they see death destroyed there'll be no hold let's stand our feet there'll be no hole that's my Thanksgiving message to you be thankful that God has spoke to you and me in this endtime a direct message you are either going to be the recipient of a resurrection or you are the resurrection amen you're a winner either way what does it matter Happy Thanksgiving take it so enforce 403 in the 403 in the spiral book let's say it's right here and then we'll get out of here 403 anybody have a need
