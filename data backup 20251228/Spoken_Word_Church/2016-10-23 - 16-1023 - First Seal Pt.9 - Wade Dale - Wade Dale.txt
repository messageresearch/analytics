========================================

good morning my time everybody okay now today we're still on the first seal now have you notice anything that we have not been doing the whole time not the message been doing mom got it and also what did Mom say we've been using the Bible and N I have we have we've only quoted quotes but we've never even looked in the book I would say you know but not to pull up quote after quote after because listen it's got to be your Revelation that that that has been here forever you got that that has been here forever and ever for 60 well what is it 63 to now yeah 53 years good wow and and and it's quote and there's nothing wrong with that true but where did the prophet of God get it that's why you should you should never have to go to a quo to explain a Doctrine right that's right true that's right cuz brother Ram didn't he didn't sure but now watch what he done he went back and looked at some of the scholars quoted some of them and was wrong yeah right right even Clarence warin could get it right but he didn't have the full Revelation I believe the man had a revelation if he had a revelation of Daniel 70 weeks and and uh U that the white horse rider was the Antichrist that didn't come from the devil right that came from God but he only had a partial piece of it what's happening is now is we're going to I hope you're seeing that that as this Antichrist comes he is destroying everything that is of god yes conquering and Conquer who's he Conquering the people us the Ley he's conquering by a Doctrine he's tearing from the from the naing council he he has he has declared war against God okay to me you ought to see that cuz the revelation of the first seal if it's one true and living God what's the first thing Satan started on in the n coun Jesus is a separate person Jesus is another identity and then that same old Doctrine comes right over here and comes in the message like brother procast is talking I think he was more talking about two Lords instead of two Gods uh the doctrine is over in the Phil in the India now in the message well we've had it here Jesus wasn't god of the River Jordan we had lale with the two Lords and all that and I called his name but sorry not way it is where it came from and where did that get them where did they get the people that were following them confusion that's oh true Revelation true Revelation is supposed to simplify everything not confuse everything right I like what brother clar said he said if you come and preach a mystery and confuse the people he said that's not God God is not the author of confusion that's what the Bible says you know God's not the author of confusion so he's not going to um he's not going to by Design he he's not going to make you be deceived but now remember the Bible says that that they believed a lie and God let them believe it well they believed it first yeah right and he turned them over you know to a strong delusion well what who's a delusion is God a delusion but God knew what they were going to he knew that that rider was going to continue to ride on on through there cuz you got to remember where does that horse rider ride in the people right that's right listen you you got to get the God showed that's just like Moses I love what brother said Moses was caught up on the mount to write the Ten Commandments while he was up there though God showed him the temple that was to come the future home Jesus Christ and said Moses here is the type that you take to the people now it wasn't a person but it was but it was hidden in the outer Court the inner Court the holy of holies all the killing of the sacrifices that was all what Moses saw in heaven was what he saw the future home he saw Jesus Christ sitting on the right hand of the father he saw all these things but when he came to write it he didn't have the Holy Ghost hello right he was anointed but he didn't have the Holy Ghost when John goes to pass atas he's got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost agrees with the Holy Ghost and he goes back and writes but then he goes into the Johns and says hey what I saw was the Antichrist remember he's the first one that said Antichrist even Paul didn't say Antichrist he said Grievious wolves he didn't know what to call it but when John goes to patmas sees all this that we're that we've read in Revelation 6 he goes back in John's and he says Beware of the Antichrist right so he had a revelation it wasn't a full Revelation but he had a revelation like brother Dale was talking now how many of you caught that Wednesday night the Capstone Revelation is the seal obviously The Headstone all right what does the stone mean Revelation Revelation so it's the head Revelation that's right it's the capping revelation we won't need anything else past the I'm talking full revelation of the seals cuz when our body is changed that's the full revelation of the Bible to us to us see your mind to go well he's going to go that's not to Israel no we get here that's right they don't they don't get it till we're gone so we got to get it first okay so we get to full Revelation that is the capping Stone and even though he may be here Jesus was here for 30 years and a lot of people didn't know he was here he's even his his own disciples at times didn't know who he really was so there's a there's a development of time that has to come in here and the Antichrist let's go back to them just for a second cuz remember take heed that no man deceive you now this is Jesus talking to the disciples all right so this is the Capstone Revelation but now remember you got to remember he was also the Cornerstone like Brother D was talking about Wednesday night now what is the Cornerstone Peter who do thou say that I am Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and upon this Revelation I'll build got to have Foundation before you can build I'll build my church so the Cornerstone sure he be he had he was The Headstone The Headstone came walked on the earth for 30 some odd years right that was him right he walked for that many years okay okay then he left and sent back he the head became the corner which was down here the corner is down right here and he and he said Peter upon that rock I'll build my church so he built it on the revelation of the Son of God remember me preaching Son of God the son of man yes we got to see the Son of God Revelation is fine to see it is it is is eternal life in your soul you going into heaven you have eternal life your bride Jesus Christ right that's right but that's not the full Revelation that's right full Revelation is a headstone the son of man God in human flesh walking on the earth not a second person that's what Satan want he Satan knows something is going to happen to put God and man back together again that's right he just knows that I mean he's he's a spiritual being amen because remember brother R said when when Satan feels God come toward you right what does he do he tries to jump in he tries to jump in between that's just what he is is that why he's distorted the word because it's Revelation the word sure it had to be he had to go to the word first yeah all right he had to distort the word take heed that no man deceive you now what are you talking about deceiving me in money and houses and cars and land and buildings and take he that no man deceive you by the word I'm not adding two but that's exactly what Jesus said for many shall come in my name right right now the ones in the prostitute ranks is not coming in the name of Jesus okay so the religious world is going to come in my name Jesus Christ amen but now remember if they they're coming in his name but they're denying it that's right when you deny the Lord Jesus Christ as the name of God yes and he's this what see denominational mentality okay shall come in my name second person of the Trinity that's right just like that brother was talking about with with with that up there you know he wrote that he said Jesus was the third of it see that's so ingrant was that um that was so in said I believe in one God right but then said brandom says one God then he said but I believe he's the third well next time I see him I'll I'll ask him about that I'll ask him why he didn't send me that we got a local guy that that that's he's a good guy but he he writes little commentaries and he quit sending them to me because I never responded to him he said he wanted to debate that that Cain would come from the devil or from the Beast I said okay I'll take it but he never say anymore take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name so see if you take a father son Holy Ghost baptism what are you doing you're denying that's right my name you're denying it you denied the faith that's right one Faith one Lord one baptism that's what the Bible says that doesn't come out of a brandom commentary you know you understand what I'm saying everybody said brandom said brandom said whatever brother BR said he got to tie back to the word of God or a false prophet there's a place in the Bible talks about seven women take hold of one man right take hold of one man yep and how does that go but they don't want they what it is they want to keep their name and don't want to take on his name well that's that's the denomination right but now let's take it to the to the message of the hour listen how deceptive it is now the message of the hour teaches water baptism and the Lord Jesus Christ right I mean if you're in the message of the hour and you're not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not going to say what daddy says stupid I mean really if you can't see it then and you're sitting in a message church then you you you're being deceived worse than anybody else that's right all right but what happens is now is see Satan he's got all that but he comes in message and he makes that the second Lord cuz there two Lords say the two Lord Doctrine or they make him not god Till The River Jordan well now his name was Jesus when he was born yeah he was born Lord the Christ and given the name Jesus does that say Lord Jesus Christ to you right so you see what he's done he's not out there now he's in here amen he's tearing the one go and but now hold on a minute it's like that brother I believe in one true Living God everybody in the message believes in one God but my heavenly days is look at all the two Lords all the other doct Jesus was God of the River Jordan you came here with a seed in you you didn't need this you didn't need that what's that doing that's tearing down the one God Revelation this whole message is based on one true and living God cuz remember they had it right down here amen when Paul says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ or May the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ bless you all that's right there's no way in his mind and even in his human mind he he was talking about three or two or he knew that Jesus was almighty God you know why when that man was struck down and road to Damascus he said who art thou Lord so he knew there was a higher power remember he studied all the Scrolls he was a scholar yes who art thou Lord and when that man spoke and said I am Jesus whom you persecute Paul wasn't an idiot that's right Paul knew he never persecuted the man Jesus that's right that's right it struck him so hard that God had moved into another form called a bride and that he was persecuting the very thing that he should be grabbing hold of that's why I'm asking this question if the seventh seal is is coming and it has to come who's coming who is it can't be physical through us huh can't be physical we are going to read a quote but as Christ was the first one to raise rising of the Sun from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slep left and the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheep wav again in the last day the bride coming of Christ so who's got to see this revelation of his coming only the bride will see this revelation of his coming see Jesus Jesus said and it's hard for it's hard for you to explain it to to someone that doesn't have a good knowledge of the Bible when Jesus said the world will see me no more but now he didn't stop there he said but you shall see me now how in the world are we going to see him and the world not now that word see means understand physically we're not going to see Jesus on this Earth until we come back with him in the Millennium right that's right brother BR said his holy feet cannot touch this Earth until it's burn over right so what is the seventh Cal it's his coming but it's not not just his coming it's the bride coming right so at the end of the seal you got to see yourself that's right you got to see the coming in you we will said in the Bri yes no one else will see it CU Jesus said You shall see me the world won't see me no more but you'll see me see what understand me you'll understand who I am more than the world will because the world is barred off cannot understand look at all the different doctrines all right even in the minute don't even want to no so the bride coming of Christ is what we're looking at I want to bring that in because watch we always we're humans amen we always put God way out you under we really do yes we do right yes I was thinking yesterday I um while I was delivering the mail truck is now my new lawnmower so I don't preach the lawn more anymore I preach to the ma to the mail yeah hey that mail's going to be anointed anyway I mean I SLI that mail in there bright light come on but now what did Jesus say Jesus said I'll go away oh you know what I was thinking about you know you seen those stickers that says um there was only one man who walked on water you know we're not perfect that's a lie that's a lie the Bible says Peter walked on the water and he didn't even have the Holy Ghost that's right he just believed that Jesus could do it I can do it that's right but now what did Jesus say though before he left he said the things I do shall you do also now do we believe that come on now do we believe that we tried he got up every day and you and he would come from God and he was going back to God that's true right he got up every day and as the Lord led him he did things I'm sure we're not the fullness of the godhead B we are not God as Jesus is is God Amen we never will be okay I'm sorry we but he's the fullness but whatever the fullness he is we get a part of which a part of is as much as the okay but that's what struck me I thought you know you don't we don't you we quote that all the time but do we really believe Jesus said the things I do so read Matthew Mark Luke and John and the book of Acts the things I do shall ye do also right and greater or more because he was one man in one place you know he didn't he didn't he didn't fly to India or to America or to Ireland or to Jamaica Philippines no he was one man but now we get in an airplane we fly to Jamaica Philippines Ireland India and we preach the gospel of God and we see signs Miracles and wonders that's the Greater Works is that we can go out and multiply what God did in one man standing on Earth in Israel and he was the seal yes so as he was the seventh seal the things that I do shall who do also who are you who are not r a r e who are you you got to know that that who is you that's right can we say that one more time that who is you but that struck me that yesterday thinking about that that that that's what this to me that's what the seal does as the Antichrist is destroying the revelation of one God then that first seal under the Lord Jesus Christ coming the bride coming of Christ it ought to take us to see us more like God okay cuz remember we're talking about justification here those who he has Justified he has already gled glorified okay but now there's many people going to be justified in the world Listen the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved there's no stipulation to that you don't have to be a message believer to believe that that's right right right but now what about see remember though if they stay right there and keep sinning God has to account that sin to them and they have to be judged for that but once you're truly Justified then you go to sanctification then that's why brother had to come back and preach justification sanctification Bap of the Holy Ghost in the correct way that if you're truly Justified listen if you're truly Justified God's the only one that knows you're going to be glorified amen millions and billions of people have been Justified and going to go to hell okay yeah they are many people going to be Sanctified and they going to die and go to hell okay Judas that's right Judas was under the preaching of sanctification the prophet of God said and he was the son of predition that's why brother br said he said this seventh seal cannot be duplicated or copied the third pull can't be duplicated or copy why it's Christ himself in who form of a bride amen but the the the whole world we're not perfect just forgive them we're not you know we can't walk on water who do you think you are they asked Jesus the same thing they just didn't have a bumper sticker in the car to put it on remember the Pharisees and Sadducees I'll guarantee you they stood over in a corner and they talked about Jesus a lot yes and it wasn't good right who does he think he is no one perfect not this he can't be the Son of God he does this he does that the things I do so you do also okay he said I was despised and you'll be despised too and you'll be killed for my sake if you keep reading in Matthew it keeps telling you that you'll be killed for my sake because he was killed he was killed because he told the world he was the son of God right or he proved to the world really but they turned him down so under the first seal justifica I see justification but it's not the justification to chop off your past sins you should already done that back that's the Son of God Revelation that's right got it that's the Cornerstone the Cornerstone revelation of this um bride as a whole I'm taking the bride from here all the way through the Cornerstone the foundation of your Revelation should be one true and living God the Lord Jesus Christ is his name and that's the baptism you should that we must go by right and one true and living God now once you see that that's like what brother Dale was talking to brother dick he talking about one God well I believe in one God then first name day said what about your baptism if you believe in one true and living God you got to be married to him he's got to you're got to be his bride you can't be Miss Father Son and Holy Ghost you can't be Miss father son Holy Ghost right you got to be Miss Jesus Christ yeah Jim didn't stay you know she she's now she's a Dale why because we marri and then in the Christ coming of coming of Christ coming out of the church what marrying we're married to Christ now amen then we should lose our name and take on his amen right so the seals tell me though in this justification is that if his coming is us then we stand just as just as Jesus did on the earth yes well is that too hard yeah it must be we've been here 50 50 something years since the prophet preached the message and I'm not laughing I'm just I'm just saying we we sometimes we're silly when we say yeah I believe that but do we really believe that we believe it for somebody else well that's what I'm saying saying we believe it that Jesus can walk on water and I don't believe that if I go out there I'm just going to walk out and walk on water but I'm going to tell you something if God comes on the scene like he did to Peter and me with the Holy Ghost and I have a need of it see that's why that's why you have to be careful cuz the devil can throw these signs and wonders out frivolously frivolously you say that prly prly you know why wait I'm going to go walk on water cuz I'm godone no You'll Never Walk you know you might get an anointing and might try it but you're going to do like Peter you're going to start sinking some kind of circumstance is going to happen around you you'll know then that's not God show that was Peter or show off that's exactly what Satan is he's a he's a flashy show off but I'll promise you Paul stood one day and he said the angel that Stood Beside of me remember now what happened was that boat was was in a storm they were getting ready to get in a boat and leave now you would think in your mind that that would be the most safe thing to do is get in a boat and try to make it to shore Paul so convinced those 200 people I think it was he said hold it I can see old Paul standing up on the boat he said hold on that he said the angel that Stood Beside Me last night I believe Paul had an angel come in just like brother R got an angel any prophet's got an angel that takes care of him that they can see I believe he said the angel that stood by him stood he wasn't up in the air flying around he stood by him brother Brown didn't see Angels flying around in the air he saw people walking on the ground so as we see Paul said the angel stood by me said don't leave the boat but everybody will be saved now you think listen you got to think them old fishermen thought man this guy's crazy and we need to get off this boat but he so convinced them he said if you'll stay on this boat not one of you will lose your life and you know what the boat got tore to Smither rings and they had to Flo in on they were holding some of them they talking about were holding on to the to the slap of the old ship that was gone that's right but they were saved that's that's why I said you know sometimes we look at it we think well this is the best way and you get somebody come along say hold on a minute or you get to one inside of you say hold on a minute yes be still and know that I am God am I calling me I don't know who that is probably tell Market many minutes he's telling me to shut up he's probably watching online that brother trying to call you that brother trying to call me oh okay all right no he's don't live in Atlanta he lives a lot closer than that but do you see what I'm talking about yes when Jesus said the things that I do shall you do also we quote that and quote that but look go back and look at the things he done you got to be able to do the same thing Jesus wasn't to show off right he didn't show off he he he always um gave the credit to the father right which was in him right right Jesus answered take heed that no man deceive you now the deception especially the the deception in this end time is is that you were born with this seed in you and you don't need to struggle you don't need to fight you don't I mean I don't know what in the world I'd like to really sit with about 10 or 15 of them and ask them what they what the new birth in the Holy Ghost is for right yeah you can't be born with a holy ghost right I mean Heavenly days there's only one person ever been born with the Holy gohost and that was God himself amen we were born in sin so there has to be a separation there is no way I'm going to tell you this right now there is no way that I can walk up at the day of judgment if I'm a sinner knowing what I know now if I walked up first thing I'd do is I'd say you said they had something I didn't have talking about the bride standing in judgment that's the first thing I'd asked I'd say you said you gave them something that I didn't have then you respected them and not me how you going to judge me right honestly that's right that's but for us to know that we were just like that man stand in there and for God to look down and say Hey you had a chance here's the day here's the hour he's got to tell him that to me that's a just judge here's the day here's the hour I came to you and the difference in you and this guy right here our sister right here they accepted it and you did that's right settled the whole ball game to me that there's no way then that that person can argue that's right cuz it's going to come right back to him hey is right cuz you know they sear their conscience where they don't think about no more but see to me that's a righteous judge to be able to judge he's going to have to put everybody on the same playing field and say okay these will accept and these won't sure he knows that but we don't we've got to you know like the the quote where brother Brown says that in the upper room that the Holy Ghost fell on Sons well see that's where they go to is that we were born sons of God now it fell on Sons because God knew that was God's mind knowing that they were Sons not them they didn't know they were Sons amen my heaven that's the furthest thing from their mind they were scared to death they wer sitting up there and saying well bless God when the Holy Ghost come just going to quick and everything I got already in me we're going to be just fine no they were up there brother R said with the door shut windows locked scared to death then when the Holy Ghost quickened what they had in their soul they run out the door and said hey we really don't care that's right we got what that man told us we was going to get get okay so that's the difference but see there's another doctrine that will take you away from a true Revelation see that doesn't to me simple simply is we were all born in sin we all had to either accept or reject Christ to me that just the simplest but now to say well I was this seed and I it was already in me and as a baby and I did this and I did that to me that's more confusing we're all born in sin amen everybody but Jesus Christ was born the same way that's right mhm right so that way he's a righteous judge right see to me that's a revelation it's not a revelation to say that you had the eternal life in your soul that when you were born a baby the things I did I knew I knew I didn't have God in Me that's that's what the people ought to see right sister the people ought to go back in their mind and in their I don't care if you want squeaky clean you still had things that you shouldn't have done that's right when you were younger that the Holy Ghost ain't got nothing to do with that's right right wasn't nowhere around oh yeah he was watching over you but he was not in your residing in your person when you were doing the things you were doing you're believing you're not believing right either no you don't believe none of that I come to church a couple of times a year just so M just make Mama happy honestly what I I sat there and thought about work and about playing ball and about this and wonder what the Falcons are doing and you why oh but brother you had that se if that listen if that seed was in Paul Why didn't it Quicken on the road to Damascus why did he have to go to another body of Christ to the body to get that seed Made Alive that's right right why didn't when Jesus said receive ye the Holy Ghost to all the disciples they were all there receive ye the holy go why didn't they just receive it right there that was God Almighty himself that was the that was the very tube that they needed they needed that why didn't they receive it right them cuz they had the word inside he he had talked to them for three and A2 years yes sir why didn't he say receive you the Holy Ghost and they just boom we don't need to go in the upper room we got it now no why don't God condemn them if they was born with it right like he condemns us now when we do have it well they told Peter he said get behind Satan so I don't know where in the world Satan was at at the time but I know where God wasn't that's right he wasn't in Peter at that moment that's right that's why if you read Oneness with God I love that quote I keep it in my house he's talking about the disciples denying him like Peter denying him he said God wasn't in those disciples yet well okay if he wasn't in them he wasn't in them thank you brother I was wondering when you going to startop take heed that no man deceive you boy right off the bat you're going to be try to be deceived Satan's going to try to deceive you right for many not to a three many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many what telling them they're Christ because they'll have signs and wonders and the great things and the great Miracles I've always said and I'll stay with it till we get out of here somebody's going to raise up that's right in this messag amen with signs and wonders and miracles that you will not be able to deny that it's God and he'll be false in the word and the people will flock to him flock to him not care what he's preaching but they'll flock to those signs and wonders cuz that's what Satan's into he's into the signs and the Wonders and the feelings Now you listen what is false unowned one it's the true Holy Ghost healing the people raising the dead Satan can't do that that's true the brother I'm said the person's fault inside okay and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you not be troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet we're going on toward the second seal so I'm going to go and read it for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquake diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows did y'all see the other day I look read it a little more this morning Bob sent me a link Russia is headed towards Syria with the biggest war Fleet since to World War III with the biggest Fleet they're coming now they not going they're not sending one boat no they got a fleet heading toward Syria cuz they want that Syrian president to stay in power and then he sent the quote link where brother Brown said watch Russia when they come after the oil where's Syria right right in the oil District listen I'm going to tell you something I think about this morning we're not going to be just able to read what's happening we are going to be in high defin color right in the middle midle of it and that's what God knew he knew we'd be right in the middle of it that's why he said be careful watch but see if you're truly Justified then your sins are forgiven then you go through sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost well if you see that that's fine but to me I've always call that baby form justification but the justification that we see in the seals is not that you that you that you were not even part of that sure your flesh did all the things that you did I'm sorry hold on a minute your spirit did all those things the Inside Man right remember your flesh don't do anything except what's inside man motivat all right so we look and see that that happens then we see that we see that we're born again in our soul but we need more work that's perfect man this works on our spirit realm it does yes yes cuz remember bear with me just a second we're not getting anywhere but we'll get to it next Sunday now this is Brother R Drew these right here right uh Soul spirit and body right now if you cut you in in half you wouldn't see that right but that's a illustration of this being the outside of man body spirit and soul now this is either Faith or doubt it's not like this right right this can be this can be like that that's right yes right yes but that can right it's either white or black so really what are we working on this there's your filter there's your filter cuz listen if Jesus comes back this is what I think we believe this is what I think we believe we get the Holy Ghost and we get about that much I mean the new birth I'm talking about old man cleaned out God comeing and reside in your soul then all of a sudden a few more years later it does like this that's not it right that Soul come from God it's Eternal perfect never sin a day in its life never had a bad thought never did those things never had a beginning and never had an end yeah so where's our problem God and the devil half of it here but now this right here if you're born again it's all what right so he's still working on me but it's not in the soul that thing's perfect what you know what he's trying to do if God gets in here and starts going this way that's where we have a problem if we don't see one true and living God guess what filter gets stopped up okay listen you're not training your soul right everybody see that so you you we don't really see what we the new birth that we have we don't see what it is it's the fullness of God in your part not half God part god 2/3 thir 10 if you got the new birth you've got the soul of almighty God in your soul right that's true justification those who is Justified he's already got that whole thing but that's our problem we think that when we get the Holy Ghost and sure brother B says we get the Holy Ghost is like a little button well it's like a teaspoon of the ocean right that's the whole it's the whole ocean right it's just part your part that's right so our problem is it's got to be in the spirit realm because if your soul is eternal listen if your soul is eternal what's wrong with it nothing nothing it don't can't even be judged now the Deeds that we do here yes we're going to be judged but that Soul cannot be judged if he said I'm coming back and the things I do you do a comforter I'm going to reside in you not on you that's anointed ones the anointed ones this guy right here this is still black huh yes but God will have to go by his word if they meet a certain requirement and in this realm here they're falely anointed okay can't be falely anointed in their soul they're either born again or not that's right so that Spirit realm is where this works that's right now do you have faith in your soul if you're born again it is Faith don't that you have it it is Faith it is virtue where did Jesus get his virtue from in person inside of knowledge Temperance what our problem is is we take the knowledge of the Holy Ghost knowledge and it's got to come through this junky filter called memory reasoning there's no memory reason conscious affection in that Soul that's right see that mean when that seal broke to brother R him he saw something go away from him that wasn't in his soul it was bothering him and it didn't it didn't quit bothering him you understand what I'm saying but he was he identified because the scripture says there in Hebrews that the word is a two-edged sword that what does it do it discerns the soul from the spirit and we stopped there but I read it the other day what's joint and Marrow does your spirit have joint and Marrow does your soul have joint and Marrow your body has joint and Mar so he covered all three cuz see we always stop and say Well it divides the soul and the spirit it says and the joint in the mouth it it tells you what your flesh does your spirit and your soul we got to go we'll pick this up next Sunday sorry for getting off the line a little bit
