made possible south across a man enjoyed the message this morning a man he's already this afternoon her brothers speaking the word of the Lord and to us to bring us to word would be for the hour that we live in the time right now we always wear the Queen as I said this morning he does not take his he might not want me to say a lot of things about but I tell it like it is he doesn't take his money when he goes out I mean our money that we give him when he goes out on the missionary field he pays his own expenses but then when we give him he gives away to buildings or whatever you know building houses doing whatever he wants to buying food for the people so if anything you want to give him extra feel free to give it to it because that would be fine there's nothing but we always try to give some to work that he can go and do so is it all right with the church if we give him like twenty five hundred dollars to be able to just spend out in the missionary you know whatever he feels could be you know sufficient for him and what he does if he needs anything that we give him he's always I told him you feel free to use that money something you need something goes in are you take care of it and all this alright but I'll know him the way he is he goes on it on and takes care of it we appreciate that appreciate his stand for the truth the hour that we're living in the things and trying to cure the message to the world it's getting tighter and tighter you've heard two reports already of the government forces trying to step in one through the other brother the other day and then brother Quinn just cutting in and putting a little tighter belts on things so it'll get that away I wasn't working on it right so that's got to be but it's the same time it says the Spirit of the Lord will raise up for standard that's a wonderful opportunity - no one realized I let's just sayin open the eyes are my heart everybody Quinn comes minister unto us the word of the Lord open the eyes of my

but we're just going to read a few verses amen and Paul says for in verse 16 Romans chapter 1 just give you a second to get that Thank You brother we'd we've got the water here and he said he said for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God on the salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because amen because they that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God has showed it on to them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world I want you to get this are clearly seen and visible things clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse amen so Prince the Lord may the Lord out is blessing to that and heavenly father again we thank you Lord for this time Lord this day is a holy day to us Lord and father every day is what Lord this is the day we get together to

there was a thank you there was a little love we're open open brother brother richard wilson and you know we love brother richard and you know sister Janice they're lovely people and we love the little fellowship that they get the gather there's always a Liberty to preach to the Tennesseans you know and praise God they don't talk to that you people but but you know we always enjoy gone through there and so amen at the server side mate this little little woman she was telling me later on she actually told the church she testified of it she said you know when when the brother was speaking there I she said I said to the Lord I wish he would hurry up and quit you know and she says no that's not the way it seems she says I wish he would hurry up and quit that I can go out and be prayed for but she said just as she said that I quoted something from brother Branham and she said there was a lovely she told about our needs you know she said there was a lovely sweep over her and was all gone so you know like that's just the way it is and I'm glad hallelujah we're in a wonderful word today during the word of this hour where would you want to be other than in the brain of Jesus Christ where would you want to be hallelujah nowhere at all amen so praise the Lord I'm so glad about that there amen night I just do this here of domain and then that keeps a little thing and and place amen you know what the day of the camp meetings we respond spoke this the other morning we got the opportunity to speak at the camp meetings in the morning time for one service and you know I was just saying that to me the meetings were actually that I believe that God wanted to reveal himself to show hard grit here's the show hard gritty yes and we could never think that he's not too great but his greatness you know we could never think highly enough of that that he's a great god and he's a good god amen and he's the one whose greatness abides in us we were talking about the word being in you that's Christ amen of that words in you there's greatness in you amen and I think we were talking about it earlier with already planning to talk a few places in the existence when he gets there event and I hope you join him and did you know it's wonderful who we are and God's purposes when you look at your life and look at God's purposes you could never know enough that God what he's purpose for you like really every step of your life every part of your life he's got a purpose in it you know what I mean and and sometimes you might say or forgot the keys and go back into the house then you get the keys jumping in the automobile how do you know there wasn't just going to be a rack down there and you missed it because we're talking about the Angels you missed it things like that but God has got a purpose amen and that's a wonderful thing to know and every is a simple speed deal said how could he be planning like that but he's God you know if he knows how many you take every squirrel in America and God knows how many things just spotted aside today he could tell you so he knows the smallest detail of your life so that's wonderful amen to know that amen 9 I'm glad well you actually can't see it maybe I don't know if you could raise that or not yeah okay because we'll come to just in a while but I was really glad to see this little thing today the Ark of the Covenant but you know I this just came to me a man your brother branham talks about heart a minister gets the messages and you know gets quiet and just begins to think and study and think what god I knew it gives you maybe a thought and you start to develop it and and this is what comes in your message but that message will then you go to the the prophet and then you'll get what what he says about the different things and is such a blessing amen and this this part of the scripture here what we just read amen and we're going to look at it and a bit of depth and a moment but I is called six invisible things made visible once I got this one this was the first one that there was an invisibility you know you've seen a blank screen there there was nothing on it amen but if you see something then began to be projected onto it and Mead then it shows you something amen and it's the same when you look at the universe you know it wasn't there one stance and I it was there amen it was invisible it became visible and you see God's great eternal Godhead and power to do it amen I'm so glad to see the younger people in here today as well and God bless you amen as you serve him with all your heart I was 15 years of age when I started to serve the Lord 18 years of age amen I've never regretted not never regretted not amen so prison Lord amen for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen the invisible things clearly seen being understood amen by the things which are made amen the things which are made if it's invisible you don't know what it is what if something's made you know what it is prison or disfigure it's like an artist amen and praise the Lord working from nothing and then what he creates or a sculptor what he creates then you know amen what it is what would what his thoughts were and it's the same with God with God to mate I remember reading about one of England's famous painters his name was Turner and he was had quite a famous name and that this lynnie of the realm came to visit him a man knew that her servants brought her and her carriage and all that and she looked at his work and she said mr. Turner she says I do not see what you put in to that finding of a teacher and whatever it is and he just looked at her and he said ah he said but mom do you not wish you could see his he made encima he hid but he could see a tenor so it's wonderful amen I also in the Bible and talks about Hebrews 11 though we a through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God a spoken word creation that he believed his own word amen and so prison Lord was framed by God by the Word of God and may I add from the eternal mind of God I'm the intelligent God then intelligence on his perfect wealth though a lot was free him by him amen the Sun the Moon the Stars the planets everything the whole universe and there was nothing made that was not made but by him amen so praise the Lord and it was made from things that do not appear you know it is we do not see out of well we do see items when we see ourselves but you know we don't see that them certain wheels going through the building and things like that and you know it's invisible to us but they're real they are real I'm so prison Lord amen by things that do not appear the invisible items the law of gravity electromagnetism we don't see it but it's there Prince the Lord not at the beginning only the Eternal Spirit all was invisible you know even Paul says it in the New Testament on to the king eternal immortal invisible that God only wise amen be honor and glory for ever and ever amen so when he speaks there comes a creation the cherubim the sovereign and Archangels the universe mine the world everything the earth and man on it praise God when he spoke he spoke at all and existence amen and then may I say that I never really thought it but a brother branham said the cherubims they are the guards around the throne and then I was wondering about the sort of films not too hard remember I wondered about them and you know I the answer really was that and Isaiah chapter 6 I believe it is when Isaiah saw the Lord High and lifted up it was a Seraphim that came and took the coal from off the altar so that the cherubim are the throne that Seraphim are the altar they are the guards of the altar they are to do with the altar worship amen so prison Lord for that nine if I may read your quote he said I'm funny enough this is wonderful because when I was asked to speak on Friday morning I had this quote this quote was there to be printed off and I had it and I did not realize that that brother Craig Brewer the night before would would actually be written from this here so it was so the continuity of the holy spirit was so wonderful no I and I have heard but now I see one of my favorites I love that one of my favorite you know the Bible says Kirsten see you know maybe some of our young people thinking well I I don't see in it but my mom or my dad sees in that well you test in see and find out of us it was evidence to see him for your mom and dad that they a little bit you'll love it have you really kissed and see it no so he said I could he this is job truly go to his house and knock on the door say this this man had suffered where would he open the door and talk with him a while and then when the inspiration dropped in his heart then he could see God the lights are flashing the thunders are going and when a dead he stood upon his feet and said I know my redeemer liveth my Redeemer at the last days you'll stand on the earth see he had to begin to see God's reaction to his fear and you know I may not know a lot but I'll tell you one thing I know this much that there is never a time in your life where God will not react to your faith never if you have faith in God for something and you really have it God will react to it because that able react to your for you think he did with you know so prison Lord Amy and 9 we wonder if we could see God is there a way that we could see him because he's it was invisible see and he says is there a way that we could see him no he said oh no he said it was the only way God had try and Jocasta the way says it trying Joubert so he will try you he will test you we know that and he said I have heard of me with the hearing of the ear but now I see thee and now I see them with my eyes the vision of the invisible had been made clean no he seen the crater rollin he heard the the flushing of the Lightning and saw it and saw the roaring of the Thunder on a clear day he seen God wasn't not cleared and then not lightning just like Ezekiel and he could see go with his natural eye and the way brother Branham says it exactly the way we read it he says amen and the invisible became visible so that's that that's what I wanted to just that thought this afternoon amen the visible vision of others was then vindicated clear to him to the nuts your life Amen I heard of you but now I see you amen and so praise God for that amen and just like faith with works as he spoke one last night about Abraham but we're not going to that but the visible became visible to Joe and he could react to that amen praise the Lord and he was restored back to a full house as you as you know amen no prison or you know Genesis one I want to just cut a platform the builders on Genesis one this was creation the invisible atoms made visible by what is created it was a spoken word creation praise the Lord we know that and you know all my the bride of Jesus Christ has been introduced to that and the third pole amen the spoken word on his creative power 5 times brother Branham spoke daddy infallible word amen our field at the little dead face back the three squirrels spoken the existence will take bellybuttons the salvation of sister honey rate sons the Colorado storm I'm sister Millis tumor taken away we had a just a lot of short talk this III really it's just a shame I can't stay longer even just a couple of days just to have valium and talk you know I'm a beautiful but and you know when we talked about Colorado I've never been to Colorado I was talking to a brother up in Galax in Virginia and they'd come down from West Virginia and he said you preach that was the old church because it burned down not because I preached in it you know button hit I've got a lovely run run yet new church that's brother Rob really shoes me and I'm this brother said you came and preached to us I said sir I don't think I was ever in West Virginia and he said oh you weren't it was you and I said are you sure he said yeah and then he said uh God brother Brad Burgess brought you or I said son right I said well if I was with Brad yes surely way back and when I was young not so much these days but the thing is I said I didn't know that he said what was you and the lovely thing is he said and I could tell you what you preached I thought my you come back 30 odd years I think I still remember he said you talked about the ISIS and the blood and whatever not well I don't know what I talked about I can't even remember being in this fit well I don't know what a priest in the church but you know it's wonderful is God and that I will say this about Colorado I've never been there a number flying over at one time and you know you're looking away down and then all of a sudden you're looking down on this city and it's not so far below you so I think I said I I believe that's uh in Colorado what's what's the capital Memphis no Denver Denver Colorado so I asked one of the attendants and she says sir I don't know but I'll find out so she went up and asked the pilot and he came down said yeah that was Denver Colorado so I got that close to it but I never got up but do you know something we're talking today I would love it wouldn't you're not gonna do me much you know what would you for you but just to where brother branham spoke that storm away I'd love to stand there just think of the greatness of God that day that was manifested there Amen praise the Lord and a you know I I said to my wife just a few weeks ago brother Samuel that I had a dream I said you know I had a dream of me in you and I said honestly we were young you were young and I was young and we were beside each one another and you know it's going to be wonderful hallelujah and I was thinking of brother Branham and sister Mary that day he said is that you honey as a young sister meda a young brother branham and then when the vision went and you know and the tears were running down his eyes and praise God when he when he looked down and got it all dried up all the snow was gone and the leads were there Amen what a wonderful day that was praise God so Amen we are we're certainly noble to spoken word creation to do amen ix prison ORD and i and his great creation God saw everything that it was good amen it was very good it was very good because the eternal being is essentially good our God I don't know but Muslims or Allah well I was look I was not even in the em all it means God as all it means so he's a God with no name all right but our God's got a name the Lord Jesus Christ and our God hallelujah not only not there Amen but our God is a good God he's not going to bite murdering people and liquid hitting people and all out he's a good God and so thank the Lord for that his nuts in his personality and his Nitzer he's essentially good and goodness and it's per side and personified in Jesus Christ our Lord when what did he do he went about doing good and all he got for the reward from the world from the Pharisees and the Romans was crucified harvest my I'll tell you what you and I would look them Hance to be laid on us I tell you all your troubles will be gone if he would put them just a touch from the near print hands my that would really be a blessing to your heart today amen so praise the Lord undone may I just say this that that were good as a good a good word it's a joining word unobjective as they call it and then it's a joining where that's where objective means it's a joining word and it means pleasant acceptable and satisfactory so what him in the world it was pleasant amen and it was acceptable and it was satisfactory to him God always refers to anything that is desirable or beneficial as opposed to something bad unhurt fall amen oh what a wonderful thing to know that the Bible says the goodness of God leads men to repentance even so creation was very good what he admit so to start off with amen the eternal God had the invisible things amen and just because we don't see things with our human I don't mean they don't exist prison just shows our limitations Amen you see and and you know like I see them invisible atoms they have to recreate it to show something and and we know that the fourth dimension amen Victor's and not we have dimension things travel as a real dimension so praise the Lord Paul declares here the invisible things are clearly seen the Greek word is a cough or Oh Raoul clearly seen means thoroughly seen amen thoroughly perceived clearly amen to understand them so thank God we're not living in a mist you know we can see it clearly see the things that God has done in this day and he has done them and we know it a hostile image him hallelujah and so we perceive them and understand them because of the form they take no although they are created of nothing prison Lord the things that are made or crivit the creation the invisible heavens clearly declares the glory of God amen it was the first Bible let me speak about in a moment and the first feminum and dot dot dad that firmament there's a greek word for it not even going to try and pronounce it it's an extended service solid expanse called the vault was called the vault of heaven and took the water and it was only above the clouds and it was only when nor day were not was emptied on to the earth amen and and then as with the rain came from and then of course the flood and then the earth tilting and whatever not but prison Lord the firmament well air the firmament from here raid up your own night avarice is getting very thin hard to bury but you're still just about there amen and then of course nobody looked about 30 years ago he was talking about an ozone layer nobody knew him whose only hair was but we know know amen you keep out of the you know you key part of the the Sun praise the Lord and that so that ozone there to shield the Rays of the Sun against us and what a wonderful God that he made this planet habitable Amy and he really didn't do that and that's all for our good it's all for our safety hallelujah and he's thought of everything amen and so prison Lord wonderfully created you know fearfully and wonderfully made amen to show forth his workmanship and his handiwork amen and what a handy work it is prison Lord the voice their voice the heavens have got a voice amen the starry heavens and it's clear to all mankind that the grid I am the designer and builder is God amen as I said probably here before but I remember when Neil Armstrong was over in Ireland and he was being interviewed on the radio and I listened to it not at that time and what happened was the ER it was kind of personal questions and answers and uh the presenter asked him he said do you mind if I asked you seen were here do you believe in God you could just er know and he said yes and he said I know I'm getting personal but could you tell me why just shortly briefly you know and he said well yes I could and he said because when I was up there and looked at that universe looked at that story haven't looked at all the creation he said I saw a design a design no you can't hover the sang with her the designer you can't you just kind of do it amen well not only him can see a design we can see a design hallelujah so this is the designer amen honest wonderful prison Lord and the grid I am the designer Amen the Builder is God Christ Himself that created it all amen you know the again good on to the pro Catholics but you know while when we were being brought up the Catholics would tell us oh when Jesus was a baby he would take the clay and get it wet and make a little bird and he'd say what's this and throw it up in the air fly away they did they probably still believe that some of them but you know the Bible says his first miracle was in Cana of Galilee so he wasn't showing off the kids all look what I can do and you put a kid's come ain't got nothing no no that's not the way God works where is the Lord so here it was the whole universe in creation and Paul tells us it shows forth as eternal Godhead has eternal and everlasting made and strengthened ability that he's got to do it on his inherent power that resides in him the eternal Godhead prison Lord and the divine nature by virtue of which he speaks it and it happens hallelujah amen and bless the Lord we just want to say something in a moment about that amen but the heavens were his first Bible I was Jewish first Bible the zodiac amen brother Branham and I might just run this past year brother Branham and the 60s but 62 he talked about the cross face that's where we are now he said Amen put in 62 he said that Malachi 4 hadn't been brought into existence yet it wasn't there Amen we're looking for him he said you know but that was the common step into his office as a prophet amen and so I hear he was and he's talking about job and that's he said that's where we are and if you look at the ancient zodiac the real Babylonian one guru way back because the Romans like they always do and the Greeks they get all mixed up they've got swarms and all kinds of stuff in it it's got nothing to do the original zodiac and so the original where you have there you have the Virgin and then the Leo the Lion at the end and then between you got them cross fish and if you look at one am cross fish amen it's sad it's joined to this other fish that's horizontal amen so you can see one of the faces going up a woman has to say behind you know and really what it was as the bridegroom open its Israel Brazil or join together like those time because that said Naomi and Ruth whatever way you want to look at it that's where we are pretty large and 62 that's what was coming forth amen and it's still coming forth were cells and joined by God praise the Lord but you know and 63 if you come into it and you know I remember I wouldn't say there's anybody able to help I ha ha nobody janitor you have you in your neck I want to you again No praise the Lord the heavy is used to say this is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius almost smoke more dope and we'll be happy you know more and more what anymore oh my but they must sit a million miles but I'll tell you what they hadn't something they knew there was something common something common and if you look at Aquarius the sign of Aquarius and how you know it's a lovely study how do you know what it really is all the stars have been named the way back then and they'll tell you they'll tell you like even in Virgo the virgin she has a a bunch of wheat weed in her hand and just something like a branch so also you know and she's horizontal in other words the heavens are telling us don't worship the Virgin amen but here's the bronze in her hands here's the weed in her hands and except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die she was going to bring him forth amen and that so so here when you come to Aquarius what have you find you find this person and he's got like a big water jug and he's pouring out the water the water of the word hallelujah poured all over the bread of Jesus Christ all around the world you know and that's the age we're and what it's a new age a new message and it's wonderful hallelujah okay let's let's go on amen so prison Lord brother bronze says look at the earth spinning around and perfect harmony amen perfect harmony order an order as never by chance this word could not spin the way it has done for all these thousands of years and everything stayed the way it has would take somebody order and not to happen it just said so order has to happen amen praise the Lord and the earth is better tamed than a nice wit's watch that you could find pretty Lord like I said this morning with the engine it's perfect it never loses its beat now sometimes they do say it does wobble and do things they got but you know my my it still goes on it still goes on praise the Lord so remember hallelujah amen he says can you bind the sweet influence of Trinity's that's or lose the parts of Orion and plenties is the Seven Stars taping the seven the seven stars in 100 Jesus or seven churches messengers and to the seven churches and the sweet influence of Pleiades what a sweet influence they have had on us Amy and then their messengers you know I was just telling we had maybe you don't know it but on the 31st of October this year on 15th of 1517 1517 we find that Martin Luther took his little pieces and in the inlet to the door of Wittenberg Castle that he wanted the church did a bit what was going on and said it and the wrong things that were going on and get them sorted eyed but instead of not happening in an order that he wanted what happened was they took a bridge whose s a priest there from there trying to tell us that we read of order you know and that we should be it anything he says well he didn't mean it but I'll tell you what he started the Reformation amen because that had to come out of there you know and Prince the Lord it sure did know the restoration of the braintree and he did and so you can think about that I'll be in Germany in September praise the Lord I'm looking forward on being Switzerland France and Germany and that's all a story that I haven't got time to tell you today but you pray for me prison Lord and so it's wonderful amen and he says here on Orion amen Orion's bond goddess job can you open or loose the bonds of Orion the cords this Orion is the beautiful Christ but you know something a way back if you studied and ah what was it not the Earth's early stage but head slaps to bubbles you read all of it it's a hard read but you read all about Nimrod and you know something lo and behold they say Nimrod that's him the bonds of a riot say even if you looked at the Great Pyramid and then pyramids they're all the exact copy of the belt of Orion and so they say oh that's numb rod but I'll tell you we say that Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah that's what we say the mystery of God reveals hallelujah and so because the pyramid was the second Bible and Amen a job I could not I cannot understand the mischief at all but hallelujah we can and do understand the mystery hard that he Christ Orion let the glory of heaven and came here on this earth and his cords were loosed amen and revelation can praise the Lord they certainly were amen the coming of the Son of Man with that revelation of them seven seals amen praise the Lord so no wonder don't wonder a little fella way over in Austria somewhere Amen could write the words Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder consider all your hands of men I see the stars I hear the Rolling Thunder thy hand to light the universe to spread then sings my soul my Savior God to thee How Great Thou art How Great Thou art then sings my soul my Savior God to thee How Great Thou art why because it was invisible but it was in his mind he spoke at he career he made earth for us hallelujah to the minutest detail praise God amen and he's a great God not ever made because I could watch the time look anything and I'm going to use this here over here keep your are not solid there Justin and a little while but three things that Paul says there he says first of all the invisible things are clearly seen that means them be made visible a scene of him from the creation okay then he said by these things that are made we apply these things that are seen we understand what is made so if you'd walk round that yard was with Michelangelo and you see nothing there but he sees something he sees a big slab of marble and he walks throwing it in your finger oh I don't see nothing here and he's walking round up and he sees Moses and not say it's invisible to you but it's not invisible to him it's in his mind and he takes that down apparently they had rejected that bit of marble well that's a masterpiece some masterpiece amen so when it's million you understand what was in his mind praise the Lord and then what do they do in this text they show forth God's eternal power on his Godhead 9 so I'm just going to speak about one other thing that was invisible amen I just rate at this moment and as mine the crown of God's creation amen a psalm 139 just very briefly he said I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and my soul Lord right well my substance was not hid from you Amen when I was made in secret hallelujah you know you're a designer product in fact you are how do you you know I talk about little things that I've done and when I went over there to the Philippines three little things I'll tell you but now you know I certain but how well you know first of all two pastors and brother James he said brother George I'll be your bodyguard everywhere because don't know there are Muslims you know and the concern for me down there that everything would be all right but it was okay and so you know I I said brother James I've got something for you you showed me your letter Church and there he was working away trying to plaster and I said you told me that you didn't have any doors and the windows and I said there's a couple of hundred dollars that will help you to go on so I came here to the bathroom and he's taking photographs and and I said Jim what are you doing he said I'm taking photographs of this money Jackie for why did he he said I've never seen a hundred dollar bill in my life a man never seen it folks can you imagine her but later off but thank God I know he was done something with that then his brother he's a pastor at another part of the island and I said to brother mark I said mark I've got something for you and I know it affects you because you're small these people you know and I said this is a Levi's shirt now can you imagine Nona mean like here's a Levi's certain I'm giving to and he broke down in tears and I said did I say something no Dada what you know what olessa bite and a breath you know are you okay yeah and what's wrong he said I've always wanted a Levi's shirt he said he said but I could never afford one and I said what brother this is for me and you don't have to pay for it this is my gift to you and that's why he was crammed you know wonderful things and so praise the Lord here we are we're meet in secret amen my substance was not hid from me I was near and sigrid curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth amen thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect but in my book all my members were written God's got a book he's got a number of books but you know he's got a book and all your man all your members were written you know like I was preaching all up I could even preach it this afternoon you know ah the body is full of light and you know where it says and I think it's Luke 11 where Jesus said that of your eye a single amen your body will be full of light and heart I kind of go on did folks but you know how your body has got 4s and when you go after 65 you're on your last ray so I'm on the last you hey okay but the only thing is some guys are 91 and whatever not they're still on their last ray so you know it doesn't actually tell you when it's going to happen but before goals any program talks about acts rational just don't do as many if you can help it at all because you will lose your cosmic like amen and so anyway praise the Lord but I won't get on to that there but you know what we were talking about the eye we're talking here but our members made your eyes are absolutely wonderful amen do you know why did God give you two ice you know wisely not give you three eyes or one eye and if you'd only one eye you'd be like a clay ops you don't want em clean and the great thing you know boy bowknot monsters you know what I mean and you wouldn't even look this pretty as you do pretty hard let me give you two eyes because you don't really realize it that you're looking in 3d you're not looking at a flat surface they God you're looking because you got to ice prince & you know the story of the I you know even even Charles Darwin admitted that he can't explain the human eye because he knew that it can't evolve you know you don't start off with a bunch of something and it evolves to this and involves that you had to have all the components to put it together and make an eye and he knew that and it's true praise the Lord and not I abut single if it's focused hallelujah it's the light of your body how much more spiritually even I focused on to the Lord will it be the light of your body amen but you see these were all and continuance were fashioned when I said there was none of them so they were invisible only God in his mind you but you Amen there was no mind probably wasn't even a spirit man man I don't know but what I do know it was invisible but the invisible became visible all that it you know that's why he did you know you say I've got five let's say five fingers you got a pregnant finger and what four fingers that um I knew that but boy I'll tell you what if you ever met somebody that lost her thumb and of course they can get by but it's not the same it's not the same God give me a fight because you need it five God did you - because you need it - amen my it's a miraculously I millions of cells in your I bow tie it's miraculous and how you say well I can turn around see we only have the turn my head and the little muscles and all things they got is put it all there fearfully and wonderfully made hallelujah card presses are thy thoughts to me oh god her grit is the sum of them that he would make us and make us body soul and spirit amen okay so that's mine no I if I could talk about this little fella for a moment because uh you know it would be impossible to bring to all the tabernacle today you couldn't get what I'm sure you've studied it over the years amen and our tax enrollments amen the invisible things are clearly seen of him from the creation all right this structure was clearly in God's mind hallelujah Edwards in his mind first and foremost from the beginning when Moses delivered the people from Egypt you know in the wilderness if you oughta said our before but crossing the Red Sea when I leave in Egypt have you had a said Moses when he shows the design for the tabernacle able to said what tabernacle oh and what about the tabernacle why don't wanna back up you say brother George no absolutely mad how hard would he known about the tabernacle until he got them in Sinai and went up that mountain at God's command see and so that's what it was but it was first and foremost it had to be revealed and what a revelation it was and Moses access 24 went into the midst of the cloud and got himself up the mind and Moses was in the mind 40 days 40 nights and the Lord speak on the Moses saying speak to the children of Israel that they may bring an offering of every man had given it one Lee with his heart he shall make me an offering him in and let them go me a century that I may dwell in enormous that was the whole idea of the tabernacle a century that God could dwell with his people Amen I love that hallelujah and and says and according to all that I show you after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thou shall make it precisely every detail so coming out of Egypt it's an invisible thing to Moses knows nothing about it no it's going to become visible it's going to become visible hallelujah and praise the Lord we get a leaven thing here it was invisible to Moses but in the mind of God it became visible he saw it hallelujah and he understood the invisible by the things that were made Moses saw it Moses saw for the first time God's divine blueprint amen of the place of his worship and the police where he would place his name remember the only place and in Isaiah 6 that we already quoted what happened he said where he was and that place the glory of God the angel flew off the servant flew off and took coals from off the altar there had to be an altar there with coals on it and didn't burners noise but they were there see so Moses saw it every detail God give him it in blueprint and he made it exactly like it was and I mentioned the serpents the Serpent's earlier on to you amen and so this was that the blueprint but what was the key what was there that this Ark of the Covenant now this little fella here that's a lovely little model you thought of that and dad it was three quarters three and three quarters feet long that's all TNT quarter feet long that's all it was it was a a two and a half feet high and two and a quarter feet wide that's all boy you think God's going to do a big temple or something like that and here's a little box amen and what's going to be on that box praise the Lord amen you see the contents Bourbon samuel showed me this morning the pot of manna symbolizing the true bread that came down from heaven amen that does not feed away or decay it's incorruptible prison Lord and I was in the store with my wife and we saw let us cannot think that you'd use in the kitchen I don't see it made from akhiya wood I'm what a beautiful print and they call it incorruptible wood and no doubt that's just because he was incorruptible that you'll not be less than more than 72 hours and agree of because amen you will not see corruption I'm not a care which speaks of Jesus Christ and so and there the ten stones are the two stones of the commandments the ten commandments and I'll speak a bit that a little bit later in it the 10 and then Aaron's rod the dead stick and came back to life you see on board fruit tapping the resurrection of Jesus Christ cut dirt and death and raised amen and the newness of a body that can never see death again praise the Lord but that tabernacle folks he got a homonymous you gotta focus on us you see the chief piece of furniture and dot Ark and that whole Tabernacle was this fella here that was the chief everything else was secondary beautiful but secondary all nevertheless and amen the chief piece of that art was the was of the Covenant was the mercy seat right on that there's not the things that were in it but right where your angels are touching wings right below that on the lid was the mercy seat praise God for that mercy seat amen and when you look at the whole structure it was invisible but now it was become invisible see that's the whole point that I want to get over to you today it was invisible but not compensable hallelujah and so amen everything leaded in perfect order and explained it's a complete type of Christ from the door to the mercy seat it shows his eternal power and Godhead and not here he meets God this is God meets man on God's conditions and God's requirements amen under fall or mine amen under necessity of a life for a life a blood sacrifice amen are clearly shown throughout it when you have your arm you know your Passover lamb sacrificed and he takes in the blood and he sprinkles it here over over on the mercy seat right here amen and God would accept the blood of that lamb praise the Lord no okay so amen he said the plas over blood was to take into the Holy of Holies sprinkled on the mercy seat for the people man comes in to God by the door which is Christ the sacrificial lamb of God amen and as a sin offering for atonement for sin cleanse him from sin everything his blood shed for the sins of his people the high priest carries that lambs blood in a sensor on the day of atonement and the blood is sprinkled seven times for each search he ate amen so I'm glad we've got the blood today because when I see the Blood I will pass over you and then the lovely thing is because it's pure gold this mercy seat amen the lovely thing about it is that amen on that mercy seat s where God will his people all happens right there and that's where we have a mercy seat today your heart everything a mercy seat amen and brother Branham said and right over that folks that's what you can't see today but I'll tell you there was a lovely soft glow of late just hungover up between their measles and brother Brennan said that was the Shekinah glory of Almighty God and that is why I say I would say to that if you had have been a Buddha when trading along in your camel and you looked that you'd say court was but seven feet high okay but this better bit bit bigger or smaller than his circling here right in here and you know a Buddha when driving along looks over and he sees a bit of a tent said what saw a lot of bird in there well I don't know nothing about I'd keep driving this camel you know but in there was the Shekinah glory of God that he could dwell with his people amen and that's what it was all about hallelujah that's what they had amen and I could go into more but that's what they had prison orde that's why this piece of furniture the mercy seat is mentioned is so important with third it the whole structure would be minimus but that God was there amen that God was there the wings touching supreme holiness unto the lord supreme holiness unto the lord amen and that lovely weight soft glow light the Shekinah glory of Almighty God and a form a man prison Ord and that is where God meets mine and mine meets God praise the Lord so we understand eternal mind and intelligence by the things that are me at all of it I'm not going to say any more about it because they're at what's invisible now it becomes visible and I'm sure your postures could given but a weird I took you were what all the meanings of the different things are but we see that it shows his eternal Godhead as eternal go ahead knowing one other thing that was amen and it was a high priest and the tabernacle but it's not a high priest mention in the temple it's a king hallelujah and so I'll mention in a minute just keep your eye on out there but in second chronicles three and one then solomon the to build the house of the Lord Jerusalem on my Moriah where the Lord appeared on the David his father in the peace that giveth had prepared in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite and this was always in the eternal thoughts of God amen even when it was a little Tabernacle be amid God already knew that there was going to be a temple amen see because he's God and it was invisible to the people they had the on their wanderings they had this tabernacle but in God's mind he wanted a permanent building prison Ord and that was given to David amen who moved by the Holy Ghost to build such a building and he said I dwell in a house here and God's will in a tent and he had this the Holy Spirit to say I'm going to build a building for God a temple where he can dwell them and of course you know because of Bathsheba because of Uriah and other things see but he said you've got blood on your hands he said you can't hold it for me your son Solomon amount of peace he will build it but David did everything he bought the kneels he put the cold in the silver and he did everything and he laid it all on to Solomon and actually I believe of them correct that he actually drew the design of the tabernacle while he was not in a transport something similar to Liggett and he drew died and not Bush built it was a permanent stature the house of the Lord the place where God placed his name and that's where we are he's presses me - amen and he said for now I have chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there forever and mine eyes mine heart shall be there perpetually and the grip feasts of the Lord were held there as well I just say it was a permanent structure because when they took this organ do you see these rods that day that they were taken out in the temple amen because it was permanent no more moving well isn't it wonderful I know one of the things but one day hallelujah you'll say one day my wanderings will be over I'll be glad hallelujah I'll tell you what it's not it's not easy living in a suitcase all the time you get a bit fed up with a change you know but you got to do it and you do it gladly zone to the Lord and so but one day your wanderings will be over hallelujah praise God if you want to go you're gonna thought Amen and that's going to be wonderful amen nice so when you look at this and it sat down there and the glory cloud is going to come in and brother Branham says if you don't see Jesus Christ and every verse go back and read it again search the scripture he said to the Pharisees they speak of me I'm here I'm fulfilling the word amen praise the Lord Amen no fools and slow of heart to believe all a prophet said about me so been fulfilled you missed it but I'm here to tell you that it's real and they knew it was really a man so Prince God 9 that's wonderful this wonderful press amen the cedarwood speaking of Christ in his humanity covered in gold is divinity amen the only way on one approach to God the king of kings are Grillin and Solomon to whom the dedication is where God places Miam God's only place of worship Jesus Christ our Lord amen it is and can I just say this because I'm going on really fast here the temple was twice the size of the tabernacle amen there were steps up to it there was a porch there was two pillars and everything in the temple was ten amen so just think of it there was ten levers of water there was ten candlesticks there was ten peoples of showbread ten the number of responsibility the number of law government and restoration what a wonderful thing praise the Lord and there were ten lovers that jesus healed and Daniel had ten toes the number of trial and revolution you'll be tried ten days the number of testing ten virgins amen five did have no oil and then the ten tolerance responsibility because she'd lost one on care of everything and not Tabernacle amen and prison Lord had talked about ten times that they counted God and numbers 14 I believe it is or Leviticus 27 is one of them add the tithe and they're not the tenth Amen that we should give to God and then the lamb was sacrificed on the tenth day of the first month restoration and kin is always the son of mine ministry praise the Lord so it was built a stone and somebody was very kind to me this morning talking about when we preached about the stones of the Bible and what a stone is every stone fits in just lovely doesn't grit against the other person just slips in as a stone amen could in God's grit quarry covered in gold covered in wood and gold and it slips right under to his temple you know and I can say more but I can't amen because it's very fitting the believers the body of Christ amen and praise the Lord praise the Lord Amen that we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost so that's the way that works amen the glory of the temple amen praise the Lord the cherubims and the palm trees all painted on the on the lovely doors and the holy of holies the ark the mercy seat amen the high priest and Ranaut put the king praying for it remember the dedication prayer I could go on more than an hour but him captured well I was a man and where were heap read he said Lord any man looks toward this place the place where you've sat your name please come down an answered their prayer and you know he was a good receptive in the god Jonah a man Jonah he prayed he turned toward Jerusalem you say brother George hardly to do that even the world bellies of the wheel hardly know what he's praying to Jerusalem it's very very simple if you start off here and tournament three hundred and eighty degrees circle and keep praying you'll be pointed in jerusalem somewhere a man and he said and God heard that prayer of Jonah hallelujah amen but you know something and here was the here was the visible invisible made visible and you know the Jewish thought this is a perpetual Monument hallelujah but Jesus told them he said you've made the temple your God and the temple is not your God tumblers were gored Wells the Shekinah glory the Jews couldn't accept that and believe that amen even when he warned them and warned them and then the day came where it says akka board over the heights the glory of the Lord has departed oh mama my my so prison Lord okay so I tell you what that's a sad day we never want that Amen that could happen if the Apostle Paul could say that he wants to press on and finish the course that I don't become a castaway amen how much more menu that I don't want to become a castaway I think we heard it already that we want to finish the race we want to finish it and be there amen okay no let me just go on very very quickly Christ Himself the mystery of God revealed you know nobody knew about that my when that was happening all up in the heavens you know there it was leaving millions we won't even meet but we were in God's mind and you know that's what he did he desired to have a form he knew what he was going to make gonna create and the formerly took that theophany body was Christ the logos hallelujah and just to keep it simple amen dot logos became flesh and dwelt among us amen and aren't you glad that that happened because the Bible says God's invisible as I read and Jesus said God as a spirit you must worship Him in spirit you know you can sing a song but if it doesn't come from your heart no good amen it's no good praise the Lord so there we are and you know God and not glory of that theophany amen you know Ezekiel sinem fire ferry being read down and up given has been and Daniel saw his glory and John saw his glory and as I saw as glory said I saw the Lord what did he see him not through not day what did he see him in but he saw the Lord hallelujah praise God what he was in human form anon I do not know but I tell you what he saw the Lord Amen and he saw his glory amen so praise the Lord as a son a kinsman redeemer in the form of the sovereign servant he came why because God wanted to reveal himself amen and the place where he said his name like the temple and here is saddest neum and Jesus Christ amen a greater than Solomon here amen and so the eternal mind and thought of God the invisible one took form thank God he took form and eventually born into the world that you could touch him and handle him the Word of Life associate to me I'm sure disputed amen so we know that the invisible was made it became visible by the things that we say and John said we did touch him and we handle him the word of life amen praise God said also wonderful night and that you know he wanted to do that he wanted to reveal the true God and that's why he came by the Incarnation he could see himself in the Bible because he said to the Jews he said I'm a book my father's business okay so god bless you all and finish up 9 the next 10 minutes and if I can I said well I'm a bit amen and that he made her preeminence in his church his body his bride and that he might restore the kingdom to its rightful place so the king invisible me invisible the king of kings and the Lord of lords and I am just coming up to I could say more or not but I just for times sake I will not but hallelujah that's look at us today just as we close up this section of the service Amen see nobody really knew bitter bright I mean you go Park in any any of the original they really didn't know but a bride they talk about a church you know and a New Testament God always deals with a nation Israel amen but even in the Old Testament the shadow is there we've got Rebekah and Isaac and we've got David and is five hundred wives amen I'm not must have been a stray on them amen 500 of them not 5 500 well I'll tell you what but praise God it was typology because he and says that Christ would have a many member braids hallelujah I'm not is so true and then of course Ruth and boys prison Lord what a lovely lovely type daughters they may Rutten boas and Naomi Israel and Ruth with Gentile praise God Mauri men and the kinsman redeemer you went through it all and you know it and I'm glad and I just feel the anointing of God right here and right now amen so prison Lord the reason for this is that the Bride of Christ was in the mind of God from eternity you came from that mind of God you are the predestinated seed when you believe this word amen and all you were waiting for in your life was God to show and through his word on that seed and like we all know it when it happened they find seeds in so many sparrows graves and what did they do they took some and planted them and what happened they grew imagine all four hundred years later amen and they grew or four thighs or whatever it is they grew praise the Lord so amen this Bride of Christ was just waiting for the word to be weaved over them as we said this morning and give you life amen and that's what has happened and the reason for this is because the Bride of Christ was on his mind from eternity you were in his eternal thoughts and folks really and truly Amen that limbs an eternal thing to the bride because being in that man's eternal that's why you know when you look at some of the old Nazarene you know you can be saved today and I know what the main you know John Wesley a drunk man met him one day and he said Oh mr. Wesley said I'm one of your converts he said I can see that I said you're not one of the Lord's you know it's so easy you know a person could do that but a real genuine seed when that word is weaved over them not my pets them amen they know who they are and you're not here today and tomorrow been Boxford and lost that will not happen praise God you will finish the course amen and so hallelujah because you were in eternal thoughts you were to help me you know as brother Branham said we don't often think about it but you know he just say it he said that God was alone with of thoughts God was alone with his thoughts you know and here was Adam and you know God turned around and he says it's not good that Adam should be alone but he was alone I said but it's not good tadhana was alone and he made out of his red he merely praise the Lord well I'll tell you what folks I've got good news he's not alone I because he's got his brain he's got his grave hallelujah hey man brother Donny amen he's got his bride and thank God he's not alone and where he goes he'll go where he said she'll sit praise God yes she absolutely will amen and you know that you know when did it come on praise the Lord the jury's never seen it coming but on the day of Pentecost a bride was born that church first churches was born amen and then in our day the bride for our day amen come forth this brother Branham amen started to preach well you can say it whenever he just says about an Ohio River in 1933 you go back as far as you want when the purifier are formed but the whole thing then was a change of dispensation and it was going to end up what I call you bright that's who you are if you want your identification there it is you believe this you are bright amen so she materialized from being invisible before the day of Pentecost was just a handful of a handful of disciples amen and praise the Lord I I was heard someone a brother speaking I never December Samuel you know Jesus sent 70-minute and they saw the miracles they saw it all they come back rejoicing even the spirits are subject unto us and the brother was saying was that the same seven-day that when he said except to eat my blood my flesh and drink my blood and they said oh that's a hard scene I mean we saw American Sparky and Enola but that's a hard scene Jews don't drink blood you know and you see what I said this morning they were putting a carnal interpretation on a spiritual revelation you can't do it folks you got to get this first a revelation of amen so prison Ord amen and here she was made visible there's a pride today amen and you can clearly seen it wasn't visible in the mind of God you were there and now we're here on this earth as his bride amen and the invisible has been made visible we're here praise God and I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed or not I'm not ashamed of brother Branham Amen I'm not I'm not ashamed of the gospel I don't care people can laugh the whole way during the road and the donee voltaren I don't care amen I am not ashamed of the gospel we read it all right I'm not ashamed of the message and I'm certainly not ashamed of brother Branham never hallelujah never will be no I praise the Lord and so it's a masterpiece in every aspect amen praise the Lord that alacrity coming into plain view amen missus Jesus Christ voila you know not years that's a mouthful yeah mrs. Jesus Christ I think you really think you are yes for this praise God that cuz that's who we are amen that's what this word has done for us amen he showed us here we are the bride has made herself ready the word the word bride Muellers already with the word dressed in the Word of God and that's what he said brother Branham said I came to dress the bride well he's donut hallelujah and we're so thankful for that amen not just as I as I do come up to finish here amen praise the Lord so the Bride of Christ manifesting his eternal deity and attributes cleansed by his blood sanctified set apart for service and filled with His Holy Spirit set terrain to rule with him what a day that will be and you know that Paul says to the Corinthians you know you were all kinds of people all kinds of sinners amen but he says I wish to present you as a chaste virgin to Jesus Christ know even being reasonable people you name me one man that would be worthy in the century to present this bride to Jesus Christ there's only one knot though that's the alleged himself amen that's melaka for himself that's the messenger to our day I knew we believe it folks but after somebody else that thinks of the messenger how could they ever fulfill what it says in the scripture but not messenger what he would do amen praise the Lord and what he has done so thank God for that today 9 just as am i finished with this I want to just finish up a quarter to us roughly when I started no but prison or there's something else that never came into view the new heaven and the new earth it was invisible nobody you with that praise the Lord but you know it was invisible from the creation the prophets some of them had an idea there was something you know Ibrahim I don't know who told him maybe Melchizedek I don't know who told them but I'll tell you one thing somebody told him praise God for he knew there was a city he knew there was a city it was invisible because he didn't see it but you don't see it's invisible not right amen and he searched for it brother Branham said he searched for the scripture said he searched for it hallelujah but he never find it sad right do we look for it everywhere in every hell held band maybe it's here but it wasn't there brother Brown said it was just above his head Amen that's what he said see but all aren't you glad today that John saw dot said a prayers God and it was a reality amen not just something that was invisible anymore but he said I John saw the New Jerusalem come down like a bride adorned for for amen ah the glory of it all and I knew we should come and dine onion aspersa cents the bride is that but in another sense the King always identified with the city or the rule that he had and he identified himself with that and so that's why it says the bride adorned like that amen and so he said John saw the heavenly Jerusalem descend onto the earth amen it was made visible thank God praise the Lord there is going to be a city and it's going to be 1,500 miles long my I tell you as you can't spiritual age at all folks no matter what way you do at amen I'll tell you what there's going to be amen a wonderful throne there the alarm will ever be the light there amen The Tree of Life will be there the river of God will be there amen my those lovely boulevards and the trees I'm brother Branham said even then he said if you ever want to have a you know a meeting with me amen he said you come one day with the angels are singing and go right down the little seal he said you'll find me there so I'm looking for that one day to find that little trail and go down and savor Branum I'm brother George Amen praise God hallelujah amen but all what will it be when we see Jesus what will it baby was and you know something folks I wish I could have time but again I wouldn't say its controversial but you know last year when I was open Mackay's well I've been preaching here oneness that God wants us to be worn with him and character and everything you know knits or everything and I was up there and I had a dream and I woke up one morning but 6 o'clock and you know it said you've been preaching about oneness what about the seventh dimension and well I tell you what I have some thoughts in the seventh dimension and I believe with all my heart will attend that seventh dimension you say well hardly how can you say that because jesus said our Father which art in heaven amen well of God's in the seventh dimension then that's what heaven is amen and you know the sixth dimension brother Branham says oh I want to see him he says he's a little higher only one lamp seventh that's where Jesus is right nine or seven dimension so praise God but yet above when he appeared his disciples he came back return and they touched him on the hundred so can we move from one to the other or whatever not I'm not all I sure about all these things but I'll tell you what I believe there's a great future for this bride hallelujah amen so thank God for that the tree of life blooming it's going to be wonderful six and things made visible and what a day that would be when we wind up millennium when going to that New Jerusalem a man in the city with alarm is the light and I believe with all my heart and I listen you know when Jesus appeared to his disciples not one of them fell down at his feet he made them bread and on the fire and fish I'm every can be appeared in the upper room nobody fell dead but when he was in his glory and not 7 I'm John psalm John fell at his feet as dead so that's the way it is but here's what I want to say in closing and I'm in it with all my heart you know one day I believe that you will see Jesus Christ face to face and you know who's it gonna be thank you brother Samuel and who's it gonna be is it just going to be a group no it'll be you and the Lord and the vigil I brought a weird you'll walk with them and you'll talk with a man right here amen together hallelujah he's not going to be sitting on the throne and all that glory but you'd fall at his feet no he'll be there just like he was because you'll come into where you are at and you'll walk with you and he'll talk with you what a day that will be what a day that will be - common folks praise God because we know all the scripture and you know something the scripture cannot be broken so that's what it's going to happen brother Jerry that's gonna happen god bless you today it's time for the communion god bless you partake of it amen that's our new covenant that is it really before the Lord and I'm glad to be here today to do it with you and God bless you I hope that's bless you this afternoon today it's just been a blessing to you and that is my desire above all things this is the most important to me is to be with you I'm with the word and share it together and whatever praise the Lord brother Samuel said to me oh brother George you know the Lord spoke to me during the night I've got something to say that search I just said here beside with that's what you think I wouldn't I would I let him speak speak whatever's on his heart say so god bless you it's been a joy thank you for for all that you do for me for all your prayers mostly amen because God hears on the answers prayer and I've been a recipient of that I believe that you know so god bless you / Samuel please take over because of the time and God bless you and thank you amen praise God because God makes you brother Samuel yeah we love you too can you say Amen let's give our brother good a why we believe it we believe it true it is true so that's that's the way it goes and it comes down to the end and you're going to understand all things I believe that the Lord is unbold unveiling his word unto us and it won't be invisible anymore because the invisible is made visible where we can see it right here we don't have to wait we get dark no it's going to be right here because according to my understanding I thought we meet him in there so we do is when I have to become visible the Prophet sit among us MA and raise the dead okay we go in the rapture that's a wonderful thing to look forward to in infancy to know and to know assuredly that all is well done amen before we come to the communion anybody have anything they need to get rid of and everything's and I'd say do that now you know finish that part up and I just want to say this I believe some of you are setting our texting while the service is going on it happened this morning it happened - seeing it now I've asked you not to do it you say yeah but Rowan's also have asked you to turn off your phone well I can't turn 1830 mine I'll call my mom and my dad you mean God I don't know all about things and it could be then very easy could if somebody did you you can just - okay that's all you got to do but this morning it done it it bothered me you said what you can't even hear Brazil that's what I'm telling you it's even that's been very prevalent throughout the service don't do that don't have your mind on everything else you're supposed to be on the Lord you can take care of you texting and your talking and everything later you'd say well these kids I don't think it was a kid because the Lord wouldn't speak to me about it I think it's somebody else well I had to do this and I do that you make your own excuses just remember you will answer for your doing and your excuses won't be any good because like I said it now line language always been straight if somebody text you and said call me say later and that's it you don't have to make contact you just and you're finished with it so okay now I've warned you even though that's just a point because I know some of you set in text and do things while the service is going on so I'm telling you don't do it so as we go into the communion then we come to the place it is a marvelous position a situation that we're able while we're here to participate in something that will actually as it's taking place now here in this world that we get to do this because ordained to the Lord but you know what when we leave here so we're going to take communion that is actually related to the world physically we will take it and then when we go into glory the first thing we get it's a marriage supper is the communion that's how much the two worlds is tied by the blood of Jesus Christ so let's just have a moment spur and this praise that the Lord would you know take care of everything and then we'll just have the one with silent prayers we always try to and then we'll go in through the communion okay just cleanse us all through your blood Lord make us to be worthy of all things just make us to be worth it we can actually protect the communion and to no one realize that our Lord has ordained this as I said for us to do in this world and there will be a marvelous thing that when we get there we can take it again in order to be a great time there what a great time at this time have your way with all of us that we may all be together do in Jesus name Paul in first corinthians says prior received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you but the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when it shook saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged well that's that's a good statement a good though but when we don't do it this is what I like but when we argue that in other words we don't straighten it up but God has to move on the scene but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world what if he didn't chasing us where would it be all right wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come out together in the condemnation and the rest what I said in order when I come father we thank you that this read has been made for this purpose today this purpose only as for us to be able to protect we know it's not your body we know it represents you how much more would it be Lord it will never be your body because when we get dire and we eat the communion we would take of it with you in glory you'll simply are with us on it but they'll still be telling us what you think of this because this to us means one thing you said it to the disciples this is the New Testament in my blood so then what else would we need and the Word of God to be brought unto us and in the spirit to quicken it sanctify the bread and the protectors that we may all be together as wanting you in Jesus name what a wonderful opportunity when they'd been something to been back dire and been able to take the communion with him you know but what about now as rather brother was bringing the message I thought we believe that he's now crossing us I didn't think it was absolute hell I thought it was in us amen now in us that he lives well and we are his tabernacle we are that holy of Holy's that spoke of back garden all the things happen all that was speaking of that new work that would come into our soul to give us eternal life this is a to make and forth of that into manifestation we thank the Lord for truth aid we know that it's not the blood yet it speaks of it but what about a type of shadow to speak a wonderful time in Amen Lord Jesus we thank you for this wine has been made for this purpose today that purpose is Lord for us to be able to just take a little piece of bread and follow the example that you gave us a little wine to drink to understand the hour that we live and you would quicken the word and to us will give us life yes we love you and we thank you sanctify the bridge they provide a wine sanctify the protector and we may all be together as one in you in Jesus noises come morning I walk by the river arrest me the evergreen free I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning DARS glory for me sometimes I despised and rejected and I questioned Oh father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I walk by the river I'll rest me the other green cream I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me things are moving so fast around the world on coming to a close and brother branham say that what that I got to back up wait on this other to catch up well I think it's catching up pretty good you know I think the world's getting in the right place one stroke of a pen can change the whole world all today yeah just one one little stroke 1pn mark and it can close out everything the money you have in your pocket would be worth nothing because they're the ones printing it it will come to a place that you just try to print more it ain't going to help much but then to go then that is the end of all things what a wonderful time the greatest day of all the world oh we were talking yesterday but the greatest day of all the world is here now to know that the end is here everything in the Bible speaks of this day you say if I could have just been back there I want to be here too and greatest of all days I want to be here to see it finished a man let's protect together you can be seated for a moment too we come to the get through I'll read the scriptures in John and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he rises from suffering laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then coming he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto Him Lord that I wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what I do die no it's not now but I shall know hereafter Peter saith unto him I shall never wash my feet jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou it's no part with me Simon Peter said unto Him Lord not my feet only also my hands in the head jesus said them to him is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but it's clean every wit and your are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him darfur said he you're in our all clean so after he had washed her feet and taken his garments and were sat down again he said unto them no you would have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for sure I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet I haven't given you an example that usually do is I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord either he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's just stand and be dismissed from here the sister is going down stars for the foot-washing in this then he'll tell brother Quinn how much you appreciate it you appreciate the message he's brought today we're in Georgia and I've said just begin weird that I believe that the Lord was going to send us ministers to try to lift us up into the hour that we're living and I believe that's what's taking place so you know tell these brothers and saying how much you appreciate them huh but then remember pray and one for another member brother Len Len will be with us this coming Wednesday and then brother Brady from Jamaica will be with us on this coming Sunday some of these and father we thank you for this day and the opportunity thank you for the time that we could just sit down and listen to somebody else talk about you and Lord to realize he's talking about the same one we know in our heart that way then we can follow what somebody's saying when they're talking about you we love you and we thank you and we just pray you'd bless us now as we go on to the part of the foot washing and then when all is finished take care of everybody on the way home give us a safe journey of you with all of those traveling and things Lord and just help each
