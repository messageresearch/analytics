name thank you amen Revelations 1 and then we'll go to Ephesians and I turn to see the voice that spake with me in being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PPS with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame as of were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters now let's go over to Ephesians to just use this scripture today in what we're thinking on we'll read uh 1-4 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus now remember this is to the Saints in Ephesus but it means to the Saints the bride of Christ all the way through right so this is speaking to us Grace be to you and be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and Father father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be ho and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath B abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of of promise now notice what it said you were sealed with that it this doesn't say see we quote it a lot of times sealed with the Holy Spirit but look at the emphasis we sealed with that I put a big circle around mine a long time ago and wrote New Birth okay and uh uh the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of The purchas Possession unto the praise of his glory you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now one more scripture to as we hope we'll get to it as Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption all right now we have been speaking for quite a while on the new birth and I want to continue on this and if it gets kind of boring take you a vacation come back in a couple of weeks and pick up and we'll go on you know whatever is doing it's not a joke you know I'm just saying that we will still be on this for quite a while because I want to make sure you understand what I'm saying whether you believe it or not that's between you and God I cannot reveal anything all right and and even Jesus said my own life didn't reveal it so then we're going to have to depend on the holy spirit so if you don't have the Holy Spirit as the new birth then you don't have an inside teacher and if you don't have the inside teacher how can you know anything because we'll get to that eventually in the message today I hope that there's no way you can understand Jesus being the Christ except it be by the New Birth by the Born Again experience you're just saying what somebody else says all right but now what have we been dealing with now we've been talking about the New Birth all right and we've been dealing with the one thing that I believe and wholeheartedly have for you know ever since I saw it in the message and we came in message quite a while ago and uh I believe that the new birth is the birth of the word amen all right now but I say to you because I know what our thinking is in our minds when you say New Birth born again um whatever the terminologies you're going to be used on that and you ask the people cuz I originally put the title uh like this but I changed it but I put the title what do you call the New Birth what do you think about the new birth all right what is the new birth see and you ask people say what is the new birth and they'll automatically tell you something they done right I mean it it'll come as an automatic process this what do you believe the new birth is and it'll just be I shouted I spoke in tongues I cried I done that is not the new birth am if you don't get nothing out of the message please get that into your mind and thinking that's like a baby it don't you can't hear the baby cry until it comes from the mother's wound and life comes within the body the baby coming is supposed to be the birth all right and so we're looking at the things that we call the attributes crying shouting speaking I believe in every bit of that see that's where when you start laying down hard on something people are he don't believe in that well all right I can't determine what you believe I can just keep saying I believe it I believe in all kind of signs and wonders and manifestations of the Holy Spirit and I I do not believe that and I'm going to say it the way that I mean it I believe every person in the world that has had the New Birth has had the same new birth right am now I want you to show me where that would be wrong right see now don't jump back in Luther them because we'll get to it this evening and something but don't jump back there and start trying to make them have a little bit and that's a whole lot that justification was the new birth right of their day are they're not in the body of Christ so now you're the one taking them out it's not me in in trying to express it to you but see every person because every baby that's born natural L now now we're in the day of you know the cians of this you know and all but every baby that is natural born baby is born the same way may be in a pink decorated hospital as the prophet said or maybe on a you know a lot of times now babies are born on airplanes they're born on trains or they're born on in you know ships and and everything all kind of things as places as it's been but yet it's still the same birth it's still what water breaks blood comes the baby comes you know I mean they tried to scientifically make everything to be so great but you just can't bypass none of them things right because they're going to be there right so then why don't you think about everybody that ever received a new birth is like everybody that received a natural birth normal natural birth they're born the same right right all right see then that way you can get down to something that would should make it easier for you to understand because you're not dealing with 969 plus 2,000 in the message of different ideas about what the new birth is remember we took that a few weeks ago how can the New Birth be according to to thousands of interpretations no see that's where it's messed up at right that's where the people don't believe it correctly according to the Bible they don't believe it's the birth of the word well if it's not the birth of the word what is it well I shouted I cried see but you put the things of of what the baby does when it gets here no just get the baby here you know then whatever it is then you can say well the day I receive the Holy Ghost I shout it well I'll agree with you then you said the day I received the new birth I I just cried I I I I just had this weeping feeling or I just sat there with a sweetness about me and I'll agree with every one one of them as being outward manifestations of something that has taken place inside of you then we'll go along and we all have the new birth in the right order what is this so much trouble about the new birth I don't understand that I never have I don't I don't get it well you're just too stubborn to agree with this about well that may be true just pray for me all right but you come and show me anything different than it being the birth of the word because I thought we read the other day we talking about where Jesus said in the parable what so went forth to S and etc etc and he said he SED the seed and he said and in the bible let think where was it in Luke 6 and 11 you know where we were at the other day and it says the the seed is the word of God well I didn't know of God having anything other than a word the seed being his word amen now if you got anything else on that I'd like to know about it but I I can't find that anywhere because that way it would keep everything straight all right but you see what did the prophet say that we gave we'll get to it in a minute what did he say he said they deny the birth of the word right well when you deny the birth of the word you're going to go through your own ideas so all right listen when I say new birth I cried well all right but that's the after effects that's not the birth that's the after effect see we spent all of those times now Pentecostal people did especially cuz us old Baptist and things we didn't think much about it but some of you Pentecostal and things you know you know how long it took to get out of you what the prophet had to bring that we every body wanted to read the Bible there in the book of Acts and and they had everybody speaking in tongues until your Prophet made the statement I didn't he said if you say you receive the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues he said you're contrary to the word right that's right I didn't say that are you offended at me because that the prophet said it see I thought we believe the prophet was the one to tell us what these were and I thought the first doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ was what you must be born again I thought then when it come to The Parables you remember where we read it the other day if you don't understand the parable of the sewing of the seed you can't understand the rest of the Parables amen why because the parable of showing in the seed is the new birth so if you can't understand being born again you can't understand the rest of the parables in the Bible oh but brother Dale I can read them that don't Mount to a hell of beans that's right that don't mean a thing right if you're going to make it on a basis you can read it what are you going to do with somebody that can't read I'm sorry I put those things in a lot of times they try to get us away from thinking our old natural ways but it's true isn't it like my wife was talking to my my brother-in-law about it and he believes in tongues of evidence she said what about the person that can't speak right well you know he hadn't said another word to her since then about it but did it change him and did he come to the truth I'm not saying he won't I'm saying he didn't change a thing well because he still believes it you know why cuz his church teaches it right right right you see church we don't realize what we're holding on to in our our our ideas and ways from a childhood up no wonder the Catholic Church will say give me a child until it's like five or seven years old so you can have it the rest of your life and you'll never convert it I don't agree with them I do 99.9% of the that is the truth but I don't agree with them about the New Birth it will take care of that and the others is just a switching over from one doctor to another one right I mean you come out and be a Baptist and you still got the father Son and Holy Ghost what have you what have you changed you know right all right but look see see I ask you what is the new birth but you'll automatically say I done this or I done that that's not the birth right amen that's the after effects of the birth amen all right now listen see what the point if I ask you what is the new birth and you first thing you pull up is something you done all right yeah now I thought the new birth was not what we done I thought it was what God done all right now if it's your shouting crying etc etc if that is your new birth then what did God do now you're out of the scriptures see well what do you mean brother Dale uh Abraham believed God it was imputed unto his righteousness amen but what did God do God gave Abraham the sign of circum cision as a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right see now you see you're not you're not staying in the word all right see if the natural birth is a type of the spiritual birth then in the natural birth the seed was planted into the wound and then it came forth the processes of doing and and all through the the nine months and then the the the water breaks the the blood comes and then the baby comes into the world and the baby comes alive all right see then the natural birth it consists of water blood and life all right so the spiritual birth consists of those things justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's right all right see all right see then it is the birth of the word or seed that was planted into your soul that the spirit of God can give life to the word that was shown in you all right now remember this point I've got it in every message and I got it colored run across there to make sure if you'll see them light ones that means I can skip them because they're not as important but when it's got the oranger looking that's one I got to express okay now watch you are not born again in your body that's right amen you are not born again in your spirit all right the new birth takes place in the soul all right so then it's justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost our new birth as being in your soul right because you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit right that only displays outwardly what has taken place in inwardly now watch in a minute where we get to that quote where the Prophet said he said see there's not too many new BS then that's right I didn't make the statement he was the one that done it but listen brother randam we gave it there the other day paragraph 44 of souls in prison we won't pull that up you know but he says it like this he said that soul is what God is working on right amen now as I went through it with a drawing so you would not have nothing to be able to argue about sure you're listening to what someone says and Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word all right now so that has to come through the outward senses see tast fi smell here see all right then there's a memory reason conscience affections Etc as to the spirit part of man and that God has to deal through those things amen because that's the way he's contacting us but he's not giving birth to your old caste field smell and here he's not giving birth to your memory reason conscious affections that's the things that have got to be cleaned out he's giving birth to the word amen that you heard and like I said now where you won't run it all but I didn't hear nobody I was I was just sitting out under a tree and the Holy Ghost fell on praise the Lord but remember you heard it from somebody if you read the Bible you heard it from somebody so don't go with that junk all right I I'm sorry I'm I I try not to be too arrogant but you know I I like what brother brandham said one day too he said if you make it soft he said they'll think you're trying to pull something over on them all right so at least you know I'm not trying to pull anything over on you you know I'm just trying my best to express what I see right amen all right and then it's up to you between you and God for to see what that is because we'll get to it the Lord willing this afternoon see you got to have your own personal experience amen my wife wonderful we're we're a husband wife but she can't her experience is not my experience she could have a genuine experience and me not have a genuine one see it's not only because you're born kin folks or somebody now watch this this afternoon when we pick up something as a little deeper thought but we will bring it out this morning and just stop and then this afternoon we'll carry it a little bit further see then justification see we believe in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost as to be the new birth Amen in the days of Martin Luther now I want to express this where you'll think about it the days of Martin Luther they taught the just shall live by faith but was that all he [Music] knowed was was that all no but it was a birth right and what was the birth of the new birth to Luther was a just shall live by faith you agree with that all right but now we got a little bit this afternoon we want to cover because remember Martin Luther was a Believer before he received justification John Wesley was a believer of Luther's message before he received the message of sanctification so we're not just playing with words we're trying to express something see in justification we read from the future home it chops off your past sins says it does nothing to your nature does nothing to you except what forgive your sins all right then sanctification is the driving out of the unclean Spirit cleansing The Vessel sanctifying it setting it aside in order to be used cleansing it it's the cleansing of the nature of your soul right sanctification is a cleansing of the nature of your soul right it's not a white wash in of the soul I still don't believe and I'm going to get on it more and more to to where we we'll we'll Hammer until we get it or you'll you'll quit coming or do something cuz I'm going to hammer it about the soul until you see it and this is 40 something years I've been doing it so it don't matter about me to take 40 more if I'm alive that long because I don't believe that most people know what a soul is Right amen I got it written in here in a minute and I'll get it if you think the soul is just the nature of the spirit you just trapped yourself you said that's what the prophet said amen but he knowed what he's talking about but if you say the soul is just the nature of the spirit there is no quote for it first to say the soul is just the nature of the spirit it's the soul is the nature of the spirit you added the word just to it the two Soul people did years ago and it's become a Doctrine all right but I want you to think about this if you think it's just the nature of something that that's what your soul is then what's the nature of uhoh we just made another step somewhere do do you understand what I mean if you say it's just the nature then what is it the nature of meaning whatever it is is more real than just the nature you agree think of that we'll drop back in a minute on it see so sanctification is a cleansing of the the nature of the Soul now remember how we tried to express and we'll say this a little bit about it when you started is a baby just a baby in the Cradle first thing you do the eyes you don't even know about it and all like that but it's still all in all that mechanical parts we call brains and things and uh the poor little baby starts out and the nurse is cussing and the doctor's cussing and they're rip snorting and running all over the place and all kind of things going on poor little thing starts off that way right and all of his life that little fell is being a nature is being molded within the in that little baby and that nature is what your soul is all of its life that little nature is molding within it why can't you see that as being the soul [Music] then in the sanctification see all of your life you've been raised and trained and done and taught and you go to school and and you get into the schools and what are they teaching now Heaven helped the poor kids you know what's being taught even by the schools of the systems and things you know and then even you say well well that's why I homeschool well you still take the material you got to take the material for somebody to give you cuz you ain't going to get credit you ain't going to get credit to say just take it up when they get up to whatever age they get up to the top and they say I homeschool my kids well what program did you I use my own and they say you need to go back and start over right no am I true you do the best you can choosing them but they're still going to have their slant and their idea until the child has no hopes we see sanctification then doesn't drive the soul out it drives out the nature of the Soul if the soul went out remember we gave the quotes the prophet said you're a tri being and he said without any of these you're not a being right right do you remember that see you say well my old soul went out go back and check the tapes and the things check the quote from your prophet and watch him being referring to the second realm which is the spirit real all right see the nature of the soul the prophet says on page 36 souls in prison he says the the nature of your soul is God if you're born again look at the very expression now bring it back down to where we just read the whole thing this is paragraph 36 souls in prison now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the souls and the soul is something that's the the nature of the spirit amen that's right because it displays from inside out whether you're saved or lost it's coming from the inside out okay now what the nature and then when the nature of man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us we are dead and our lives are HID in God through Christ sealed are by the Holy Spirit now it wasn't your body died it wasn't your spirit died you talking about the new birth right it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul now did the soul die he just explained that the body didn't die he's just explained that the spirit didn't die well is is the soul that dies well it looks like it is well then you got a lot of problems with other things so you're not seeing the real you of what it is the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world all right so now it's not the body that dies it's not the spirit that dies it's not the soul that dies it's the nature of that soul that must die in the new birth and to be made alive with the nature of Christ okay all right then see now what is a soul we gave it when you must be born again you are a soul the part that's inside of you your soul now remember I go through it a lot I keep saying it it doesn't say the body that sinth and the spirit that sinth it says the soul that sinth it shall die so then the Soul is more real than any of other yet we like to look at the body we even talk about the spirit but we even consider the soul fact of being more real than the rest of us you know as far as Body Spirit and remember it's the soul that's made in the image of God not the body and spirit all right what do we be We Believe then see it was the nature of your spirit that died whatever was motivating that in the directions that was going that part has to die all right whatever is motivating the soul and may I go back to the quote I said a moment ago if you think that the soul is just the nature of the spirit then all right that means the spirit's more real than the soul so now you trapped your own self because something else has got to be motivating it for it to have a nature right so we better get down to the center part of us and start from there in the new birth right and then we don't have to worry about the anointings we don't have to worry about all of the I cried I die you'll find out what the New Birth really is all right and here's that one I got the question I wrote a question see we think the soul is just the nature of something all right then what is the something that has the nature say that again see we think that the soul is just the nature of something it's the nature of the spirit it's just well all right what is the something that is the nature what's causing the soul to be what it is that's right right see you trap your own self by trying to think out things instead of listening to the prophet the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world that solves a problem we there either one or the other there's not a gray area in this new birth that's right all right so either one or the other it's either what did he say faith or doubt he said it's either God or the devil right all right so now the soul see truly it does have enough nature because that's what I was talking about the soul of that baby when it was born into the world the nature started being molded into what it is today and whatever you let it be molded in them just remember well I I can't do nothing with my kids because you know they they're they're they want their own nature well until they get up so far then mine always wanted my nature and it had a little Hickory on the end of it that made sure they got the idea correctly of what the nature was wanted don't you want your kids to do right does that solve the problems of what we are but yet we say let them go let them go no you don't let a child go uh-uh now you can think all you want to you can say brother Dale's wrong there I don't have to argue no point with it cuz you're going to find out when the nature of that child comes out down the road and pulls a gun on you and say I'm going to blow your head off if you don't give me some money you're right then going to think boy I wish I'd have whipped you when you was little right and don't believe in in you know child abuse no way no way I do believe what the Bible says the Bible says beat a child it won't die Spire the rod spoil the child I never have understood how that little Hickory down on that bottom made that head think different but it did it might not have converted the child but the child didn't act like that around you right right you got the attention all right now but watch now see then we used them last week we've used them a couple of times where brother randam said it like this on you must be born again paragraph 129 61231 false prophets brings what false birth true prophets bring the word the birth of the word Christ now I believe brother random tried to bring us the birth of the word don't you now you ain't got to the point yet what I'm getting at but that's all right we just move along a little bit and we'll get it one of these days and then you'll say wait a minute that's what he's been talking about all right we went to the spoken words Original Seed paragraph 151 he said the birth of the word is Christ all right paragraph 76 and 77 of birth pains they have that one you can pull it up is number four because we got a number that goes with it but he says that's why there's not too many rather genuine new births let's read that we know the old seed is must before the new seed can come out of the old seed it must rot absolutely not die only but rot after it's dead we know that to be true that's the same thing in the New Birth we never go back but we go forward when you're born again and that's why I think today we have so many now watch him not so many rather genuine new births why is because the seed is maybe will sympathize with the word or the person but they don't ride away from the old system that they were in they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system watch and claim the new birth are the message of the age and we'll get back to that little quote in a deeper meaning uh we found that under Luther west of Pentecost and all the other ages they still try to hold on to the old system and claim this but the old system age must die right in order to bring forth the new one they still want to cllean right all right what did he go on as we were given last Sunday as a seed's not air with a shu paragraph 144 they deny the birth of the word now truly we can see that the denominations want their part and the things to hold to their doctrines and their ideas and their situations and whatever but they're going to hold on to that idea and they won't rot away to their own ideas and thereby they're not getting the birth of the word well are you saying them people's not saved I don't say nobody's not saved that's right I've never said that I don't even say the pope of Rome's not saved that's between him and God he wouldn't do no good for me to say he wasn't saved or he was either way it wouldn't change him right so then don't get that idea amen well you think you're the only one got the new birth I'm the only one that I know's got it right right that's right now you better deal with yourself that's right because if not you're saying what somebody else says right come on you can say brother brandham had it I agree with you I believe that but that don't save me right that's right that's saying what somebody else says and that won't save you that's right you got to have your own experience all right see then If you deny the word any part of the word how can you how the birth of the word that a simple question well brother de agree with everything in the word except one thing well no God can't give you a new birth right now if you change that around in a way of saying you mean we got to have know all about the word I didn't say that I said if you say I agree with all the word except one thing you said it I didn't if you say I don't understand all of the word God can give you the birth of what you do understand right in the days of Martin Luther we talk about it trinitarian sitting in a pub drinking beer smoking a pipe well God gave him the new birth right amen you know what his new birth was not the seals not the plagues the vials of trumpets right what was the new birth to Luther the just shall live by faith amen right yes all right see there's something wrong with the planting of the seed is where the trouble's at that was the parable even if planted correctly in The Parables you would come out with the people deciding that you know the cares of Life the this out of the other not understanding or doing a thing something took them away from the real understanding that is even the genuine planning of the word of God don't you believe the disciples that God planted the word in them pure and unadulterated come on that's right we'll get to it in a minute where he's seen a 500 Brethren but only 120 of them got it in the upper room right amen all right y see that's Bible all right but look Luke 8 11 says the seed is the word of God right all right now see if the seed is not planted correctly pure and [Music] unadulterated by your own doings of rejecting it and saying I don't believe that now are you listening I'm putting that the way that I'm saying it you say I don't believe that then how can you say you got the new birth right well you're trying to tell me I ain't born again hey I'm glad you finally called home what I'm talking about remember my way of saying things if I knew all I had to do was just to say one thing wait and he'd leave well you know what if I knew he's going to leave I just might as well say it to him now and let him get up walk out that's right I'm not going to back up on what I say I'm just going to leave it that way amen and say what I believe because that way then you can differ whatever you want to do with it it's up to you but see get what I'm saying how can you deny the word and it be the birth of the word that you claim you got now may I go through spoken word is Original Seed in a Flash which took Prophet 6 hours to preach it but can I sum it up in one little word or two that's why them denominations cannot accept all of the word is that summing up the spoken word original now let me bring bring it on down then the from the N the 990 of them or 69 or something how about the 2000 in the message that claimed the prophet's message now Heaven helped now for me to ever get in the pull pit and claim brother random was a prophet and I plainly can read where he says that you don't get a New Soul well let me say it correctly where to go you you how dare me say that I have the birth of the word and deny the word especially this prophet's words just like one man says after all brother around and said it's not replacement so you drop this book pick up another book but he plainly teaches and a very popular man among the message that you got to get a new body and quot spread around him more than I do now you know I don't understand that I don't understand the people of the message today that can say that Jesus wasn't God until the River Jordan and he just a man then he become God and then God left him he died a man and I don't understand that right but yet quoting brother brandham right see if the seed is not planted correctly how can you expect the Holy Spirit to do anything other than anoint the spirit of the individual that's right we agree with that don't we that it can come down and anoint your spirit and you're still lost well how come you lost come on how come the Bible said Jesus was seen of over 500 Brethren after the resurrection but yet he's only 120 my death for room well went on vacation that's a good time to take one that's pretty well like me I said okay now next Sunday I'm going to explain something and I want everybody to be Brother D I ain't going to get to make it well I wouldn't care if the world shut down right you know I wouldn't care if the world shut down and you tell me I need to be here I I'll be here you say no I know you're going to get upset when I say it but go ahead Let the dead bury the dead right I didn't say that you say you believe all the Bible I didn't say that the Bible did amen yes sir and you as a matter of fact it was the one of the god of the Bible that said it you know and says now lay down all them things let the dead bury the dead and come follow me now you know brother Dale now you you talk all you want to you do all you want to but you know one thing in the in finality where I stand I'm not saying for you not to go to funerals and go to Mamas and go to this and go to that no that's your business I'm just asking you which is the most important that's all I'm asking make you upset at me because I just ask you that question which is the most important okay see the seed is the word of God Amen if the natural seed is not planted correctly into a woman what happens you heard what you call the tube pregnancies right that can happen right the seed can actually go into the tube and actually um be fertilized and can actually start growing but it won't bring forth cuz it's not in the wound all right so in the spiritual see it must be planted correctly that's the parable now don't go into your Parable and try to straighten it all out just because it says some bring 20 some bring 40 some bring 100% or something like that you know cuz that's in the parable or don't think that that 20 is just a little part this and this no no it's not explaining the parts it's Untold you the seed because some of it according our word can only produce 20 but what word we know that's what I'm talking about of Martin Luther only he could bring forth which just shall live by faith comparing him to the day of the amount of work he'd be 20 this day would be 100 right don't get into them things and think you're so super religious you're destroying the word of God but even though the word is planted what does it take to bring forth the seed now as I say don't you believe don't you believe brother Randon planted the word here and un adulterated from all Creed right now if you don't believe it go in the spoken word read no seed and you'll find out wait a minute Brother D he didn't understand the shs then nobody didn't understand them and nobody wouldn't responsible for for so don't go garbage can with your brains to let it run he said on spoken word is original see the pure and unadulterated word had been shown which we know it was his message right and yet at that time the man believed that the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost amen that's right come on you don't think but see he was the world nobody was responsible for knowing that at that time amen just because Clarence Lin even before brother brandham said that that didn't bring it to brother brandham because God had to bring it to brother brandham it wasn't nobody else that brought it you see where we do with our own ways and thinking but even if the word is planted pure and unadulterated why does not God Quicken that in everybody's heart that heard that on the tape or was sitting there when he preached it or was there the whole Ministry of the prophet and then all at once in these life days is turning against him until they're saying he was wrong here and wrong there now you tell me the word was planted pure and unadulterated in a man's heart and he said brother brand was wrong then I I'm just going to tell you I don't believe that I mean if you do that's all right that's your business but I'm going to tell you I don't believe that that's just like taking John 3:16 say I don't believe that or take acts 238 Matthew 28:19 well I don't know which one of them's right both of them's right amen that's right that's where we was wrong but listen I'll have to continue this message this evening I know for sure but watch now see then if the natural seed is like the spiritual seed that it must be planted into the ground correctly and brother brandom emphasizes what that in the natural you get the ground ready right you don't walk out with your corn and there it is you walk out in the yard and say I'm going to have a garden right there where well I'm all them weeds I just throw the corn I throw the beans you might get some right but what did he call it I believe the word was pre-prepared ground I believe that the wording pre-prepared ground you see why it's so important to hear the word of God now you can argue all you want to but the Bible still says it how can they hear without a preacher how can he preach unless he be sent then you say I don't need no preacher to tell me what the word says then you tell me you got the new bird now you know where I'm going to back up right there that's between you and God that's right that's right but that ain't according to the Bible may I be what the Prophet said he said I'm not going to tell you you women preachers you're not called to preach right right what did he say he said but it's not according to the word see it's leaving it up to you and God but irregardless of the planning of the word irregardless of the doing it takes the moisture to Quicken the seed right mhm we planted on I think it was Good Friday I'm not certain right along in there we planted the garden we planted some squash and cucumbers and green beans and and we got one squash and no cucumbers and probably half a dozen green beans and it had plenty of moisture cuz that's what the problem was but then we hit it just right planted it boy got pretty garden growing now just all them just growing and what I done with the beans instead of digging them up cuz I know and realize sometimes that can come on up so I went over just a little bit and just dug a hole little row and I put it green beans in there well over here where I done that lice and dug a little rad and put it in there it's this beautiful row of green beans you ever seen over on the other side the half dozen stalk see I was goofing up in what I was doing and you said what are you talking about I'm talking about how can you do it now may I quote an emphasis or emphasize a point that happened a brother one time told me he denied it later but before he died he came back and said I was right but he said I took my wife down to a Pentecostal Church to get her free in the Lord where she could get the Holy Ghost I said now brother I I'm going to tell you one thing you tell me that a Pentecostal can get the Holy Ghost on you better than somebody in the word of God that knows what the new birth is boy did he get upset with me and later he called me everything in the book and denied that he ever said it I said that's all right that's between you and the Lord you can say all you want to you told me well before he died he come back and told me he said you're was right now do you understand what I mean what was he trying to get his wife to do uh sister Gail can I use you she went one time to a place for healing and got in the line for healing and some way somehow she wound up over in the other line and she was going through for the Holy Ghost line you know all right well that's fine that's all right no problem but it just don't fit when you analyze everything correctly it doesn't match up I will even tell you an incident in the Bible that happened there's an incident in is it in the book of Acts yeah I'm sure but they had tried to get the Holy Ghost to come on those people right you remember and the Holy Ghost wouldn't come on them now in the Bible they called for who was it James and John if I get those wrong you put the one in there supposed to be but they called for the other disciples to come down and they came down and you know it doesn't say they said a whole lot and done a whole lot but all at once the Holy Ghost came on them people well you know what they must have been something wrong somewhere and that was even the disciples in doing that would you see Church irregardless of the best that can be done by any Minister brother brandham the Lord Jesus anyone else all you can do is plant the seed amen right there is no way Jesus said my own life didn't reveal that right now here's the one you don't people don't want to hear and we'll get to it this evening but I've used it before to you brother brandham said you can't be saved without a revelation now you see why I asked the question I turned it to a later that I'll use this evening so we'll go ahead and use that this morning brother Joe who's there other one go ahead and use the title you know because we'll use the other title this evening so this title will be what do you call the new birth and then we'll get on the title this afternoon all right but now irregardless of what you do you've got to have the anointing ing of the spirit of God to Quicken the word right in the natural you've got to have that's why that seed laid in the tombs over there in Egypt for thousands of years it looked like there had been enough moisture to done but evidently it's so sealed up there wasn't nothing because that's the only way I can express it because it looked like there had been enough dness but there wasn't but they took that seed took it out put it in the ground where the dness was you know what it brought seed for wheat right and see irregardless of the best way you can do of sewing the seed it's going to take the Holy Spirit to Quicken that seed that's right it's going to take the natural moisture to Quicken the seed for it to come alive it's going to take the spiritual Holy Ghost word of I mean God to come upon the word to make it alive that's righten to the best we can can do to plant the word you see I can stand here and say it to you and without backing up a a word off of it I've tried for 40 something years to explain this to you maybe it's me that ain't got it planted just right but I've tried I've done the best I could do that way I've tried I've cried I've prayed and done a lot of things to try to get to the right place to say it and I know and realize it I don't but yet I keep saying it until one of these days it'll click because I've always since I heard the prophet and saw what he's talking about that's reason I told you when when I heard him I knew I didn't have the new birth I ain't all of these people that come into the message and said that I come in the message so I know I had the Holy Ghost I spoke in tongues back in Pentecost and I thought that was it but now I know for sure cuz I believe the message but I still don't agree with brother random here I think he's wrong over here I think he's wrong now don't tell me you got the new birth I'm sorry forget it I tried to explain something one time to a brother and he left here because he said you saying I'm not born again I never said he wasn't born again I said if if you act like that and do those things don't tell me you're born again right right right I mean you want to go down to The Honky Tonks today and you got the strip teas who gets up and does a strip teas act in front of all the men and then sits down and talks to them about the Lord Jesus and trying to get them saved now I'm sorry I'm too old that's right and I didn't believe that when I was 20 all right so you got to have the moisture to have the spiritual birth you've got to have the moisture no matter how great it was planted right cuz you got to agree the disciples for three and a half years the word was planted in them right right you got to agree they went through justification of believing on Jesus Christ and who he was you got to agree that they went through sanctification St John 17 sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is true they went through those things right but they never received the new birth until Christ finished the process so what did they need well all they needed was the promise of God okay we'll drop back over I believe it's in John where it said Jesus looked at him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost and breathed on them that was always confusing right until the prophet explained it that's right but all it took was a simple explanation he said they didn't get the Holy Ghost right then cuz Jesus Christ hadn't died he said but they got the promise right of the Holy Ghost ghost y even his death and their resurrection and them seeing him never Quicken none of that no that's right even in the book of Acts two I'm sure it's two times I know it is with the with the two going on the road to EMAs and I'm sure it is with the disciples it says and he opened their understanding of the scriptures right that's it right that looks like a pretty good birth but according to the Bible it didn't work and to show you that it didn't work over in Acts one after the resurrection they see me fixing into sin they said you're going to restore the kingdom to Israel at this time they still never had their eyes on the right or understanding but why did those disciples need of three and a half years of hearing the pure unadulterated word I think we've been around 40 years long enough don't you don't you think most of us has been around about 40 years in the message I'm looking at a few that would raise their hand and say it's over 40 years amen well I think it's about time maybe the moisture ought to be hitting somewhere amen right so will ended up by saying what then when the word is planted in you the gospel then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word that's right so if you get anything I want you to show me if anywhere I want you to show me anywhere in the Bible or give me a quote from Brother brandham of anywhere that the holy ghost ever come on anybody that didn't hear the word first right amen they heard the word first there's no need talking about moisture that would be the dumbest idea you could think of excuse me but that'd be like me saying boy I got a beautiful garden planted well where's you seat they're still sitting in the house God I didn't put them in the ground I just dug the holes and put the fertilizer and covered them back up boy that's smart ain't it what do you think about the new bir I shouted I CED I spoke in Tong what about the moisture right God don't you ever get no idea in your mind that brother Dale don't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I sat and watched the video from the evening service and I cried I said God don't let them people ever get that idea that I would think that the Holy Ghost didn't come in as a birth but because I try to explain the mechanical part or the doings of what it is then you'll say brother Dale don't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I just don't believe in your idea of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't believe my old idea of the baptism of the Holy Ghost see for one time in life I can bring down and at least think about the things where the brother Brown said it's God and you together and there as persons now you can't explain that I would like for you to do it well there two people that's right we will get to it this afternoon we've left the scriptures and gone to our own ideas the Holy Spirit I thought was the seal that sealed you in and him out I believe that well does it have to go in there to push it out why don't you just let it do what the scripture says you're dead and your life is hid in Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost then you can really see what the birth is and you're not denying anything let's stand come on brothers think on these things what do you think well we've done heard this y you're going to hear it some more so that's all right if you don't stay out for a couple two or three weeks you do that be okay okay cuz that's what I'll be on for the next two or three months maybe and I don't mean that wrong and sarcastic I just mean we're going to hatch this thing out enough to where that we're going to see it or we're going to forget it one now that Prophet would say the soul the real you that's who you are you mean there somebody standing inside of this body you don't deal with those things until it's necessary to move cuz I'm a unit but if death comes there is a being in this body that will step out of this body and be in a body that looks like this body younger yeah okay but it'll be a body but yet we don't believe that to be that real we don't believe that we're real that we're a supernatural element yeah that's right dwelling in a natural situation even a sinner is a supernatural element dwelling within a natural body right that's more real than we are go ahead what we got number 47 47 inpire book number 47 inpire book anybody have a need the alar open I know not why God want Grace to me do you know what the New Birth really why unworthy Christ in love redeem me before his own I know I believe and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him we send this PR agree with him that you'll work out what is is needful he's come to yield himself to it then you just do the work you let your love and manifestation be there and guide him in Jesus name or how beling in his word what about it anybody else within my heart but know I have beli and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not how the spirit moves convincing men of sin Lord Jesus our brother needs an opening of his understanding that's the best way to say it that Lord you just come down and show him you show him and he'll take care of the rest of it he's coming yielding himself to that point that he wants to walk in what you say but we believe you Lord we thank you in Jesus [Music] name all how much longer could we quote from the [Music] prophet the word that he would talk about people that's got to have some certain feelings or they don't believe they're right what are you going to do if they take a gun stick of your head and say deny that Jesus Christ and you know what they done in the dark ages a lot of them denied [Music] it but you know what a lot of them stayed with [Music] it and said we ain't got nowh else to go I know not are we at least to that place [Music] say Lord I don't know how nowh else to go been this way a long time I just going to stay with [Music] it to believe that what you are trying to do is reveal [Music] yourself that he chur to keep I said it years ago and I still believe it every doctor that I've ever heard I don't try to figured out with quotes and scriptures because you can get all tied up I go back to my new birth and say Lord that don't fit to my new birth boy bless God you putting a whole lot I'm putting everything I got on right that my soul agrees with what this word says if you think it don't come show me I believe what this word says that's all that's been ever held me for all these years to do is to believe that word and say thank you Lord that everything now come just you you take care of it and he'll do it I don't have to question it I've seen it see that but that ain't nothing to you that's to me but what about preaching 40 something years about a new birth and it ain't stopped climbing yet it ain't stopped getting greater yet what's the difference in the new birth at the bottom of the pyramid and then New Birth at the top it's all going to be a birth of the word each one of those virtues is a birth of the word all of it a birth of the word we walk out of here we can say I got the new birth CU it's the birth of the word Lord Jesus we just commit everything into your hands Believe In You Lord and believe in that you've led us and guided us to where with what we try to bring and we try to hold true to that that way we don't have to deny anything the prophet has to say about these things we can follow it don't understand it no don't claim to Lord but I claim to believe it I believe you we love you and we thank you got us now as we go eat natural meals and then bring us back together this evening that we may walk in you in Jesus name amen you just missed him after all this life over and our burdens have been lifted and we stand upon the mountain tops of [Music] looking over in that City that the savior is preparing it gives me fa that I can make it after all
