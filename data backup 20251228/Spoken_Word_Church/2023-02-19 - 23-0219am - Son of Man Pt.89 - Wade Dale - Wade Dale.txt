say it man just say man just make me happy okay just just amen let's all remember brother pageant too I know it's been announced but he is having some health issues and also the place where their church is has been sold so they're having to move by the 15th of March they have not found a place yet to have church service and um and with brother JT you know his hands messed up and then he's got a couple other issues that he's working with so we just need to really pray that they find a find a place to uh to worship over there in Jasper it's really hard to find I know some of you know this it's really hard real estate wise that they found a place to to a small place to worship is a a church guy wanted five thousand dollars a month to rent it so they couldn't even afford that you know to to rent that so let's just pray that hey we've seen Miracles we've seen things that look totally impossible and all of a sudden somebody walks and say hey you want to rent this building it's it's vacant you can have it for 300 a month or something so let's just pray that they uh they find a place to worship amen remember brother Bob will be speaking for us this coming Wednesday night brother Tim cross will be here next weekend I'll be in Ohio doing a wedding for the whole weekend there so brother Tim will be here on Sunday regular normal Services I also remember when is the shower what time middle or afternoon afternoon all right the afternoon will be a shower for Esther and Micah hey man so let's just keep that in our thoughts March the 4th we won't have Bible study this month but March the 4th we've been seeing kind of a tradition now but we're going to have a prayer service that Saturday night from seven to eight o'clock or whenever you get finished praying because the week after that brother Jack that's going to be here for the weekend for the Youth service so just remember that March the 4th instead of Bible study we're having Bible study every other month now and uh the one that in the odd months we're having a youth service so it would be something to pray about March the 4th we've we've saw that prayer has really helped these services that we've we've for those of you that's been here even though if you pray at home and pray in your own closet we pray for the services that's coming up we don't want to just make this where you just come to church and it's just like a you know a little gerbil on a wheel that's not right this is eternal life this is your soul this is your life and your soul all right also remember one other thing just keep this in your prayer April Easter weekend we will be having like we did last year we were having a good Friday Saturday and a Sunday service brother Dutch Scott's going to do Friday uh Saturday will be like a fellowship meeting at 3 30. brother Chris long will be here and brother Chris long will be here on that Sunday for Easter weekend so just keep that in your prayers and in your hearts man all mine's clear you love the Lord okay well let's just talk to him for a minute dear Lord thank you for this day that you give us father we're just we need Revelation more than anything Lord because Revelation gives us power with you Lord I pray that you would be with the ones Lord there are caught in the middle Lord there that are don't know whether to stay in the world or whether to move on with you father I pray that you would prick their heart today that you'll go way down deep where a man can't even go to that soul and you know where it's at man can't find the soul they might find a place that it's at but you know exactly where that soul is and Lord I pray that you administer to that Soul even the ones that are born again today I pray that you would Quicken what's in our heart already by the new birth father we pray that you would just be with the ones that are sick sister Freda and the different ones Lord they are not with us that are streaming in Lord we pray that you should be with them be with a little group there in Ohio Lord and coming up next weekend for the wedding I pray that you would keep them Lord not be so nervous that everything will work out just fine for your honor and glory Lord I pray that you should be with this service be with brother Aaron Big Brother Luis give them fruit for their labor Lord I Thank you so much that we have soldiers that can work out of this building Lord that can go to other places and and help out the other bride Lord the maybe the the part of the Bride that needs help Lord I pray that you would send each one of us if we need to Lord to help them Father because we're one unit we're one body when they hurt we hurt when we hurt they hurt I pray this should be with us now and further one of this service Jesus name we pray amen I also remember to keep brother uh Samuel Reyes in prayer it's okay Bojo he talks to brother Samuel and I called him the other day and uh he's been put out of his church up there in Gainesville the Hispanic Church somebody's come in and and took over and we know who it is but I'm not it's just the devil so brother Samuel's looking for a place to have church service he's looking for a building in Gainesville around here somewhere so keep him in prayer more than anything and uh and uh thank God thank god brother Dale owned this building for a long time and give it to the church and we ain't got to worry about none of that outside stuff okay that's a lot of wisdom and I appreciate that amen and sister Rebecca gave me this to to preach over today and we pray that whatever that needs to go to that the need will be met all right so here we go it's under man part 89 and we're gonna I told Brother Bob I said he's not he's not doing Sunday school no more because we're going to talk on Redemption today as a little side note all right in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and God knew we needed both of us to say something about it today and the Word was made flesh Bob primed you so now you really ought to be able to listen and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 8 verse 31 then Jesus said to the Jews who believed on him look believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth that's a promise if you're my disciple you shall know the truth and that truth will not bind you it will make you free you may be seated in the Lord and his Blessing and we're going to try today to get to temperance second Peter 1 says beside this giving all the diligence add to your faith virtue into virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance the temperance patience and the patience godliness when we get into patience we're going to be there for a little while so have patience if I have some patience okay tribulation worketh what patience so if you pull the chart up we're gonna this morning I was thinking about something last night and this morning that we've covered pretty much all we need to cover but there's some side notes that we'd like to look at as brother Bob was talking about Revelation I want to talk a little bit about Redemption before we start up the statue of perfect man just one more time everybody with me all right one more time I want to talk about it in the form of the pawn shop because if we don't get if we don't get this out of the pawn shop then you're not born again you cannot have any of these virtues Holy Ghost virtues without having Holy Ghost inside your soul all right and then we want to also look that if you get out of the pawn shop now you can get yourself back in over here but you can't get yourself back in here I'll read you the quotient in just a minute I know it's far into some but we're going to talk about the soul today because that is where I said last Sunday add to your new birth you can only add to your new birth if you got it right right if if you don't have it you can't add to it all right so you got to get to it first but there was a problem and it's called it's not a problem but it's the Plan of Redemption and I was thinking yesterday you know you look at a plan we all make plans we have plans to do this and plans to do that and they change when God makes a plan cannot change that's why I said the other day if God ever loved you in the beginning he can't not love you through your journey you may fall out of love with him but he's never going to fall out of love for you all right because he can't change his mind and say oh no I made a mistake huh Matt Bro George play a lot blue I bless his heart I I just made a mistake no God don't make a mistake he brings you right here and he gets you and he puts it right in your face and said Hey listen I've been with you on this whole journey I'm going to show you by Revelation where you're at in the body of Christ didn't know what we're all looking for we're looking for adoption we're looking for what we can do to help somebody else we're not here to bash people brother Brown said what it is Spirits we fight Paul said it's Spirits we find amen not principalities and Powers it's Spirit where in that soul and in that Spirit realm is where we have our problem I don't my problems are not the White House your problem's not the White House your problems in your house me too my problems in my house your problems in your house what brother Brown tell us he said you can't blame the pastor if you don't make it why that takes a lot off of me but you know what without a plan without a plan brother Brian said God had a plan and a purpose now watch the plan you sit down and you draw out a plan God sat down and dried the plan but he threw out a plan that didn't need an eraser when he drew it down he went this is the way it is and this is the best way you'll ever get here and it's the best way ever trial every tribulation that you go through God knew that it's the best way to get you where you're supposed to be everybody with me so we're going to get into that with a little bit of patience because what's the first thing brother Brown said have patience with not your neighbor not your pastor not your brother he said have patience with God that he'll do what he said he would do now that we don't because what the problem is is right here we're going to talk about it brother I'm in 1953. we're going to take a little side trip for just a minute but I think it's important that we see why we're struggling and why do we need to struggling fight what are we going to need miracles in the Millennium when we're supernatural beings how are we going to need these now the Bible says now are we the sons of God not now is now is a present tense now are we the sons not we will be we are now we are this morning we are this very hour now are we the sons of God what seated together as I said before when when when Paul writes that sitting you together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he says resurrected sitting in Heavenly places that's where the people got that the resurrection was over with this is a spiritual Resurrection not a natural Resurrection all right this is the spiritual resurrection that what happens there's now watch right this very minute we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you know every person sitting in here today if you're born again your soul is eternal your soul is God your soul only thanks God your soul Only Knows God your soul is God what our problem is it's so Bound by that second man not your flesh your flesh just holds all your guts and everything together but that second man in the spirit realm is our problem and we're going to get remember two places he said Satan put you in the pawn shop but then he also said Adam went and put you in the pawn shop because remember folks we we bash Eve pretty bad but listen he didn't put us in a pawn shop Adam put us in the pawn shop Adam's the one that took on as the second Adam would take on our sin he took on Eve sin everybody with me say Amen every man by one spirit will all baptize into one body become the members of this body by the Holy Baptist Holy Ghost baptism that's right here not here here now we're seated together in Heavenly places free from judgment we can never go to the judgment we were yesterday and I'm not bashing brother he only knew what he knew and Jonas and uh Sophia's um archery shoot they had a little brother stand up and he was making his point his whole point was we all got to go to judgment we all got to go to judgment we all got to go to judgment we got to do good down here but we all got to go to judgment no we don't no we don't that's what I mean one of the greatest doctrines I know of he said I ain't got to go to judgment no time do I have to go to judgment I don't want to be Catholic where I get halfway in hell purgatory and I got to be prayed out well I'm sorry it's called paid out amen pay novenas the more you got the more you get out no I want it to be on this right here that a man came and had the goods as brother Tom Fox used to say had the goods to get me out of the pawn shop now what's our problem is we can accept whether to go out or we can turn around and walk right back in the pawn shop I'll read it right here in just a second you can never go to judgment how can you be judged twice upon Christ I want somebody to be a little happy today if you don't mind I'm not a little teaching I'm gonna do a little preaching but Christ paid our Judgment at Calvary if we're in Christ we're secured in Christ listen that that Soul if you're born again it does not have bad days and good days it has all good days that Spirit Round though is like a roller coaster like the Scream Machine it's Six Flags you scream on the way down you scream on the way up and you scream when you're done if you've never been on a screen machine you ought to try it one time and realize that's your life in the spirit realm all right how do we get into Christ by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body it's what we've been talking about the New Birth we're into the body of Jesus Christ and while we're in there look we've accepted his punishment in our Stead man we've accepted his punishment in our stead he knowing no sin yet was made sin for us and then he blew our sickness he bore our sins and we came into him and we are free from these judgments somebody that's what that's for you that's and listen that's for Monday too every day it is and why somebody asked me one time long time ago said how many days your brother play golf I said every day that ends then why except on Sunday so it's every day God look God cannot just the second time God cannot justly judge me or you the second time if he's already accepted us in Christ Jesus and punished his own son for us how can he punish us then when he's already had Christ pay the price if I go down to the pawn shop I've got something I'm in some trouble so I got I I want to do I'm gonna put that in the pawn shop right and they're gonna let me borrow some money off of that but they're gonna give me a receipt they're gonna give me a receipt you keep one the person gets a receipt everybody with me I've never been to a pawn shop you'll learn something today I was in one one time don't want to go back even brother Brown said he said I don't like pawn shops that's another quote for another day if I go down to the pawn shop and I've got something that's just like the human life put us in the pawn shop so that's you that's your soul that's right devil put us in the pawn shop because of transgression which basically we did ourselves but if you've got something pawned and you go down and get that out you hand that receipt and you get that out I'm not in the pawn shop anymore I have been redeemed or the ransom has been paid for my soul now the problem is is we've got a spirit Realm and we go and we throw it right back into pawn shop Spirit realm now Spirit realm Soul can't be judged anymore but we can be judged in our spirit realm that's why there is a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body where the good or bad that's why the denominational world says we all got to go to judgment because the Bible says we all got to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ amen but that's not the major judgment that's not white Throne judgment we're going to be judged by what we're going to be judged by how much we use are not used these virtues that's why these virtues are very important you say brother why do I have to struggle because I'm if you say I'm born again do you want to have a miserable life if you don't want to have a miserable life then you start doing these things right here but now listen that's not going to make everything go away Jesus was every one of these and they hated him they hung him on a cross because he was God remember they said we don't hate you because of the Miracles we don't hate you because of signs and wonders we hate you because you're telling us you're God in human flesh they will hate you because you tell them you are God in human flesh as we read the first scripture we read but if you got something Pond and you go down and get that out of the pond you get a receipt for it you have a right to take it out so there's no need of trying to go down look if I had my watch and Pawn and you went down and took it out for me there's no need of me for going down there paying it again I can't pay it again because it's already been paid oh when I think of that something on the inside of me under this fifth rib on the left side of somebody's heart leaps higher than the skies because I know the devil had me in the pawn shop one time because of sin and transgression but Jesus Christ took me out of the pawn shop and redeemed me back to God listen God could not go into that pawn shop and get you out oh be quiet Jesus Christ had to go in the pawn shop and get you out you sure it's the same person yes it is the same person but it's another form it's another form because remember the right of redemption is is that you got to be a Kinsman so the Kinsman became the god became human flesh to be our Kinfolk then he walked in the pawn shop he said I got it right now because that's flesh in that pawn shop I am flesh but I paid the price for that go Keith come on I paid the price for that it's mine and here we go I don't know if I want to accept that or not all you got to do is accept he did it the 650 did it because I know the devil had me in the pawn shop one time because of sin and transgression but Jesus Christ took me out of the pawn shop and redeemed me back to God he didn't just redeem you back to being a human you're a human already he redeemed you back to God Almighty he redeemed you back to Elohim somebody one of these days y'all might get excited about some of this but I'm getting more excited excited excited about just the Plan of Redemption Just A Simple Plan of Redemption because if you don't get it you forget about going up through there but Jesus took me out of the pawn shop and redeemed me back to God that makes me his son this morning and it is not yet appear when I shall be in the final end but I know I'll have a body like his own glorious body for I shall be for I shall see him as he is free from sickness free from sin so your soul is out of the pawn shop your soul has been redeemed there's no way it can go back in and pay that debt a second time already why would I want to go back and pay three or four times for something that I had to put in the pawn shop let God do it for you some of y'all that are struggling let God do it for you let God say God I'm in a pawn shop even say God I know I'm redeemed but God I'm still in a pawn shop because I can't get over this virtue and get this knowledge because you know what there's a flip side to all this to have patience you got to be angry first to have virtue you got to be powerless first then God gives you virtue you got to be have the knowledge of the world remember terminology good and evil is your first knowledge then you start eating off the tree of life when you get born again so the Redemptive Act is not so hard to do just accept that he took you out of that pawn shop and put you in his shop just accept that and then we can go on my soul praise God my soul and intellect but the Bible is talking about revelation we're going to see in just a few minutes we'll get to it that Revelation is something that's previously not seen it's there though like brother Bob said about the Statue statues underneath that that that rap or that tarp but you really can't tell what it is it could be a monkey it could be an animal could be a bird it could be something sitting on a log you know kind of call like this and something sitting on the top but when it's pulled off you see it's a human right you see what's been built God shop praise God he saw you built he saw you already made he's just now he's began to pull the wraps off so that you and I can see the pull is what's going to take us out of here we're going to be shown to God one more time God's going to pull the veil off of the world's eyes and let him see me and you the real God the real place where God dwells not in a house not in a church in you God chose by the right of redemption to dwell in you because he became you that you my what become like him now become him the puzzle his pieces are fit back together you're out of the pawn shop praise God when you get out of that pawn shop there's no way there's anything being held against you no way nothing is held against you we asked her isn't that that is oh it's it's coming no it's not coming it's already here hey when you get a true revelation the things that you think I have to do will become things I want to do things I used to do I do them no more things I used to why told me he's gone the real me has been redeemed let me I don't have this I just pull this up real quick let me read this and then we'll continue on this year's 1964. brother bear said now could a righteous judge judge a man twice remember that's even in the law of the land you can't it's called double jeopardy for those of you that know anything about the law you can't be tried for a murder and be acquitted or be found not guilty and then they call you back in two weeks later so we're gonna try you for that again no it's called double jeopardy you can't do that even the law of the land proves that God done it one time and that's it right How could a righteous judge judge a man twice for anything if the penalty's already been paid if I was in the pawn shop and you came by and said I'm going to redeem him and you went in and paid the price for my Redemption that's my penalty of being in the pawn shop you pay my Redemption then how can the pawn broker the devil claim you again you'll get a life when he comes to this guy unless I sold out again there you are when I reject listen when I rejected the fullness of the word I go right back in the pawn shop fullness of the word I go right back in the pawn shop again then fight my way out if I can he said but he redeemed me I hope that I just got so many here I want to get in other words he's trying to get to the people to write of redemption so let's add to that let's add to your new birth let's add to what I just let's add to that you're out you're free right you're out of the pawn shop you never have to go back in unless you want to go back in now you can't lose your salvation but you can go back in and not go up their statue of perfect man can't lose your salvation can't lose your soul but now we're talking about a spirit realm we're talking about the the mental guy the spirit realm and we'll look at that this afternoon I think I got a couple quotes on that if I get to them that Spirit realm is is like the soul but it's not exactly because remember anointed ones at the end time can be black in their soul but their Spirit be anointed by this Holy Ghost I'm talking about but what they did was they didn't come out of the pawn shop they just got washed up a little bit and said I'm just fine right here I'm good they didn't accept what you and I have accepted if you're born again they didn't accept that so they stayed in there but remember they stayed bound you and I when we come out we're free praise the Lord add to your new birth or Minister that word ad means Minister Minister nourishment what are we getting today we're getting nourished when somebody's telling you you're free somebody's telling you don't have to go back in the pawn shop you don't have accept that box of snake right but what do we do we do anyway we're trying our best though to shave all that off to where we can have power or virtue with God we can have the not listen if you don't have the knowledge of God the knowledge of this world is foolishness to the knowledge of God foolishness that's why they when the very knowledge of God stood on the Earth Jesus stood on Earth and he told them exactly how he was going to come he told him exactly as brother Bob was talking about the Torah and all the different town mute and all that they studied that and studied it they loved Hosea Jeremiah they all spoke Jesus looked at him he said they ever want to speak of me why are you killing me they said well you didn't come the way we thought you ought to come am right it came exactly he fulfilled the old the older man will be revealed you and I are going to fulfill the word so much they're gonna hate us are going to hate us I hate to say that but that's exactly where's the most persecution come from inside this was sitting right beside Jesus on the night he was betrayed nobody knew it but one guy and that was the son of man he had enough discernment to know what Judas was foreign to supply furnish to be supplied in other words add to assisted and why has this got to happen why is there a restoration got to come because we're in the pawn shop that's not where we were supposed to be we were supposed to be free Adam and Eve were supposed to have children by the spoken word of God we were to multiply and replenish this Earth not by sex we were supposed to not ever have a headache not ever have a disease not ever have a bad day it's laying right inside you today though what do you mean some kind of a story or history is where the Bible said you know it's something I think brother John he was talking about this morning it's something way I started what have I told y'all we're a bunch of Tunis Jesus is Way Out younger and we're over here just struggling no he's right here he's the same person I had a brother ask a question online I'm gonna cover it real quick but he said sorry I meant to say John 17 25 he said are you saying this is not another being because I said that when Genesis 1 26 he was talking he couldn't be talking to another person I know brother Brown verbatim quoted that he was talking to another being now look if you look the word being up that means person so he's not talking to another person if he is he's talking to the devil that's the only two people that was there when he was talking but you and I were inside of him and by him knowing that he could talk directly to me and you but he's not talking to another person he's talking to another form of himself that's what you and I another form of himself not another person another form so you can't be a being and when I don't I'm not trying to correct brother brown but that word being means person he wasn't saying that he was talking he's saying he was talking to and then morphe he's talking to a god that moved over in another form so that we could understand that the Son of God had unlimited power and now he's coming down and he's going to be in the beginning what's the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh Elohim became flesh not another person that's denominationalism that's where they get three Gods that's where they get the trinitarian idea they're the street persons in the godhead can't be can't be a step from being unless he's talking to the devil is everybody with me on that So when you say being you have to be careful but when a being is another person but it was not another person God was talking to person is a personality unless it's the devil and he's not telling the devil let us make man in our own image the devil didn't have a part of that actually you know what he hated that day that happened and he's been hating it for thousands and millions of years he hated the day God said something and some form came out of him that was him and Satan couldn't understand so he's like you come from hold on man I'm not done yet let there be I got to start making devil you go over Yonder I gotta start making stuff because that was a creator the Creator God but all that got lost by what Adam put us in a pawn shop I will restore to you though to you whatever Adam lost in the garden I'm going to restore it back and it's got to be in an entire people because only this time it's the true revelation of the son of man if you want we'll get into that though some maybe I understand that but but the son of man was a word made flesh son of man has got to be the word made flesh in me and you you and I have to become the son of man where what we speak is what God Said can't do that well you know go somewhere else you become an unbeliever I believe what God Said and I'm waiting on the manifestation of you say well you're waiting um see it's right here patience to wait on who did I say God that he'll do what he said he would do that's the problem with Eve she couldn't wait on God to get his plan fulfilled she had to help him that's the way listen that same spirit is in the church today remember brother random he was Discerning that brother walking through the house he went to the brother and said brother said you commit an adultery on your wife he said no brother grandma and then the angel remember brother Ryan said the angel took him over to the side and said no he's messing with organized religion that denominational idea is a system to God just like Eve was it's a horse system to God and it can't be brought back this is restoring me and you because we're able to be restored we're able for somebody to get us out of the pawn shop and we accept that and we gotta start believing that because he said I will restore to you the years the locusts eaten all the way down you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord that have to dealt what wondrously with you and my people shall never listen if you're ashamed of this message if you're ashamed of this gospel you need a new birth you need a new birth I kind of was thinking about this the other day and I believe Lord want me to put this in here do you remember the dream or the vision brother Brown had about the bride coming into preview if not I'm going to read it to you everybody all right with this but this is part of you this is this is listen this is the vision that reveals to me where I am I'm the bride I'm not a church I'm the bride and the bride has to come into preview twice the church only comes into preview one time and remember she was naked she was twisting she was rock and roll that was the churches out there I'm telling you what brother Brown said I'm not making it up then I have to watch her watch he she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch remember the second bride the second preview the women in the back got out of Step he said get back your line now look it didn't make her church she was still bright she just got out of staff she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch and when she's passing by when she's passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or whatever is what they were getting back trying their best and was getting back get in line because what happened now the first the first preview of the bride was beautiful everything was in order First Church ages there were no denominational idea there was no eternal hell there was no father son Holy Ghost baptism it was a pure bride but couldn't be complete without the Omega bride that's the two previews what happened in between that a church was born prostitutes came out of the mother sorry strong words but that's what the prophet said so what they were getting back trying their best so which one was getting out of line the second group first group was not they went on off brother Ramsey went on off into heaven he said now the church come into view the naked girls and all that they fell off and was swailing and screaming and all that he said he said he was like oh well Lord that's that's my American church and remember the angel said the bride will come into preview one more time praise God that's me and you I said he got our line they was looking out somewhere else look watching about that church that just went into chaos so what were they doing they were marching and they were looking at the church remember John admired the church it was beautiful but when she fell off into you read the whole thing chaos but the the front one's never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepping out a little bit to the right hand side not staying balanced stepping off to the right hand side and looked like was trying to get back in line as they went by they was just past me and oh as far as here to the wall passed me and I was standing there now I just seen it all move out and leave but you notice the church only comes into view one time each Nation the church but the bride comes into view twice see what it is or what it was now not knowing it but look at it with my message this morning not knowing that see the seed fell in the ground at Nicea so the first bride was what first three Church ages then what came along Nicea the church buy with me the church happened denomination happened man's ideas happen and then God sent a prophet to say now I don't call you church I call you bride I brought you out of that group that was naked blind wretched miserable and don't know it I praise God what a plan and it's your partner the seed fell on the ground and I see you that was the original seed that one false seed that was the original seed and she's come to the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last day I will restore see the Masterpiece is brought up that's the reason she was in view reviewed the second time watch she was reviewed the first time then she was reviewed the second time and she was perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry life get in the grain right quick now watch so you if you look at the pyramid you've got a preview of The Bride these three ages right here you've got a preview of The Bride walking just perfect everything right then you've got now see it happens right here the Dark Ages not that they're not bright it's just they were not complete they had their ideas and God winked at some of their ignorance amen anybody with me but to get right here that outpouring of the holy spirit that we're looking at there had to come a second preview there had to come a second part and then we kind of got out of line a little bit because you know what just like some of us we don't do everything God tells us to do I'm sorry I don't do everything God tells you do if y'all do that's okay pray for me you say that they look at you like well that happened to you and watch this ow L I have two kids I'm human Josh is in the back oh look all others never appear no more look they never appeared so when God was done with them he was done with them they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor has made him a masterpiece for it is a peace of his first masterpiece in other words he got us out of the pawn shop because we were a part of him before the foundation of the world we just got caught remember between Satan and Eve Adam took on her sin so we got put in a pawn shop we didn't come the way God wanted us to come but thank God the restoration of the Bride tree real quick may not get too far but that's okay I wanted us to make sure we see this you've got to know not think and not hope hope is good but faith is the substance of things hoped for so you hope for it then there's a journey that's called faith then there's a reality I do not need faith brother George to get to church today I'm standing here now I had to have faith to get in the car some of y'all that drive Forge you had to have more faith pickup trucks basically boys going but you had to have faith your wife was going up early that that you know your kids was going to all get together at the same time you get do you get do you get dressed and all ready for you Mama does nope didn't think so hey look when a kid looks at you and goes I didn't pick on your sister okay I'll pick on you I bet you she gets ready for you do come on now you're left-handed you got to be able to do something more better than she can but you know what God looks that's the same way he says look come on get ready we gotta go quit messing around because here we are here that God is here to do exceeding it abundantly whatever we ask him for we need to ask him for what Revelation brother Brown said not not we sure we're sick sure we need financial sure we need a new job brother Brown said pray for Revelation more than anything why because what would Revelation do to show you who you are it'll show you where you're at it'll show you your issues it'll show you your problems and it'll do one thing for sure if it's a true Revelation it'll show you how to get rid of them it won't be a thought it won't be a hope anymore it won't even be Faith anymore it'll be a reality I'm gonna have faith that my body's gonna be changed but one day praise God it will be changed and I will not need Faith anymore we'll not need faith in the Millennium what do you need faith for when you're perfect but we had four Messengers killed that tree in between those that Dark Age time so with four death Messengers come and they suck the life out of that tree all the way down to the roots for God said I will restore he's going to restore it by four death Messengers killed it four life Messengers were restored not three four is the four is the number of man we know sometimes it's a bad number but four is a number of restoration that's what it is right here by four death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word that was the prophet's message brought him out of Pentecost now Pentecost stayed where they were at they stayed in their own little pawn shop Christ came to a little man to say I can get you out not brother Branham I Jesus Christ can show you the word so that you can get out of that pawn shop speaking in tongues there's not the total evidence it's good restoration the gifts are good but getting out of that pawn shop way better than having gifts because gifts and callings are without repentance you can have all the gifts in the world still being the phone shop but once you come out of that pawn shop if Jesus Christ brings you out you're born again right there your soul is redeemed that's what I want you to see but as your soul is redeemed through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost you've got to put the word in it you can't just well I'm born again I don't have to go to church anymore where'd you get that at unlike a preacher's Dead one time what most y'all ought to do is is you ought to look on your calendar and think today's Monday because most people get healed on Monday I can't come to church I got a headache I can't come to church I got toe eight I can't come to church I got too much to do and then Monday you spend all day at Walmart healed completely completely healed no you're completely lost if that's what you do you're completely lost you need to realize that's the devil doing that to you that's not God God will never keep you out of church ever you gotta fight this thing fight your way in here Find Your Way in here and I promise you it'll be better as you go out that door what was the fourth the word and I believe that's what we're under now with the preaching of brother Branham and then the preaching of what brother Dale's been preaching all that it's a progressive word it's being progressed we're being Progressive some I'm sorry I think about the other day all the people that left the church and I pray for them I don't I don't not like them I mean I will I wish we were the church was packed and we had to find another building with all the people that's left and they're wandering out in the world they will if you believe you become that word and didn't the word tell you you asked what you will and it'll be done to you you ask you say to this mountain be moved all right the word there was four great prophets will I I'll go a little bit further is that okay it's just 11 30. one of them Martin Luther he began to shine a little light it's a very small strength of justification Along Came Wesley stronger sanctification after Wesley come the stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great prophet we've been taught that remember the prophet the Pentecost was not brother random hey man it was the Holy Ghost himself that's what brother Brown said because if not you'd make brother a messenger to the Pentecostal people not the Holy Ghost come on today at Pentecost 1906 to restore the gifts that day cabbage down and said no this is it we're done later ain't former rain we're gone we're out of here this is the great Revival do you hear about that Revival that's going on in Asheboro Kentucky Ashbury College been going for days we can't get y'all to come one day it's been going days weeks I'm talking 24 hours there's somebody in that service praying worshiping God that's been going on for five six seven days solid but you know what without the true word of God sure God can save them but they ain't a bright one if they ain't got the Holy Ghost it's just emotion it's just sensation it's just we're having a Revival that's why I want us to have a word Revival the word Revival will start in the soul teach us what to do and it'll work its way out then if we want to shout that's great if we want to run that's great for want to speak in tongues that's great I pray that we speak in tongue I pray that something comes into this church of Prophecy to stand up and say hey you're not living right or hey you need to go do this or hey you need to go do that it scares to death we'd all be halfway off the building before these come said stuff because I was junk in our life I'm me included we'll get clocked that's okay you better pay attention one day God's gonna bring something I promise you we're going to get cleaned up we're gonna get cleaned up because even the Bible says the congregation of the righteous there will be no one no sinner sitting in this congregation but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah to come with a very word the word of the Lord came to the prophet and the evening light is to come forth to restore and bring back turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of God fourth light four Killers took it four Messengers destroyed it four messages of death took it away what in Dogma Creed not word and then brother I'm saying it in non-word there's nothing to question if you're standing here today with non-word nothing is quickening today it's just going right over your head unless you pull it down and say hey that's for me hey that's for me for Messengers righteousness restored her back again prophesy son of man ain't what we're coming to son of man can these bones live wish we had time I got a rope down here but I have to miss it prophecy because these bones live what's the fourth stage that's coming forth of that church that's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones remember the dry bones came together but they just stood there without number four what was number four breathe o Breath of God now breathe whole Breath of God now breathe what not the Holy Ghost your dad would dead without the Holy Ghost you are but I'm about to dry bones standing up you're dead without it but the life only comes not when the sin you skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that fourth message of life I will restore us after Lord hallelujah Glory praise be to God the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same sign listen we are living in that light now it's not coming it's here justification brought back to Paul sanctification brought back the mark doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leads what Pentecost what does the leaves do when the wind blows but you know what if it's dead you ever seen a dead tree below no it just does this then it breaks off but when you got life y'all want to try that sometime maybe I'll give you a little bit of life rejoicing I don't want us to be a bunch of Pentecostal people but I want you to be a little more joyful than you are now you've got eternal life and your soul and I hope you're listening to the word of God now it'll make you happy I'll put them to them too what the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ says finally finally after justification been planted sanctification being planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ has again centered himself look like the cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism logos then the coming of the cap what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed what are we doing today we're being honed all the stuff we don't need should be shaved off so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away who went away the Son of God didn't go away the son of man went away got a human flesh went away so that he can send back the son of God in the Holy Ghost to be with the people number three justification application Son of God fourth is the son of man the word made flesh is the son of man I just read that to you in John 1 1. same kind of ministry he had when he went away when he went away was there a doctrine of of three gods when he went away was there a father son Holy Ghost baptism when he went away was there a Baptist idea it was a pure word but it was the infancy of it it was the beginning of it you had to have a Alpha and Omega according to the Bible the beginning and the end watch this same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture where the Justified Sanctified and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again whether you go or not whether I go or not this is going to be made manifest the Tree of Life is growing again where out in the field oh and you remember I read you the scripture she is a tree of life she is the bride is the tree of life that's the only Tree of Life this man I know y'all walk out in the world and rub shoulders with him so do I I feel sorry for them they have they have no idea what's coming they look toward government they look for the denomination the Methodist Church is getting ready to split there may be some Churches to empty we could buy real cheap but no the Methodist Church is fixing to split wide open they won't allow prostitute they won't allow uh prostitutes they won't allow gays some want some will right so they're going to split neighbor I was talking to a neighbor the other day and I said what are you going to do Jerry he said he said I might just start my own church I thought you might could try coming to your neighbor's church and see what's going on over here but you know what we got the same thing in the message folks I mean we can say well we're up here we got all this clean no we got all kind of denominations in this in the in the church too in the bride well not the bride but in the so-called the uh we call them the mixed multitude but listen brother Brown said this Brides brides churches Brides churches he makes a big long he said but there's going to come one there's gonna come one people one group that's going to take this message and live it not talk it live it and going to manifest watch this right here then we'll close I didn't even get to knowledge tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time this time right now where were there ever a time in history that manifests the time to deliver all nature nature nature itself has grown and waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out all the Old Testament on down here there couldn't have been manifestation what brother I'm saying is let me interplay they were in the pawn shop and they couldn't get out because the blood of bulls and goats just covered them while they were in there didn't save a person Holy Ghost filled person in the Old Testament it just Cape older covered it so that God couldn't see it but you and I come to a place where you were taken out of the pawn shop and listen God's able to use this thing now it's not inside and locked up behind the devil's door you get out here where God can use this thing y'all be like an old chainsaw you look in the pawn shop and you see chainsaws I don't know why people they must not like to work that they put their chainsaws up for Pawn I hope the devil watches that and the Lord goes and gets that chainsaw and that's you and I hope he comes out and he uses it that's brother Ernie Villanueva said not just we're not just going to peck on this devil he said hack him went through all that uh I want to take the chainsaw with double double chains on it and cut that sucker to pieces you say oh you just aren't you tired of the devil beating on you aren't you just really tired of the devil just beating on you living in your house well guess what there's a provision if you do what God said the problem is we don't look it had to wait till this time now all things have been brought coming shaped into a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men what these fivefold Ministry not one take church right the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their Ministry their ministry will be so close like Christ will join him in the church together I got to cover this because Bob covered it while it's fresh he knows mine I'm gonna scroll through here close your eyes if it's makes you sick see how far down it was right here revelation because brother Brown said look there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word of God nothing nothing of such prevailing power not just up power one day and down the next prevailing power means all the time that means working all the time in your life there's nothing such prevailing power is the revelation of the word and what does that word revelation mean the act or process of disclosing something previously secret are obscure especially look something true so we know God's truth we know he's the truth we know he's the word so if there's anything covered by him when we uncover it it's got to be truth it can't be uh copy we see a lot of copies of Moses sitting on that throne with a little piece off of his knee but there's one original over there somewhere in the Louvre or wherever it is over in France somebody's got it over there there's an original but there's a bunch of little bitty ones you see them all over the place we're not that we're off the original that's why he had to Smite that they smoke us a piece of himself it's a PCU the active process of disclosing something previously secret or obscure especially something true a fact disclosed or revealed especially in a dramatic I like that or surprising way wow never seen that before listen this right here musicians come on let's stay God's disclosure of his own what nature listen when you get a revelation it's not some man's idea it's a revelation of God's nature God's wanting you to see him that's why the statue perfect man is so important it is him being made manifest or made known in a bride it's never been before just the beginning of time God's disclosure of his own nature and his purpose for mankind the plan especially through the words of human Not Angels do you say Angels no it says human intermediaries Apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists Sunday school teachers something in which such a Divine disclosure is contained such as in the Bible amen so there's no providing power the prevailing overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us however you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism is right there staring you in the face wow I bet you them people sitting in that Auditorium that day that we're trinitarians thought man this guy's crazy that's why they hated him that's why he kept hating him because why they kept hating Jesus he was wonderful Jesus had 50 000 people 25 000 people right when he died there was one him was the only person left brother Branham when he started preaching us as a scrolling through YouTube the other day and it's some I can't remember The Minister's name um Roth David Roth anyway he's a he's a commentary you know he brings people in well he brought this guy in young kid I want to smack him in the face brought this young whipper snapper in and he talked about William Branham no greater gift the whole healing movement was by this William Marion Branham and I mean I thought man this guy's got to be a message preacher he got right to the end you know what he said he said but he was probably about the worst Bible teacher I've ever heard I thought dude you're totally deceived why would God that's why I want to ask these people that that's run away from the message brother Brian didn't preach he wasn't a flash in the pan he went in a 30 minute John the Baptist six months and he's gone he preached 30 years God Vindicated him for all 30 of them how could God a man can't keep it together I threw that prophet he kept everything together sure they hated him they hated Jesus Jesus preached three and a half years and the whole world was against him brother Brian Prince 30 years 30 years and you know what he tell the same story and that might be it might be a little different but every bit of it was he tell that same story he'd stand up there and he'd say if I've told you the truth tonight he said let God come and back it up let God now listen if he was a false prophet God didn't have to God didn't have to back him up he could have said no you're not preaching my word you're a false prophet and he could have been like bail and been a flash in the pan and had a little bit of a gift and calling whatever but 30 years Bro think of 30 years this man went on the field and preached to 20 30 40 000 miracles documented not just Word of Mouth documenting miracles and it just kept going until he had to come to preach what the Revelation that he come to preach and that was the seals and that's when they hated him that's when that little whippersnapper kid on the on the on the uh can't remember his name doesn't matter oh no YouTube says boy he wasn't a very good Bible teacher wow we're going to use and him not being good Bible teacher it's because you know what what brother Brown a preached same way with Jesus Jesus stood there he said if you don't believe I'm here you're dying your sins I was not born a fornication like you was I I I know the Torah I know the Moses quote book I got Abraham I got all Abraham's tapes well here we go I got all Abraham's books he said if you to believe Abraham you believe me he connected it where they couldn't unconnect it he has so much influence though with the people when he would say that that's what made him mad because it turned to people against the denomination of the day listen he didn't have a problem with Sinners and prostitutes right always there'd be one Pharisee walk in and he just tore the whole thing apart now that was the religious people of today that was supposedly the ones that had the truth supposedly had the truth and he said you're of your father the devil you're a snake you're a liar you know what he was doing he's trying to save their soul but he knew there was so much in them of hatred he couldn't save them he couldn't save them sure he died for everybody but he knew who he was going to get out of that pawn shop he knew who would come out he knew who wouldn't but he didn't get up there and say well bless God I'm not dying for them Pharisees no he said Lord father forgive him for they don't know what they're doing do we no father burn the house down destroy him they're against me make their car engine blow up that's kind of the way we are they don't believe what I preach let them be cast out well guess what Jesus never was that way so I don't think we should be that way he died on that cross for everybody but he knew being God he knew who wouldn't who wouldn't who wouldn't accept him so he died for me and you he died to get us out of that pawn shop praise God and then out of that pawn shop we still got work to do why would you take a chainsaw out of the pawn shop to use it put gas in it put oil in it they go cut trees down go cut the devil down Troy wants to take you out of the pawn shop to use you not to take you out and go oh that's a pretty pretty chainsaw no every one of you purpose when he got you out of that pawn shop we got to now what step into that
