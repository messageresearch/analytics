and typed and i passed them out one on one for those of you who read it and uh want more detail i'm going to write some more of my story down okay now the serious stuff it's a testimony and i want you to see how intricately the lord works can you hear me nanny okay okay that thyroid nozzle i talked about the last time i sang that started back in february when i went to my ent we did an ultrasound and we did the biopsy poking you in the neck to get that tissue out of there the nodule when it gets to be four centimeters they want to do surgery so i go to my ent who had already referred me to a specialist in augusta one of the top five surgeons in the country to do this surgery because it's risky and i had taken radiation back when i was 20 something so i go to him on friday a week ago and he walks in and he says have you met dr terrace and i said no he said why not i said because this is their procedure he said really i don't like that procedure you should meet whoever is going to be cutting on you before the surgery they have something called one stop surgery down there now and you go on monday meet him do your pre-op and then you go back on tuesday and have the surgery so that told me hmm the gift that the lord has given me put the brakes on so that's what i did and i'm a natural girl in case y'all didn't know that i'd rather go the natural route to find something to resolve a problem for example i had abscess i went to the store and got garlic started putting garlic on there my girlfriend was amazed in two days it was gone okay so this time i said okay let me research how to shrink those nodules right spirulina cumin and ginger i started taking those okay let me back up so i canceled the surgery and i told my ent about it and i started taking this on last saturday monday i shared it with june i don't see no nodules kathy can kathy do you see that neck you see that nodule i don't see those nodules anymore you see how the lord works that doctor walked in and asked me had i seen the surgeon no regina puts the brakes on i don't feel no look at that smooth y'all ain't no lump praise the lord amen all healing comes from god amen whether he worked through the ginger or through the spirulina amen but all healing comes from you know praise the lord jesus thank god for the ginger thank god for the spirulina it was god god made it but he used it amen i believe that praise the lord sister amen like brother dick said last week hey man that he he got healed by a brain tumor he had something to shout about something to sing about amen something to to praise the lord about sister regina you have something to praise the lord about it amen praise the lord jesus thank you for that testimony let's sing this song shut in with god and we're going to have brother uh brother porter we're going to have uh you come up and sing first amen and uh since you're our guest [Laughter] and i try to stop it brother but i got too many requests [Music] shut in with

my sin upon his shoulders ashamed that i'm my voice [Music] it was my sin that held him there [Music] until it was a complex his dying breath has brought me life i know that it is [Music] i will not boast in anything no gifts done but i will boast in jesus christ and resurrection why should i gain from his reward [Music] i cannot give an answer but this i know with all my heart his wounds have

inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance why you say jesus left me an inheritance beg your pardon everybody still believe brother brown was a prophet we in the right place right okay he said beg your pardon jesus never left you an inheritance um jesus never left you an inheritance he never left me an inheritance wow he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world god gave you your inheritance your inheritance was first your inheritance was first amen so here we are our inheritance god give us our inheritance jesus came to pay the price to give it back to us thank god it's an eternal inheritance it's eternal redemption satan can't do anything eternal bless his little heart sometimes i do i'm like brother dale i feel sorry for the devil because he can't get saved he can't have this wonderful feeling that we have in our heart he tries to take it away from

grand just for the bus so but the church is going to pay for it for you and it'll put us all there at the same time one time together and we won't have to wait on some of you that don't know what time is so anyway just saying i got to quit thinking out loud but god bless you we love you with the love of the lord let's let's start on who is this son of man this is part 39 brother brother john okay 39 i'm a little slow but i'm a southerner and we all are too so we're good but that's all right i looked online the other day brother donny was on number 200 and something on about the church so i'm i'm not i ain't got that far yet but when you're in a series you just kind of want to stay on it and if until the people get it and then when the people get it then we'll move on amen so this would be part 39 who is this son of man because our mandate we are not under the anointing of the son of god anymore they were in the church ages and some still are but we're in the dispensation of the son of man when god is to be human flesh again and he's going to change your flesh he's already changed listen he started to body change when the 120 in the upper room got changed in their soul that started the change now we've come now all the way here because it wasn't their mandate it wasn't their box it wasn't their time it wasn't their anointing they didn't have the people here for it because god was waiting on me and you to be here me and you to be here in this building in this time to be alive to listen to the message of the hour and believe for a body change because it can and it will happen how many times have i told you i'm just dumb enough believe it's me and man and i just believe that with all god's help that we'll all get in there together amen don't kick any of them out amen let the lord deal with that so who is this son of man let's bow our heads i know we all have unspoken requests things on our heart lord thank you for this day that you give us i pray that you'll be with us now and the further in this service you do the speaking lord you be the one lord that doesn't reveal him because without you lord this would just be a meeting of like as a prophet god said it'd be a lodge just where we just meet and shake hands and and talk about the things of the world but lord let's just for a few hours lord just be under this umbrella of hearing from you lord and lord that we'll get something from you today lord that'll help us in the days to come father that we'll take this inheritance and we'll be able to use it lord you don't want that you don't want us to put it on a shelf the lord do you want us to use it and lord that's what this statue of a perfect man is for it's not a statue it's a statue it's something moving it's moving breathing it's you lord in human flesh again back on the earth in a bride in a mini-membered body and thank you for the lord giving us an opportunity to stand before that purchased possession thank you for the ones that are here our visitors now lord that are here and the ones brother john and his wife lord we praise you give them travel and mercies as they head back tomorrow whenever they're going back be with us tomorrow memorial day lord we want to we want to truly remember the ones lord that gave their life to make it where we can stand in this pulpit as of now a free country i know the united states is going to get what they're going to get but lord i wouldn't be living anywhere else this would be the only place i'd want to be right here right now lord and i thank you for the men and women that fought and gave their life for us to have this freedom that we have in the united states of america but lord this is nothing compared to that freedom that comes at the baptism of the holy ghost the freedom that comes when we walk into that city lord all we see is you you're the light of the whole city everything's lit up because of you we're even lit up because of you well lord let us have a little part of that today lord light this building father with your presence we asked your name in the name of the lord jesus christ that you do these things for us lord amen in the beginning was the word where it was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh that word that was in the beginning was god and now that word was made flesh we know that 2000 years ago but what about today where is christ in his bride he's not on her he's not around her he's not hovering over her he's in her she is him so the word was made flesh when today in you 20 22 the word has become flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated but we're all we read the scripture there in ephesians uh several weeks ago about being predestinated to adoption now there's a lot of people been predestinated to different things the church ages they had their anointing they had their time they had their characteristic and they had their time that they fulfilled that characteristic under the messenger of their age when i under the messenger of malachi 4 we see that we've moved to the son of man revelation all right now there's not it's not going to be during the time of the church ages that we see the son of man revelation the son of man revelation is god in human flesh for a body change all right we're we know we're all called out called out of the age we're not living in any age if you're born again you're living in eternity your soul is actually in eternity what a what a paradox is you're stan you're here getting older and we're getting more feeble and we're having more aches and pains but if you're born again tonight this afternoon that soul inside of you is 20 years old just as eternal as god is never had a never had a bad day never had a bad thought never began and never will end thank god for that that's the new birth to me that's not just the message of the hour that's the truth the message of the hour is as as we were talking about the message of the hour is the holy ghost in your age you get the revelation because remember you look at what we were looking at the chart this morning when and in the age of justification that was john wesley right well john what i mean martin luther martin luther sat in a pub and drank a beer and smoked a pipe he was a german talked about the word of god but god he wa he allowed that because he wanted martin luther to preach the just shall live by faith people to come out of the catholic church people to get born again under the reformation get born again and then what did he do he said oh well i got to have a john wesley because we got we can't be sitting in in no pub drinking beer smoking a pipe you can't do that but they could because that was their box that was their leadership that was their time that was their anointing then you come to john wesley's anointing and then you come to pentecostal anointing which was the gifts coming back into the church and the different doctrines and and you know the first the first church the first pentecostal church in 1906 they were trinitarians they didn't have a one god revelation it was only until about 1912 they came in with daddy seymour and him came in and and got the revelation of one true living god but then you got all kind of jesus name which was you know one lucky finger and they had all this and all that they subdivided again man has done that we just they just keep dividing because what does satan like to do he likes to what divide and conquer he don't want us to get together now how many i'm gonna go ahead and say it brother john how many denominations we got in this message one message one bible eleven hundred sermons vindication vindication vindication vindication and these people go different churches won't even talk to each other you know why because of these virtues i want to read this we were talking about this morning brother brown says in blasphemous names he said brother branham should we speak with tongues absolutely that's the gift of god they don't have this quote but these gifts of god without these virtues make a stumbling block to the unbeliever because the unbeliever looks at you he said look it's not accepted by god god doesn't accept you just to get born again not in this age in this age he expects you to get born again then he expects you to grow because you've got the word to grow by you've got an open book to work by not a closed book it's open so you can read everything you need to read praise the lord but let's not be a stumbling block even believers can be something blocks without these virtues what brother brown say power without characters what satanic power without character would have you do it'd have well it you zap your boss out of existence if you could now mine's a good i got a good boss maybe some of y'all don't but i got a good ball she's a good postmaster lady but um but if you use those characters wrong god's not going to give you that character if he knows you're going to misuse it that's why we've stayed babies for 60 years that's why that we've as brother brown said we've done like pentecost we've tooted out the whistle we've made sure that we shouted spoken tongues and and quoted brother branham to a degree and lived a good life but that's not what god's requiring now he's requiring the revelation of the son of man because that's not your birth your birth is over here and then the revelation that we're going to talk about under the sun of god revelation you can only understand it by having the new birth all right and there's three stages of this adoption we were talking about this morning we'll go through it pretty quick we have the birth so for as many that are led by the spirit of god they are not going to be they are the sons of god for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption listen if you're born again today you should be the freest person in the world you should be so free you say no yeah we have problems we have issues that we have to work on which is life but you should be able to handle them and get through them and get by them work your way through these things for we've not received the spirit of bondage against fear but what we have received the spirit of adoption all right you got to receive the spirit of adoption to even be considered an adoption in other words you've got to be the child i like what brother dale said many many years ago he said god is not obligated he's not obligated to adopt the devil's kids he's obligated to adopt his own kids and that's what we do at the new birth we receive the spirit of adoption and we are children of god children we start out as children as i said this morning you know you we got several young men in here and several young ladies that are getting older but you're not going to give a car keys to a five-year-old you're gonna let your daughter drive with you home today brother why she's a girl i mean she's a human she's got bias she got no she got a mouth she got hands she got feet she's human why she hadn't come to the growth development part she hasn't come to the intelligence part sure she's got a brain and it's very a very good brain because she looks like a mama very good very good brain but um but still i mean she's human like i said we're christian my point is we're sons and daughters of god we have come to a place that we know we should know what the new birth is but we should know the requirements of that that brother bob was talking about this morning and as we move further the requirements we were talking about downstairs of having virtue knowledge tempers patience guidelines and brotherly kindness these are required virtues they're required but listen all the apostles had those virtues the apostles the early church ages had those virtues working in their life so i'm not when we talk about the son of man revelation we're not talking about that we're going on up higher into the headstone as we see over there that there's justification sanctification and baptism of the holy ghost in the pyramid and then there's a in the small pyramid which is really small because only a few group a small group of people is going to make it to the son of man revelation but the son of god revelation is down to the church ages we got to be out of the church age when brother branham was preaching he was preaching he said he said not in the years of preparation what was that he was preparing a group of people he was trying to get the pentecostals to come out methodist baptist pentecostal he was trying to get them out come out of her my people with the signs and the wonders as moses did the signs and the wonders caught the attention of the people but the attention of the people was supposed to gather them to moses and then take them into the promised land oh what happened the first thing they did said was that you brought us out here to die moses we'd rather go back and eat the leeks and garlics and i don't see how in the world cause man leeks are horrible but they'd rather eat that than what be in the we're the same way folks sometimes we'd rather not be in the presence of god human beings i'm just human i don't know about y'all we live in a spirit realm not enough but we are human beings and we have things we have to do you know that but that's what we're working on we're working on we're not working on now and thank god for for brother john we were talking about this today a progressive ministry we've had here brother dale's been preaching here for 45 years and it's always been progressive ministry one of the greatest teachers i've ever heard amen and i'm like those people across the country time i'm resting on that amen and if air if children then if we become children then heirs all right heirs of god what heirs of these virtues you're not going to get these virtues from god if you don't have god already inside of you all right and if children then there's heirs of god and joint heirs with christ whatever christ gets you get amen what do christ christ got a body change christ's got a resurrection amen christ got an eternal body do you know his body was not eternal do you know he received an eternal body amen the bible that's why the bible says being made perfect he became the author of our salvation that we may be glorified together let's continue real quick justification we were talking about this morning and we were talking about baby form justification which takes your sins if you're truly repentant throws them in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again now we remember them but god does not remember those past sins stop wasting god's time repenting for something you're already repenting for if you truly repented satan is going to bring it back to you don't worry that's his job but it's only in that memories and conscious affection realm it is not in that center realm that center realm is settled it's peace it's joy it's all those different things but what sayeth that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in the heart that is the word of faith which we preach if thou shalt confess with my mouth the lord jesus we were talking about it downstairs sister christine was preaching a good sermon back there listen stop just a minute there's a lot of churches in this message that wouldn't let a woman say nothing and i know paul said bless her heart be silent in church but say some women i'd rather hear than men boy you ain't getting away man's except for the women i got a man from the women brother john durrett bro john said john duretz i don't know who you saw i didn't know you somebody so i stayed awake the whole sermon that works brother that's where it works but i you said it so i can say it ain't that right brother john but there's a lot of people no there's a lot of people that wouldn't want to listen to a sister but we got some sisters that's got some they're faithful to the holy ghost brother brown said holy ghost-filled woman can help you now we don't believe in women preachers and all that we don't believe in conducting having them conduct meetings no but sitting around talking about the word of god haven't you rather do that than to talk about candy and cooking and all that stuff y'all can do that together but i tell you what there was a brother came here one time that preached a false doctrine and there was about two sisters met him right down there at the bottom of the stairs the preacher pastor didn't even have to get out there they done cornered him and said what do you mean by this what do you mean by this what do you mean by this i we ain't seen him since i don't think so but anyway make a point sister christine what we're talking about and we're talking about salvation there's a lot of people going to be saved that's not born again that's not living in the city that's not bride they're going to have to stay dead a thousand years they're going to have to come up and give an account right but like i told you before i'm so proud that this message has given me at least two good revelations brother john back there in the back there's two revelations you can talk about seals plagues vials all you want to talk about there's two things that god showed me if i get born again i never ever have to stand at the judgment thank god thank god i'll never have to stand at the judgment and i'll never have to go through the tribulation that's enough i know it's not all but that's enough for me to know that god saved my soul and it's taking me somewhere but if we'll give the rest of it we're going to talk about later on in the sermon about doors and doors if we'll just let him let him get a step further let him get a step further let him not just let him in your house let not just lay them in your heart let him ramble through those drawers that's right open the doors up open the doors up and say god come in and if there's trash in here take it out if thou shalt confess without mouth to lord jesus and believe in thy heart that thou he is raised from the dead thou shalt be what saved salvation is of the lord a lot of people are going to have salvation but they're going to have to live outside the city they're going to have a position where they're going to have to go through the tribulation they're going to have to stand at the white throne judgment but if they get eternal life they get eternal life that's what the bible says the bible says you don't it does not say a word about well you got to know what this message is to be saved oh that hurts oh that hurts a lot of people there's going to be more people saved that never heard of this message than they are it's going to be that's ever heard of this message amen so we are what bless people to know that we've come to the message of the hour that we do are going to be able to stay in that city we are going to be able to pass judgment the one that we're not going to have to go through the tribulation we are going to take a body change and we are going to be caught up out of here amen we're going to have some heart aches and trials but we're not just saved we're full of the holy ghost and we're born again christians for the heart of man believeth unto righteousness and with a mouth confession is made unto salvation that's what i was just doing confess confess with your mouth romans 3 verse 24 says being justified what freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness what for the remission of sins that are past god cannot forgive you even knowing that you're going to sin tomorrow he's not going to forgive you unless you ask him that's catholicism to ask for you know what that's why that's why the mafia love catholics they love being catholics i'm sorry priest i'm going to kill two people tomorrow so i'm going to ask you to go ahead and forgive me now sister anna's been she was a catholic i mean that's what you do you you repent for all that stuff well i'm fixing to do this but i want you to forgive me for that that's not the way god works he forgives you for the he gives you remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god that's justification to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of works no but by the law of faith that's what we're talking about get down here at faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law sanctification now this is again this is sanctification you're not even in the body yet you're not you're you're becoming a believer we were talking about this morning when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walks through dry places seeks rest finders none then he says i will return into my house that's satan talking if you don't mind he said i will return into my house that's right god has not took full possession yet he has cleaned your drinking cuts and smoking gambling laundry list whatever your problems were if they went out they should have went out at sanctification not that you believe the message don't cut my hair i don't go to the bar anymore that's just that's just good living that's sanctification which is still you're going to go to hell if you if you don't continue on because you don't you're not you don't have god in your soul to protect you now you have the unclean spirit out but what's he going to do he's going to try to come back he's not going to try to come back he will come back because you know what i was a good soldier for him he lost a good one when he lost me because i did what he said most of the time then he said i would return into my house from whence i came out and when he has come he find it empty swept and garnished started going to church started believing got a new spirit remember we thought about it this morning but it's not the holy spirit then go ahead and take himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself more religious and put you in a message church and say you're fine just come to church whenever you need to i say want to sorry you need to every time whenever you want to uh i'll stay home listen tapes if i need to i ain't going there anymore i'm not that's for somebody else if you think you can make it at home then god bless your heart and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so it will be into this wicked generation who's he talking to he's talking to us ii timothy 2 19 nevertheless the foundation of god stand is sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity here we are getting ready to start getting cleaned up we're not born again we're clean and set aside for service not put in service but in a great house they're not only vessels of gold and silver but wood and earth and some to honor and some to dishonor watch this if a man therefore purge himself from these why start going to church start doing somebody asked me a question the other day about oh bless his heart if somebody having problems with women i said well you know what you know where they go they go to bars they go to shows they go the same in the world i said you don't go find them sitting over here on the view of a church environment change your environment if you don't if you if you say i got these demons i can't get rid of quit going to where the demons are quit going to where the demons are try going to church there's enough demons here already devil comes church when you don't if a man therefore purges himself from these he shall be a vessel of what honor sanctified cleaned up and meet for the masters used and prepared under every good work now still you're not born again you're still working toward that here's a quote that that kind of gets your eyebrows furled judas this carrot was justified by faith believed on the lord jesus and was baptized pretty good believer huh let's just keep going jesus said sanctify them father through thy truth that word is truth and he was the word even before the atonement was made in other words as a preview father of shed blood i sanctify these he give them power against unclean spirits they went out cast out devils is that right they healed the sick is that right they came back sanctified rejoicing jumping up and down remember judas was in this group right is that right he said even the devil's the subject jesus said don't you rejoice because the devil's the subject but rejoice because your names are written in the book of heaven is that right and judas this carrot was one of them one of them he was one of them he wasn't one of them we are but he was one of them and like i said before i want you to get this that's why the son of man revelation has to come in back in the end time because the only way that that judas was exposed was because the son of man was on earth the son of man jesus christ knew he was going to be the betrayer so the only way that we're going to know who and he hid in the system as we all say he hid in the system he was a spy he was one that was so good the cia would have loved this guy he fit right in all the other 11 had no clue who he was on the inside but what the son of man did so the revelation of the son of man to me in the end time has to come back to identify the devil where he is and expose him that's what the seals were for the seals opened it exposed the devil it it it produced jesus christ but it exposed the devil and where he was it proved brother brown said oh man i knew i hated those organizations i knew i hated those denominations he knew that was the antichrist system listen covet shot is not the antichrist system see that's another thing all these questions that all these people all these pundits and all these people on cnn in cia and all them other places fox news they're bouncing around this theory and this theory and this we know where the antichrist is if you're not born again he's sitting in you you gotta worry about you're talking about disease that's the worst disease that covered ever thought about being it's for satan to be inside of you and you not know it you be deceived by it because the whole world's going to be deceived except the bride and she's going to be about that close from being deceived because all these other 11 bride bride disciples were deceived until judas did what he did and showed his colors and judas this carrot was one of them called out sanctified name written in the lounge book of life not the eternal section read matthew 10 and see if that's not right he called each one of them and judas every one of them right down there he sent them out give them power against unclean spirits wow how the thing was refreshed in the presence of god notice another thing once in the presence of god you get quieted you don't ain't got to shout listen jesus never shouted i don't want when you wha what and i know we came under the son of god ministry where it's a lot of shouting a lot of speaking in tongues and a lot of hollering and and jesus never did that the son of man never screamed except one time and that was to get lazarus out of a grave the devils knew who he was when he walked in the room they started screaming at him he never screamed at them we scream shake shake them and everything else what is the virtues working in your life though didn't brother say that was supreme power and control remember power without character satanic but power with character is fit to rule supreme control over the situation that's one thing that i believe you know brother branham he would stand there and he would say i take every spirit in this building under my control he controlled the whole thing he controlled everything that was going on and it wasn't he never hollered and screamed at people he prayed for him he prayed for him with power behind it that's what i'm looking for listen satan can do seek he can impersonate every gift every spiritual gift but he can't put the word together and drive satan out he can't satan can't cast out satan but the word of god can do it folks that's what i'm looking at you get quieted you're not tossed about by everything you know where you're standing there's something happen you know that you're a real christian you know that you've been in contact with somebody that loves you you know that something's happened down here and it's refreshing and not only that but you'll be refresh others you've seen people that was nice people but you wouldn't hardly stand to be around them there's something about them they got a creative power around them it just seems to be different how i'd like to stop here if it was possible and tell you something on that you're a little creator you create an atmosphere that's why when we come into service we don't do denominations man you ever been to a denominational church boyd has i've been to a few uh there was a young little boy that was preaching just started preaching in the old baptist church we used to go to years ago in the 60s and we went back and it's truly it's just like a lodge i mean they were leaning up the bench on the side of the bench talking about the ball game talking about their car and how they're gonna you know race on sunday and how they're gonna do this and who's gonna win the ball game and all that stuff and then all of a sudden the song leader stands up like this and everybody just kind of sits now then they sing their three or four songs and bring the preacher out and formality formality that's why we're quiet before the service that's why we have music playing before service that's we want to invite god in our midst i know we brought him in here with us but we want a special anointing on us to help us to worship and listen to what god has to say well you're a little creator then you can do that he said he'd give you a new spirit now this is sanctification now that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit in him but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you so he has to get you fixed up first before you he can come in i'll give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed so you can entertain him right so that's when you're on the first altar see you're not even you know any minute holy holy you're not even a holy of holies yet all right but when you hot but when you hide away you get his spirit then the holy spirit none other than god himself comes and dwells in you and then there's something about you the neighbor loves you the people likes you entervale 1956. i love that little message right there called the intervale the dwelling place of god i'm going to try to skip through this to get to something showing that the human heart not the human head but the human heart is where he's going to reside i'll write them in my heart they'll keep my statutes and so forth saith the lord god said in another place in ezekiel i will in that day take out your old fleshly stony heart and i'll give you a new spirit i'll put my spirit in you now a lot of people even you pentecostal people listen folks it's not bad to have a pentecostal experience but staying in pentecost you're going backwards sorry you are we're past that now a lot of people even you pentecostal people a lot of times get mistaken in that you get a new spirit that's not god's spirit that's you that isn't god you get a little happy because you got a new spirit and you jump up and down run around the floor maybe shout a little bit speak with tongues run around a little bit and think you got the holy ghost that's not it that's a new spirit god gave you that's you then after he give you your spirit then he said i'll put my spirit then what's the matter with this missed meal cramps that you get that's right that's the reason you this and this is the reason we can't get anywhere 60 years we've been in a message we can't get anywhere we've not grown up we got to grow we got to grow up in god we've got to have our teaching right we've got you say brother wait you you believe you might believe this and i might believe that we might be a little off now listen was god and jesus ever at odds with each other jesus said i only do that what the father shows me only do what the father shows me it's time where everybody's doctrine has got to be the same it's a requirement to be a son of man to be in the son of man revelation we got to have the same doctrine not preach the same thing but like brother john said here they are 200 miles away from us and i don't talk to brother shambo i don't know him but preaching the same i'm preaching on the same line called brother claude the other day preaching on the same line that's god that's the holy ghost trying to get all of us to see something now notice you put a new spirit god has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you couldn't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you everybody believed brother brown was a prophet we believe what he said right okay just want to make sure we're good so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit i'll put a new spirit in them and i will put my spirit in them he said after he gives you a new spirit all right that's you that's sanctification because you know what you got to get cleaned up god doesn't have to clean itself up god doesn't have to clean up he's got to clean you up but you got to meet him you got to meet him like i said before i've had people come say huh let's i want to pray for god to give me a job i said well have you been looking no i said god's not going to come and knock on your door and say hey i got you a job that's been lazy you got to make an effort put in an application then god will help you get a job but you got to make a move lazy bunch of people i'm talking about the world can't get nobody to work anymore you remember when i know a lot of you older ones remember when the if if you could work for the post office you were set for life you had a job and you i mean man you were we haven't worked two days and they leave this is too hard for me what too hard for you to do this [Laughter] next box oh i'm sorry i gotta drive over this side next box oh i might have to pick a package up and take it to somebody that orders from amazon all the time but it's a mentality of the people give me give me give me give me give me. i'm sorry i've got on that i shouldn't that's a rabbit trail i'm off of it now but that's the spirit of the world we got to put forth some effort he said what now wait a minute here's the scripture he said if you'll draw nigh to me i'll draw nigh to you if you draw an eye to me in other words you make the move and then i'll make a move too but now wait a minute that guy's standing over here though he's going to try to make a move too be careful of the devil ain't going to hit you be careful of the devil he might hit you he's going to try to make a move too so make your motive and objection what motivate objection make sure it's right don't get it confused with god's spirit it's not that's why we're going through these three stages i want you to understand sanctification is a wonderful place to be it cleans you out man it just makes you feel so good but if you stay there satan's gonna come right back in and he's gonna make you settled he's going to just he's going to just shoot you full of stuff and make you think you're a believer please don't do that strive no like brother bob was talking about this morning if you i'm if go and say it if you can't understand this message now i don't say seals i mean if you can't put certain things together say god look you told me you could tell me these things you tell me these truths that i have come into i have come into this truth i believe it's the message of the hour i don't believe it's out there i believe it's in here no i'm talking about this four walls i'm talking about the message of the hour then god listen take him to task say god you're obligated he said oh i don't talk to god like that brother brown i'm dead the bible says come boldly to the throne of grace well who's sitting on the throne god sitting there come ball in the throne and say look you promised me right here it says if i'll do this you'll do that i can't understand this god put somebody in the pulpit give me a tape to listen to give me a sister to call me give me somebody to answer my question and you know what he's obligated to do it and you know what if you're a child of god he will do it because he's not obligated to the devil's kid so now let's make sure we're not the devil's kids hmm because he's not obligated to tell you anything if you're the devil's kids so let's get born again let's get the new birth let's get faith and then start adding if we ever get to that we'll start adding them if he ever gives it to you man because you're in your condition you in your condition never get along you can't get along with your wife can't get along with your husband can't get along with your neighbor how you ever going to get along with god so he has to give you a new spirit before you can get along with him so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his spirit in you that's the new birth gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new faith then he puts his holy spirit inside of you then he puts his spirit listen when he puts his spirit in your soul there's no room for another spirit because that burner everything god touches it burns if it's sin it burns it burns it out and when he brings his hands and he lays his hand when some brother or somebody lays hands on you to receive the holy ghost or you want to receive the holy ghost you know what's happening there's a burner there's an angel read the bible burners remember they had coals of fire that came off the altar that touched the lips about was it isaiah there's one when you come to the new birth they'll burn you out and you know what that reminds me of he said well bro wait that's i don't know how in the world that happened there was four hebrew children three hebrew children right they went in a fiery furnace that was heated seven times further more hot killed the people that put them in there and when they walked out of that fire what'd the bible say the bible didn't say that they were not just burnt their clothes weren't singed and they didn't even smell the smoke now listen we can get close to a neighbor burn in the trash and you can get wind you can get that smoke on you and you smell it for three days that's but what happened to god it's just like that fiery furnace heat it up god heat it up seven times and burn everything kill them demons and even get close to the door because those people that went up to the door guess what happened and the three hebrew children is like it's not even warm in here i'm sweating more right now than they were you know why because there was a fourth man god met him in a fire do you know what had happened if they had never made the step god would have never had to meet him but they made a step toward the fire they made a step toward the furnace and they said it doesn't matter if we get burned up we're going to meet god anyway but we're not going to bow to this world we're not going to bow to this image and you know what that image was of ow sister you're not supposed to say nothing in church be quiet i'm glad you did that though you were exactly right you know i'm just joking she said daniel that's what the image was the whole image was about there was a prophet that they were supposed to bow to oh i'm going there anyway there was an image of a prophet of the hour that they were supposed to bow to and they said we're not bound to that my god stronger than that that's flesh and blood i got a god that'll meet me in that fire i got a god that yeah that god was in daniel no doubt but that same god it was in daniel that same god that was in william branham is inside of me and you tonight amen not in the measure of being pro the prophet no not being a we're not church age messengers that was a special gift but the same holy ghost he had inside of him i got inside of me you got inside of you if you're born again we'll read it right here seeing you have purified your souls now see we're not purifying we're we're purifying the soul everybody with me as brother bob was talking about this morning we're getting the soul burn out we're getting everything we're getting everything cleaned out at sanctification and then he's going to bring the burner and make sure everything's burnt out and then he's going to put his spirit in and he's going to give you faith to receive these virtues is everybody with me amen but you gotta be born again first so listen right here purify your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit you can't obey the truth and not have the spirit of god inside of you there's part of the things you can obey but you can't obey the full spirit of god without having the spirit of god inside of you as i've said many times before brother john both of you if i were to write a love story june and i've been married for 43 years that lady sitting right beside you i got to get back here yeah you're the right one 43 years we've been married 43 years and we've went through two children a grand baby ups and downs ins and outs a lot of ups a bunch of downs but we love each other amen and i could write you a love story that would just make your face turn red but you know what if i gave that book to tony he probably read about two pages and toss it over to the side why because he wasn't a participant he didn't live through it okay it's only one page the fly leaf of the book but you understand what i'm saying you read in you read in novels and if you ever got involved if you get involved you learn more but if you're just reading words on a page you're just like oh well well jen and wade they went to alaska in 2004 man we had a wonderful time and we did this and we ate at this um sushi bar and we all we were just oh white dubs flew everywhere you know yeah y'all laughing but i ain't laughing because me and her experienced it everybody with me on this you understand what i'm saying but how if some way i know tony's not gonna like this if some way i could take my spirit that lived through that if you'll catch this you know how important the new birth is that spirit that i have me me that did those things with june if i could some way take that out and place it inside of him and then he'd read that book he'd learn a lot more because he knew what that was talking about because he had the person that wrote it inside of him that's how important the new birth is you get that man that wrote the book you get him inside of you and he's going to look through your human eyes and you're going to see and things are going to be revealed that's never been revealed before the love letter you're going to be able to watch not just read it as a as a outside person but you're going to be a participant that's the way i see the bible that's why i see the prophet's message we got to be active participants in this message not just coming to church but no actually i like what brother schrader old brother used to come here he's saying now satan he said i know you're rambling around up in my head he said but me and you fishing to read the bible me and you fiction read the bible and he said i want you to look if you're going to look through the eyes we're going to look at the bible we're going to read the bible we're going to see what the bible says about you that's a good thing to do it but it's a real good thing though to say god i i don't understand this could you drop down just a few minutes and help me read this because you wrote it and he wrote it in a way that the whole world don't understand it he wrote it in a way that 99 of the people in the world don't even really care about there's only one percent of the people in the world that knows what he was saying when he wrote that bible that's why it took a profit with a prophetic insight to come and show us how many i mean how many times do we read acts 2 38 how many times did we read that that the serpent begot eve how many times did we read all this brother brown never brought us a new bible it was already in there but what happened was is that had not been transferred the seals were closed the book was closed you could just barely see a little bit but when those things were open oh my and i don't believe he ever shut it either i believe he give it to me and you and we're supposed to read it just like he read it being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible seed by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever for all fleshes of grass and all the glory man's a flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof follow us away but look but the word of the lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you ephesians 1 verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together what one gather together in one one bride not two one bride all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him even whom also we we have obtained an inheritance obtained we just didn't get it poured i wished i could pour it down your brain but it'd do you no good without a revelation it's just words but being predestinated we have an inheritance according to the purpose of him he worked with all things after the council of his own will what is his will his will is his word he wrote this book this is a will we come every sunday to listen to the will being read cause somebody had to die to give me these words somebody had to die so that he could come back inside of me and show me what they said but this is my will your will is being read today you got this promise you got this promise you got this and then what happens when somebody dies you go to the lawyer and the lawyer says okay here's the will because you're the son of samuel and peggy dale you get everything he's got really everything yeah it says right here in the will gives you everything all the promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line we're living way below our privileges that we should be the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom also you have trusted look after you've got to hear the word to know it you've got to hear the word for it to be quickened the gospel of your salvation and him also after that you believed you believe you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance what's the earnest money down payment now you don't get the title to the house yet but you know what if you make your down payment and you make your and like i said before in this building we know we got 30 years on our houses but we've got seven payments to get this house built to get this house to where you can get the title you show brother wade uh jesus holds the title deed i thought god holds the title of deed and i thought he gave it to jesus on in revelations 5. and there was the lamb and what did he do he opened it up the prophet said and give it to his people us which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possessions of the praise of his glory john 14 verse 15 says if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father he shall give you another comforter that you may abide who he may abide with you forever look even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because they can't see him neither know him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while the world sees me no more but you'll see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that what we were talking about this morning i am in my father the father and ye and me and i in you heirs and joiners folks listen you're not a second person of god the devil is the second person of god your god if he possesses your soul your god that's why we're still here because you're not believing it oh i can't here we go with the excuses oh i can't no but he can and i just read you the will that said you were heirs and joiners whatever christ god's what you got i just read you the bible that he said i pray father that they be one like me and you are one well how was jesus in god one they were one so guess who we in christ are one adam and eve folks were literally one person now they were separated but they were literally one person if you took a dna test from adam and a dna test from eve the there's no way they they say no there's two people here he said nope one dna because she literally came out of him so that's what you and i got to come back to when we come to this body change we're going to have to literally know that we come out of god hard to believe but you better start believing it folks are we just going to keep dying we're going to keep having funerals and i brother could not speak unto you as into spiritual carnal even as into babies it's not bad to be a baby it's bad to stay a baby i have fed you with milk and not with me for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able for you are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying strife division are you not carnal and walk as men listen to first peter too wherefore laying aside all malice all guile all hypocrisy envious evil speaking as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word listen i like milk man daddy the other day he had some cornbread milk and i about stole it from him but i went home and had a steak because i like steak hey man i like milk but i like steak too but a baby desires the sincere milk of the word look that you may grow thereby if so be you have tasted that the lord is gracious first corinthians 12 3 says wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus the curse and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost there's no way you can have these virtues there's no way you can understand this message of the hour uh sister anna come on that would come with another another sister bless her heart we were talking about and and she's like well i know about serpent seed and i know about well so did i when i was 14 years old i knew the major what you want to say major revelation doctrines but i didn't know how to fit them in the word because i wasn't born again and i proved that because i went out in the world for about 20 years but i knew that it was not an apple in the garden common sense could tell you that brother brown didn't he say one time he said that's just an ability to read but what about a revelation though what about when god came and gave me the new birth when all those pieces then i i all just began to fit and they fit together and they fit together and they weren't contrary one to the other that's to me that's the new birth simon peter's servant apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith look you've got to obtain it something you got to get remember meet him he'll meet you with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and jesus our lord according as what he is divine power there's only one divine power and that's god has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue who by our given unto us exceeding great and precious promises what these promises right here that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature now that's partakers of the divine nature that's god when he comes in your soul burns you out gives you his nature burns your nature out listen he doesn't kill your soul you'd be dead he kills the nature that's attached to it because you have an old nature he we're going to now take the divine nature of god having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add besides this besides this giving all diligence add to your faith remember faith is not an ad add to your faith virtue knowledge one two three four five six seven seven ads we're talking about right here in numbers 34. we don't have to look at the chart again i don't think but remember moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the land which you shall inherit we had a prophet of god that he walked through us through the wilderness of sin he walked with the pentecostals he walked with the different ones they saw signs miracles and wonders and they still denied him they still turned him down you take them you take the uh the life of moses and the life of brother branham and the life of paul and you put them all together and they all just kind of coincide with each other all right he led us up to he led us up to the promised land but brother branham was not here positionally by in human flesh to place us right the holy ghost is going to place us by what moses said by what the prophet of god said we're going to be placed in this land nothing nothing against the prophet we listen besides jesus christ he's the greatest man that ever walks on the face of this earth the greatest man that ever walks on the face of this earth is william man branham except for jesus christ i just believe that he was a prophet he was a born-again christian he was adopted he had the he had the revelation of the seals he brought everything that we needed opened the scriptures to me i really don't care brother john whoever whichever john i want to talk to whichever if they they can say what they want to about brother branham i really don't care about his well here we go again about his life he led me to god he brought clarity to the message not the message he preached to the message that we got right here he brought clarity to this and i thank god for that and he's going to get a great portion of heaven but so are me and you because we're followers as we were talking uh yesterday uh talking to somebody and we're not followers of william branham we follow the message we're the we're in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we know we had to be off the scene for it to be the voice in us same way with moses moses had to be off the scene so that joshua could take him to the promised land and positionally place him into the promised land and i believe listen i said before and i'll say it again i believe that you can get born again by listening to tapes and reading books but you can't grow you cannot grow without a five-fold ministry or god's gonna have to take the bible and change it because the fifo ministry for the perfecting of the saints amen and that's bible that's your inheritance that's what i trust you know what i put my trust in that because that's what god said hallelujah and moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the land which you shall inherit by lot which the lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes and half tribes i remember there were twelve for the tribe of children of reuben according to the house of their fathers a tribe of gad we were looking at the poster this morning you don't have to pull it up had received their inheritance and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance the two tribes and a half tribe received their inheritance on this side jordan near jericho eastward toward the sun rising so under moses under moses moses taught the people there is a promised land and we're going to it i've brought you out my message has brought you out of egypt and we're walking in the wilderness of sin sanctification it cleaned all them out hello somebody it cleaned them out it got rid of them old fighters they just started dying and god started killing them with plagues he was what he was sanctifying his people he was getting rid of the old unbelievers the old fighters he was getting rid of the ones that doubted god and he raised up a 20 year old group and and below and they're the ones that went over and possessed the land that's where you and i are it doesn't matter what age you are today we're in that time to where we're that group of people that's to possess our property percent possess our land the 12 times of israel we don't have i'm going to skip through that but what happened is remember this morning you had reuben and gat on this side of the jordan river what does jordan mean death on this side of the jordan river and a half triumphant tribal manasseh well there was another half tribe went into the promised land but all these that's why it takes justifications sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost to even get you to the promised land then you've got to enter into promised land and fight your way because even reuben and gad and half tribe manasseh they said we'll go in and fight listen that's the holy ghost fighting your battles for you and he positionally places us into land that's our mandate that's our adoption is our placing but look right here brother brown said virtue must be in us and until we get virtue then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall now first you must have faith faith alone won't do it you peter said then add virtue to your faith you must have virtue in order to add it to your faith now then it might be the reason you don't have it because many churches of today teach you you don't have to have it let us oh well that's just demo denominations no that's just in my message churches be quiet if you want to but we got to have true teaching we got to have somebody to teach us to get out of here we're not just going to get out of here because there's a day on on the calendar and it's just x and there's the day and that's the day we're going to go in the rapture and that's it that's not right we're gentiles we don't have a time we don't have 1260 days we don't have any kind of time we're not we're not told we have a day no man knows the day or hour because we're gentiles but it's when the last one comes in and gets ready they teach you you don't have to have it of the days of its past they don't have to have it the only thing you have to do is just join a church yep days has passed so real quick if you look on the chart you'll see that god down through the church ages and i'll read the quote here in just a few minutes god was building a body this is the bride this is the body of christ and he built it under the revelation of the son of god believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved get the virtues in your life live a good christian life you know what i've read the quote the other day that brother branham gave us but you and i are required further than that you and i are required more of the open book we're not required just what seven church ages because the early church ages had these virtues they had these virtues we're trying to get them and the early church already had them peter couldn't have preached it if he didn't already have it all right let's read the unveiling of god 1964. but god is still make just to make the same notice what does it do it finally returns back to the original seed again when he comes in the form of martin luther when he comes in the form of john wesley when he comes in the form of the pentecostals he is supposed to reveal himself again like the same seed went in the son of man he revealed himself as son of god through the stalk age and so forth but in this last age he's to reveal himself as the son of man again get it congregation says amen i doubt they got any of that all right like the beginning molded and what does that stalk grow it's growing all the time that little stalk grows still it's not like the original grain neither was luther's message no along come the other message finney thank you not calvin what believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved right believers listen as i said before millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of christians every how many christians they are are never going to hear william branham only this small group of people in the end time and not just the ones that hear the ones that what act on his message it's going to be a very very small group of people that's even going to know brother brown was even on this earth that's why i thank god he gave me an opportunity let's don't squander it let's don't squander it he gave you an opportunity that he didn't even give the apostle paul that's the revelation of the seals the open book paul could see it by revelation he could see there was something coming i see through a glass darkly i see but i see jesus see he come back he'd come back he said but i see jesus he said but i know there's something coming everybody every prophet brother bryan said whatever prophet would want to white live in this day because they prophesied this day right here fenney sankey knocks calvin on down none of them they were still the message listen list they were still the message but what it was they didn't get the complete revelation of it because it wasn't time you can't put the ear on the corn before it's time to come i planted corn the other day as i said before i got some really pretty rows about eight rows of them i i wanted to make it in eternity so i did eight rows eight rows of them and i didn't go out there and start pulling them up and say well i got i got some cob right here on this corn i'm gonna start putting in the freezer no you know what you just pulled up the plant and finally there comes back again the original seed because one day in about six more weeks i'm gonna walk out there and that stalk is about this tall now it's gonna be about this tall it's gonna have went through a process and it's gonna have ears on it and i can take that ear if it's if it's um heirloom corn i can take that ear i can put it up in a place and i can dry it and i can plant next year proving his word los angeles listen as i said the other night he comes in three names the son of god son of man son of david when he was on earth the first time he was the son of man he could not be the son of god then he never claimed to be because what is the son of god god in spirit form everybody with me say amen those of you that are asleep can say ma'am it is a little hot up here aaron you got the is it this thing not working we're a lot of people are fanning if you don't mind can come look and see he's our hvac guy he's a good preacher too he said he was the son of man when anybody would question him he said you see the son of man the son of man now son of man is a prophet he had to come that way because the scripture he cannot come contrary to the scripture that's why today our message of this hour cannot come through theologians in theology it's got to come back the same thing it promised to do it must be that way so we find out in this man this man he had to be a prophet listen boaz was a man he was a flesh and blood man he had to do the rite of redemption ruth as a man because they were kin as a man not son of god he had to be the son of man jehovah himself called the prophets jeremiah them son of man when you see the son of man who is the son of man they kept asking then he served his office as the son of man on earth then he served his office now as son of god god is a spirit and when now he served through the church ages as the son of god everybody with me so through the church seven church ages he was the son of god what god in spirit form the holy ghost the comforter he is now living inside of the believers but look they are they are they are um limited to the word that they get they're limited to the word they get everybody with me on that they're limited to the revelation that the prophet of their time brings because listen god wanted it to be in this end time in the evening time it shall be light down here is where it's going to be perfected but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spoke to the child i thought as a child but when i became a man we're not to be the son of baby we're to be the son of man amen i put away my childish things and we know perfect men of full age i like this one brought to its end we're bringing this thing to an end the gentile dispensation will be brought to an end by the bride of jesus christ realizing who she is and what she's doing here ephesians 4 11 he gave some apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers for what for the perfecting of the saints so the saints were being perfected down through the church ages but they never did come to perfection because they without us cannot be made perfect till we all come to the unity of the faith and that's our problem we have a and the knowledge of the son of god until what a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried away with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of man and cunning craftness where they lie and wait to deceive but speaking to what truth in love may grow up in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole whole body fitly joined together compacted by that whichever joint supply according to the effectual working the measure of every part that's why i like yesterday that at the nursing home there or the assistant living home that was parts working sisters were playing the guitar and playing the piano and playing this and playing that brother bob was speaking and and brother um luis was singing and we had singers and we had people there clapping their hands and we had support group there that was the working of the body of christ he said oh brother that was too simple we won't we thought maybe the there had to be a halo in the room or something or there was you just didn't see it there was y'all brought a pill of fire with you didn't you okay we're living below our means i tell you again increase of the body into the edifying of itself in love i want to read this one right here real quick first corinthians 14 19. everybody believe the bible is correct amen yet in the church i would rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown language 10 000 words in an unknown language apostle paul said i'd rather speak five words with my understanding that my that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue brother be not children and understanding how being in malice be children because children are gonna be children but you gotta grow up but in understanding be men in the law it was written with men of other tongues and other lips while speaking to his people and yet for all that they will not hear me saith the lord wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying service not for them that believe not but for them which believe give me some prophecy first corinthians 2 verse 9 says but as it is written i have not seen our ear heard neither entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them he didn't keep them he revealed them to who trees cars buildings houses no human flesh there's got to be human flesh in the end time for god to not just that's right but god has to reveal them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god you know the spirit searches and whatever you let allow him to work in your life he'll do it he searches he goes out through the building he searches i need this all right drop it down i need this drop it down i need to touch from god drop it down i need a new birth drop it down there's angels today if we could see in another realm i believe they're not just going like some of y'all are doing thank god angels don't sleep my guardian angel would get me killed but think about it they're working all the time there's another dimension that's faster than this one and they're just working like crazy trying to give you some revelation trying to let the holy ghost work in your life for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit that's in him that's exactly right when you were in the world you understood the world but when you get the baptism of the holy ghost you ought to be able to understand god even the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words of man's wisdom teaches not not that's not knowledge to know how to make a's in school that's holy ghost knowledge to know whether i'm telling you the truth today or not know where the bread around is telling you the truth no word preacher's telling you the truth or not but that which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned listen we are spiritual people we should be spiritual people let that thing that's inside of you work its way out you either got a devil spirit in you or you got god spear there's only two amen then when we get that settled we got to work on to the outside person sister shepard was worried about being born again this is her dream she dreamed she was on the mountain he's talking about i don't have the paper i'm going to paraphrase down through here i'm sorry she dreamed that she saw a rock box like a framework sitting on top of this mountain and her husband was just behind her and she saw a large van standing there work clothes on sleeves rolled up bailing the most pure water that she ever seen and poured it into this box pouring it into the box now remember the headstone hadn't come yet i got to know there's another over there that's got different screen but this is gone so he was pouring it down in here because this was the message he was to bring the first part of his message everybody with me and the rock box would not hold the water and it rolled right down there and just balled up all the trash now where was that trash coming from it was coming from inside sister shepard because this was her he was pouring the water in water of the word in and trash was coming out oh brother wait after the new birth you got trash yes yes your memory reason conscious affection imagination is trashy and god is working on that if you've got the new birth he's not working on your soul it is him he's working on your memories and conscious effects and imagination and boiled up all the trash and sticks trash and everything in there and boiled it out i like that if you want to purify something what do you do you boil it boil it out and roll down that mountain and it rolled right over her feet and she was standing right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her it didn't stick to her she was getting a revelation that that's not going to stick to her it might have come out of her but it's not going to stick amen let me read this real quick and then we'll close i'm going to skip this and we'll talk about it next week brother we should be y'all need to pray for him this this wednesday night you love the lord that's some good stuff right there but i'm gonna pass to it watch this right here by the way do i get everything i need is a new birth yeah you get the whole house you get the whole house you are the house but there's doors inside those doors thank god for a prophet for in the human heart is just like the door there to the house after you come in come in sir sit down who's that the holy ghost come in sit down but these other little doors i don't want you fooling around in my house hmm i want to speak in a few of those doors all kinds of little private doors in your private life jesus can be in your savior save your butt don't you never try to tell me what to do lord hmm i know what i want to do and don't you never try to rule me that's the attitude of many people who profess christianity am i hitting home somewhere brother brown said in klamath falls oregon in 1960 here's another sermon you know look after you get inside of the door of the heart you know there's some more little doors in there lots of little doors in the house you go and have a little closet here and a little room over here and a little room over here there are several doors many people are ready to welcome the lord into their heart because they don't want to go to hell but they don't want him to be lord when he comes in well if i come into your house and say well come in brother brown well you know what i'd do i'd come in go down the refrigerator get me a piece of cheese and some bologna i would too and sliced me off a piece of onion and cut me some bread and mustard on it and some lettuce i'm hungry and everything and go in and take off my shoes and lay across the you wouldn't do that at mama's house don't try to do that in her house okay and lay across the that's a do a fold or across the bed and eat the sandwich you won't need to sandwich your mama's bed either and drink a soft drink he's but no brother brown's making a point he's making himself at home the holy ghost is feeling comfortable but hang up your hat if you said welcome i take you at your word but do you really welcome the lord jesus take him at his word so can you take us at our word now let's look around some of these little doors in the heart for the next few minutes the first little door you turn to there's a door there called pride oh my you know you don't want to know jesus standing in that door because he'll take all of it out of you he swings that door right open oh if you could you say now wait a minute jesus you can save me but don't go to messing around with my pride everybody still believe brother brown was a prophet i everybody got quiet so okay just make sure make sure i hadn't trans-migrated into another place you can save me but don't you go to messing around with my pride now if i'm going to have to stand up there and act like some of these people do i couldn't do it then he's not welcome let me say this he won't stay very long either you can just depend on that i wouldn't stay if you told me that you wouldn't stay if i told you that so won't stay if we tell him that pride well now i tell you brother branham if i'm going to have to get down there on that alter crime make my girlfriend hate me my boy friend turner turned me down my wife tells me i'm a holy roller my husband says i've lost my mind now if you're going to do that something like that stay out jesus that's just exactly what they say so much i'll not do it those virtues will unlock every door in your personal life your private life of things and your memory reason conscious affection imagination that are bothering us and keeping us in this world that's what we got to clean up next is our memory reason conscious effects and imagination and i'm going to tell you something else that love that's up there on top of that pyramid that ain't a love that you know until you get to there sure you get a little piece of it at the new birth you get perfect love but it's a little bitty piece of it brother brown said a button did he not say he said you get the holy ghost you get a little button that button has got to grow though but that love up there is not love like you love your wife it's not love like you love your family it's not lovely you say i love to play ball i love to do this i love to sing i love to play instruments that ain't the love that's talking about when we get to that love it's probably gonna burn our hide call this god's love and his love is corrective and his love is what pure unadulterated there is no ulterior motive in that love i love my wife because because what because she cooks good looks good that's going yeah can't you cook and sister sister sister edie's going to get you thank you for poor zach you won't have to eat out we eating out no more but listen as we love god with whatever we've got it's just a little bit above filial love come on memory reason conscious affection most of our love is affection we have for here but when you love god we're supposed to give him everything we got because his love is unconditional unconditional to us our love should be unconditional back to him but we don't we have conditions brother branham pride he keeps on doubt i didn't read all of man he goes to a bunch of them but that's what's going to happen when we go through that statue of perfect man when we go through those virtues those are not virtues that man knows anything about those are the virtues of almighty god contrary to everything we've ever seen virtue you know live a virtuous life and be a virgin brother brown said that ain't it he said that virtue is strength that virtue is power that virtue is something you've got to have already inside of you he said oh brother brown said i'll just get some virtue you can't buy this it has to be developed inside of you you have to be born again by the spirit of god and then let those things work let god in and let him if he has to kick the door down let's stand our feet let him have his way have we really done that i asked myself the same question have we really done that just let him have his way no sometimes we get in the way most of the time we get in the way that's our problem we've been in a way a long time we need to get out of the way let go and let god have his wonderful way musicians come we'll sing one song then we'll go to the baptismal service god bless you we love you with the love of the lord i hope you at least you listen enough to stir something up in your heart i want you to study i want you to say what is that man talking about if you've never heard that before what what do you mean we got to go further in god listen you don't want your kids to stay babies oh they're beautiful they're young they're sweet they're innocent i want mine to grow up you don't want god wants us to grow up not be babies and not have to be babied listen god's coming back after a wife he's not coming back after a bride his wife has made herself ready his wife has made herself ready the armored meat packing girl she didn't just lay down for a year and not do nothing in the story no i believe she said all right this is the day he's coming and i got to be ready i got to get on the right garment i got to make sure i can learn to cook and i can learn to make clean clothes and i can learn to wash the dishes you know i'm talking about spiritual we got to learn these virtues and let them become a part of our life to where we don't have to be made to do it we want to do it i'm not made to love you and i love her i love her with all my heart it's a it's a relationship that we've developed with each other have we made that relationship with god have we developed i y'all know as well as i do when you first got married you know a lot about each other it was mainly for one thing companionship lust getting getting to live with the wife and somebody that's pity and you think they smell good and and but what do you do afterwards you develop you start talking about things hey you want to have some kids yeah let's have some kids you want you want to do this you want to do that you develop into that into those things you you're lying if you said oh i love my wife now as much as it did the day of marriage no i don't think so come on somebody but you can you say that about god the day you got born again are you still just that little bit in love when you should be so in love with him some of us have been christians 20 30 40 50 years what's our issues we need virtue knowledge temperance patience god that's why these virtues are so important and they're being so ill-taught in the message we need these virtues to even to get to to where the capstone can come down it's got to come down on that we got we'll get to that eventually but that's what's got to settle down onto is the what the whole bride of jesus christ letting all those virtues work in their life and then the headstone is going to come and sit down on top then we're going to take a body change then we're going to really you're going to see the power of the church then brother brown said we'll see it and i believe we will we'll see a church on fire and not just on fire but it'll do the will of god and not back up be able to speak and it happen not have to cry and beg and try to find a pastor okay that's what we're heading to that's why we need these virtues and we need them working in our life we need them working so that we can work toward this son of man revelation which is what the seals and it's the thunders and all we'll get into that later on but don't let that don't let that muddle your mind up let's just all make sure we're born again let's all make sure that foundation is real sturdy then let's start building the house you can't start building a house from the walls down or from the roof down you start from the what foundation up start with the foundation if you're not born again if listen what brother dale always tell us he said seek god every day of your life and ask for the new birth he said i'd rather know i had it yes 20 years ago then for me to think i had it 20 years ago and don't have it now seek god every day every day god fill me with the holy ghost god give me lord these virtues give me these give me these promises they're mine i'm your child i'm crying out listen if if uh one of your little babies was in a crowd of people you've done it before you've been in different places and you you kids start screaming daddy or mama you know exactly whose voice that is right sisters you can pick that voice out from 5 000 people standing in a stadium and somebody goes mama what's the first thing you do say that's my kid now all the other mothers are mothers right but they didn't hear that voice that's the same way with god that's why there's going to be silence in heaven because god's going to be listening to his bride god's not going to be listening to the angels he's going to be listening to his bride because his bride's going to have something to say we are going to have something to say in this world to take a body change we're going to have to have something to say we got to have something to say that no one else has said is death you will not destroy this body death come up your sleeve you just well we get scared of the toothache we get scared of our harder flutter me i'm talking about me yeah your heart starts fluttering the first thing you do is looking for microglycerin pills we're just not to the point yet i'm sorry but we're getting there i believe we keep keep striving and keep driving i believe we'll get there to where we speak and god will back it up we've seen it already happen in a small portion in this church we've seen the third pool happen several times here where things have been spoken into existence spoke out of existence spoken to where these things were and where they were not and all that we've seen that several times here in this church dead raised by just a screaming of a brother's name just like jesus at lazarus tomb same thing we've seen it here in part but i want to see it like brother brown said one time pop like popcorn have you ever been to a place where they got these big we got them downstairs we got a big popcorn popper and buddy when all them pop all those corn when he gets hot when all that corn starts popping man it goes pop pop pop pop pop pop pop you just can't hear anything but the popping of the corn that's what i want in this church that's what i want in us i want to just pop every service i want something to pop amen amen devil will definitely he will get agitated and i know he's going to but that's okay that's his job but you know what god's job is to protect us sing a song then we're going to go have a baptism think about the original life god's attributes were manifested in his breath in this last days by the last prophet's message and we know who we are [Music] the original sea the original word is what i believe the son of man [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] did you believe [Music] [Applause] [Music] the original word is [Music] the original scene we [Music] [Music] the original word is what i believed it's revealed the seventh seal is unveiled the original lot the original seeds you believe that that's us every song was written brother john he knows that being song leaders there's there's a there was a group that came by and they sang i'll fly away some glad morning when this life is over then there's a group that come by and they they sang my name is written in heaven then they have a then we got a group that comes by and they they sing about the blood then you know i'll fly away and it says well we're going to die talks about dying well these songs that we're singing now the bride songs we've raised it up a notch we've got a revelation that somebody's not going to die somebody's going to walk off this world without seeing any piece of death whatsoever [Music] oh death may be all the way around us but somebody is going to stand like jesus did at the tomb of lazarus and say saints come out of the ground and they're not going to die i can't die i'll be raptured by and by i'll fly away amen god bless you if you want to be baptized sisters get with sister june if brother wants to be baptized see brother terence we need to go and get that circulator out from there and you take all the stuff off of it i i think he may be he's going down but if you want to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ the water's ready i know we got one for sure may have two or three but please don't rest until you get everything right and we take get into the steps and just like sister roo she said i'm putting the stake down right here this is it no more [Music] and let that spiritual rudder take us somewhere let that thing give us we got a journey you're on a human journey anyway so let's make it a human journey with god amen let's make it let's let's meld the human journey with god and then let's walk in god in our human journey because we are going to be in a human journey until we take a body change it's going to be a human journey we're going to journey we're going to have trials and tribulations heartaches but there's going to be a city that we're going to live in no sorrow no pain [Music] when we enter that city when they're redeemed they're gathering in the saints are all going to listen because they cannot join this song they can't sing the song of redemption because they never were redeemed so they're gonna have to be silent when we walk in that city but i'll promise you one thing's for sure we will not be silent we will not be silent because we'll know where we come from and we'll know where we ended up at the angels all will listen for they cannot join that song when they're redeemed are gathering in let's dismiss dear lord thank you this day that you give us father we pray that we continue in the furthem
