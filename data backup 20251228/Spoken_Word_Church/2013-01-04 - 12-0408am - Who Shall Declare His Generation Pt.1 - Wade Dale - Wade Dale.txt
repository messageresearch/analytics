different we're going to kind of take a spiritual aspect brother Daniel said something when tonight to kind of spark my attention but we're still going to be on the family but today we're going to talk about the family of Jesus Christ amen and the title of the sermon will be who shall declare his generation who shall declare his generation Our genealogy which is a what family all right who shall declare his family turn to Isaiah 53 and we'll read scripture there they should have all this up they doing a wonderful job all the these quotes and everything we won't have as many quotes today we're going to read a lot of scripture but we're going to we're going to dwell on two points today going to take time dwell on two points today one is Adam and Eve and and the what happened in the genealogy in the Garden of Eden and then we're going to look at why the Holy Ghost wasn't given in the Old Testament they're not part of the family of God as in Sons and Daughters of God coming straight from God they're the Bible even calls um calls Abraham a friend of God right all right so they're not in the family as far as sons and daughters and we're going to try to cover those two points pretty well today and then maybe next week if that's okay we'll get back on the the natural family but going to give you a couple of testimonies that um uh two I want to thank everybody for taking part yesterday and we need to thank our pastor for for supplying all the food and and all the entertainment and then a wonderful Bible study and I physically counted about 75 people so so it

drive that bus that that church bus has got 30,000 Mi on it and it's about 10 years old so it's we need to run some miles off of that thing so going to Kansas we'll do that I promise you but anyway one more thing um I want to kind of put it in your mind that starting in June or July when June and I finish this Financial Peace University class that we're that we coordinating at Keller Williams uh some of you have said you wanted to do it but the only way we can do it is do it here and if it's all right with Dad we can do it here after second service it'll be 2 hours but we'll start right after second service and have it downstairs I don't want to have it up here so we'll just take the projector downstairs go back there but I really want to know if you want to do it you need to write it down and give it to Sister June or will uh keep asking you but but the 23 people that we are dealing with now which a lot of them 18 of them are from this church and 6 weeks we have saved as a total group of 23 people we have saved $35,000 and paid off $32,000 in debt Amen in 6 weeks amen nothing special nothing nobody's Grandma Rich grandma died or anything like that we just took our money and put a name to it all right so that will um and some of you that are that are there you you can testify to the ones that maybe want to go but um we may think we know how to handle money but we may need to sharpen a pencil a little bit too so but out of 23 people in 6 weeks just in 6 weeks those same people have took what money they make and saved put $35,000 more in savings and paid off $32,000 in debt that they had and June and I was one of them we just paid off our last one last week so we are debt free uh except for a little bit on the house so we don't have any extra debt so the Bible says that the borrower will always be slave to the lender always always Isaiah 53 let's bow our head dear heavenly father we pray today Lord that you'd come Among Us in a special way yes Lord Lord we know that 2000 years ago Lord you you're already out walking about doing the things Lord that you wanted to do before there was a fall you wanted to walk on this Earth in a glorified body and Lord you you were doing that and people didn't believe you and they they didn't trust what was going on and they didn't listen to what you were saying but father maybe with 2,000 years of teaching that we can listen to what you you have already said in your word and through the prophet's message that you have risen and Lord You've risen in our hearts you the quote of what a resurrection that was but Lord what a resurrection is to bring us out of dead denominational thinking Lord to bring us into the Glorious Liberty of Jesus Christ give us eternal life while we're standing here on the earth father we pray that you'd be with each one Lord take care of the ones that are sick and not with us the ones that are on the highways brother boy and Sister Janet them that are on the highways there in Louisiana will be coming back tonight Lord give them strength and bless them Father take care of each one of us that are away from the church Lord just be with them be with the sin sick Lord bring them into the fold Lord the the list Lord that we go over every day in our minds Lord that's right down below my feet now in the Sunday school class Lord I pray that you just go to their hearts Lord and and PR their hearts Lord and bring them back to you father we pray that you just be with us now take care of us lead us and guide us by your holy spirit let only thing be said Lord that you want to be said nothing said wrong or out of line Lord we pray that you'd just be with us take care of the missionaries on the Foreign Fields Lord we pray that you give them fruit for their labor and bless them as they go and travel and do and spread your gospel father just be with us forgive us of our sins and our daily mistakes that we make Lord just be a part of our life in Jesus name we pray amen Isaiah 53:1 who hath believed thy report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground now remember who he talking about Jesus Christ growing up he have no form or commonness in when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as it was our face from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely Heath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but that was man's idea right but he was W was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his Strife we are healed now remember that happened in his body all right all we have all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way now that's you and I being lost and out in the world right and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all amen he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears his dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison here's the here's the theme of the of the message he was taken from prison and from judgment PR come from prison went to Pilot's Hall they judged him and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living in other words he was killed right if a man's dead his his genealogy ends right all right who shall declare his generation question mark for he was cut off of cut off of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken you may be seated in the Lord add his Blessing to the of his word and let's go now to Daniel 9 cuz we're going to see today we're going to take a natural part we're going to look at the Eternal genealogy of God but we're going to see the natural part remember the two points we're going to deal with today and and like I said Wednesday night brother Daniel did a wonderful job and he brought a lot of things out that were that were just really wonderful but I want to kind of expound on it and and maybe take two services and and kind of expound on on the family of Jesus Christ or the family of God because who shall declare somebody's got to declare his generation it's not Jesus Christ died 2,000 years ago when he's done finished and we're all that we're not children of God we have nothing to do with with our heavenly father but that's not the way God wanted it he saw remember he predestinated before the foundation of the world put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life So Daniel 9:24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to do six things right cuz look at these six things in in chapter 53 of Isaiah and this is the sixfold purpose is what he's doing remember he come to get Israel but watch he was cut off just like he was cut off here should have Clare as generation and make an end of s finish transgression make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring an everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and anoint the most holy all right give you a little key brother Daniel said something last week about the resurrection starting from within the Earth yeah I'll read you something in a few minutes know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and build Jerusalem to the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks that 7 we period then there's a 62 we period right everybody knows that in Daniel 70 weeks the street shall be built again the wall even troublous time now that's a that is a prophecy of a natural happening right right that's going to happen and it already has happened cuz after three score in two weeks what on the 69 after the 69 weeks yeah two I mean the 62 and 7even Y right that's 69 after the three after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off go back to Isaiah same thing right who shall declare his generation because he cut off from the land of the living right all right and after three score in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself amen he didn't die just for himself he didn't die just for Israel he didn't he died for us and Israel all right but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city that's the Gentile and the sanctuary that was Titus and the end thereof shall be with the flood until the end of the war desolations are determined but he was cut off what he was cut off so that who could come in you and I could come in right is that correct you he cut off Daniel 70 week shows that the Messiah week is 7 week how many so one week is 7 years so 3 and 1/2 years he preached he was cut off and he's got 3 and 1/2 more to preach but we know there's a one more week period cuz if you keep on going which we're not going to talk about Daniel 70 weeks today but there's three periods the first one the second one is 62 the first one is right here right all right then there's another week and in the midst of the week of the other time coming up they're going to make a covenant and then in the middle of that week right natural all right but look at the spiritual part he was cut off but not for himself he was cut off among the land of living why was he cut off he was cut off because of what happened in the Garden of Eden right the natural lineage of Jesus there was no natural lineage right so it wasn't that he was being cut off for himself he was being cut off to get you and amen out of him right all right so now is't that correct amen cuz we're bottled up inside of Jesus Christ we're bottled up inside of almighty God before the foundation of the world we're not some floating vessel over here and God some floating vessel over here right no we were born in His image now let's go to my favorite scripture Genesis 1 26 and 27 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air that's what Adam and Eve were doing right right and over the cattle and over the Earth because what's going to happen this part of God this this part of God that moved over went into Genesis 27 right Genesis 126 man into the 27 man correct this is not flesh man this is Spirit man all right over F of the air and over the C and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them right that's a them not a thee all right created he them now this scripture is the Eternal genealogy of God Amen exactly right this is his children right this is not Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph um John the Baptist this is the children of the Kingdom right the least in the kingdom is greater than John now John got the Holy Ghost yes he did but he didn't get the new birth right he wasn't born into the family of God right amen he received an anointing just like Abraham Isaac Jacob that's why we're going to read in a minute that they were given to us for examples not full examples you can't type Abraham all the way through Abraham's Journey don't go give your wife away twice right don't laugh at God right but remember God God said let us make man this was the part of God that brother R said this Genesis 126 man went into the two7 man now now remember this is the generation of God Amen this is The Book of Life The Eternal section right brother D's going to be covering that you watch that book go all the way to to Revelations 5 right amen this is the book in Revelations 5 right the redeemed this is the redeemable exactly the others are not redeemable this is redeemable why because you were before the foundation of the world God saw you listen right put you in a family album this group right here in the spiritual never needed regeneration right this group never needed regeneration this group was perfect this group was God made manifest in another form right called Sons and Daughters amen amen right amen this is not mankind this is man the only M that ever was and that's Christ right this is Christ we are Christ made manifest in another form God takes this and remember you take the one seed and put it in the ground it grows a tree that has many apples one seed many apples one seed remember Galatians 3 we're going to read those scriptures right but this is the family album of God before the foundation of the world right before the foundation of the world this happened right let's look at the first quote questions and answers now look take a cell you break it down from a cell and it comes into a cell and a cell into an molecule down like that and finally it ends up into the Unseen it goes from a natural something you put your hand on to gases from gases to acid acid to gases gas GES on back like that till it finally all winds up to one little thing and that is Spirit yeah and this Spirit who has occupied these gases he's talking about us human beings when we die and go away it might not be the same gases but the features that you are will be exactly what they are again amen see the spirit has control that if the spirit of him that rais up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he will also Quicken your what moral mortal body your Soul's already quickened by the new birth amen all right and now in other words when you become a young man or young woman and like God takes a picture of you that's right now no matter but now look be careful be careful cuz watch the quote down at the bottom God takes a picture of you now no matter how old or wrinkled disfigured whatever it be that will wind right on down through and that body may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up my lines whatever but it was made up of gases let me tell you something God thinks enough of your flesh so he's going to preserve it all right so we're going to watch that now because remember everybody we talking about Adam Adam was the man earthy right amen and he had a we're in Adam's race yeah Adam's what family I'm looking at Adam's genealogy flesh right that was calcium and potach and petroleum and Cosmic light and so forth all goes together to make up the body now no matter that the whole Earth is filled with that yeah but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and acids and things come right back into the place and develops this picture again exactly now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 right when was it taken amen before there was a foundation of the world right Genesis 1:26 and 27 came into being amen right before there was a foundation of the world it was put in God's Great file family album amen and then only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice right amen see then you become a servant of God him knowing it makes him a redeemer as we've been through it then that picture is absolutely this is the negative right we think this is so great and so wonderful this is the negative of the positive picture right this the pictures absolutely this is the negative look how much God thinks of us amen back before there was any time he knew how many children he was going to have he knew their names he knew what they're going to look like and he put them in an album and he preserved us the negative part of life is where you're living now and you know what he didn't do he didn't go preserve it in somebody else he preserved it in himself right right and anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative right therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere amen and this isn't the real thing right this is only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come now you get it so I don't care what you would do with you they cannot destroy that profile that picture in God's Great Gallery up there sounds like we're declaring somebody's gener doesn't it right it cannot destroy it it's in heaven right you can burn it up feed it to the lines do anything any way you want to it'll come forth again just as sure as the two twos is four amen just as sure as God spoke it it'll come forth so no matter where you are in other words no matter what happens to you do not worry right God has already got a position that's a place for you amen if you're a son and daughter of God if you've made your choice exactly to be a son and daughter of God so we are truly spoken word seed children forget about the natural right now right we're spoken word seeed children it did not take a sexual act to get us in God right come on we going to look at Adam and Eve here in just a minute it's not it did not take a sexual act to get you in the family of God right it was a spiritual spoken brother BR preach the spoken word is the Original Seed all right so let's don't worry so much about here and there and here and there let's go to Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed through his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul right man became a living Soul Adam become walking around had the Genesis 126 he was the son of God he was eternal right in his soul he was eternal right amen right now go to verse and you get up 18 and you're going a little bit further and the Lord God said it's not do we've already read these remember we went through when we talked about the man and the woman but let's that's why I said hold your point we'll get back to the spiritual but let's see what happened in the natural the Lord God said it's not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meat what we say that was help meat one suitable to help him amen all right and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field male and female right every file of the air male and female brought them under Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof why Adam was a Son of God he had the mind of Christ for his day listen I said for his day cuz you got to watch what he did afterwards but he had the mind of Christ for his day and Adam was there and and I'm sorry and Adam gave names to all the cattle foul the air in other words he sees the male and the female coming up and God already told them to multiply replenish the Earth right so by so by sex they were going they were multiplying and replenishing the Earth cuz they had the organs for it and that's the way God animals that done mind you don't have to cover animal up when they're when they're breeding you understand what I'm saying everybody okay with that cuz what because they're they're lower form they're they're living they're living life but they're not a soul they're not something with a conscience to say I shouldn't do that or I should do that no that just what happens by Nature right so Adam sees all that cuz remember Adam's got the mind of God that's he's a living soul but he's got the mind of God remember he was God of the Earth right and Adam gave names to all the cattle foul of the air beast of the field but for Adam see Adam Saw 2 by two 2 by two 2 by two 2 by two but for Adam it was just him it was not found a help meet suitable a help suitable for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof now remember he closed the flesh up and the rib which the Lord God took from the man he made a woman and brought her under man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man amen the word woman means a man with a womb right so now now Adam and Eve can do what God told him to do in Genesis 1:26 and 27 right multiply and replenish the Earth right but now not by sex but by Spoken Word every how you figure it can come that doesn't matter we were not supposed to have sex to bring kids period all right you say well what about the organs I'll read it to you in a minute oh I can't read it to you the diglot the diglot says animal flesh we were put we were made animal when we read about earthy about over there in Corinthians where Adam was was made Earth the man earthy that actually said animal yeah so we're animal flesh this is this is the highest form of animal flesh so if an animal boy had a and an animal girl had a keep it in your mind yeah then Adam and Eve had to have the same parts or they would be they would not be in the creation line rightly God created amen Genesis 2:7 man was not something out of the line no he come right up through because remember in Romans 8 the whole creation fell because of Adam but now if he would have been something different the creation wouldn't have fa right but since he fell the whole creation fell below it all right so God put that 126 and 27 man into Adam to reproduce himself then he brings a part out therefore shall man leave his father and mother and shall clle to his wife and they shall be one flesh looks like that kind of what we're ending up to now right all right so now number two Blasphemous name dad's read this many times let's read it again but now here Jehovah Witness in their book it says that the breath that you breathe is a soul which they call it aoya if you want to read on down through there but let's just read the other save time now take the scripture from back and God breathed breath into his nostrils and he began a living Soul now I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of a breath was he breathing before God breathed his breath of life into it right he was a living Soul what kind of breath he was breathing living man yeah well then if that be so then every animal is a living Soul he talking about if he if it's the breath right cuz they breathe a human soul if that's the way it's supposed to be which it's not we know that and our soul and all together then Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient hold that point so brother the argument don't stand but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen when he became a living Soul a soul that can't die now watch now we're going to get into honey Plum up to your elbows now watch breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul cuz God breathed not what nature done right but what God did breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living Soul you then you say to me Adam died brother brand but remember before Adam died he had a lamb to redeem it Hallelujah those who he forew he called he got a lamb to redeem them he was a Ty Adam fell now Adam didn't fall from eternal life in his soul does everybody understand that he fell from eternal life in his body all right then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of Eternal God and he became a living Soul he was a Son of God he was actually the only son of God in the Old Testament we'll read that in just a minute not his breath as the African word amoya then why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the Eternal Soul breathed into us by breath why would we struggle for eternal life it backfires brother see it just can't do it but gone especially upon Adam exactly breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power like God he was an amature God he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven now God of the earth and someday he didn't leave it to Adam amen and someday the sons of God will again become Gods Glory Jesus said it's written in your law you're God and if you can call those who he call God who God visited how can you condemn me say when I say I'm the Son of God see now we're getting into something deep right that's what we're fixing to do okay now here they are he is now a Son of God but he makes a mistake and he knows he's doing wrong right amen he's a Son of God he's got the mind of God he knows he's doing wrong right Eve didn't Adam did we're getting to a point here now now remember Adam was not deceived amen the Bible said so 1 Timothy 3 Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived was in the transgression Adam walked with Eve because it was his wife same as Christ not deceived by Satan but walked into the death with the bride he went to be with the bride so he could redeem the church in other words he came down here all right Adam know he was wrong so he just walked out with Eve see but there was a lamb provided for them that they were redeemed see they were covering theel with fig leaves God just said forget that jump here cover the whole thing right put this on and these Lambs today that were for on by God and God is called there is a redeemer talking about us no man can come to me except my father draws all the father has given me will come that's right congregation says amen so there is a provided lamb from the foundation of the world where their names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life right a lamb was provided to make way of Grace now what is Grace for is for something you've done in the past not for what you've done in the future we're not Catholics that's premeditated if you do it before all right but for grace for what we were trapped into or the thing that we didn't know was wrong and it was wrong and we asked God to forgive us give us Grace for everything that happened afterward I'm working toward something here cuz something I I believe the Lord showed me this and I brother they can corank me if I'm wrong but I think this is what the the part that Adam and Eve and all this stuff that they're thinking that what they did was watch a lamb was provided to make a way of Grace Grace was what for what you done in the past to make a way of Grace for every one of them to go in the resurrection a provided lamb Adam's lamb now notice as Adam had a provided lamb right right now remember in the fall Satan used the Beast to stop a Son of God from being born yeah right cuz the Beast came to Eve put a natural genetic seed into Eve so that it polluted the womb there's no way that God's program could continue in that condition right right stopped it correct right now what's he still trying to do now sure he's trying to stop Sons and Daughters of God from being born spiritual all right but now look Adam could not save Eve he wasn't the Savior right right amen that's right right amen but he could protect him right or preserver yeah he could protect and preserve but he couldn't save Eve he could not bring her back from the condition she was in cuz the natural act had already took place there's no way Adam could turn back time exactly let's go to Romans 5 now people are are discussing or preaching that Adam put his natural seed into Eve to save her you can't save her there's no natural genetic sperm let me be plain will ever save anybody nevertheless death rain let's let the Bible prove it nevertheless death rained from Adam right so anything Adam did after that is death right nevertheless death reigned from Adam to MOS even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression death reigned in other words look death reigned over let me make it plain even over them that didn't do the sin that Adam did yeah amen but being in Adam's Fallen race right when God cursed that ground anything come out of that ground is cursed anything that's why Jesus didn't come out of that ground right amen even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression now keep in your mind who shall declare his generation right who is the figure of him that was to come which is what Jesus Christ but not as the offense so also is the free gift for through the offense of one man many be dead right if Adam seed was some special something Abel would not have had to drug that lamb up right and sacrificed it I get to a point here in a minute but not is the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of many of one many be dead right much more the grace of God and the gift of Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many in other words Grace come through who Jesus Christ not Adam and not not as it was by one that sin so is the gift for the Judgment was by one the condemnation Adam not Eve Adam right cuz the Bible said in Adam all die right and not as by one that sin so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses under justification Jesus rose for our amen justification right for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which which receive of the abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one amen Jesus Christ all right so that's the only way we're going to get out of this mess is to get into Christ all right so now First Corinthians 15 I think brother collee may have read this this morning for since by man come death right by man came also the resurrection of the dead right am for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive those first Adam second Adam all right but the first Adam could not save his bride Eve he could only cover her or preserve her or or or just do like brother rown said you know he couldn't get to Eve he couldn't get to Sarah because of Abraham the head the headship was established there in Genesis right all right number three let's read what Adam did but he's forfeit that Adam forfeit the title deed to it what the Earth eternal life to this all this stuff that we own eternal life and the inheriting of the Earth right Adam forfeited that Jesus said in Matthew 5 blessed are the meat for they shall inherit the see now we don't have it now and look it wasn't to Adam any of his seeds yeah right right right Adam planting a seed and Eve did not save her amen gee come on people Adam's seed absolutely lost everything right it's not the seed of Adam no matter how much we try to beautify this world and how much we try to make big fine homes and things it still doesn't belong to Adam seeve no sir it did not go to Adam's seed no sir because Satan took it locked stock in Barrel right for Adam forfeited it amen now number four the breach see Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan he sold his faith in God right let's go back for a second Adam was a son of God right he had the mind of Christ he had the he had the Holy Ghost Inside of him he was God of the earth amen right Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan right he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth belonged to him and he forfeited it every bit to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hand to Satan therefore now it has been it returned and has been polluted listen to this and the seed of Adam natural not the spiritual seed of Adam the natural seed of Adam right has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had amen that's the Earth that's right see the seed of Adam now what happened the polluted seed of Adam there's only one original good seed that's the word of God Jesus Christ right so every other seed is perverted now what happened the polluted seed of Adam has polluted and absolutely destroyed the land do you know the Bible says that and because that he has did this the polluted seed of Adam God will destroy them amen but now listen remember Grace is something that you for something you've already done that's right now this is what I believe this is my belief Adam seeing what Eve done Eve was already polluted Eve was already ruined but she had a natural genetic seed placed in her by the Beast amen all right now go with me that far like I was telling brother Donnie the other Sunday this is what Adam did Adam said God I will accept what she's already done not what I'm fixing to do to her right right I've accepted what she's already done what did Jesus do he accepted what we've already done he was the first Adam and this is the second Adam right typing total type so Adam was saying God I will accept what she's already done so in accepting what she's already done he soole the human race out but now listen let me make sure I get this right he will willingly took on her sin yeah because there was no way because she had been naturally polluted naturally we're not talking spiritually now she has a natural genetic line in her womb right okay and it was polluted there's no way that a son and daughter of God can ever come from Eve anymore right but and there was not a way for her to actually get back into Adam wound was closed up amen there was no way for her to get back into her protector that's right so he could either kick her out and say God let her go I'll do it with another one but he couldn't do that he'd be killing a part of himself all right same way with Jesus Christ Adam's Act was to preserve his lineage think of that Adam just didn't have sex with her because it was nice and fun and all that stuff right right he knew that if he destroyed Eve and didn't do anything past what she had just done with the Beast his multiplying and replenishing the Earth we know he knew that in that he could do that in in spiritual but once he saw that the way was closed where he couldn't he couldn't do it spiritually anymore there was no Genesis 12627 going to come out of that amen right but Adam's natural lineage would have stopped if he hadn't went and took Eve and then did the act that he did now if you go that way with it I'll agree with you that he and I was telling brother join him that's why brother R said he took her quick quickly to himself why heet waited two or 3 days the womb would have been closed he would have been locked out people there was no other woman for him to have his lineage with right so he took that's the same way with Jesus Christ to carry on his Genesis 1:26-27 he placed the spiritual seed right Amen to what declare his generation right so Adam the first Adam earthy remember everything Earth come from Adam Adam and Eve you understand what I'm saying right we know the Beast line was there but they call it Adam's race the Bible even calls it Adam's race this is the race of Adam without Adam coming to Eve and doing what he did there would not been a Abel a Seth an Abraham an Isaac a Jacob a Joseph right no uh right just keep naming them on down Thad there so Adam and Eve didn't get together just to have fun Adam was preserving his lineage right natural so he knew there was no spiritual way his lineage was going to come about there's no son and daughter of God ever going to be born from first Adam right not since what happened to Eve but if he did what he did Adam knowing he was a Son of God he knew he knew things God had to teach him things right right there wasn't nobody else to teach him there wasn't prophets we got prophets and and and scribes and people to teach there was nobody but Adam and God and Eve right and the devil right and the devil had pulled th pull one over on God but God didn't bother God because look if that act was so bad that Adam and Eve did with each other had the sex act then why did Abel get B I mean why did Seth get born and why did this one get born and why did this that's my point if that was so wrong God didn't destroy the sex act afterwards they started beginning to what multiply and replenish the Earth under a permissive will right right right God takes the book back from Adam which is the names of Genesis 126 and 27 only one came up that was Adam then Adam was supposed to bring everybody else right well when that got stopped God said hey that's okay right to be a redeemer I got to let something fall amen cuz it's called the Fallen race of Adam right so for Adam to propagate his species or to declare his generation he had to come to Eve do what he did to keep his lineage going because through all that lineage is our types and examples until Jesus Christ could come 2,000 years ago without any sex without any sperm and and EG from from parents to get us back amen right is that okay so everybody understands you know when people preach about Adam having to having to do this and inject his seat that wasn't to save Eve that's right that was actually Adam preserving his own lineage is that okay that all right he preserved his own lineage knowing though the the Christ that was in Adam Christ didn't leave Adam when he did that the mind of Christ was still there hey I can't get it this way anymore that's right but I got to get the people on the earth now cuz I'm fixing remember after all that happened first thing God done was curs the Earth right so when he cursed the Earth everything had to come up was cursed right right but it had to come up right there had to be a lineage does everybody understand is that okay I told you I was going to make sure we dwell on that point if you hear anybody say that Adam had inject his seed into Eve to save her it wasn't to save her it was to preserve his natural lineage knowing that God somewhere down in that lineage is going to come back through right right cuz remember Joseph and Mary was not a natural lineage of Jesus right but they were used they were used in lineage right natural lineages for our example all right till the one that come that was born without sin that was born without sex that was born without uh any sex act all right but the wom was already polluted Adam's Act was to preserve his lineage he had to do what he did having the mind of God he knew he had to we all had to come right all right remember brother said he knew what he was doing amen we just got to get the same mind of God to know what he was doing am not some silly sex act but to know that he was preserving our line to get us here in flesh amen cuz that's what God wanted he wanted us here in flesh Adam and Eve were going to bring us here in flesh but God was a redeemer yes so he had to let us follow he had to let that that happened right but did it stop God's purpose no he just dropped down in permissive well and allowed us to come the way we did right but a type but now look what did God do for both of them yeah he made a skin yeah for them he made an atonement blood made an atonement threw them into the GU into the into the bushes and said hey forget to figure Le put this on I'm going to cover more than just your bikinis that you got on in there you know your fig leaves yeah you need to have you need to all be covered cuz it started right here right right started from the mind but God made an offering or covering because there were no more sons of God to be born through flesh at that time right there's no more sons of God I'm talking about eternal Genesis 126 born again could not come through that right right caus in Adam all die amen right right so God brought a group of people into the Earth let's go to Genesis 3 15 let's just read that just make sure see I will put eny your division between thee and the woman who's Thee the Beast right and the woman and between thy seed be seed right right right and her seed now woman don't have a seed so there's Christ saying that I'm going to separate this thing I know we're going to have to come in flesh but I'm going to come down and give her a seed seed right right seed and and you know the whole thing amen the whole thing's a seed okay and it shall bruise thy head serpent yeah and thou shalt bruise his heel well if you kick somebody in the heel it's not going to hurt him you take cut the heel off but it what her seed shall bruise thy head you cut the head off and you're going to kill it right and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband remember we talked about the double Covenant that now the double Covenant in the man is the man's going to rule over right and he shall rule over thee and into Adam because thou has hearkened under the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat cursed is the ground now he didn't curse Adam right he cursed the ground in sorrow shalt th eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and F shall it bring forth to thee Thou shalt eat the herb of the field sweat of thy face shall th eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was you taken for dust Thou Art and to dust Thou shalt return and Adam called his wife name Eve because she was the mother of all living now here she got her name now let's go to Genesis 5 genesis 5 verse one see look this is the book of the generations of Adam there would not have been this book there would not have been this generation of Adam had he not done what he did with Eve after the Beast did what he did with Eve right right that's where the twins come right this is the book of the generations of Adam now remember and Adam all died so that's what happened in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him now look male female created to them he's going right back to Genesis 126 and blessed them and called their name Adam for the fall they were both named Adam in the day when they were created and Adam lived 130 years and begot a son in his own likeness after his image a natural boy called his name Seth so there you start the natural lineage of Adam correct all right Abel was killed so remember when you look in the Bible just for a turn let's go to L Luke 3 when you look in the natural to be a to have a lineage or line you got to have propagated your species right or sent your genealogy down to the Next Generation right what I was telling them up in U up in Virginia right there where brother Ron and all them there was probably 200 Civil War battles fought right in from where he you know 100 miles from where he was at I said could you imagine 600,000 men were killed in the Civil War in 4 years 600,000 men there was 600,000 Generations stopped if they had not had children a lot of them were young boys remember a lot of them were young boys fighting now if they were older men and had children but just think how many were young boys that that generation stopped but God preserved somebody stayed alive to get us here cuz we're all from that line except you move from the south I'm going move from the north which bless your heart that you got here so all right Luke 3 but that was that's the God he had to have a natural lineage right cuz he was going to put Genesis 1:26 lineage into a human flesh right right that's what he did right so he was going to do the same thing to you right cuz that's the way you come you didn't come a spirit baby right you come a natural baby right which was the son of Canaan which was the son of whatever that name is which was the son of sham which was the son of Noah which was the son of lamic which was the son of Methuselah which was the son of Enoch which was the son of Jared which was the son of Mal which was the son of Canan which was the son of enus which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God right so he was the son of God for the for the Old Testament right the only one that had eternal life to be a Son of God in the lineage right right all right you got that which was the son of enus which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God all right everybody got that yes so Adam was a Son of God glory amen all right but this is a natural lineage of natural people same way in the Old Testament from Seth to Joseph there were generation but not sons of God I'm talking about Joseph what what this do if you what this do what this do does if you go backwards through Luke it starts with Joseph wasn't the son of what Joseph was not the father of Jesus but it comes down through Joseph line right but it's showing a natural Li lineage coming back to the beginning of time right right straight down to Jesus if you'll read it back right so Adam had preserved his lineage yeah right there it was he preserve that lineage all the way to Joseph all the way to today actually but they were not any of them Genesis 1:26 none of these enus Seth Mal Jared go all the way up to Joseph they were not sons of God by birth right they were not Adam which was the son of God right so now but remember from this all we get natural lineages not spiritual L lineages right the only time you see a spoken word child is on the day of Pentecost that's when the book became open again exactly all right that's when the book became right into the rightful owner which Jesus was the book Jesus held the book while he was here on Earth and we'll go through that in just a minute so we're going to walk you through this who shall declare because remember Jesus natural Jesus When They Crucified him a couple of days ago 2,000 years ago on a cross he never had children so that stopped his natural genetic lineage amen who shall declare his genation right his genealogy he had no earthly genealogy as far as this right here was going none right Adam shouldn't have really except the Genesis 126 and 27 people that's all he should have had right but by permissive will he has allowed all this Old Testament turn to First Corinthians 10 verse 11 now all these things read the rest of the scripture but I I like to use this because all these Old Testament things all these things happened unto them for examples right and they are written for our our admonition who upon whom the ends of the world are come so baby do let me tell you something that's me and you in the scripture there's nobody else there's not another one to come there's not another one pass if you can't read that you're dead you understand what I mean if you're in the grave you can't fulfill this but you are alive you are a genealogy you are written these things are written for our admonition what Abraham Isa Jacob Joseph were examples of Christianity not Christianity examples of Christianity examples of the way we're supposed to live upon whom the ends of the world are come so that's me and you so they were all given for examples every bit of this was given for our example whom the ends of the world have Came Upon Psalms 139 now this is David but listen to what this says put your name in here yeah for thou H has possessed my reign right thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am Filly and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee that's right f 5 4 years 53 years ago I wasn't in existence right but God knew who I was amen God knew when I was coming right all right that's what I was telling them we were sitting at a at a at a high school um I think Hope was graduating and I looked around and all the guys that went to school with me a lot of them were there and I told them I said you know what I said about 70% of the people in this Stadium wasn't even born when we were in school they weren't even alive yeah where' they come from yeah genealogy right right genealogy they appear my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously WR in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect flesh and in thy book all my members were written so he he he did see my substance what I was coming to right here but in thy book all my members were written which in continuent what's the continuance mean one right after the other and continuance were fashion when as yet there was none of them right that's right God didn't go on vacation when Adam and Eve did what they did in the garden that's no he just went right on making examples of the Old Testament people covering their sins by the blood of a lamb that didn't have a soul so the soul of man the soul of almighty God was not in those animals amen that's right that's why they had to just be covered right right they were just covered but look how powerful they were in just the covering of lamb all right in continuance you and I had to come because Genesis 1:26 27 was still sitting in the mind of God yeah right he was still holding the book it you know it went back the book went back to the original owner Satan's a squat on this Earth he's just here for a time but the original the book The Genesis 1226 the book of names yeah God's holding it he's the only one that can produce it that's why it took a lamb to produce the book it took a lamb to bring that book forward why that lamb that book was a part of the Lamb that's right all right all right so now Isaiah 53 verse 10 now see yet it plead we didn't read we stopped at verse eight for for on purpose verse 10 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he have put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul see you can't make the soul of an animal an offering for sin that's why in the Old Testament you couldn't have the soul of God in any individual couldn't that's right right just a covering right but but Isaiah 53 says when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin y right here he shall see his seed righten Genesis 1 126 and 27 right right right he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand we'll read the rest of it in a little while but right there Isaiah 53 who shall declare his generation that was in verse 8 right well Isaiah is telling you really in between the love letter here he's writing he's telling us that he's going to bring us when he himself when Jesus Christ himself comes and makes an offering for sin he shall see his seed Glory why because the seed was inside of him not some little spot you can't the the seed that produced Josh you couldn't find it in my body chemically you couldn't look for it until it went to its place everybody understand that you couldn't so so you don't say well I was that no but we have to know our position we're the body of Jesus Christ so we have to know what position we're in right but you don't have to say well he shall see his seed well who was his seed Genesis 12627 that's the only seed of God Galatians 3:16 and thy seed which is Christ Not seeds right that's right not Abraham planting seeds in women not Isaac plant seeds Abraham planting all uhuh thy seed singular Christ that seed never come from the loins of a human man amen exactly it came from the mind of almighty God spoken remember it has to be a thought before it's spoken yes he thought of us and then spoke us but now look let's go to Galatians 3 and just read that now the Abraham and his seed were the promises made right he saith not to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ amen you and I have a promise we're not Abraham's promis seed by natural genetics right if you if some of you have not been going to brother Bob black class you need to go you need to listen to it because he's taken from Genesis about five four and five where we just started at and he's taking lineages and showing you that lineages really if you break them down in the Old Testament they don't mean nothing that's right you start bringing in Rahab and Ruth and this one and that one and this one and that one you'd think boy that thing comes right straight down like they want to preach you know you got Adams line over here well Adam's line over here is just as polluted as the Beast line I just proved that right there's no difference in Adam's natural seed and the beast's natural seed none they all come perverted polluted dead nothing alive in it oh yeah we're alive no if you don't have Christ you're dead Okay and that's the seed we're looking at and that's the seed like brother Daniel was talking about Wednesday night Jesus said a little while the world see me no more I may stop here and and finish this afternoon may go maybe a few more minutes but that Resurrection started inside the Earth the stone was not rolled away when Jesus came out of the Grave we it the stone was still there the angel rolled it rolled it away we read it last night in the Bible study you did it's St the angel rolled it away and sat down and said who are you looking for that's right Jesus didn't need to move that thing the resurrection started when it quickened that body and he just walked right straight through that that rock and didn't matter is a million miles thick we'll read it we'll read it tonight there this afternoon but now look let's go back in the Old Testament cuz we can't do away with Israel cuz God loved Israel right he called him his children he called him his bride I was telling I was telling him somebody the other day I was telling the guys at work the reason they were called the children of Israel cuz they acted like children yeah that's right that's the reason they were called the children of Israel they acted like kids they never weren grownups they never grew up they always murmured and complained and wanted these social social programs and God gave it to them and they still murmured and complained that's babies that's not full grown adults children that never grew to maturity right but remember he put Israel away for her defilement right right he put her away for their for their defilement but Daniel 9 what we read proves that he's going to restore Israel to a position not to wife again not to his genetic children cuz remember they had all those tribes in lineages and they had all this in L that was natural every bit of that was natural there wasn't a supernatural act in the Old Testament even though um Samuel's mother Hannah was old she still had relations with her husband to get Samuel H right and there wasn't an Immaculate Conception in the Old Testament is what I'm trying to say okay everything was done by going into your wife okay or them going into the husband so Daniel 9 proves that he's going to restore her to a position she was cut off because of you and I right he's going to declare his generation here right but he's going to also declare his spiritual generation right yes which is you and I amen you and I are his spiritual genetics we all come from all different natural genetic lines but we we all have one spiritual Gene right right and it's woven into us like Daniel that was good brother I appreciate that you doing a good job I'm honored a good job cuz that really sparked something in me because that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead right will also Quicken your mortal body but what did that Spirit do when that Spirit went back in the body and we'll cover that this afternoon but when that Spirit went back into that body it quickened that body that was beat like hamburger meat his bones weren't broken but he had gashes and lashes and all he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity that's the outside this is for this guy yeah where he really done the damage is he gave his soul amen a ransom so he could see a se you could have beat this body you could have beat that body of Jesus almost to death but he was in full control of that situation Jesus Christ knew that we were going to be bruised and battered and we needed healing in our body right right but when he gave his soul Ransom when he gave himself up because of our sin what did he say he gave his soul a ransom so that he could see his SE in other words you he paid for something he ransomed our soul out of hell he ransomed our soul from Adam's race Fallen dead on our way to hell and put us into his race right into his kingdom all right and we'll see that this afternoon how did what did Jesus do Jesus came with the genealogy in him right he brought his own genetics amen he didn't depend on nobody else I don't depend on nobody else to have my kids comes from me right right and if there're my kids I put them in my family album I love your kids but I don't have them all over the country I mean all over my house in a family album I got my kidss in the family album that's right and that's the same way with Jesus Christ he did the same thing you love the Lord let's go to one more scripture let's go to First Timothy before we finish because look we're going to talk about the law because the law was given because of our transgression right okay so we're going to talk about this the law this afternoon but how the law and the prophets built the body of Christ and we'll come on into where Jesus comes up and that's why we're going to talk about today this is his this is the resurrection right right the only way that he could declare his generation was to come out of that grave amen exactly cuz he was cut off among the land of the living I hope everybody caught that this is this is a resurrection message he had is they they tried to put that great big they trying to put that great big rock up there to stop his genealogy if they could have stopped him from coming out of the Grave we were gone we were done we were finished right but see they were looking at the natural man God's looking at the spiritual man that went to hell preach of the souls in prison come and pick that body up in in other words change that body now left the scars for the nail prints but remember he was beat all to pieces he was bruised for our iniquity all that bruising was gone when mayor Magdalene made him in the garden she thought he was a gardener a young boy but when he said Mary for every cre of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the word of God in prayers why don't you should pray before you eat anything if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and good Doctrine where unto thou has attained but refuse refuse profane and old wies fables exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all all things having promise of the life that now is and that which is to come this is a faithful saying and worthy of accept acceptation for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially of those that believe all right everybody got that right everybody the ones that believe now Paul said he was scared of Our Endless genealogy right but how God has took us and told us that that have a promise of life that now is and that which is to come now look let's go to quote number five let's let's do that one then we'll then we'll stop right there the law was given because of man's transgression we know that right that's right Israel man wanted a law to live by the blood of animals with a sacrifice covering an atonement but what was the curse of the law what was the curse of the law right nobody could live it amen nobody could live it they wanted the law and then it couldn't even abide by it right all right now look Perfection we'll stop right here now when Adam and Eve had sinned let's read the whole thing there was no way no other remedy that they could ever stand in the presence of God again except this sin be dealt with right and no man can commit a sin of anything type no matter how little or how big that individual sin has to be dealt with before the one who committed it can ever stand in the presence of the holy God so therefore when Adam and Eve had sinned and had transgressed the law they were subjects of death and the law had to be executed therefore it put all the human race under the penalty of death now if we can only settle down for a few moments now in our thinking and look at this great picture and remember that every person here is included in this amen right right every man and woman child is included in the penalty of death by the transgression of the head of the human race Adam by his transgression every one of us fell victim to sin amen and sin must be dealt with and so God in his great infiny and his great love the law was to separate the sinner from his maker amen then he became Anil and totally annihilated there would be no way for him to ever come back unless that sin was dealt with and it would be very easy then to believe in a total annihilation of The Sinner at the end for he is completely forever separated from the presence of God all right so that kind of explains all that but sin must be dealt with sin had to be dealt with in a different way than Adam and Eve tried to deal with right and even Abraham and Isaac and Jacob they dealt with sin as in they give an atonement they give a covering we're covered we're covered we're covered but just being covered someday you got to stand in front of all that right cuz it's just being covered it's not being done away with that's right a lot of you young ones coming up in the Lord you sin's got to be dealt with it cannot be covered it's got to be dealt with amen and it takes what one man could do it and that's Jesus Christ he's the one that took the sin down away because he had a soul that sacrifice for you had a soul let's stand our feet and for that Soul coming out of that grave bringing the body with it took all of us and cleaned us up amen he was wounded for our transgression right he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of his GL peace our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation amen for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken right and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich and his death amen because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering
