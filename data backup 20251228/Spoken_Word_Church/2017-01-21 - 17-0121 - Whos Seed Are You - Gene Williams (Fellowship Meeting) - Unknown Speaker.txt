someone to sing and things that we're going through the services and do it we like to say to any of the ministers though that we come we we welcome you we appreciate you we just don't take up the time to do other than the pastors of the congregations and things that we know and if we miss one of you come in back raise your hands I'm a pastor come on okay brother Reyes you number one you in the back he got in the back but he don't get to do he got to come up the only thing about sitting in the back is one thing you got further to walk glad to have brother re is with us and his people from Gainsville Georgia we appreciate you come on thank you bless God bless you all of it BR bless you well I think every time we have the opportunity and this time is a great opportunity to be on here uh brother Joe Salas is very good friend and he can back to the our church and he says you got to be in those meetings all the time we have you know we would like to be here all the time but sometimes we have a schedule for go to somewhere else and go around and and sometimes it's not a possible but this time we say well we got to do something we got to be there and uh when brother Sal told to the that the whole CH you know I'm I'm kind of well because every time when we make announcement you know all that CH want to come so and I don't want to bring everybody because just only the family we are probably 30 people just only the family but uh I think it's a great time you know uh we enjoy all the time and we would like to wor worship with with with you and here and it's a great opportunity many many years when the Lord called us we've been in a Pentecostal church and uh I remember a brother came by to the church and start uh talking to my oldest brother stand up my oldest brother his name is Martino so he received the MCH for the first time he was the first one so he carry all the tapes on on himself you know and hey you want to hear a tape and you know like that and uh eventually we get all the family and we believe the the message so one time um the the pastor in the church started notice something wrong you know something strange with us and and say you know something is happen with this family so they call us um my brother they they they call my brother to the office and other brother and later they come to our houses you know to to see what what's happening and finally we have to declare then we believe a message you know and tell them then we don't get out from your system or the system because you make you you do something for us or because you do something wrong for us no nothing like like that just because we believe something greater than that so when when we when we went to the a meeting in Atlanta for the first very time and we came back home and and and we decided to do something and we say well what we have to do and say well we have to take a decision now because they know then we are attending to another church we believe this message and we got to take a decision right now and we remember then we took our hands everybody you know all the whole family and we started praying and when we prayed that that that the Holy Spirit follow off and and in the house and from that moment brother we start serving God through this message so every time it's a a great privilege when when we come together because we believe that we are serving uh uh a living God we we we believe that we serve in um uh in in a spirit and Truth amen and the denomination we maybe we we can scream and cry and and but it's only emotion you know it's just an Spirit but nothing in true but now we believe this message and thank the Lord because we are here with uh a new new faces each time you know and uh last week brother Wayne passed to my house and I

through for a while but I said I said in my heart I'm going to try to make it and I just pray the Lord help me amen and this thing is always in my heart every time I get a chance to stand before God's people the opportunity just say something that uh can bless somebody I had a friend he in Florida we used to be all friends long time ago in Africa and uh one time he asked me he said brother Tony I'm going to ask you a question I know you love the Lord you know he doesn't believe in the message I try to uh share the message to him he's a very good uh friend of mine and he said if I ask you to describe God using one word can you do it yes so that was a big question that's right how can you describe this almighty God with just one word that's right so I didn't see anything I just thought for a minute I said wow so all of a sudden something dropped in my heart and I told him words can describe God cuz he's unlimited yeah but there's this word that I know and I know that I know God is faithful amen and ever since it gets stuck with me and all the time I know this word can describe God right if you have walked with God for a while you really understand exactly what I'm saying our God is faithful Glory we uh 2005 uh 16 is uh the Lord done a lot for me all the time he always do lot woman and my wife the doctors the her doctor schedul appointment for her to do a surgery very important or the stuff can turn to cancer so it has to be done immediately she give the reports and everything and it has to be removed and all that so I took it I said well you give me time to pray it is um she called back and I pick up the phone and we were talking together and said hey you have to do it right now and I started you know um preaching on the on the phone to this doctor that sound crazy so you know um I prayed and you know the doctor keep calling and everything you know we scedule the appointment for you go and do it and and and I told her God have done this before he can do it again this happened way back and I know God is going to do it again so I wasn't afraid and I take it easy I prayed I prayed I prayed and after a while she called again and said okay go to uh go back and take another one you know MRI and all that and so she went back cuz I delayed she went back she took it and they send a report and she called me back on the same number and they said I can't understand it just amazing we don't see nothing on the report we don't see nothing on the report nothing so my God is faithful amen my God is faithful amen we are serving a living God glory and I tell my myself anytime I got a chance here and anywhere I get opportunity even one minute I'll say something to encourage somebody yes sir and if you don't believe in Jesus and maybe you don't believe in this and after service you can see me yeah and um I might testify a lot of things that will help you this brother here brother ban he was with us before he moved to Maryland so many things happened to him and the worst thing was uh prostrate so it was really serious and uh he called me he was crying and uh but the Lord has then show me and I've called him and I told him so at that instant I told him butaka before you left you were very healthy and um I know you don't have a lot of service you know where you living the Lord want you to come back and I knew exactly what I was telling the brother so the brother you know he came and uh according to his testimony he said the week because he delayed another 5 month but he said within that time God started doing things for him when he agreed to come back so um I took him to say doctor and they print the report and you know the report trace a lot of stuff in his body and I told him keep believing keep believing so about another year or maybe 8 months or nine he went back to take another test the brother is standing before us today brother you can stand up he is cancer free there not a choice not a bit and in our little Fellowship in Hostel God has healed a lot of at least I can count about five people that God has literally taken cancer out of their body so uh I don't have time I just have one song I said I have to sing it for the glory of God uh I can thank God enough when the musician will come sister Joe will also sing a song I see a lot of old friends and um brother Braham said this in the message the way to have a fellowship was 1955 and there was something about Fellowship sh we were listening to the type there and uh the prophet said love produces fellowship and that really done a lot for me amen so Fellowship is a product of love and if we keep fellowshipping because it's love and love is God so God produces fellowship and so we are very grateful and thankful to come together like this as the Samy said how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to do it together amen um the daddy okay I want us to sing this song it it used to be in my language every time I want to worship God this song used to come so I felt that it's a beautiful song and I I put it in English so it's very simple few words so you can probably uh uh learn how to sing [Music] it you help me my [Music] voice I cannot thank you enough I can all thank you enough oh I cannot thank you enough I cannot thank you enough for the things you have done for me I cannot thank you enough for the things you have done for me I can all thank you enough I wonder if there anybody here can thank God enough for all the great things God do for all of us we are Sons and Daughters of the almighty God he do a lot for all of us I

the love you have shown to me I can all thank you for the Love For The Love Jesus have shown to us we [Music] there's no way to thank him enough is it no way look at all the things he's done for us we can't thank him enough right amen well I'm looking over if I miss any pastors now somebody raise her hand I know that different ones here look like brother Homer we're down to you so come on up and greet the crowd and bring you singers bu see he's not even taking no I guess everybody else had two so I guess I have two so Kyle you come and Nikki you come and uh well I guess healing comes in different ways you know and uh my wife suffered for cancer quite some and so many problems but September the 6 she got well she left me God seemed fit to take her home but see God still healed her Satan did not win that's right he didn't win amen that's right he thought he he thought just because she had that that that was going to be the end of it but she he didn't realize hallu that he just brought her into his presence amen and so so God's still good to us amen like I said we don't charge God foolish we thank God for his grace and his Mercy amen no uh how that God has uh watched over so many years and but you know what one day won't be long CU everything is chatting up I'm looking for everything is coming you know and uh we're at the end because if we're not at the end there is no end that's right because I'm going tell you what everything is run out that's right you know and uh I thought you know when Trump went into office and all the protests I said that's just exactly like the church you know something changes some likes it some don't and I said you know somebody's always got to be the escapegoat somebody takes it out on somebody else and I thought you know isn't it sad that brother R said it Go totally insane come on yeah at the end time and I said isin't it strange how the people that had their buildings and all that they Wen the one they didn't do them guys nothing but they broke they tore up their property and I said that's about the way it is in church somebody gets a little bit of something against somebody else oh and they jump on everybody else but them oh my amen but thank God there are end to this thing amen amen and I believe the All My Heart Church that God is getting the people ready amen amen and he can only get you ready by the word of God that's right amen because there's nothing else to get you ready by right you can't do it by church enti right so you have to do it by the word of God and so the bi the Bible says and the the bride has made herself ready and I said so there is something you have to do right brother B said that's our totally obligation is to make oursel ready amen amen so if you want to go you make yourself ready hlj amen you can't make yourself bright but you can make yourself ready right I like little old St and I mentioned the other day at the church and I said you know I read this little article said I want to be so much like Christ if a mosquito bites me he'll have to fly away and say there's power in the blood right right come [Applause] praise the Lord amen amen so looks like maybe I'll have to have March amen so uh I don't see Tom's not here Tom's not here he told me he coming and I didn't say he lied I said something come up that's right he couldn't make it amen so gu March God willing be at our church amen and so uh be pray for us I certainly need your prayers amen that God will uh uh help me get through this thing and amen you know after 55 years with the same woman it's kind of

the Lord amen Romans amen the 9th chapter I'm going to begin reading at the sixth verse not as though the word of God has taken no effect for they are not all Israel who are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they who are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of God but the children of the but the but the children of the promise are counted as the seed for this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loveed but Esau have I hated father God we ask now you bless your word your people

we yield ourselves now you take control have the prence this evening for in the mighty name of Jesus we ask it amen amen as you seated tonight amen it's so wonderful Amen to know that God Amen is real and my brother is all right if I take this jacket off amen you know some I say you know some things you can't do with all pinned up like this you know can't fight and eat amen so hopefully we'll do a little both tonight if you want to fight the devil put a little bruise on his head amen and get him to running amen uh then we want to Feast upon the word of almighty God Amen so I'm so thankful amen uh appreciate uh brother Tony was speaking and some of the things that was open with he said about God's being faithful amen and I believe that tonight also that that he's faithful man our God is faithful because when it come to faithfulness there's no one can do it like my God my savior Jesus Christ you know and even the scripture tell us you know when we believe not you know when I get out of the way and things are not going like it should yet he remain faithful because he cannot deny himself amen and you know and that let I'm so thankful cuz that brings me to know that I'm a part of God sir that I'm a part of God amen you know and I don't want to get ahead of myself I just love the Lord amen you know God is so good but but I believe that this God that we serve you know the great Creator the The Shepherd of our soul of the of the Sheepfold amen he his his his own existence is for his very own amen the the reason for his existence uh is for his very own you know I begin to think about you know that God was not satisfied with the sheriffin he was not satisfied with the turbin was not satisfied with the angels all of the creation he had done in animal life the you know the plant life all of that he was not satisfied but when he made man Oh my he got somebody in His image uh and then God rested amen I said oh my God don't let me fail you uh amen because I know what your existence about is for me amen now I can't speak for everybody but I know amen what he mean to me tonight am you know and I believe that he loves me and he cares for me you know that's that's my God Amen and when the word say that your lives are hidden with God Amen hidden amen that's exactly what it means amen so oh devil you better watch out amen hallelujah amen I'm thankful am man God is true to his word amen he true to himself he cannot lie amen and he always amen will do what he said in his word and I'm glad that I'm resting in that faithfulness amen that's God I like what Paul even saiden in Philippians 1:6 he say being confident of this very thing that who he who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen now that's faithfulness amen because you know I you know I get beside myself sometimes I I don't do what I ought to do all the time up but yet God is still working it out amen God is still working out see you know we read a little bit about Abraham we're going to get into a little bit but you know God was still faithful in Abraham's life even that Abraham got down left left the the Homeland and got down in Egypt amen you know and he told a lie God's Prophet amen but you know what God was still faithful oh my God was still faithful amen when the Old King was going to take Sarah you know and Grandma you know she looked pretty good back then amen there she was getting on up in Agia and this King want to take her and make a part of his her and and and God say if you touch her you're dead man he better and not only this now here come Abraham out of position you know but yet God said now go down there and tell my Prophet to pray for you oh my I say God I know you're faithful Lord because there are times when I'm even so ashamed of my own self but yet God is still faithful because he cannot deny himself amen I'm than for that tonight amen what a wonderful savior we have now if you for just for a little while and we want to get into just a little thought now we won't have time to Amen to bring it in because we want to talk about whose seed you are now we won't be able to bring it all the way in about like you know the beginning of the seed man the destination of it and you know the trail but just a little encouragement about you being the Seed of Abraham and what that means in our life amen at this time amen so I want to read our scripture again to set our text amen and notice now so Paul begin to tell us in Romans 9 he said not as though the word of God has taken no effect but they are not all Israel who are of Israel right you can I drop something in here they are not all bride who say they are bride oh my I believe the testing time is coming uh we'll know who bride and who's not brigh amen I believe right now we going to see that there is a time we can call countdown amen amen we're going to see The Showdown just about in a few amen but notice now then he said now neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they who are the children of the flesh they are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted as the seed for This Is The Word of Promise as is at this time will I come and Savor shall have a son amen I'm thankful to know that we can look back now begin to see some things that you know because when I thought about myself uh you know we didn't have no amen rights Amen to the to to God's promise amen you know as concerning the flesh we had no rights to it amen uh we were alienated from the Commonwealth of Israel had no God on our side uh but I'm so thankful that in due time the god that's rich in Mercy amen he made away from me now that was according to the flesh I couldn't see no way in but according to God's word amen and the Mystery of a predestination and election I was always there amen remember now you cannot be there here if you were not already there amen uh so I say thank God Amen I I couldn't see it amen I couldn't understand it but I was always there amen and God made a way to make me realize what promises and part of the Covenant is mind amen so notice now so we want to look at this quickly amen I'm not you know outward may look like a Hebrew or Jew amen but inward amen by God's word of circumcision amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost he bought me right on in amen so no now so want to look at this so we are thankful now for the sovereignty of God there's no one you know there's no one here who is here by chance no that's God doesn't work that way man now I may run my business that way but God doesn't work that way uh amen God knew before the foundation of the world before anything a n molecule anything uh he already had me on his mind I was already part of the economy of God already part of that Dominion of God Amen and all I when I and I didn't know it but I I dwell in eternity one time uh oh my mind can't even can't even comprehend that uh but I dwelt in eternity one time and all of a sudden God let us drop down on that little space called eternity into this place called time to be tested and tried amen but I've always were with God and I'm looking that day to be back with him amen But Here We Stand now so we are all elected called and predestinated by God's grace amen you know and I want to read the scripture amen so Paul can uhen tell us about that look in Romans uh amen 8 amen just flip back Romans 8:28 he say and we know that all things work together for good amen now I didn't say everything will be good but everything going to work together for the good amen amen and I'm so thankful that he's working on my behalf amen but all things work together for good for for to them that love God how many l God tonight amen amen uh to them who are the call according to his purpose amen oh my now I'm trying to hold me pieace but no now for whom he did for no yeah you know I like that amen we can acknowledge amen the forn knowledge of God Amen and for them that he forew amen he what God what he what he called amen for them he for knew now notice not for he he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinated them he also called amen you know that's the part where I come in also amen cuz see God already forew me in his mind amen and had predestination already worked out and then all a sudden he called me amen you know down in this late hour called L SE God called me amen and I'm so thankful that there was something that could resonate back to God to answer that call amen and God brought us in amen so notice now so we find out so he called us amen or predestinate us and he said now moreover whom he did predestinate whom he all them he also called and them he called he them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified it's a done deal it's a done deal amen uh devil you've already lost the case amen amen everything that you tried to do uh it's in vain amen because when God open my eyes to who seed I am amen why it's a done deal amen amen I already know that I come from God and I go back to God that's why Jesus could tell them amen the this body but in 3 days I raise up again he knew who he was amen he knew where it came from amen he look I'm say why would it be to you if I go back to where I come from I come from God and I go to God and I said God what what tremendous amen uh amen know that we are the Seed of Abraham amen but no not which is Christ is that Royal seed and if we are dead in Christ then we take on Abraham's seed so those n so Paul also says in galatian if you want read this quickly I want to get a few scriptures in and a few things the prophet said and I'll let you go amen if we can but no not uh I think we got what two or three hours but a day okay amen God is so good amen Galatians 3 Galatians 3 and we want to pick this up here at the 13th verse Galatians 3 and 13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law exactly being made a curse for us amen for it is written curse if everyone that hangeth on a tree thank God for calary that day of calary change it all for me notice now that the that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles amen now remember now we didn't we won't we we were not able to be obliged to that but that the blessings of Abraham might come to the Gentiles notice now amen uh amen might come to the Gentiles amen through Jesus Christ uh that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith amen and what a mighty God we serve because remember I believe Mali 4 has restored the faith amen just like it was back there with Abraham back there with the patriarch has restored that Faith back to us today amen so notice now amen through the through faith be Brethren I speak after the manner of man though it be not a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man dis all of or n of it or added to it now to Abraham and and and his seed were the promises made amen oh my now to Abraham and the see where the promises made uh now I I got this lat on but I want to drop it in right now you know when Abraham had Isaac and we know that's the lineage should come but we know the real Royal seed is Christ amen but we find that the Bible tell us in Genesis 25 I believe that Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac amen now he gave gifts to the other ones but all he had he gave to Isaac amen and I begin to think about now this is Brother Jean 101 amen you know that's why the Bible says uh gifts and callings are without repentance amen so they can have all the gifts they want amen but that don't mean they're the Seed of Abraham now I like the gifts also but I want the giver amen you get the giver and everything will be all right uh so he gave all that he had to ABRA to Isaac amen and I begin to think about that I said that's just like God Amen God he kyos amen or emptied himself gave all he had to Christ amen oh my then Christ amen kyos or EMP himself into the church the believer amen so what does that make to tonight amen it makes you no short of having the same life as God has amen you cannot die no more than God can die when they sing that song Amen I cannot die amen the world may not understand it but you know what because you are the Seed of Abraham amen you got the promise of eternal life amen so we find so he begin to tell us this amen Brethren he said I speak after the man of men that it be but it be a man's Covenant yet if it be a confirmed no man disol or or voided or anoth it or added to it now to Abraham and his seed was the promis he made he said not as to seeds as of many but of one and we know that's Christ and to thy seed which is Christ 17th verse and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ the law which was 430 years amen cannot disan or disallowed or avoid or an know that it should make the promise of no effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise amen and if I'm a Seed of Abraham then I got all of those promis amen and we find out so there's something uh amen so so tremendous about being amen the Seed of Abraham amen you know and I begin to think about that if we want to put in the terms of trying to you know get to the place uh know one time I had gotten a ticket and I you know didn't know all what was what was you know it comprises of uh you know and but then I begin to read it uh I began to see everything uh that was included in there and I said oh my goodness uh I didn't know I had all of that because I didn't read it amen I had it the whole time but I didn't read what I had amen and I say God thank you for letting us look into the promise amen that I know what I got amen so when the Devil comes in uh and try to steal my joy my victory everything uh I know what I got amen amen because I'm a Seed of Abraham amen but now we want to look at this now cuz not everyone who confess or profess to be a Seed of Abraham not not the seed amen cuz Jesus had to have a conversation one day with those who thought they were the Seed of Abraham he had to have a conversation with him amen and tonight you know I said God you know we want to speak to every heart amen because if I'm not where I need to be have a conversation with me Lord amen so Noti it's not right quick now in St John Amen in St John the the eth verse our eighth chapter and let's pick it up at the 33rd verse St John 8 and3 3 St John 8:33 do we love the Lord seed amen whose seed are you because you are the Seed of Abraham there are blessings amen and remember this Covenant is not you know what you will do but what God has already done the unconditional Covenant so notice now St John 8 and33 he says and we're picking up the conversation that Jesus began to have with man these Pharisees and so he said now they answer him we are a Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how it says you ye shall be made we shall be made free Jesus answered verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if you if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed I know it's not I know that ye are Abraham's seed oh my oh my now look at him now he's acknowledging something here now I know that you are Abraham's seed amen now that was according to the flesh that was according to the flesh amen now he begins to break it down later on and let them know who they really are amen because I say God when it comes to time really holding to this word we'll show who's bride and who's not bride amen so he said now so Jesus at that time having this conversation amen he acknowledge according to the flesh now remember they that are of the flesh are not the Seed of Abraham so here come him begin to clear it up for them he said now I know that ye are Abraham's seed but ye seek to kill me you know people still seek to kill the word today still keep to seek to take the F from the word today amen because my my word has no no place in you I speak that which I have seen with my father and ye do that which you have seen with your father oh my now wait a minute now wait a minute now you just just said that I know that Abraham is your father but now he begin to show him that there of another father and the only reason is because it has something to do with the word amen it has something to do with the word amen and I said God will know before this thing is over amen Who belongs in this word or not amen it it bothers my mind and baffled my mind that somebody can walk for 20 30 10 15 years in this message and all the sudden turn back amen amen that bothers my mind amen cuz I believe when this get a hold of you amen it won't Turn You Loose amen it's not you turning loose it won't Turn You Loose amen the only thing I can say is oh my I don't want to get in trouble amen I'm not even my own pull pit but God is so good don't you love him amen so we find out so here he begin to let him know who they are amen so he said I I I speak that which I have seen with my father and you you do that which you have seen with your father they H said it to him because they not begin to catch on Abraham is our father amen Jesus said unto them if ye were Abraham's children uh ye would do the works of Abraham oh my amen you will do the works of Abraham have the faith of Abraham the endurance of Abraham and love the word amen but we finally begin to expose them amen and I believe that why many will be exposed before this thing is over amen but I thank God who seed are you amen we are the Seed of Abraham but notice now he's now he said but now ye seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham oh my Abraham did I'm going to read something in just a moment while the prophet said that when we are Abraham's seed we don't dispute the word we don't dispute with God Amen there's something in US amen that holds on there's something in us that that can call a man Abraham amen uh from out from his kin folks amen uh from from a the chadel amen out from there going a place he didn't even know where he was going amen but watch something had a hold of him amen I said Lord there's times I don't understand it all amen but there's something got a hold of me there something that's moving amen and because I'm your seed amen why you working it all out to my good and I say thank God in this last hour but notice now so he began to show who they areen so right quick let me hurry now he said now ye also notice now ye also ye do the Deeds of your father right now one time they told him you Abraham was your father that's according to the flesh but now he going to say that but now you do the Deeds of your father and he going to tell him who it is and then then uh then said they to him we are not born of fornication uh we have one father even God Jesus said unto them if God was your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and come from God neither came I of myself but he sent me uh why do ye not understand my speech uh even because you cannot hear my word amen I said God what hour we living in amen there are people that are falling away from the word but you know what it's got to be that wayen man in this hour we living in that's call out the great hour apostasy amen when people are departing or leaving from the word amen so when that happen don't you fight with him amen remember SE cannot harm seed amen seed don't fight with seed amen amen it's that repeate amen but but why so God you know help me to have that temperament amen I was looking at this on the wall with preaching amen a series on the statute of a perfect man or God's house is building up and we're on the fourth room right now amen Temperance amen amen I said let my temperament that God can work through it amen cuz why he said let me work through that temperament and speak through it amen amen I said that's what I want to be so I won't

him amen ye of your father the devil amen and of the lust of your and of the lust of your father you would do he was a murder from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him uh when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it uh and because I tell you the truth you believe me not uh which of you which of you a man convinces or me or condemn me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god uh amen notice heareth God's words uh ye therefore hear them not because you're not of God Amen whose seed are you tonight amen I said God I'm thankful that we're the Seed of Abraham and because of that amen there was a promise given that while thy seed shall possess the gates of your enemy amen everything the devil try to bring you can step right on over it amen why because Victory is in the promise amen I always say I'm not fighting for victory I'm fighting from Victory amen cuz I already got the victory so that's why I'm fighting from amen and that's why the devil can do you no harm I like the scripture say there's no weapon form against you shall prosper amen it cannot stand amen if you are Seed of Abraham then nothing can stand in your way oh my there's something in that promise for you and I amen I thank God for that let me read something Qui about the prophet say and I'm trying to hear you forgive me for rushing but notice now I'mma end this message amen he swore by himself amen notice this I like this he swore by himself now notice what he said God by Sovereign election has called Abraham's seed amen now just like Paul told us in Romans 8 God by Sovereign election has called Abraham seed then if that type of life that was on the inside of that blood cell was upon Abraham who called the impossible possible amen my Lord now and call the impossible that they would be because God said so amen notice now what kind of people are the Seed of Abraham oh now think about that for a little while now if the blood that was in that blood cell amen amen was in Abraham amen notice now he takes on a certain life amen and then if that same blood amen is in you and I amen and the prophet of God say if the blood of a dead man is putting you and you take on that life amen so if that same life is in me then I shall be just like Abraham amen I shall take on the faith of Abraham I shall take on the endurance of Abraham because we of that seed having the same life and the same blood amen so notice now he goes on to say this amen he said now that's amen if that same life amen then he said now but because God say so he said now please don't miss this he said oh don't miss this please don't I feel it coming from the top of my head he said look now that Prophet was feeling it right there amen he said now then if you are Abraham's se you cannot dispute with god let's stop right there who take that sentence out amen CU some people going to get in trouble oh my amen some people going to get in trouble amen he said if you're Abraham seed oh no notice now you cannot dispute with God Abraham's seed is a part of this spirit amen for God gave Abraham a sign of circumcision uh thank God for the Holy Ghost amen amen uh amen calling cutting off the flesh for a witness he had received him uh in this last days has took the Holy Ghost uh and circumcise every believer thank God Amen every believer amen uh amen been and of cutting off all doubts and unbelief uh to believe God's word uh Amen to to is pure and holy amen I said God that brings me back amen know what it is amen when we talking about the knowledge amen what is it amen amen that's be able to believe God Amen to believe God for all things not worldly knowledge but the knowledge to believe what God say is so amen and it's got to come the past amen so I say thank God in this last day so why they believe all things amen so we find so God circumcised us amen cutting off the flesh amen that we can believe God's word to believe God's word is pure and holy and it's the truth amen circumcision cutting away all unbelief everything Cutting Loose every sh line amen saying God I believe you uh live or die sink or drown uh it's your word I believe it then see what I mean amen oh my so when we begin to see that seed uh amen as that lineage come down amen we can look back and look at it I say God I can see a shamore amen of how that time uh all those years amen letting the devil just come in and just wrecking his home amen taking away everything uh and then one day amen he stood up and say I know who I am amen he begin to look back amen and begin to think about the Covenant I know that I've been circumcised he can see that he was circumcised and I say to day can anybody know that you got the Holy Ghost amen if you know you got the Holy Ghost you can stand like Shamar Oh my he saw that he was circumcised and saw that he had that he was part of that Covenant and when those Philistines came in uh he stood right there he man and said devil you're going no more farther on you got no more steps into my house uh you're not going to bother my children anymore you're not going to Sidetrack my family anymore you're not going to bring every sickness anymore why because I know who I am and he reach over and grab that Ox guard amen and he begin to work on them I said oh God I want to take this word amen hold it in the right and remember my brother said about that sword amen getting it in the hand of Faith amen I said oh God and when the Devil comes in you hold it right there amen don't let him take another step you go Toe to Toe with him and say that's all the father you go amen why because you a Seed of Abraham you don't have to take it you don't have to put up with it you hold true to God's word and that's all God wants in this last day I said God what a tremendous amen promise we have amen but you know sometimes we don't realize who we are I believe brother R even said that one time you know that we don't realize who we are he said that man set beside you is a Son of God he said that woman set beside you is a daughter of God we all are Sons and Daughters of God said it any Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now he said oh my like that and he say and now amen now what is it man Jehovah gy amen is here to provide all that you have need of oh my I said God why all because you are Abraham's seed oh my you shall have need of nothing amen I say God let me realize what I have don't let me walk around with with holes in my clothes don't let me walk around with no shoes amen don't let why because I got a treasure amen I got a treasure so full that anything I have need of God can provide amen he's still Jehovah Gyra amen and if I'm sick amen he's still Jehovah RFI amen able to heal all of my sickness amen every Redemptive name he still is that tonight amen I say thank God Amen all because you are Seed of Abraham you have these precious promises amen so I say thank God for this in this last day that God has given us this amen remember now this cover that we're part of unconditional not what you will do but what he's already done and I thank God for that cuz I messed things up I messed things up but God man he does it for us all the time and as I said I believe Malachi 4 has come to restore amen the faith amen the faith of the back to the Royal Seed of Abraham amen who see you are tonight amen therefore amen all the things of the world they're dull to the believer right they D they dead to the believer amen let me read you something the prophet say right quickly amen out of the Statue of a perfect man he's now lust for money lust for big things Lust For popularity these things are dead to the believer amen we don't care a tent or Cottage why should I care live or die sink or drown this is the thing that I'm interested in the kingdom of God oh my that's only thing Abraham was interested in he was seeking a city whose maker and Builder was God Amen nothing else bother him amen he was what he was just interested in one thing uh I say God let that be my interest in this last day one thing uh the kingdom of God amen amen the kingdom of God he said no it's not the kingdom of God whether I maintain my home whether I maintain my family whether I maintain whatever it is let me maintain Christ Our Hope of glory amen I'm not going to tell you let your weeds grow up in your yard I'm not going to tell you let the shingles fall off your house but you know that don't matter to me as long as I got Christ amen now you keep your house up amen but the main thing is keep Christ first amen keep Christ up a because this word must become our absolute this word Must Be My ultimate that that's my hitching post that nothing can draw me away from it right because I'm a Seed of Abraham call into things that are not as though they are amen and everything that comes in he disown those why because they didn't bother him anymore amen he was the Seed of Abraham you know sometime you know when things are going good everybody's happy oh yeah everybody's happy you know especially when a meeting am man like the sun was going on Amen and happiness going on am man the Holy Spirit falling everything's going good but you let the testing time come oh that's when we know amen what we are made out of and I say God I want to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'm made of that stock amen of the Seed of Abraham that when testing time come which we going to go through amen I believe brother hom was hitting on am man how am man we getting ready to go through some things the handwriting is on the wall the handwriting is on the wall amen amen we're getting ready to go how did our Prophet say watch Russia and we hear a lot of influence about Russia Heen and then you know we thought that we' get ready to go home cuz we thought my secretary Hillary uh Hillary Clinton was going to win you know we oh boy it's time to get out here but you know what he said perhaps the Catholic church then one place he say not the church not a woman but a church amen but then they got this thing going on where all these women are Uprising my wife she say she said oh oh y'all better watch out he said that might be that woman coming up now all those women marching amen I said oh my I said whatever happens I'm sealed away in God Amen whatever take place I'm all right amen Abraham didn't worry about amen he knew who he believed amen and that the Bible say why that we know that God is able Amen to keep that which we have entrusted in him amen and he that begun a good work in us going to continue until the day of Jesus Christ amen so whatever Russia does Amen whatever araq Iran and China Japan whatever they do amen I'm all right with God Amen I'm a Seed of Abraham amen those things don't bother amen so I said God Amen Abraham's seed will stand Abraham had an endurance about him that no one can can compare amen amen against all ours he stood amen and I like he man when things seem like it won't working he still stood on the word of God Abraham say Sarah you feel any better any different no bless God we going to have it anyhow why was he standing like that because God said so amen and there she was you know approaching 90 something years old and he approaching 100 amen oh my still say God says so I the prophet God said can you see him going down to the doctor and say now doctor we want to make preparation we going to have a baby that's right now today they would have took him right from there put that little white coat on him that put his hands that he can't use him and they L him down to one of them little homes and they'll watch him around the clock cuz they say wrong with him amen but he knew what was going on amen he knew that God said so and no matter what any doctor said he knew God say so amen and that's why I say God let me have that same Faith amen let that same line dwell in me tonight that we can take on Amen the every promise that God gave to Abraham so I said there we are man seeing these things happen me man so the devil better watch out man because Abraham seed takes God at his word and they hold on to God's word amen and I believe that we as go as Abraham seed and being dead in Christ we take on Amen Abraham seed and the promises that come along with it amen according to the Covenant amen and I believe Abraham's seed will stay true and will not fail even when the testing come amen they'll stand just as galling as Abraham did you know I begin to think about you know when we look down through time and see how the seed man you know I begin to think about shadra mea and abedo of how when it looked like it was the end for them but there was something that God said in his word he told him that you going to come back to this land amen you know and and but it looked like it was it was it was it was DM for a in a dismal hour amen it was a blink you know things seemed like it was just going to be totally taken out but you know what they believe God's word amen bow down he said oh no can't do it there's something in me won't let me do it and he said we going to put you fire fiter and they begin to look at him be dramatized and say are you prayed up are you prayed up and oh King live forever we don't care what you do uh we don't have to be careful how we answer you on this we don't care what you do amen amen our God is able amen and even if he if we have to go down in the furniture amen my God is able amen and they went down with that attitude amen and I said God here we are in this last day uh amen we go through some things and we just don't want trust you anymore we go through because you w't answer right away while we give up on everything but not shadra M and abedo they march on down in that fire FR and they begin to turn it up seven times harder you know how the world does put pressure on you the world Amen they're not your friend you might

cuz you have love one for another and moreover that I love God amen amen and not so much that I love him but because he loves me amen amen and gave himself amen but notice now so notice he saying now you can't do it amen the blue days are all over amen oh my so if You' been having them it's all over amen count your blessings one by one and you know why you never get finished counting down even when you wake up every day while amen God's mercies are renewed every day when you think you use them all up amen you get up the next day and they're all renewed amen I say What a Mighty God what a faithful God and all because we are the Seed of Abraham amen so no now say it's all over amen amen he said so be it all all the weariness and sadness has passed away now amen oh my oh my you are Seed

why David said when you get sad he say Lord restore the joy of my salvation amen take not thy Holy Spirit Away from but notice now so we finally say you can't do it amen it's all over he can't do it God said so it's got to be just as sure as there is a in heaven we've got to do it God's done said so out of the message it is the rising of the sun amen Rising the sun I'll try to close on this but notice now he said now the very essence of the message that was sent that he's risen from the dead how many thank God he's risen from the dead was was his beneficiaries now you know what benefits are don't you you know when you take out these these policies and everything they say who's the beneficiary you got to put a name down there amen so that when everybody when everything is over that person you are the beneficiary or you are the person who receives everything that that person has and usually you don't get that until the beneficiary is dead amen oh my thank God in this last day amen well he gave me all things amen a oh that pertaineth to life go but but no it's not let me hurry I got to hurry but no it's not he said now he said now the very essence of the message that was sent that he's risen from the dead we we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this oh my now I'm getting ready to retire from my job I'm happy about it you I tell all the Young Folks keep on working so you can pay into the social security so my check can come every month so you get up every morning and go to work amen don't be lazy go to work amen amen but you know but but so so soon I you know I'll be looking for benefits I'll be sitting on the porch and watching your truck with the eagle on it ride by put something in my box amen let me know that something's already on deposit that something's already on deposit amen and all I got to do is say h thank you Lord I got amen and you know what don't sometime don't have to move out my house they go s amen it's gone am I say oh my now I have to kind of keep a little bit from my wife you know but anyhow but we find But but so we get benefits we have all the promises that God gave in this word so when I begin to read something and I begin to say you know what that's you know that's yours amen that's yours amen Abraham look at all of it amen you you you thought that Abraham had had lost with now he told lot well you go over there and take all of that and lot looked at all the Luscious The Plains of of of Sodom you know and gar went over there got all of that and here go Abraham and be say oh my Abraham lost he said now Abraham now Abraham look up open your eyes look at all of that is yours amen oh my so you know why the devil don't have anything on you no sir not one thing on you amen he may wreck your car but you know why God got a better thing for amen he may cause a little damage here and there but God got something better for you man so I don't let him get me down amen because I know when he does something God is getting me to do something bigger amen and I say oh I'm just waiting on it I'm just waiting on it why because God watch that wayen cuz I say thank God in this last day man for being there for the Seed of Abraham so little bride don't you worry man don't you get weary Amen in wello don't you faint man because God going to take care of you man so notice right quick and I'm hting to clo am man so we Fally said now he said now he said you benefit and you get the benefits amen amen what is that amen you get draw benefit from this by proven to the world that he's alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we're apped to amen and he says some few things but I going to drop down to and if the life of a man that's dead be projected in you you will live the same life you live oh my whose seed are you am I living like the Abraham I'm living like that Royal seed Christ amen oh my noce now because if tell that the prophet said you got to have the same type of fa virtue that he had the same type of knowledge he had that you can add to your faith amen oh my cuz it almost stum me when I say he say faith alone won't do it I said why he said he said you got to add you got to supplement amen because we got to have a faith that will not fail we got to have a faith that will not fail and when Peter said I'm speaking to those who have who have attained like Precious Faith oh my what that faith that was given in the beginning that we contended for and he said you build on that amen oh my let me hurry hey that's another message but no it's not he say and the life of a man that's dead be projected in you you will live the same life he live if the blood of a man was in a was a certain type and you took the blood from one man and changed the blood and change the blood of the one man into to another he would absolutely be that type blood oh my who was that uh said that I thing was brother hom mosquito B you he got say there's power in the blood now there ain't no power in my blood but there's power in the blood of Jesus Christ amen and that's why he was saying man you got that blood in you amen that Royal Blood of Jesus CH oh my oh oh my time he's so wonderful I tell you you you know used to be when I was growing up I had a speech impediment and I found out later on that really there was nothing wrong with me it was just that my brain was working faster than my mouth I just couldn't get it out because my my brain was and I couldn't get it out you know couldn't get it out you know so when I learned to slow it down then I could speak those words cuz I used to say a word and and it just fell apart prob say huh what you say cuz it just fell apart you know cuz my brain was working so fast my mouth couldn't get it out but now I can see you probably didn't know I had one cuz I learned to slow it down and then I can let let it work and sink see God has a way of doing things that I don't get ahead of him he has a way of do that don't I don't get ahead of him that when I speak I speak as the words of God not mine but his amen oh that's another message let me he but notice now so we finally said now but you take on that blood type you become that he now if your spirit that's in you is reckon dead and you are anointed with the life that was in Christ is upon you you know in Romans 118 811 he said if the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it also quickens your mul body that same life them same Powers uh the same beneficiaries oh my oh my that you know when Peter was walking on the to the gate called Beautiful the little man say asking for arms he said well Silver and Gold Have I None amen but such as I have amen I got some benefits amen such as I have give I into you amen now that was that virtue that was able to come from him oh my oh my but no now such as I have I give to you amen but no he said but we have the same beneficiaries same benefits amen that he had that that he had here on Earth from God he redeemed you a a seed that was forn by God whose name was put on the Lamb's Book in 2010 2005 to 1946 before the foundation of the world oh my I always was with him he called me to this and I thank God Amen and that Gospel Light of the Resurrection the confirmation of of the word how did we know he was Christ because he proved what he talked about rightly if you can't walk the talk stop talking amen if you can't walk the talk stop talking amen but he proved what he said amen and he did it amen the Seed of Abraham should be able to do the same thing amen he proved what he said amen amen I thank God for that how do you know and how will I know the message of the hour God proves what he promised sir cuz he got a group of people sir many member body called the bride and God has proven every day that he's still Jehovah that he's still God he's still a savior he's still a Healer he's proven his word that every promise in the book amen is yours amen amen he promised it amen amen God proves what he promised and he talks about it that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he has talked about amen aren't you thankful for that amen whose seed are you tonight amen if you're the Seed of Abraham then walk like Abraham amen act like Abraham live like Abraham and not only that but Christ amen who's that Royal seed amen and if that life is in you it brings a whole different aspect to who you are amen you'll be a little shamard you'll be a little me sh right V go
