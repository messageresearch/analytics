amen we'll have a baptism service and a holy ghost meeting and amen do you love the Lord this morning amen isn't it good amen so this morning if we could let's turn in to our Bibles in the book of Ephesians um I want to to speak to you today uh from this Ephesians series again um I I I'm doing it a little bit different as you've already noticed um I am going through but some of these uh scriptures uh of course desire deserve a lot more time than I'm spending on them uh but like a some of these sections uh Paul is saying something that we've we've preached it real thoroughly as far as like the the Gentiles coming into the body and then the build to the habitation so I'm covering four and five six scriptures at the same time but rather than just systematically teaching I'm talking about the subject around it uh so uh if we want to this morning we're going to read Ephesians 3: 14 down to 21 and this will be uh this will be a prayer here that Paul has made and uh I I think it's very powerful Ephesians 3:14 Paul Begins by saying for this cause I bow my knes unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named so the father's name is Jesus Jesus said I come in my father's name and his name was Jesus and the whole family's name is Jesus so Father Son and Holy Ghost Jesus amen that would Grant according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the the inner man yeah that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that you be rooted and grounded in love and brother Rays on this love Series so I'm going to skip this little area here and I'm going to read it to you but you but you he's preaching it and you may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height he he's going to measure it out I thought that was pretty powerful he got her he got her measured out and to know the love of Christ which passees knowledge so he's talking about the measurement and now he says that it's going to pass your knowledge amen and then he says now unto him that is able somebody say He's Able unto him that is able to do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we could ask or think according to the power that worketh in us I I like that and unto him be glory in the church by Jesus Christ by Christ Jesus throughout all the ages the World Without End let's bow our hearts almighty God we thank you this morning as your children we've come to the house of the Lord to serve you and to Worship You Lord and we certainly want the devil to know what side we're on we want to make our our hearts known Lord before before you and before this world that Lord we love you and we want to serve you and we desire this morning that you would come and take your word and bless this congregation and them that have gathered together now we ask it father in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you as you be seated today I want to speak to you here from this 20th verse it'll be the uh the uh context of my thought today I want to title it if I could a Divine ability a Divine ability uh I I just was reading over this and I thought it was amazing that Paul was talking about depths and Heights and breaths and then he says but unto him that is able to do it exceedingly so after you get it all figured out Paul said there's somebody that can do more than you could think or that you could ask or that you could imagine or that you could dream amen unto him that can exceed he's able to exceed whatever you think he exceeds that what what a and not just he does it but he does it abundantly amen above all now it's because of his potential because God is able amen I I think it's a very powerful thing when you look at what uh the reason all these things can happen is because that God is able amen meaning having the power or having the skill he has the means he has the opportunity to do something he's able amen God is is able I I I think of this because it speaks of ability or it speaks of potential it means he can do it amen because he's able that's right he can do it because he's able now I I I'm thinking of this today amen sitting here and hearing these testimonies and looking across this congregation and amen and brother brother Andy I'm so glad to see him in service today knowing knowing that he's a testimony you know God is able amen God is able to do these things now according to Paul in Hebrews 13 which brother Bram loved this scripture was one of the main themes of his scripture that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen in other words whatever he was he still is and whatever he did he still does because he's the same he is an unchanging God with unchanging nature and with unchanging ways amen according to Malachi 3 and: 6 he prophesies and said for I am the Lord and I change not therefore you're the sons of Jacob are not consumed so God says I am God and I change not so not only is it that Paul would say it now he said it and brother bam says it like this he says and what good is a historical Christ if he isn't the same today what good is us to teach the Bible to our children or to talk about the God that was with our fathers or The God that was in Pentecost or The God that was with Martin Luther or The God was with brother brandham what good would it do to talk about this kind of God if he wasn't exactly the same kind of God this morning amen and the prophet of God says see he says but what good does it do to take a canary bird and feeding fine vitamins he said and have pretty feathers and have strong wings and then keep him in a cage he says it doesn't do him any good good and we talk about how great God was he said then don't say he's the same yesterday today and forever something's wrong we've caged up somewhere and that's a false conception of what God is the Bible says he's the same and he's the same he hasn't changed one bit he's the same yesterday today and forever and now we have today in this day and time like they did in his day we have our own thought of it but surely if there's any way in the world that we would truly know we will have to find out what he was and then we can find out what he was in other ages so the prophet is saying that the reason that we find out what God was in another age is to find out what he could do in our age amen the reason that we would look into the power of God and the reality of God is only to discover what is available to us this morning because we serve the same God and he has not changed and remember the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever so we'll have to find out what he was into other ages he when he walked on the earth and how the age after he was on the earth and he left the Earth we found out what he was and he'll be the same thing today I believe that God is the same and I believe you can do the same things this morning that he ever did now according to the Bible amen the question is not on God but the question is on us it was a man one time that had a child that the pH uh that the uh disciples themselves were praying for and and he wasn't able to deliver him and the scripture says that the man brought the child unto Jesus amen and when he brought him he says this child amen was foaming on the ground and Jesus said now how long has it been this way of of a child and and he says well this child he cast himself into the fire and into the waters to destroy him he says but if thou can do anything have compassion on us and help us and Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible amen unto him that believeth now there's the question this morning it's not on whether God can amen because the scripture says God is able amen but it's not is God able to do it it's are we able to believe he can do it amen I think this morning what a powerful thing that God took care of all of the things that we need for our healing and for our salvation and then turn to us and said if we were able to believe amen that all things are possible to them that do believe amen now that's a that's a lot when you say all things amen all things are possible to them that believe amen I think this morning the prophet says it like this he says now here it is healing is already yours the only thing that is he said maybe sin maybe sometime something you're doing in your life or something is not right or some Demon is holding over you that won't let you believe he said now you know but if it isn't Jesus told you something wrong all things are possible to them that believe is that right there it lays within you and not God my goodness amen that what we need this morning doesn't lay in God it lays in US amen if we can only believe all things are possible to them that believe amen the Propet of God says it like this we've got to break through the barrier now you know what he's talking about he's talking about the sound barrier in times past where man was not able to break through the barrier of sound amen just like you remember the the runners when they wanted to run and used to be that couldn't nobody run a 4minute mile now it's more than standard that people run 4minute miles used to be amen that people thought you couldn't fly now we can fly there was a barrier but it's gone and when they could fly then they they said well you can't fly past the sound barrier but then jger proved you can get past the sound barrier amen and whatever fear they had breaking that barrier that man did it and proved you not only can do it but it gets smoother on the other side amen and sometimes when we come up to barriers amen and the enemy is saying to us this is impossible this part can't happen amen you've been too far too long there's been too much trouble it's been here too many years it'll never take place amen but I say this morning you are to press through the barrier of unbelief and say God is able this morning and let me say this if you ever break through the barrier things get smoother on the other side amen I tell you this morning the prophet of God said we've got to break through that power of unbelief and then Miracles and things now watch what he's saying the only thing between us and a miracle is the power of unbelief then he said then like this you break through that power of unbelief Miracles and things and Promises of God become unlimited my goodness when you break through that barrier of unbelief Miracles become Unlimited in other words amen there's no limit on what God can do when a man gets past the barrier of his own mind of his own experience of his own intellectual failures of his own sinful thoughts of his own troubles in his life all things are possible with God when we begin to believe amen I know I know somebody says I I know I'm already been through it myself while I was studying this but what about this situation what about that situation amen I'll tell you what I'm going to do this morning I'm going to focus out every situation you know I'm going to focus out any reason to disbelieve this word and we're going to come directly to the channel of faith and say by God's grace I believe this amen it doesn't matter matter what my eyes see it doesn't matter what my thoughts are it doesn't what my flesh believes it has nothing to do with it our sin debt was paid for that day on Calvary we have a reason this morning to believe that God can do these things even with the weakness of our ability God is still able amen it doesn't matter who it is that does it if God does it he's still able to do it amen in The Book of Mark ma Matthew you'll find amen even when Jesus is discussing to the Rich Young Ruler amen and he says to him Lord I'd like to inherit eternal life and he said go sell all you have and come follow me and the young man was saddened in his heart now now here's something that's powerful because the Bible said Jesus looked at him and loved him amen so God did love him amen God so loved everybody amen and he loved him but he asked him he said he said listen what you have to do is sell all your you have and come follow me and the boy couldn't do it because he wasn't ready to follow Vindicated word into leadership that's right amen he was still under the Pharisee laws and the ideas amen and and you know uh uh it's amazing because immediately Jesus turns to his disciples and said see it's hard for a rich man to come into heaven and he even describes that he can't get through the eye like taking a camel through the eye of an needle now I've heard people talk about what all that is but whatever Jesus meant by that it's hard for a rich man to get in heaven that's what he said that's what he said and they come back and said amen under the disciples meedi amazed and they said well who can be saved amen if you I think I I would ask him the same thing then Lord who can be saved and then Jesus said see but he beheld them and said with men this is impossible but With God all things are possible and I like that amen amen with man it ain't possible but With God all things are possible amen God in other words not only is it to him that believe there is nothing impossible but to amen With God all things are possible so it's actually possible with God he can save anybody he wants to save amen God can save from the gutter most and put them in the uttermost because he's God he can do the saving and there's nothing impossible with God there's just nothing impossible with God folks God Saves who he wants to he saved me and you didn't know me but let me tell you that took a lot of saving amen and you know some people that you say there's no way amen with man you're right it's impossible with man it'll never happen but with the God I serve there is nothing impossible with that God he could take a drunk off the street and save him he can take the attic out of the cocaine houses and he can save them he can take listen Church we're talking about a god that is able he's able to change the situations he's able to change a man's home he's able to save the situations of Our Lives listen he's the kind of God brother he knows your prayers he knows the situations of your life amen I I I believe this morning amen that there is a God here amen that is has things that are possible and I I love how it says it here in the Book of Luke amen even with with a Mary some people say well brother Wayne I ain't never seen a miracle like that done in my life well does that make it impossible because we've never seen it or never heard of it being with someone now watch this obediently abundantly now we know whatever he done for somebody else he could do for us but what about something you're believing for that you've never seen anybody else get it or you never seen nobody else do it how do you know that you're not the one God's going to use to prove to the world he can do that amen it's just like there was only one leopard healed in the days of of Syria amen when Elijah was there but later the scripture tells us amen there was only one healed and brother BR said that little girl testifying to non didn't didn't even know that God could heal leprosy amen but she had seen him do so many things she believed he could do anything so she said if you just get in the presence of my God and there was only one man healed of leprosy Amen in that day and I say this he will come the example our lord Jesus himself used him in his generation to make an example of so sometimes maybe you're going to be the first person God uses to do something you may become the example God's going to use to say I can do this and there's my example right there hey can you imagine Amen in the Bible that when Isaiah said behold a virgin shall conceive half the people left church that morning thinking they were following a crazy Prophet but the prophet of God said had had Isaiah thought about it he would have never said it he said but being a Vindicated prophet he just said it when it came and I imagine after it got out of his mouth he said dear Lord what have I said a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child see but it had already been prophesied in Genesis amen that there would be a woman seed Amen in the book of Isaiah it says that God would do a new thing that a woman would Compass a man in other words a virgin would bring a child upon the Earth amen and nobody had ever did it before now we seen we seen it when God went to Zacharias and and Zacharias was questioning the angel of the Lord remember God had to shut up his literally had to make him mute amen he couldn't the man couldn't even talk because of the way he questioned the promise of God until they had the baby he said because God's words would be accomplished and when God speaks something it's going to be accomplished you might as well shut up and wait on it to come and if you can't testify the positive God Amen took away the negative wouldn't even let the man talk until it came into action amen and brother B said and and Zacharias had all those examples he could have looked at Sarah and have what God done for her and could have looked at Hannah and he could have looked at all the examples he said but when God came to Mary that little that little young girl when the angel be to speak to her and said thou going to have a child amen and she said Lord I haven't known a man how's this thing going to be and the angel said to her Thou shalt be overshadowed with the Holy Ghost amen isn't it amazing Amen in Luke 137 it says because with God nothing shall be impossible with God nothing shall be impossible Amen Let me just give you a little breakdown on this the word that is spoken comes with the power to fulfill it so there is no word uttered out of the mouth of God that it doesn't have power within itself to fulfill it when it comes the same as every seed that came into the Earth had power to bring a tree out of a sea when God speaks a word whatever that word is it holds the power to fulfill itself when Isaiah said it he said listen the word of God cannot return unto me void but must accomplish that what I have sent it unto amen I tell you this morning amen there is nothing that is impossible with our God amen now sometimes you just got to take God's word for it and sometimes that's all you got is God's word for it sometimes you don't have any other thing to point at but God's word listen when when when Mary left brother BR said she ran to Elizabeth's house and she was shouting and rejoicing and when Elizabeth saw her she said what is your joy about and brother BR said she said Elizabeth must have said to her did here that we're going to have a child is that what you're so happy about she said yeah Elizabeth I've heard about you I heard about the baby coming I'm so excited for y'all but there's something else that's on my heart this morning I tell you I met an angel up there and he told me I was going to have a child and I was going to call his name Jesus and brother B said the moment the Bible said it when the name Jesus was spoken that the baby John that was in the womb of Elizabeth had never moved for six months and when it heard the name Jesus it begin to LEAP within the womb I tell you the first convert of the name of Jesus was his Forerunner and he done it in the womb amen let me say this morning if it does that to a dead baby in the womb of a woman what would the name of Jesus do Amen in the Church of the Living God who is alive with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I tell you what it ought to do it ought to break out in such a rejoicing in the house of God come on Church we're not a dead Church we're a living church and the name of Jesus is above all names brother Bram said sometimes you got to take that word he says no matter how impossible it looks you begin to believe God Amen now here's the thing Amen brother BR said she didn't wait Mary didn't wait till she was positive she didn't she didn't wait till she seen one physical sign yeah yeah I I'm not crazy this what he talk not one sign he said I he said now I've looked for signs of it he was in a Revival and he said not every seed is even full in the place maybe even 2third full he said but it doesn't matter we don't have to have an overflowing crowd we do have one this morning but amen he said but he says see they only had a 100 in the upper room 120 he says now God started a Revival with 120 completely surrendered into his hands and that's never ended a fire that can't be put out what could do it here tonight with hundreds in his hands getting ready believing holding to the promise before him Mary could have waited till she had some kind of sign that she was going to be a mother and you could wait till after these meetings are over you could go home and then maybe then you could move your crippled leg or you could hear a little better out of a deaf ear or that cancer seemed to me not as bad as what was bothering you he said that's not taking God in his word he said take God in his word is to hear the word accept it and start rejoicing to take God in his word is to hear the word accept the word and start rejoicing you said brother Wayne what's going to happen I don't know what's going to happen it ain't my promise it ain't my word it ain't what I said it's what the message of the hour has spoken oh over this generation and let me say this I'll stand with a prophet I'll stand with him I'll say that God's word is true it's yes and amen and there's no backup in this word there's no backup in the faith of God Amen I love how he says it to take his word accept it and start rejoicing he said we could have 500 at the altar tonight which would be a good sign of a Revival is breaking out he said but we don't have to have them amen at the altar he said we have to take God's word for it and start rejoicing something's going to happen the word brings life he says now he's talking about having Revival there in California and he's saying we're going to have Revival I don't care if he's anybody in the altar or not we're going to have Revival don't matter how many people's in the seats he's given you how that you have Revival when you can't see Revival he said when Jesus told them to wait in the upper room in the city of Jerusalem until they were doed with power on high that word fell on their ears and they were in that Temple continually praising God he said day and night what were they doing they were watering that promise oh all of the sudden there came a sound from Heaven Like A Mighty rushan Wind and filled the house where they were sitting the word was being watered it took life and started growing and if you're wanting a Revival start watering the word amen it makes me feel religious myself he said if you want to come out of that wheelchair start watering the word if you want to come from that cancer start watering the word Little Ricky here in his testimony tonight God loves to heal cancer God loves to heal sickness if we want to see healing in our lives we've got to take the word accept the word and start rejoicing before we see the physical sign this is the way Miracles are performed this is the way God does things in our lives don't you let no die no no devil tell you you that God don't do these things or that these things are not acceptable in our generation you tell that dirty devil you don't have a right in my mind or in my spirit or in my soul I am a believer and I know the word of God and I'm going to Rejoice whether I see it or whether I don't see it it doesn't make any difference because if I die I'll go down rejoicing but when I come up I'm going to come up rejoicing because I'm going to praise the water of the word of God I say we are to pour the water on the power of the Holy Spirit Until It Breaks out into our lives you'll never you'll never be the Revival out of this altar you'll never be a Revival out of your Pew you'll never beat yourself up till you get a Revival you will never get a Revival until you accept that Jesus died for you that you have repented of your sins and they are covered under the blood and he made a promise to you you could have the Holy Ghost I say this morning quit waiting on the Holy Ghost and start thanking God for the holy ghost in your life said preacher I thought we had to come to the altar to get it I don't know who told you that they didn't even have altars in the in the in the upper room they didn't have altars in the first churches cuz cuz it was what it was what they did to worship pagan gods they fell at an altar God moved the altars out of the room and said there too many of them that believe that could receive the Holy Ghost I tell you what we need this morning is believing we need to to believe God we need to believe he changes we need to believe he's able Hallelujah brother bam said God ignored our Doctrine to give us the Holy Ghost so we don't have to get our Doctrine right we got to believe we got to have we got to believe he's able this morning he can break through the corridors of our life amen you said I never seen it before well God's into doing things you ain't never seen he can do things that are exceedingly and abundantly above what you could even think or what you could even ask you can't even think up something God can't do you can't even have a dream about something God can't do he is God and he's able this morning to change the situations of Our Lives Hallelujah that's right he's able he can do a new thing amen I believe we are to water that word when it's spoken we water it with praise because that's what makes it grow in our lives I tell you no doubt and dirty devil can get around me but he's going to have to listen to me he can come to church but he's going to have to listen to me preach amen he's going to have to hear scripture after scripture after scripture he's going to have to hear Brother Richard shouting amen he's going to have to hear Brother Ray amen as he speaks in tongues under his breath amen amen you're going he's going to have to listen to us cuz we're not going to shut up we're not going to sit down we're not going to back away we're not going to say oh that's okay Mr devil you won no he didn't win he never wins we already have the victory in the blood of Jesus Christ and I will give him praise for what he has done unto our lives Hallelujah he is able somebody say it he's able yes he's able I don't know what you're going through but he's able He's Able I want to make preachers out of everybody in the building this morning turn and tell somebody beside you our God is able amen he ain't just Lord he's my Lord he ain't just God he's my God if I could speak Hebrew I'd do it with another language amen I think it was ad on ey wasn't it amen was what she said it's not just Lord and made him my Lord amen Shout It Out sis what is it Adonai Adon I well I'll tell you what he's my Adonai amen he's my Lord and he's my king and there's nothing above him and his name is Jesus are you you hear me he's able this morning I don't care what you're going through He's Able this morning to change the circumstances of Our [Applause] Lives listen as a pastor as a preacher we would we would lose our minds to think that we somehow could fix you we would lose our mind to think that somehow amen that I had the ability Amen to do something to fix you or your life or your marriage or your health amen look amen I got somebody a call on because I'm just a weak vessel just like you're a weak vessel but I know a god that is able and if he's able he can take a weak man and put his ability in that man and God can heal and God can save and God can cast out spirits but he does it by the hands of a weak human being Hallelujah He's Able hey I know nobody had ever seen it they had never seen one man walk down into a kingdom of the largest army in the world and say hey you've had these slaves here 400 years and I know that you're living and there's two million of them but turn them loose it going on with me let me tell you there's a miracle that Moses even got an audience with a pharaoh there's where your Miracle started go try to have a go you go go sign up and see the president tomorrow come on the media can't even see that guy it was a miracle it was a miracle that they got in and then he told him hey let my people go now you think about what he's telling this man crashed the economy of Egypt because there's a 400 year- Old promise here to a man that was a Drifter with his and they had a brw of kids and they call them Israel and they live in tents and they talk funny and they got long beards and come on they were a rejected people they were seen as muddobbers let them go they're God's people true well I tell you what if we can't we we we ain't going to let them go well then God started unleashing plagues y'all y'all know the six seal story so but let's take it back there for a moment do you know what God can do anything he want wants because he's able you know what's amazing amen I I just looked through him this morning he turned the water of the country into blood hey think about this brother said he brought frogs and they I don't know how deep they were but can you imagine come on he he multiplied frogs among them well that wasn't bad but when he got to them lies and I bet they didn't have modern lies treatment they were in their beds they were in their hair they were in their clothes they were all over there's no getting around it no getting away from it listen if you think that there's a devil that can hold God's children amen I want you to know that my God is able and I don't care how powerful the economy I don't care how power for the kingdom amen When God says let my child go it will turn loose because He Still Remains to be God and he plagued them with plagued them with lies he plagued them with frogs he plagued them with blood turned in and water turned into blood and then can you imagine he started going in and put bows on them and then it started raining fire out of heaven now you you're serving the kind of God that controls nature am I ever seen fire rain out of the heavens come on but he called fire out of the heavens he called Locust upon their fields amen and then he caused Darkness to fall across the entire country amen it was so dark you couldn't see your hand in front of your face because God is able he's able to control the heavens he controls the Earth he controls the waters he controls the fields he controls the floods he controls the plagues he is God and he's in control and I say this morning his sovereignty is my ity because he's Sovereign I don't have to worry this morning my God is Not chewing his fingernails how this going to come out God's not on a on a counseling program he's not on xan axer volumes he's God and he makes every situation move to the word that he has spoken over it Hallelujah I tell you why because he's able when you're driving down the rad going home look at your family and say God's able now hey I I I agree people hadn't seen things like this they had a right to to go is this really possible yeah they really they read never seen like you you take you take Caleb and Joshua and them spies and they go over there now they had all of them had Faith to come out you know they all had Faith to come out under those great plages but when they got out in the desert amen and and years they go to look over in the land and 12 comes back but 10 of them comes back and says hey man there's Giants over there I know God promised land but there's Giants in that land and there's wall cities in that land and we'll we'll never be able to take that land and I love what the I love that what Caleb pronounces in in numbers 13 Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once let us go up at once he says and possess it for we are well able to overcome it for we are well able to overcome it Caleb knew he wasn't able to tear down walls or beat Giants but he knew that was a promise from God that they could possess that land and the God that he was serving had already done these things he' already opened the Red Sea he' already delivered two million people out into a desert listen I I I I know I I just just I got to put this out here to you amen it's it's like brother Seth it's like having a birthday party and inviting the whole church now you can do it but what you going to do with them when you get them you can do it and everybody might come but what you going to do if you got a house my size not everybody can come unless we do it out in the backyard we do that once in a while just have it out in the backyard and everybody can come but what I'm saying to you is how you feed two million after you get them what do you amen how how do you how do you Doctor the kids how do you how do you take care of the of the earaches and the coughs and how do you take listen to me amen you're talking about two million people but he knew God was able he didn't have it all figured out but he knew God was able to do it now that same God that did all of that was now Caleb was professing we are able because what he was doing is he was looking at a promise that God had made now promises transfer ability say that one more time promises transfer ability what you're not able to do God is able to do but he transfers it to you by promise so when God makes a promise you believe the promise you've now taken the power and ability of God and using it for your own ability yes I think it's powerful you said well preacher is that really sure it really is Jesus in Mark 11 he cursed a tree a fig tree he cursed it and when they saw it and marveled at it Jesus said unto them if you have faith in God you could say unto this mountain here be moved and cast into the sea he transferred his spoken word ability to those that heard the promises of God because he was able they became able because he's able you you're able you are able to subdue this morning you're able to come through this morning because he is able you're able it's a promise over your life and Promises transfer ability man when I think about this I think of I think of how sometimes we we look at things and how God looks at them and and I I as as I'm reading Moses sometimes I really get him I really get what he's what he's saying here but do you know that when Caleb and Joshua delivered these powerful speech that were able the congregation all rejoiced and said okay let's go over no it's not what happened do youall know what really happened the congregation picked up stones and stoned them for it honestly that's what happened because you know it's easier to preach law than Faith come on it's easier to preach law than Faith it's easier to preach a law than Grace it's easier to subdue a group group of people by fear rather than by courage and ability but the prophet said God ha given you his courage and his ability do you believe you have the ability see amen that's the thing amen that the devil don't want you to believe n we are more than cockers in Christ over all these things whatever they are we're going to get through it folks now of course they wasn't preaching to this congregation but that's what happened in the Bible because it was a mixed audience so they picked up stones and they stoned them and God turned around and said I'll tell you what I'm going to do because you've stoned my children you not believe my promises your your carcasses is going to rot in this Wilderness and I'm going to destroy the whole thing and I'm going to get people that can believe me and while God's going off Moses says hold up now think about this all of a sudden Moses has got a better idea than [Music] God come on Church brother said that's Christ and Moses that was Christ in Moses that wasn't Moses but God's ability of Counsel had come into a mortal man and he was counseling God hold on Lord don't kill him don't destroy him Lord cuz we took them out of Egypt as a group and they're going to say down there in Egypt that the god of Moses is not God enough to deliver the children into the land so don't let your reputation be tarnished and God said okay amen I won't this destroy them all I'll save two of them and I'll leave them out here until another generation Rises up that's like Caleb and Joshua amen because they have believed my promises do you see what Moses did with God he said to him your reputation God your reputation what they're going to say about you do you recognize that God was interested in his reputation that people that heard about the God of Moses and the god of Abraham he wanted them to know he is a delivering God and he able to deliver thee from the hands of Egyptians he's able to deliver thee from the hands of Philistines and give you the possessions that he wants it's his reputation on the line and you can you imagine now y'all know what I'm talking about because that generation come up later David David goes in the promised land amen and he's over there fighting and he comes up and sees a whole bunch of his brothers and they're sitting on the side of the hill and the prophet said they were all just basically Paralyzed by fear got so scared they couldn't move one place brother Bram said they turn Yer he said their liver messed up on them scared the liver out of me says took me a while to catch that one when you Scar the liver out of somebody they turn yellow but brother B said when David walked up there and saw the situation and what it was he said ' let me go fight this fell he's the youngest among them he's not got weapons yeah he's not got anything of a of a of a background of a soldier he's a hard playing curly-headed boy with a slingshot yeah let's just get it out there but he knew that he was watching his father's sheep and he had saw that Gods was not going to allow amen a line to take them sheep so God gave him ability to deliver sheep and he gave him ability to kill a bear and he said now the god that killed this Lon and killed this bear he's the same kind of God that's going to deliver this uncircumsized Philistine into my hands and I love it because when he went off the when he went off into the B he didn't he didn't go off into battle with Saul's armor and I I know you've heard these things but I I think it's pretty good cuz Saul tried to put something on him he said now wait evented I ain't tried this stuff out I ain't proved I ain't proved what you're trying to put on me right you see sometimes people try to put ideas on you they try to put doctrines on you I don't know about all that amen but the God that I serve the one I met out there in the wilderness he can kill Lions he can kill bears and I didn't have no armor home when he did it because I'm not trusting in my armor I'm not trusting in my strength I'm trusting in the god of Abraham and that young boy took off of that Hill glory to God brother Seth he took off running into the battle I tell you there's some confidence right there as a man with confidence when he runs into the battle that looks impossible to happen but he knew God was on his side and I always love how oh oh oh Goliath he must not been a very smart man cuz he stood down there and cursed David and said he's going to hang him up and the birds were going to eat him and he told him all these things he were going to do had he been a Bible reader he would have knew that God had said whoever blesses Israel is blessed and whoever curses Israel is cursed amen so I say this he was messing up because he was speaking his own destiny he was speaking exactly what God was going to do with him when David got down there and one Little Rock did him in can you imagine amen he was such a he was such a powerful thing such a powerful man man when it looked like he had all the odds but one Little Rock did him in it wasn't David and it wasn't the Rock brother BR said God got in the Rock yes sir God got in the Rock he was slinging it like this and through the Rock and brother said God got in the Rock he told how fast it went it went beyond the speed of sound can you imagine when it broke sound barrier sound like a missile went off down there in that Valley and they thought good God what kind of weapon has he broke out I tell you what kind of weapons sister l was a weapon of praise that's what he broke out he broke out a praise for his God and he become a weapon in his hand and he said my God's able to slay these Giants and he let that rock go and it did its business because God was behind it because God is able he said brother white you know but will God but but really is God a deliverer now here's the thing as a Bible reader Daniel has always been a beautiful book to me because it's the children of God took down into Babylon who had all these Gods yeah and they didn't know any of their gods had power like these little Hebrew children knew the scripture declares that they you know what they did they you know for our Sunday school children and things I know y'all probably know these things but let me just say this they what they were doing was they was forcing worship on the Hebrew children they were forcing their type of worship that's what was going on they had made an image of the Prophet Daniel and they were playing music and they were forcing the Hebrew children to bow to their own Hebrew Prophet now brother Bram said now we're nearing the end and as it went out so it will go out in this age and they were forcing them to bow to their own Hebrew Prophet now that's that's that's pretty powerful stuff yeah and when they got forceful with it they told them they said we're going to destroy you right so so they Nebuchadnezzar's laws were were were put in place and in Daniel chapter 3 I love the way he says this these men were brought before them basically Nebuchadnezzar says to them you guys are not worshiping at this image and basically I'm going to give you another chance here in front of me and when this thing begins to happen I want you to kneel down and worship he said or you shall be cast the same hour in the midst of a burning furnace and who is the god that shall deliver you out of my hands Daniel 3:15 and who is the can you imagine that and who is the god that can deliver thee out of my hands well I tell you what you're about to find out he's about to find out these men served a God that was able he was able to take a out of a fiery furnace and I want you to see this because we're not just talking about a fiery furnace back there we're talking about suffering and afflictions of our lives and the enemy has tried many times I know what it feels like if you'll just back up we'll back up but that's a lie they're not going to back up that's like this this nonsense of having two states in Israel like it's going to bring peace it ain't going to bring peace it's a lie the devil's lying to you you back up and I'll back up no he's just going to move closer that's all it's going to happen it's a lie the devil's lying to you and he was lying to these boys amen but I'll tell you what they did when the fiery furnace come on the Bible tells us that they were threw into that furnace seven times harder of course Le oia and they were B they were thrown in seven times harder and they went inbound now brother Bram says it like this he said what did they do while they were in that fire I always wondered and brother Bram said what did they do he said I tell you what happened he said God came out of the heavens he said he came out of the heavens and said a man-sized job I'll do it myself and he went right by the Sea of life and picked off a palm leaf and went down in the furnace and was breeed he said with that palm leaf and was blowing the heat off of them and while they were in the furnace they were sitting under the wind of God and brother Bram said he was fellowshipping with them about their future he was talking to him about tomorrow he was talking to him about what's going to be after this Le DEA ended there he went right there amen that's what it's going to be after it's uh I'm not trying to see things anybody else see that that fire just went right over your head there Christopher just just like that through the building amen I'm going I'm going to talk to you about your future that's what's going to happen you may be in a fiery furnace of Affliction you may be in the toughest time in your life but the God that I serve he able he's able to come down in the fire with you look what he done when he got down in that fire amen when them children of Israel when they come out the next morning I always love this B when they come out the next morning amen they didn't even stink like smoke you know the only thing that was different about them they have went inbound and they come out loosed and let me say this morning I don't care what you're going through the only thing it can do is loose a praising you because our God is able he's able to deliver he's able to come in the fiery furnace he's able to move in the midst of this amen I don't believe I don't believe that our God is just some God somewhere off Amen in a far and distant land and he's a God that used to be and God that don't care that's a lie he's able He's Able you said I never seen it before and maybe you're the first person God's going to use to do it in Romans 4 I love how it speaks when it says of when it says of of Abraham you got to watch this the wording he said he was fully persuaded he was fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform Abraham didn't look at Sarah didn't look at his body didn't look at the condition but he knew this I'm persuaded what God promised he is able to perform now if God promised it He's Able isn't that something because watch watch what what happens here he's able to perform this is if you haven't listened to the sermon while go listen to it this is the sermon brother Brandon preaches a sermon intitled is there anything too hard for the Lord it was exactly the quoting of the scripture in Genesis 18 and4 is there anything too hard for the Lord it's in Jeremiah 32 and 27 is there anything too hard for the Lord I say no there is nothing too hard for the Lord I say God is able to do anything all things are possible and to you that believe it's not just possible with God it's possible with you because he's God this morning all things are possible he is able to raise the Dead come on Abraham believed it he was going to take his child up there and sacrifice the child and they said how you going to do it Abraham he said he said he gave him to me from the dead that he's able to raise him from the dead and he wasn't worried about Isaac because the promise said he would have a nation come out of the child listen if God gave you a promise he'll test you on the promise you would have thought 25 years waiting for a baby's enough test but after he got the child after he was living with a Vindicated word are you hearing me after he got the message God tested him on the message yes sir and it was then after that he possessed all things I'll say this this morning if you're looking at the message and you're trying to figure out if it's right let me promise you this it's right and let me say this to you the message ain't on trial it's your faith on trial God ain't on trial this morning it's your faith is on trial it ain't whether God can do it or not it's can we believe that he can do it it ain't whether the message is right or not it's do we believe the message is right he is able this morning he is able to do it amen I love how it was spoken I was spoken there with John when John said God is able these stones to rise children under Abraham another way he uses it able God is able these stones to rise children unto Abraham in other words you man you can kick him out if you want to he'll get something to worship Him John was actually talking about Pharisees and churches that wasn't accepting Jesus and he said it's okay God's able these stones to rise children under Abraham and brother Bram says he updates it a little bit brother Bram updates it and says it like this don't you think to yourself that you have a World Council hey man and you got the best dressed members he said God is able these Aly rats here he included me right there God is able his alyra to bring children to fulfill the word He's Able these prostitutes and these Street Walkers and these drunkers and these gamblers and he's able to do it because he still remains to be God is it something God is able God is able listen let me say it he's able to take a prostitute and make a mama out of her he's able to take somebody's immoral life and make a Christian mother out of her and use her for his glory because my God is able don't you ever say within yourselves well it's too far gone and my my son my daughter they're too far gone let me say this my CL is able to change it he's able amen I don't have to have a lot of proof brother Ram preach didn't have one child one person to prove what he was talking about and if I could sit here I could go to you to job and I could go with you to Paul amen but let's update it a little bit let's go to Hade and watch hadie Ride amen hadie never expected hadie never expected a squirrel supper to turn into the salvation of her children it was exceedingly and abundantly above what she could even think or what she could ask but she was set him with a prophet and his God was able I mean let mean let me just let me just get what's really in my heart right here amen I was sitting here on my study and I I heard the prophet say this over this and I could literally hear myself this morning saying amen sister Lucille God is able I can hear myself saying it Lucille God is able I don't care what the devil's saying God is able hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I watched Justin we come into Louisiana Camp amen and I watched that boy give his life because his sister stood with him amen it's no coincidence his name was Justin amen because it was God that showed me he was able to do it there he's able to do it here and I not back off of it don't make no difference to me what somebody says or what they think because God is able let me can I go ahead and preach what I saw amen Ray Ericson God is able he's able to raise Martha out of that bed amen it's not too far gone it's not been too many years it ain't no God is able he's able to change it he said brother Wayne will you get that Georgie Carter was nine years in the bed but God who was able raised her out of the bed and gave her back her [Applause] life so brother Wayne are you crazy no I'm not crazy I heard it come through my office and I heard it I heard it say anoss and God is able I heard him say if I could give you her I could teach you how to deal with her I could teach you how to listen if God starts something God finishes something even he don't just oh you don't know what it means when you hear the spirit of the Lord speak to you L and say to you Bethany God is able to fix it he's able to change it you don't have to live your life like oh preacher you've lost your mind no sir I'm not because my God is able He's Able listen he's able to change it right here this morning he can change it I know I'm probably loading you up but let me just say it to you Beck of he is able let me tell you he gave me an answer for you and he said this is your answer you tell her that I am able to heal the wounds of your past he is able to heal us he is able to change us so brother the Wayne I'm going through the hardest time of my life tell me what the answer is he is able that is your answer we serve God and he's able he's able to do it I know people think I get crazy that's all right that's all right amen I remember it Mariah I remember it I remember when I was with brother brother uh brother mle Freez and somebody called and said Mariah's having a having a Flash and every few seconds she's going blind we got to take her to the hospital and we stopped and begin to pray I actually called her on the phone there you people were praying for her they didn't know what was happening Seth amen but they come back and said there's something I don't we don't know but there's nothing wrong with her you see that same God that was able to deliver there he's able to deliver JoJo we don't have to fret and warry and you said Preacher what's going to happen I don't know what's going to happen but God is able he's able to change it he's able to take a hold of it Hallelujah He's Able I'm talking about the God that open the womb of Mary sister Ursa He's Able he sees your labor of love He's Able Glory don't you dismiss my God don't you dismiss your case it's too hard don't you dismiss your case that there's no way it's ever going to happen for me you may be the first person it ever happened for but God made promises and when God makes promises he is able to perform that what he has promised unto you that's right we got a group of young people sitting here some of them's needing the Holy Ghost and they're saying theirselves will I ever have it well let me tell you the answer is God's able instead of confusing yourself and beating yourself up trying to figure out how to get it release all of that say Jesus I'm sorry I have been baptized into your word now now I receive the Holy Ghost and begin to worship God for what he's gave to you and don't let the devil ever pick I'm talking about a God that's able I'm talking about a God that Open Seas and and 3,000 in one meeting receive the Holy Ghost yeah 15minute sermon Peter had a 15minute I seen a I seen something the other day and I don't make fun of nobody but I seen a a some message I I don't know where they were but it said part 34 on the new birth how to be born again I thought dear God I'm so glad he wasn't on the day of Pentecost if it takes you 34 parts to tell somebody how to get born again maybe you got that more confused than it needs to be let me give you let me give you one scripture and this will tell you how to get born again he said repent every one of you amen and re and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the of the Holy Ghost always remember Romans 10:9 believe on the Lord Jesus with thine heart and confess him with thy mouth and thou shall be saved he is able to save he's able to do that which you don't think he can do he remains to be God I know people's in fear everywhere right now people's living in fear everywhere right now is is the doctrines or we going to get in false doctrines is this Doctrine going to take the message over and this going to take it listen if God got this message through William brandom and his rejections and all the the denominations that tried to stop that man and he got a man in his hand to preach this message among all that nonsense and got it on record and got you in his hands and put this church together and set you in the middle of this church don't you know the god that started is a God that finishes he that has begun shall also finish this because he's able to do it he's able to keep it he's able to do what you have said and keep it until the day of Jesus Christ amen I I just just just real simple amen you you look in Jude 1:24 and watch what he says here Jude is talking about false false teachings he's telling you in the book of Jude how that they crept in how dogmas and denominations and how things have happened he's telling you all that and then you know what he does he says now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of the glory with exceeding Joy unto him that is able Jesus said they would deceive the very elect if it were possible but it's not possible because you're harnessed to an absolute there is a jean seed on the inside of you you might fool me for a day but there's something on the inside of me that's going to come out to God because he said he would keep us if from falling in other words we will not be deceived do you know when God Saves a man he saves him for Time and Eternity let me let me just say this very clearly do you know when God gives a man the Holy Ghost it's it's impossible for that man to perish I don't have time to read now I got the quotes here but the prophet of God said this very clearly when you receive he said that's the only reason New Birth is salvation because the new Birth by the Holy Ghost is not you saying you're saved you receive Zoey life and you could be no more lost than God is lost because you got God's life on the inside of you he is able see it's in John 10 where Jesus said my sheep know my voice and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish and neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand Hallelujah nobody can plck you out of the hand of God ain't no doctrines ain't on Ministries that come on I don't care how great they are I don't care what the devil's doing he will never take the bride out of the hand of almighty God under him that's able to keep you he's able to keep you from falling I thank God this morning that I'm not in a position amen that I'm so nervous that I can't even sleep because I'm worried that I'm going to fall amen a real believer no matter what they are thoroughly satisfied the life that's in them has already become Christ and there is nothing somebody shouting nothing that shall separate you so preacher how is that possible brother baham told us this he said the blood didn't bridge the gap it removed the gap so there just ain't no Gap there no more it just removed it how you going to fall you standing on level ground Anchored In Christ under him that is able to keep you from falling you have been eternally born into Christ listen ain't no different ain't no different when Jesus was on that boat and they going across the sea and look like they were going to sink then look like it for sure and they got all upset but brother Bram said the thing is he said Jesus was on board and when Jesus came up he was able he was able to calm the storms he was able to cause the waves to cease listen brother Bram said see Jesus was in that ship he said now today we're just a bunch of mud ships and some of us are made out of Arkansas mud and some Ohio mud and some Alabama mud but that's all you are is mud yeah but there's a life in you and the same life that was in God is the life that was in that ship is in you this morning how secure were those Believers in the middle of that sea if Jesus is on board you can't sink you have the same security of your eternal life this morning with Jesus in the ship somebody said well I ain't seen him in a while well then wake him up the God that saved you wake him up he's still able to calm the Seas he's still able to speak to storms he's still able to create squirrels he's still able to cause the to get up and walk he's still able to open the blinded eyes he's still able to give the Holy Ghost he's still able Our God ain't changed any I know we've been through the storms and we've been beat up and everything's trouble but let me say this it's the devil's job to try to destroy you okay but Jesus said this to Peter he said Peter I want you to know something the devil has desired to sift you as wheat but I have prayed for you well I tell you what I'd rather have him praying for me than anybody else and let me tell you what he prayed he prayed a Thanksgiving prayer like you sat down over a meal that's already prepared sitting on the table and you start thanking the lord for the meal on the table Jesus thanked the Lord for the disciples that he had given him and he said Lord don't take them out of the world but keep them from Evil while they are in the world look what he done he began to tell them I know the devil wants you and look even Peter even Peter played in the hands of the devil sure brother brother Bram said it I think it's amazing he said Peter stood up against that that Pharisee Roman soldier and cut his ear off he said but he didn't have one ounce of Christian Courage he said he stood back a far off and watch Jesus be crucified and stood at the fire of the enemy and warmed his hands but when he went up till on the day of Pentecost he said Peter when you are strengthened when you're converted I want you to strengthen the Brethren and what was he going to strengthen with listen it's in first First Peter chapter 1 and verse 5 you say preacher how are we held let me just say this to you amen Peter says we who are kept by the power of God through faith under salvation will be revealed in the last times amen let me say here's here's the meaning kept by the power of God those who are defended like a person in a fortress kept by the power of God let me say this morning he's able to keep you he's able to keep you from falling he's able to keep you from being deceived he's not just a deliverer he's a keeper he's one that gives the Holy Ghost and he don't take it back come on Church brother said when you're saved you're saved eternally saved he said you might go out there and backslide but how could God ever change his mind come on it's what he said and if a man was ever saved he's always saved if he was ever saved then he's always saved sobody said well I believer couldn't backslide that's a lie the prophet of God said he could backslide yes he did he said matter of fact you could backslide every day if you ain't today in better shape than you was yesterday then you backslid on God but let me tell you it didn't change your salvation it didn't change what God has done in your life listen brother man believe in eternal security folks he disbelieved it he said when a man was sealed with the Holy Ghost he was sealed until the day of redemption he said matter of fact if you get it right do it while you got a s mind he said because someday fever might boil your mind till you ain't got a good one he said you may lay on a death bed and say curse words and everything else he said but you already fixed it up you already fixed it up with God it's Eternal he is able to keep you I say this morning Lord give give me something that keeps me in the hour of distress and the hour of it he's a keeper this morning I don't know you preacher I don't know how long you can keep us well let me say this let me let me let me just say this how long you had the Holy Ghost Brother Ray since 1968 68 I was born in 73 5 years before I was born he got the Holy Ghost and he has kept him he has kept it 55 years he has kept him now don't tell me that every day of 55 years were good days and don't tell me that he was living the perfect life and his best life every hour of every day for 55 years but one thing never changed was that God fixed it up amen God fixed it up and there he said you said preacher why would you do that cuz I want these young people to know you can get something this morning that'll last you 55 years you can get something this morning that as long as you're on this Earth it'll hold you in the grace of God until you meet Jesus in the Millennium let me say this this morning you don't have to worry I'm going to be up one day and fall the next day get God in your heart and he will keep you so brother way I don't know I don't know if God heals cancer does he somebody's been healed stand up right quick this if God's healed you with cancer stand up amen come on somebody give praise to God cuz God is able anybody
