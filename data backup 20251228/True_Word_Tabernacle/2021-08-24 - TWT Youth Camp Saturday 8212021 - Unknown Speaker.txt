anxiety are taking their leave at the very mention of the name of Jesus Lord we invite you we invite you to our Pew we invite you to our heart we invite you to our need I ask father that you would do something special here tonight that would let those that maybe a critics maybe maybe they're necessarily not a critic but they don't understand but Lord I pray that you would you would visit them and Lord I pray father that you would just begin to move across this need move across this church move across these young people Lord I myself am very needy Lord I hold many things in My Heart Lord that I need to see you move on Lord one forsaking is my father Lord been sick of this cancer for over a year and a half now and still dealing with the effects but father I believe that you are coming here to give us nothing less than full Victory and so father I I I ask God not only for my father sake Ron Spencer but for every person that's been touched by cancer any of the residual effects of anybody that has that has dealt with Co and dealing with different things Lord in their body we pray that you'd be mindful now Lord I'm aware that there's mothers here that that have little children and sometimes it's it's a little bit difficult to get something out of service with a little child and I just pray father that you'd be mindful of them tonight I pray that you'd minister to each and every one of us in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles we'd like to look over and in the Book of Joel chapter 2 verse 25 Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 and then down to Acts chapter 2 and as you're finding your way there I'd like to I'd like to read you a quote this evening from the message hear ye him brandom said he saidthe numbers don't mean whether Christ is there or not it's the attitude of the people that's in the number what determines it you can take an egg that a hen is supposed to set on to Hatchet and you could put the egg in an incubator where it's just a warm light that incubator will hatch the egg just the same as the chick or the hen will itself because it's the atmosphere that does the hatching it's the same thing in a meeting of this type it could be possible tonight and also probable that it will be that there could be an hour of this next hour on that clock that there wouldn't be one Center or backslider left in here without being right with God it could be that every sick and Afflicted person could be made well and go go out of here glorifying God this could break into a repeat of Pentecost if the atmosphere gets right see the atmosphere to bring such results would be the Holy Spirit and if he can get every heart in one Accord then he could just move masses and heal the people save the people or whatever he has died to redeem them and every Redemptive blood blessings belongs to the individual I want you to believe that Christian Joel 2 and verse 25 and I will restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten the canker wor the caterpiller and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed are you his people and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaidens in those days will I pour out my spirit acts chap 2 and verse one do you love the Lord this evening he's a great big God Acts chapter 2 and verse one you say Amen when you have it this evening I don't want to leave anybody El and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and it sh and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave utterance and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in unknown in in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians and Mees and elamites and the Dwellers in MotoMia and and Judea and capid doia and imp pontis and Asia FIA and filia and Egypt and in the parts of Libya about Serene and strangers of Rome Jews and prelit cits and Arabians we do hear them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meanthis maybe you're sitting here tonight and you're wondering what meanthis others mocking said these men are full of wine and here's Peter's first sermon and Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord I'd like to speak to you this evening by the help of the Lord on this this is that this is that and the think that today that we're living in one of the most grandest days that man has ever stood in when our Prophet would say that if I could have chosen any day to live in I would have chosen this day to be living in this hour when we are watching the the revealing of the son of man when we're watching the very winding up of all the prophecies that's that's been laying there for for a last for the last age and for the people of the last age and here we are we're watching a the blending of Dimensions where you're watching eternity blend in with Time and Time begin to blend in with eternity and here we are living out what the prophet had said and these very things are being fulfilled right in the midst of each and every one of us and and what an opportunity that you young people have been given in this hour to be living in the last of days and I don't believe that there's another generation coming but I believe that this is the last generation but what an opportunity that you and I have to rise to our feet to grab a of this message that has changed your life and got a hold of your family's life what an opportunity that we have been given to raise our hands in Victory to to stand out upon thus saith the Lord when when men are are heady and high minded and they're lovers of pleasure you are a young people that love the very things of God and and brother Brandon would say that we have been given such an opportunity that that that Elijah would long to see an opportunity like this and we have an opport opportunity that St Paul never dreamed of or Enoch or Elijah and all those things and to think about that you and I have an opportunity this evening to receive a holy ghost that David never he he never was able to to receive fully on the inside of his soul but yet it would come and anoint him and hear you an hour standing in an hour when the when the very pouring out of the Holy Ghost is coming not just a not just a a an isua an experience but here we are living where we are baptized with the very life of the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost which is God himself and we're living in the last of days when you go and read over in the Book of Revelations and you begin to look over there and you can see the seven Church ages and you can see that there is one that is walking in the midst of them in the midst of the golden candlesticks and that is a proof to you that Jesus is not somewhere off in another day but Jesus is walking right in the midst of a young people that are called by his name that are that are baptized in his name and to realize this evening that that if you could just let your imagination loose to begin to think about how that God felt when he was holding those seven stars in his hands and there he was and he was he would disperse uh he would disperse Paul to the to the Ephesian age and he would disperse the other one a and God would have characteristics in each of the seven Church age Messengers that would be identified of that day and I'm so glad to be identified with this last messenger of this day but you could you imagine as God begins to release he begins to release those stars to go out to that age and begin to watch as that message would go forth and there would be a people that would grab a hold of that anointing I believe that this is that that was spoken in the word of God and we realize that that that no no no no prophecy is of no interpretation but we realize that God has given it and we look back in the Bible and you can see that men would go out and they would prophesy and prophecy would come upon them and they would speak out things but it did not come by the very will of man but it was men that were moved by the Holy Ghost and they would speak things and you would watch men like Isaiah and he would speak something maybe he didn't understand everything that he was saying but it was a prophecy and that which God has used in that day has used again in this day and there that man of God when thus safe the Lord would come across his lips no matter what happened no matter the critics that would rise no matter how many would doubt that there would be a virgin that would conceive it had to be fulfilled because it was coming not out of the will of man but it was coming out of the very mind of God and to think today that you and I are living in an hour where the very Mind Of God has been poured out and dispersed in this hour we are living in an hour where we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled in our ears what men would love to see what Wesley would love to see when they looked out in the man age when they look out there and they would grab and bring some of the greatest Ministries and some of the greatest sermons that you would ever hear but yet they could not come up to where you are living at because they were only living in the light of their day but this is another day this ain't the day of man this is the eag anointing and there is a people that are under that ego anointing and they're not just looking at what they see they're looking past what they see they have a prophetic vision and they're looking past what they see in Lota they're looking past covid they're looking past uh turmo they're looking past circumstances they are looking with the eyes of an eagle and they're looking out there and they realize that I am that one I will be that one that overcomes lotos here hallelujah you young people may not realize where you're sitting at but you are the final Runners to the final age you have a voice to be sounded out and if the enemy tries to shut you up you speak up if the enemy tries to tell you this message ain't right stand there be a man be a woman and daughter of God be ye quick like men be strong in the Lord be strong in the Lord this is your hour this is do that you remember when brother Brandon would begin to talk about that Chinese laundryman how he how he would first come over here and how that he would he didn't know how to write or know necessarily how to speak things exactly in the minds of contract of what we would think an American but he would come over here and there he would run that laundry M and you would go in there and you take and you would drop off you drop off your old clothes and when he would when you would go in there he didn't give you a slip and write something down on it but he would have a piece of paper that he would that he would rip down the middle and when you took your dirty clothes in there before you could ever get them back clean there had to be a contract that was sitting there there had to be there had to be something that would dovetail and match up to everything that was on his side of things and before you can ever get your dirty clothes back clean you got to have the other side of the contract but here we are living an hour and we realize that that Jesus Christ of the New Testament matched up with everything of Jehovah of the Old Testament and we're looking out there and we see one part of the contract and brother brandham said I believe this with all of my sincerity that the message of the hour matches everything that was said in this day so you're watching the two pieces of the contract have come together you and Christ are not Twain but you are one so let me say this to you as thus sayith the Lord you cannot be destroyed you're a part of the contract veiled by the Holy Ghost filled with an anointing filled with an Eagle Eye sitting out there saying I am who I am because the I am tells me who I am I can't be destroyed I can't be stoed I am what the prophet saw coming out of the vision I am the prophet's [Applause] prophecy see God has always had a promise that was hanging over top of his children in the days of Abraham it was a it was a time for the promised son in the days of Jacob it was time for a Joseph that would be that would be hated of the Brethren it would be time for Joseph to rise and there his Brethren would bow before him he would rise in position though it didn't look like it was coming but yet there was a prophecy that was laying there that his brothers would bow before him but you see even though that prophecy was was laying there Faith had to be awakened to see that this was the time of the prophet's prophecy and God does things in ways that you and I can't necessarily understand but we realize that the only thing that you have to do in deity of Jesus Christ he said the only thing that you have to do is when you see something in the Bible that sounds just a little bit Mystic and a little superstitious to you just give God a little bit of time God's in no hurry we're the ones that get in the hurt we just give God just give just give God just a little bit of time and you'll see the old prophetic Wheels cogs run up right in the picture it'll develop just like the bringing up of a picture you see many times we get caught up in the time of delay and we think well this is the way God needs to do things and this is the way that we're expecting it to do if you're not careful you'll put God In The Box and when God will actually be moving by your way you've got God so boxed up that you can't see him when he's passing by I would I would tonight that you would let God out of your box out of your ideas or what you think the message is what you think what's got to happen in this hour I would to God that you let God out of the box and let God be God if he's God let him be God if he's strong let him be strong if he is a Healer let him be a Healer if he's a way maker let him be a way maker the word of God it might be slow but it's sure and I want you to know it may look like that Judas is having the last life it's having the last life the last life but here we are in this hour Judas can laugh always he's want he's come and kiss the son of man but it's a time that the Disciples of God rise up out of that you ain't been called to this hour to go down and defeat you've been called into this hour to come out as The Undefeated Judas can mock all he wants to but we know where we're standing at you just wait Judas laugh all you want to make fun all you want to just give me three days give me three days it may look like I'm defeated it may look like I'm whipped I might go in a corner and I might pout about it but you give me three days on Sunday Jesus is coming out and this is the rising of the sun it's a new day it's an hour here we are living in the hour where the very headship of Christ is being identified with the body with the body which is called his children in this hour now you remember when brother BR would speak Christ The Mystery of God revealed and if you have not listened to it young people I admonish you by the spirit of the Lord to go and listen to that I have listened to that one sermon over a hundred times and I have benefited every single time most of the time I get I can't hardly get past the first hour because I'm having s having myself such a jubilee but go in listen to that 4H hour sermon you make yourself enough time to go out and watch two or three hour movies on the screen why don't you sit down and have yourself a time with a prophet of an age that's giving you a sure word of Prophecy that you'll come out of this thing but here in that Ministry in in Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Brandon was coming down and he was showing us that God's three-fold purpose firstly it was God to express himself in Christ secondly it was to come and have the preeminence in his body thirdly it was to restore the kingdom back to its rightful position again and if you go and listen to that you can go ahead and Skip down to the end if you want to see if I'm right on this or not but you can go all the way to the end of Christ The Mystery of God revealed and in paragraph 637 brother brandom comes down to the end of that message and he says if you're spiritual you'll catch these things he said it's 2:00 on the dot he said there it is the second pole has been made manifest and it's time for the next pool to come into manifest here it's time for the next pool to come and brother brandom goes down and he starts singing a song and he starts going and he says the second pull is manifested and then he comes down he said did you watch how the spirit of the Lord come and got in that song and he took it a higher octave higher he said the third pole is at hand so here we are the spirit of the Lord has not taking you back to man's day the spirit of the Lord's not taking you back to the world the spirit of the Lord's not taking back to your taking you back to your hust he's not taking you back to your family history he's not taking you back to what your mama dad that your mom and daddy deal with he is taking you higher this is the hour of the Holy Ghost this is the hour of the anointing there's an anointing in in this building tonight to break every fed to break every chain to break every sin to break every disease to break cancer itself lust has no hold where the power of the Holy Ghost is what was it doing the atmosphere was changing to say it's time to come up here it's a time it's a time he didn't take you back to the second pole he he took you to the third pole we say well brother Andrew I I I I'm I'm acquainted with I'm acquainted with televangelist I'm acquainted with the TD Jake's Ministry I'm acquainted with the Joe ostein Ministry I'm sure I'm sure they got some good stuff to say but they can never outside of this message they can never out they can never operate any higher than the realm of the second poor and they're very good you watch the ministry of Billy Graham you watch as that angel is working he's at work and there he just makes a simple call and thousands would run down to the altar why because an angel was at work I want to say this to you that that same angel that was with William brandham is still here and he's still calling people he's still anointing people he's still calling the apostolic days are not over it's a time for a repeat of Pentecost again there will be speaking in tongues there will be a people that realize that this is a time to fulfill every prophecy it's a time to move forward into the opening of the word a time to move forward a time to conquer every battle a time to win a time to be quickened a time to be filled this is your time and the enemy's time is [Applause] over go ahead and give him praise this is that young girls suicide can't hold you young girls lust demons can't hold you young girls young girls pornography can't hold you young boys diseases can't hold you lust problems can't hold you yeah maybe your mama di with cancer but you don't have to die that way maybe your daddy was a drunker but you don't have to go that way this is your time to rise up and break the cycle break it it's a time to accept the challenge said I'm a David there's my Goliath it's your time I'm anointed for it I've had the horn oil poured over top of me I'm anointed to take my giant down what's going on here this is that I don't understand why those young people people are acting like the way they are they have seen themsel in the word and Paul said in the book of Hebrews he said let us lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us and let us run let us run with patience or race that is set before us I want to tell you young people you're not running without a message you got the king scepter in your hand and anybody that gets in your way you can stand toe to- Toe with the devil said I got a king's message in my hand it's a time to run when Jesus you can be seated if you want to or if you can but when Jesus when Jesus is making his triumphal entry into the city of Jerusalem brother random goes over and anointed ones or excuse me what is the attraction on the mountain he goes in there and he picks up Matthew chapter 21 and there you see there you see a man that is riding on a white donkey coming down off of a hill what is it brother brandom said he said there's an unusual people out there there's an unusual event that's going on he said what it is it's history being made and it's prophecy that's being fulfilled and he said what you're seeing is that prophecy that was laying back there in Zachariah and it's coming to pass right here in this hour and here brother random goes in there and there you watch Jesus in Matthew chapter 21 as he's coming down off of Jerusalem's Hill making his entry this is not an entry of defeat but this is an entry of Victory you might look at calvary's Hill and you might see Jesus dying but I want you to know he did not go down in De feat he went there for you and if God does anything he does it for his children he didn't come just to show that he could die and just to show that he could get off the cross he didn't just come to get out of a tomb but he come to pay a debt so that you didn't have to go to a devil's hell so that you didn't have to go down there but while he was down there he went down there and he preached to the souls that were in prison but when he went down there he dropped off a load he dropped off a load what was he dropping off he was dropping off your sin so you can say to the devil what sin what circumstance what [Music] disease oh come on somebody I'm not carrying this load No More Jesus Jesus got a hold of my life 2,000 years ago I won the victory when I was with Jesus I won the victory and Jesus is making his way off off of the hill and there they are breaking palm branches and there they are laying out their robes out into the street and they start singing hosana to the highest blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord and they begin to say who is this I have just I have just been a part of a meeting I have just been a part of a supernatural event but blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord you remember in 1959 when brother brandom he said he was holding a Revival there on the Holy Ghost and he preaches three sermons on what is the Holy Ghost and what was the Holy Ghost given for and then a few days later brother brandom holds question and answers on the Holy Ghost and there in that service before there was a tongue and interpretation that had came forth and while brother brandom was speaking these things he said it was a Vindication of what the message was that came forth he said I was saying blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord he said but then there came forth a Vindication but blessed is he that comes in this blessed is he who believes that this is the Lord's coming blessed is he listen to me blessed is he that believes that the the Lord has come in this do you realize you're the most powerful people on the face of the Earth you're the most blessed people there is upon the face of the Earth the Book of Revelation says blessed is he that readeth and heareth these words and understands this prophecy if you have recognized yourself in the book you are blessed blessed are your eyes for you see blessed are your ears for you hear you are blessed blessed when you come in bless when you go out he said I'll make you the head and not the tail blessed is he that believes who is this MDC it's none other than Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what's that about what's that about going what's that about right there what's it about them young people right there I'm not going to be guilty for stopping their shout I'm not going to be guilty for standing in the way of them getting their Victory if you stop their shout you're stopping their Victory you may not understand why these young girls are dancing and shouting the way they are it's just a sign of Victory and if you stop their dance and if you stop their shout you are guilty for stopping the son of man coming in Victory I won't stop no matter the message preachers that rise up and say we can't have it this is that how about you back there in the back if you just want to come up here where the anointing is maybe you'll get that filthy Spirit off of you stop judging them young people and get in the water where the Holy Ghost is that this is the anointing of the Holy Ghost you're blessed you're blessed you're blessed oh look at your no say look over at him say I am blessed I am blessed oh every day of my life I'm blessed God woke me up this morning he started me on my way I'm blessed oh I'm blessed [Applause] brother brandham said that his own sister was sitting there he said and there the Holy G the Holy Ghost was falling in that meeting he said there the Holy Ghost was falling in that meeting he said but the devil was going around and telling the people don't listen to that sit still I'm going tell you that same Devil's still here tonight and he's trying to tell you don't listen to that preacher don't listen to what he's got to say why don't you just sit still when you Pew but if you felt like I felt if you've been in a pit where I've been before if you've been in sin like I've been before if you've been hung out on drugs like I've been hung out on drugs if you had a bad night like I had a bad night oh if you knew Jesus like I knew Jesus my Jesus ain't the god of Hollywood my Jesus ain't the god of some basketball my Jesus ain't the god of some baseball star my Jesus is a champion of champions he came to the myy clay and he picked me up and set my foot on a rock to stay this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our sight oh you're blessed who is that Goliath that's trying to scare the liver out of you why don't you start picking up a rock start giving out a rock of testimony I was there and I killed a bear I killed a ly I killed suicide I killed lust I killed demons I was there when it happened grab that rocket testimony I was there in a cabin when that young man got the Holy Ghost I was there in a cabin when that young man got the Holy Ghost it's a rock of testimony pick him up this is that you ain't got to be in a church building like this but yet there's a great atmosphere where you can get the Holy [Applause] Ghost I believe it was Dolores that was telling brother random said Billy why you was a preaching on that why you was just a preaching your way said I felt something rise up on the inside of me oh I could have just stood up and jumped through the wall right there he said that was a time that you should have stood up and just raised up and prais the Lord right there she said but when those when those men and all those things were happening she said when they begin to shout when I be when they begin to shout there there I begin to feel like I was a little old nothing he said that's nothing but the devil he said what you should have done was raised up right there I'm giving you a commission right now don't sit there and listen to the devil why don't you to listen to the Holy Ghost say come on out of that thing rise up out of that thing this is the best time in the world you're blessed to be here receive ye the Holy Ghost there's a promise hanging over you young people ah come on somebody you better be careful brother Andrew you'll create some Wildfire down there I'd rather have a little Wildfire than no fire at all I'd hate to be into a cooler where they ain't nothing but a bunch of icicle preachers that can't preach their way out of a paper bag don't know nothing about the Holy Ghost cuz they never been born again but i' like to be up here in a meeting like this where we can shake the singles off the place we can shake the stalactites off of hell and shake them down into the devil's eye because the power of the Holy Ghost is in the church it's in the people behold I saw Satan falling like lightning from the sky it was when the church was receiving her power when Jesus stood there and he said Peace be unto you and he breath he said receive ye the Holy Ghost and he breathed on them it was a promise that there was one coming come somebody I want you to know that when they got up there on the day of Pentecost which is a type of the Jubilee that you can go free you can drop your hoe you can drop your all you can drop everything that you were all your sin everything that was stacked up against you this is the Year of Jubilee you can sit there if you want to but I'm not going to let the enemy Mark me for being down there a captive anymore you don't have to be a slave you can come out of that sin you can come out of that trouble receive ye the Holy Ghost and when they got up there on the day of Pentecost what were they doing they were up there thanking God even before they got it and if you ain't felt him yet why don't you go ahead and thank him for the Holy Ghost if you ain't felt that anointing yet go ahead and praise him for it they were up there with a promise hanging over there's a promise hanging over you and you ain't got to wait 10 days you can have it right now all you got to do is mortify the Deeds of your flesh and receive you the Holy Ghost but when they got up there and they got in one Accord and in one mind they begin to praise God they begin to sing songs unto the Lord they begin to bless His holy name they had it in seed form but it not yet made manifest but when the day of Pentecost was fully come the promise that was hanging over them was no longer in seed form it was manifested and they broke out of that room they broke out of St Mary's they broke out of Ohio and they went out there and preached Jesus Christ you got got a seed hanging over you son you got a seed hanging over you there's a promise been given to you you're not going to be the only one that makes it your whole family is going to make it and you're going to stand there you're going to be a testimony that God gives the Holy Ghost Mama you ain't been in church for a while but it's time you get in church it's time you come up here where I know it's at the final days are here and I am one of them that's going to run this message I'm going to take it I'm going to take it to my dying days I'm going to believe this thing I'm going to run with this thing Mama come on over here what are you doing brother Andrew I'm trying to get you to look into the mirror it ain't somebody different it's Jesus that's standing there why' they get so confused with William brandom they saw so much of Jesus on the inside of that little frame of a man of a Kentucky hillbilly they seen Jesus in there and some worship him but this ain't some man worship this ain't some Prophet worship this is the worshiping of the Holy Ghost and if you'd get baptized you could have the same spirit that William brandham had well that was for Brother brandham The Works that I do say you do also where did it say William brandham right there he said if you believe me ask anything in my name and you will do this you can stand there all you want to but I happen to believe with all of my heart that just young people have a chance at the revelation of this word brother random said every young person every generation had a fren a fresh chance at the word I'm not going to stand in the way of them getting their chance at the Holy Ghost brother Andrew you better be careful you better be careful you know brother brandom told us that we better not live we better not jump no higher than we're living I've heard that all my life and I've heard people say you know what you better be careful you're going to jump higher than you living why don't you start living higher so you can start jumping [Applause] higher 42 in Caribou it was prophecy but up there on that mountain it became fulfilled Silver Tip grizzly bear it was a prophecy but there upon that mountain what is that bill well all I can say it's a silver tip grizzly bear what was it what that which was in Prophecy was now fulfilled there for two years there was a boy that was over there that he seen and there was a country that had rocks all over pine trees setting the course and everybody had it in the fly leaf of their Bible it was once held in Prophecy but when he got over there on that finished border and they seen that little boy laying there in that condition he saw him laying there in that condition and he looked at and said oh my I begin to think if that was my Billy or if that was my son how I would feel and I began to walk back and there was a hand laid on me he said go and look at it again I want to be that voice to speak to you if you have turned away from this I want to be the one to lay my hand on you come back and look at this again come on back over here and look at this one more time that dead man could be your boy matter of fact it could be you that which was held in Prophecy when it was over there when brother brandom realized that that was the boy that was in the vision he said Jack go get your Bible is this not the scene and he said look at that panoramic look at everything everything's in order brother brandom I happen to believe that's boy he said you could line up every single devil in hell he said you could call me a false prophet if that boy is not up off of the ground in five minutes call me a false prophet you can't call him a false prophet because that boy got up out of that you're not going to call me a false prophet and you're not going to call me a false preacher but right here in this meeting there's going to be somebody that gets up out of their dead condition you're standing here under the greatest ministry that's ever been released it's been circled around the world seven times miracles on top of Miracles I've met some of those Miracles I've sat and spoke with e bisco had had conversations with some of the great men that stood there in that Ministry watch that thing happen and transpire I wasn't there to watch the first pole in action I wasn't there to watch the second pole in action and I wasn't even there to watch sister ma when that tumor was laying on her I wasn't there physically I wasn't there to watch that tumor go off I wasn't there when had wres boys when when they were sitting there snickering and making fun of the Holy Ghost and he said give her what she asked for I say this to you parents the pillar of fire is in this building right now now give them what they ask for I wasn't there I wasn't there to see no squirrels manifested I wasn't there to watch that storm be spoken out of existence I wasn't there to watch those things but I am here in the hour of the third pole when the son of man which is the opening of the word is standing right before us and he is manifesting himself aresh again today today and today and tomorrow and the next day until we get raptured out of this and go into our home up in the [Applause] sky the Bible said it's it's coming there's one coming there's one coming there's one coming and Moses stood over there in the book of Deuteronomy 18-5 and he said he said the Lord Our God shall raise up a prophet like unto myself right out of the midst of you and when Philip found Nathaniel he went over there and said we have found him who all the prophets were talking about here there was prophecy hanging and now it was fulfilled that here was the very word himself that was laying there it was laying there through all of those prophets Ministries but now it was a time of fulfillment they said a star would rise out of Jacob they said he'd be born in Bethlehem he said he'd be despised and he be rejected of man he said the government would be upon his shoulders it was said that there'd be a forerunner that would forerun his ministry and when John the Baptist is standing over there in Matthew chapter 3 I believe verse 11 and he said there stands one amongst you when they ask him are you he he said but there stands one amongst you that is mightier than myself I will baptize you with water but he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and the fire what was John doing he was pointing you to that which was once prophecy to that which is now fulfilled and they could say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears it seemed very very concerning how in the world how in the world could a virgin conceive how in the world Isaiah's lost it we thought he was the prophet of the day but he's lost it seemed to get off there at the end seemed like he was he was just trying to get a people just joined to himself a little bit there's a lot of people and I'd say even Isaiah didn't understand everything that he was speaking it's Inc conceivable how in the world of Virgin can conceive but it ain't up for the [Applause] prophet it might be inconceivable how in the world these young people are going to fit in a dress you may not understand it but I ain't the one dressing them he is you don't know their past like I know it you don't know what they've been through like I know it I'm not the one dressing them parents and you can go ahead and let let loose just here you're not the one that's going to dress him either he is so why don't you just give them to God right now you're not the one that's got to make them fit in the prophecy if he saw him in the vision they're going to be in the vision they're going to walk and step they won't get out of line and if they do get out of line there's a prophet that said get back back in line it ain't my job to figure out which Mary it was it's the Angel's job there was a lot of Marys that was living out there in Jerusalem in and in Nazareth and all those cities there was a lot of Marys down there there's a lot of churches out there there's a lot of denominations out there but the germ of life could not come by the angel it had to come through the Ministry of the son of man it's not my job to figure out which Mary it is the Angel knows which one to go to the angel knows which one's going to do it the angel knows who's going to overcome the angel knows who's going to receive this the angel knows who's going to make it the Angels knows going who's who's going to be healed the angel knows it wasn't even up for William Brandon to figure out who who that bride was it wasn't up for him to figure out how in the world she could put it on but all I know is I can look out at that dress brother brandom said that the bride has the material to dress herself in all I know is that the dress [Applause] fits I'm in the prophet's Vision last day for who last day for who it's your last days we're in the closing of times last days for who Satan's losing Satan's lost Satan has to let loose them and let them go I'm in the vision don't get excited don't get anxious about it you'll be there I see you sister Brown what a birthday gift over there on the other side well I didn't have brother Bram speak that over me I did I did I did there's going to be a bride that is standing there that is spotting that is washed in the blood of the Lamb she'll be perfect she will be blameless she will be holy she will be pure you can call me crazy all you want to I happen to believe that I am her I'm her she has thus sayith the Lord or she sit still she has thus stth the Lord she has the very mind of Christ notice the harmony notice the harmony you're walking in Step you're under a Joshua commission all you got to do is go out and possess that which is laying out before you there's a promise hanging over you the Holy Ghost is yours healing is [Applause] yours it ain't nothing it ain't nothing too hard for the Lord that's David's Abigail out there zlags got her down there there won't you start taking a walk David he said go down there and pursue and take it back he said go down there and get what's rightfully yours it's up to you whether you go and get it or not that's my that's my Abigail and I'm going to get her well you say well hey man hey man I ain't got the strength like you preachers got I want you to know there's Grace for you there's real Grace for you maybe you don't have the courage to stand up and do like David did you might be an 11th Hour worker and you might be coming in at the last moment where you're going to get the same reward that we get I don't know if I can go down there with David or not there was a whole group of men that stayed back on the other side of the river and when David come back with all the spoils I'm not telling you this to tell you to sit back and wait for me to bring it to you but I'm telling you this that there's Grace for you maybe you ain't ran the hardest race maybe you ain't won a soul yet but there's still a whole lot of running to do there was a whole gang of people that was waiting back on the other side and when David got back with all the spoils of ziklag all of the men enjoyed all the spoils you might be a young person and you might be sitting there say I don't know how in the world I don't know how in the world to get it but you're in the atmosphere where David's bringing the Holy Ghost where David's bringing the spoils you're right here in the atmosphere if the atmosphere gets right there could be a repeat of Pentecost again you may not be sitting here you may not be sh shouting you may not be jumping but you're in an atmosphere and in this kind of atmosphere chickens chickens die and Eagles are born where we're going young people I want you to know that nobody can fly up there except the ordained of the moment and I want you to know that there's a prophet that has said over top of you that you that once it was the anointed man but now it is the anointed bride we are anointed by accepting what Eve turned down you're anointed for this hour you're anointed for this moment let me give you a prophecy the devil said that you're going to listen to his lie but the prophet said that you're anointed and predestinated to turn down the devil's lie cancer you've been lying for a long time you have lost I am predetermined my course is set I'm not listen to you one day more this is that we're under a Joshua commission go out there and get that land go get it I don't understand all this I don't understand all this shouting brother Andrew I don't I don't understand why them preachers are preaching like that I don't understand that there's a young girl over there we're going to get there won't be no wall of petition that'll stand before us there won't be no wall of giants that stand between us it might be so thick that they can run horse races around it but there won't be walls that stand between you and this coming out because this is Our Land This Is Our Land you say oh I don't understand what all that shouting is about let me tell you the shout is what gets Rahab out I'm under my commission brother lemel I'm under my commission the shouts what get Rahab out Rahab didn't necessarily understand everything that was going on but she realized that that God that was fighting for Israel was the god that she wanted she recognized God and all of Jericho recognized as well that that was the god of the heavens and earth if they had not recognized then why in the world were they're sitting back there scared now I'm getting ready to call you out for a minute some of you preachers some of you so-called message preachers have been trying to wall up the children of God in all of your ideas because you're afraid if they get something that you ain't got they'll actually come up and live a little higher than you are but I'm saying to you in the name of the Lord you're not going to hold Rahab no longer she's coming out I shout is is a sign that Rahab is coming out in the name of Jesus Christ let your shout loose let your daughter [Applause] loose where's that young man at where's that young man at come at me last night said brother Andrew you don't have a clue what you did last night he said but you prayed everything that I was asking for and you prophesied over top of me and he had a set of shoes in his hand he said and I got my shoes I got my dancing shoes on now where you at young men where you at young ladies it's a time to get your dancing shoes on we have rounded this thing six times we're on our seventh round this is the final age this is the final [Applause] Runners RAB come forth come forth what is it this is that which gets Rahab out yes there he goes [Applause] [Music] Satan you can't stop this because this is that that's what's been holding down there in Prophecy it's now being fulfilled you could stop the sun quicker than you could stop these young people because they are filled with something that you never had they are filled with the very life of God Satan loose them [Applause] [Music] [Applause] brother brand said he said when you believe done the Lord that was your title he said but when the Holy Ghost came it was the abstract to the title deed you can hold the title of I believe this is the message you can hold the title that I believe that this is the final Prophet you can hold that in your hand but when he comes when he comes you can get your dirty clothes back clean when he comes comes everything that was against you everything that was against your mama every sickness that has been laying there throughout your genealogy he's been building a case against you throughout your DNA and there's certain DNA markers that are laying there and the doctor said you're going to have to live with this because it's laying there you say you have to deal with high blood pressure and sugar diabetes because it's laying there they say you're going to have cancer because there's a certain Gene that's laying there that you're going to have to get and all we know how to do is to go ahead and set the course for you but I want you to know that the abstract to the title deed it clears everything that was against you it is now struck off everything your mama may have been a prostitute but you struck off your daddy may have been a dope dealer but it struck off there a whole lot of Bootleggers in my family but ain't no Bootleggers left in my family no more in my family there's giant killers in my family there's people there's people that know how to pull the sword of the spirit in my family history there is a hero and his name is Jesus struck off omitted not against me no more you're Justified as if you never done it in the first [Applause] place that's right that's right every thing that was against you now let me let me let me give you this little piece this a little nugget and I I'm going to do my best cuz I I feel the Lord doing something but let me give this to you that when you hold an abstract title deed everything is cleared and I mean everything say that with me everything now you know what you're going to get ready to do you're going to come through a prayer line here just in a few minutes you're going to walk through his prayer line and I want you to hold this over you there's a promise holding hanging over top of you everything has been struck off of you everything say it with me everything now now when when you're holding that Abstract title deed not only is it just the land that is cleared you see if somebody has gone in there and placed a lean on it you can say that I have the title you can say that it's rightfully mine but if there's no abstract there there still could be a lean that was placed on it years and years ago now in these great big cities like New York and out in Seattle and Chicago and all these places there are people that actually buy the atmosphere above and they go in there because people know that there's going to be somebody that comes in there that's going to want to build a skyscraper someday so they're putting putting a lean on the atmosphere and they're saying they're saying that this has got to be paid before there can ever be a skyscraper placed in there so let me say this to you under the anointing of the lord your atmosphere is cleared and you can rejoice in the Lord everything below you is cleared everything above you is cleared the anointing is here go ahead and Worship the Lord go ahead and praise him your atmosphere is clear every lean that Satan put on your family history has been struck off by the blood of the lamb and you are an overcomer and everything that was against you against your mama against your daddy against your granddaddy everything the atmosphere is cleared you're not going to wall Rahab in there no longer the walls are falling because the destroying Angel has been circling your atmosphere is cleared you can have your repeat of Pentecost you you everything everything is struck off and curse it curse it be the man that builds on this Jericho again curse it be the man that builds on this past again her past is gone her sin is gone your depression is gone your diseases are gone everything has struck Off Of You the atmosphere is set for the [Applause] supernatural everything is struck off it's right the atmosphere is right that Pillar of Fire he's been circling and whirling through this building all evening I was in a camp meeting I was in a louisian camp meeting I was down there preaching with my daddy and we come back we was preaching a camp meeting and it was one of the dumbest things I ever done in my life went to a camp went to that Louisiana camp and it was kids like you drain the very snot out of my body I told brother Timothy I said I will never do this again but not preach a camp meeting but not only did I preach a camp but I I drove and my dad drove a bus all the way back 20 some couple hours taking off time driving trying to get kids back to school but I I I I don't mean that against you and I don't mean to hurt your feelings I'd do anything for these young people but in my flesh and I have been ran over by a truck kind of like what I'm going to feel like tomorrow but there we were you you you were there we were we were driving that bus and we were coming back and we stopped in nowheresville and there there we was driving this bus we got out a little gas station we got out and we sat in there we sent the sent the kids over to McDonald's to get them a Happy Meal maybe get a toy they could play with for the rest 15 hours we got out me and Dad were standing there we was pumping gas all of a sudden this man pulls up white-headed man pulls up he's got a bunch of clothes in the back of his car and he said hey man what you doing down here he said I see you from Virginia so I said your license plate said what you doing down here he said well me and my son just preached a preached a camp meeting down there in Louisiana and uh he said oh okay and he began to tell us his story he said well he said I'm a prison Minister and said the Lord saved me he said I was actually on death row and said the Lord worked away and I got out of that and I told the Lord if he got me out I I'd preach I'd preach Christ and I I've been a prison Minister for about I believe he said 15 20 years there so he said well y'all have a good day so we asked him said he about to drive off and said hey well what made you stop he said man the light the light he said what do you mean we said what you mean he said he said I told my wife I don't know who them people are but there's a light following them I got to meet the people of the light you're that people and this is that you are the prophet's prophecy now fulfilled now tonight I want you to be very aware that in this building is the anointing of the Holy Ghost and there across this platform and throughout the building there are men of God that are anointed ordained to lay their hands on you and when you come through this prayer line as the musicians are making their way when you come through this prayer line we will lay L hands on you and the Bible said to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover sick in mind sick in body sick in the soul they shall recover now when you come through this prayer line there's an anointing here you're very aware of of it you sense it that's why you're rejoicing you're a very instrumental and a very well taught young people but when you come through this line I want you to be aware that this is where the battle stops and enemy lose and the enemy loses when you come here don't you be afraid of this anointing that's Jesus and our Prophet said he won't hurt you he's here to help you where where's that Mariah Pro it she in the building is that her would you mind come in here just for a moment why you give her a good hand that's I was at a youth camp and this little girl come through there holding bobby pins in her hand she said Uncle Timothy I want I want my hair back she was like that little boy holding no shoes he was ready to put them on and she was ready to put those pins back in her hair now maybe some of you don't realize this but at one point this little girl was diagnosed with alacia and there she lost all the hair on her head standing before you is a very Miracle this is what I want you to know this is prophecy fulfilled because her pastor prayed some several months before and said we will restore the glory back and what you're watching is the glory of the Lord restored and this is prophecy fulfilled she won't be the only miracle in the room tonight [Applause] Ruth BR it Ruth BR you've been battling some things but the spirit of the Lord woke me up two nights ago and told me that it's going to be well what the doctors
