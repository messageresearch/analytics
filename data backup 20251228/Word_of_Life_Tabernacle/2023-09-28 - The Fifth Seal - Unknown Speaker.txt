you for the many things that you've done for us and to thank you for being who you are and Lord the Almighty God that could come down and chose to come down and be one of us Lord that we might be saved from our sins Lord and become like you I thank you for that Lord we don't want to ever get over that Lord we thank you for this message and the word that you've given us Lord as we as we enter into it tonight I I pray God had become a revelation to every heart Lord I realize there may be people here that are hurting or in need or in some way I pray God that you'd help them tonight Comfort them help them deliver them oh God lord we believe you are the almighty God and we believe that you're able Jehovah Jireh able to to provide Lord what the people have need of what I have need of tonight I pray you granted Lord we thank you we're trusting only in you tonight we thank you for your word thank you for your spirit Lord and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor for each thing that's done we ask in Jesus name Hallelujah I want to read from Revelation chapter 6 verses 9 through 11 tonight as we are entering into the fifth seal and it's been just an overview of the seals refreshing our memory so we can deal uh with some other things in Greater detail I really have enjoyed this myself though and getting back into these things and being reminded of some of the things that that we were taught I believe it's important and it helps us in every area of our life we can apply it even the things that are to the the Jews and even during the tribulation period And yet there's parts of this we can apply to our own lives and we can take from it and so we just love the Lord for the word tonight amen good to see each and every one of you remember communion Sunday evening just always a blessed time that we have here at the church Revelation chapter 6 and verse 9 we need to open the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true thus thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled pray the Lord would add His blessings of the word you may be seated I want you to notice first of all tonight is we're going to try to move quickly through this and and get you out of here on a school night but there's no mention of a beast or a living creature or a horse or a rider so there's a change from the fourth seal the first four seals and the fifth seal there's no mention of of the living creatures in the fifth Seal The Sixth Seal or the seventh seal and brother Brandon said the reason for that he said according to the Revelation the Lord Jesus gave me today this morning early he said that the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time so we've been looking on Earth and now we begin to look it into Heavenly things and he said the mystery of the Antichrist is revealed at this time I believe that's the case today the mystery of the Antichrist is revealed the Antichrist took his last tribe we found him on this pale horse mixed with many colors and he rides all the way into Perdition remember it was this message it was under the message of Elijah that he was given a name he was called Death he was exposed as death so we find him identified he identified death as spiritual death in a denominational Antichrist system so we as to go back just for a moment and then we'll move forward those four beasts were to Combat Four Horses so you have four powers combating four powers everybody understand that tonight a beast is a power and a power is an anointing right when someone talks about the anointing what they mean is an empowerment an anointing David was anointed to be king he was empowered to be king when we're anointed by the Holy Ghost we are empowered to do something anointing is not just being loud or or shouting or something like that although that may come with it but it's actually being empowered to do what God called us to do and to live the word of our hours so we find that that white horse came out that white that power uh came out and uh it was it was false teaching it was an antichrist spirit that was supposed by what it was opposed by The Lion The Spirit of the lion or or like a lion a pure word brother Brown said manifested by the Holy Ghost so he he was a false teaching and it come in and I just want to take this as an aside because it meant a lot to me what I've been studying about this Antichrist system and they actually thought they were doing God a service by pulling off into their own clique and I want us to be careful as a word of warning tonight as a pastor we need to be careful that we don't pull off into clicks but we're a body we're a body of Believers we we don't need to uh so uh socialize only among those with in our same socio-economic status or or something like that we don't put one down here and one up here preachers up here and people down here or something like that but we're all one we We Belong Together because in that Antichrist move he said well you know little he said like little clicks will arise up in the church he said you know what you pastors he said they like they say birds of a feather but if we're born again Brethren how many are born again tonight he said that's not the attitude to take see if we see something wrong in our Brethren he said let us just pray and keep it before God and love that man until we bring him right into the presence of God he said that's the way really to the way to do it so if we're born again we don't make our living we don't make our our lifestyle it's not attacking and attacking and coming at this one and coming at that one but it's actually trying to pray that person and love that person back into the kingdom of God we don't want to see one lost why because that's his desire he doesn't want to see one lost do you believe that tonight he doesn't want to see you lost he cares about every part of the church so and so he said you know Jesus said there will be weeds in there because Jesus said there would be but don't pull them up you'll take the wheat with it he said just let them alone he said he'll he'll do let him do the segregating when the time comes he let it all grow together so it was an effort to clean up the church an effort to make the church better an effort to do away with all the nonsense or so they thought and many times Satan will get into that and he'll make a cold dead powerless Church out of something that was intended to clean up the church and so I think as a pastor I I have to be careful to leave him alone let them grow up together and and so we don't start pulling up the uh the wheat with the tears right and as people we need to be careful with that let it grow together it's always going to be mixed till we leave here the truth is some of every church is going to go and some of every church is not going to go it's just the way it is but let us be that one let's be that one I'm going to be that one you you want to be that one so he'll do the segregating when the time comes so that was the White Horse move uh that that Antichrist Spirit Now red horse was physical persecution opposed by what the ox look what was opposed by not not a not some force of of man but it was uh it was sacrificial labor sacrificial labor and Ox just gives himself to the work and brother random talks about polycarp and how that he gave himself to the stake to be burnt and and all the different ones from that age and what a glorious time it was he said but brother Ben how could they have done that and I love what brother Brown says here in the fifth seal about that he said don't forget this church he said you Brethren on tape I want you to examine this he said how could men do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them so the reason they could do that is because the power of God had been released to do that it wasn't because they were superhuman it wasn't because they they'd been taught over and over again brainwashed into it it was because there had been a Power released to them and the reason why you'll escape laodicea the reason why you will overcome the reason why you're going to make it is because a power has been released to you you may not even realize it you may not always feel it you may not always think you're the one or you're going to be able to do it but you will overcome because an anointing has been released in this age to let you see what's wrong and what's right in the most deceptive ages there was how could men do anything else beside the power of God that's been released to them so then the Black Horse Road we found that spiritual control right remember all these horses they ride on to the end spiritual control control of purgatory and it was opposed by Godly wisdom the man the Branham called it Godly wisdom the face of a man so is Luther Wesley Etc they come those men smart men that could come with the cunningness of a man and oppose that and bring out from the scriptures that it was wrong and so then you come down to the Pale Horse the final one which we know is spiritual death opposed by what by an eagle Yeah by an eagle it was prophetic revelation listen to me you will not overcome spiritual death in this age outside the message of the hour you may come up with all kinds of other influences you might say well I'll just kind of hide the fact that I'm a message believer you might as well embrace it because you will not overcome this end time power of a Pale Horse you will not overcome spiritual death without the message of the hour because only prophetic revelation will cause you to oppose the Pale Horse move so so here this Prophet would come but the man would talk about how he had no certain mystery but it would come and and there's criticism of this fifth seal because brother Branham says it's the Jews and many said that these were Christian martyrs and and that's what most commentaries say but there there were people who said that it was the Jews Larkin was one who said it was the Jews there were others who taught that but nobody had a voice of authority nobody can say in fact when Larkin wrote it was before World War II and you'll see why that's important in a moment brother Brown said these things could not be revealed until they had happened right it said in motion that's what the opening of the seals is all these things there's no more delay all these things are open before us in motion the tribulation periods in motion the pale horse riders in motion they haven't maybe come to their fruition yet but everything's moving you understand that tonight so it's open so now let's look at this fifth seal it says when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held now these souls are not the bride so if you're keeping notes or middle notes if you keep mental notes I I'll be honest with you I like to keep mental notes but then they're a little bit hard to get get back at sometimes my problem is not my memory it's my recall so you just can't find it in that index system so their souls are are not the bride they are they are the uh they're Israel and brother random teaches us from the word why they're not the bride most teachers saw these as Christian Martyrs now he said brother Brandon said these cannot be them Souls because the souls of the righteous martyred and the righteous people the church the bride has done been took up that's pretty simple isn't it he said so they wouldn't be under the altar he said who are they then if they're not the early church he said this is Israel that's to be saved as a nation he said all them that are predestinated and that's important because not all Israel is Israel they're predestined just like we are yeah right there's a predestined group of Israel and there's a predestined group of the church the Gentiles but there's a predestined group of Israel the difference is that predestined group has saved as a nation saved as a group we are not saved as a group we're saved as individuals but that but there is a predestined group there's some who hold to the law there were some who won't there are some who live it there's some who don't just like Among Us right so now uh he said who are they then if they're not the early church this Israel is to be saved as a nation all them that are predestinated Romans 11 25 let's let's look at it from the scripture for a moment what the promise is for Israel he said he said I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits I like that he said I want you to be wise in your own conceit and just do away with something that God has a plan for come on right and we need to be careful with each other that we don't become conceited and do away with something that God has a plan for God can do anything he can bring anybody back to him he can save anybody oh yeah there'll be scars but he can save anybody he's got his own he keeps his own counsel he doesn't tell us all the time what he's going to do either so he said don't be conceited he said that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in it's blindness in part because there were Jews there were Jews who could see but there was a group of Jews who could not see they couldn't they they couldn't see him at all and they couldn't see the gospel at all and they've been that way for for uh 2 000 years now Romans 11 26 and so all Israel shall be saved someone say all Israel as it is written there shall come out of Zion to deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins oh I love that this is my Covenant so he's saying they're going to be saved all Israel all those remember the predestinated group are truly Israel will be saved now brother Brandon says this he said now there Israel that's under this altar he said watch Israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved this is a great truth Church it's a great truth it'll humble you if you recognize it he said you believe that now Who blinded them God blinded his own children see we didn't have a place we weren't a nation that was chosen by God we were not we were not chosen to be as a nation to be he didn't choose America as his nation is his people he didn't choose the English or he didn't choose the Anglo-Saxons he chose the Jews and they were his people they were his children God blinded his own children to come get a renegade like me or just makes me want to weep when I think about it [Music] he said no wonder Jesus standing there at the cross and them Jews howling for his blood kids and he was the scripture he was himself the word and here he said he knowing that those people would have gladly received him think about it if he'd come any other way they would have gladly received it he said and that's the reason he blinded them so they wouldn't recognize him he'd come in such a humble way and blinded them to it that they wouldn't receive it the scripture said they would do it and he blinded was blinded he said Jesus pitied them even so much as he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they literally did not know what they were doing they were blind Paul said they were blinded for a cause for us and brother round uses the example of Joseph and Joseph is a is a fascinating example because it's so true and so real to what happened with the Jews remember Joseph was sold down into slavery and and they threw him they threw him in a pit he was sold for 30 pieces of silver thrown into a pit and and they thought to do away with him they didn't value him they were jealous of him and so they sent him and they don't realize he's going up to Egypt and then you know the story how he goes to Potiphar's house and and you know sometimes many times the Way Up Is Down so instead of get getting promoted Joseph gets demoted right and he does the right thing and loses his job and ends up in prison over it but he still could have satisfaction he did the right thing so he ends up in prison and and then you know the story of the Baker and and the different ones over there and how he told their uh their future and and Pharaoh heard about it and he ends up at the right hand of pharaoh just in time for a famine to come you talk about a God who knows everything every little detail and orchestrates world events oh we we shouldn't worry we shouldn't fear we shouldn't pray God knows what the economy is going to do he knows exactly what's going to happen so here they come into a famine and when they come into that famine time Joseph at the right hand at the right hand of pharaoh he he calls to his policies everything he worked with wisdom and and he knew the famine was coming because the pharaoh's dream that he had and so he stored up food and and he stored up food in here way down in Israel is Jacob and his son speaking that Joseph was dead and they get poor they get they get run out of their own country sounds familiar doesn't it they get driven out of their own country and they come up to find food and when they get there they go through the rigmarole that Joseph puts them through and sends them away and they don't recognize him and brings them back and finally in Genesis 45 1 it says then Joseph could not refrain himself uh brother Harold I can't even imagine how he must have felt his own brothers and here he is with his kingly robes on and they didn't recognize him in that condition yeah the last time they saw him he was a little muddy slave thrown into a pit but now he's grown up and he said he was sitting at the right hand of pharaoh and it says he could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried caused every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his Brethren but the bread and put it this way his sin is Gentile wife back into the palace to reveal himself to his brethren and he wept aloud and the Egyptians in the house of pharaoh heard and Joseph said it to his Brethren I am Joseph now he didn't hide it no more he made it plain I am Joseph see if he'd come that way the first time they would have accepted it they would have received it but they couldn't come that way the first time because if he'd come that way the first time we wouldn't be saved so he says I am Joseph oh my God does my father yet live and his Brethren could not answer him they were troubled at his presence to this guy in a pit you can't keep a good man down can you through this guy in a pit years ago and here we'd come back and he's a king he's at the right hand yeah yeah they couldn't even talk and Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt now therefore be not grieved oh you talk about the right attitude this is this is the man who understands that God's got everything in his control now see he held their lives in his hands all he had to do was refuse to give him food they would starve to death he could have done back to them what they did to him but he didn't do it he said don't be angry don't be grieved that you saw me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life yeah Hallelujah well the problem said see they had not a chance because they were blinded by God their own father so that the grace of God could be fulfilled so the bride could be took from the Gentiles he talked about how God crossed Jacob's hands remember when he's blessing the children and Joseph brings his sons up to be blessed they would be a part of that even though they were half Gentile but they would be a part of the tribes of Israel they would be grafted in and at that time there was an older son and a younger son and he would usually would lay by tradition his right hand on the elders his left hand on the youngest but God crossed his hands and Joseph was upset and went to move it and he said no he said God crossed my hands crossed over from the Jews to the Gentiles people that were not a people James in Acts 15 13 said it this way after they'd held their peace James answers said men and Brethren hearken to me Simeon that Simon Peter had declared how God is the first to visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name a people for his name brother said that means he's given them his name he would have a bride and to disagree the words of the prophets as it is written after this I will return and will build again the Tabernacle of David which has fallen down I will build again the ruins thereof and I will set it up that's the residue of men that's us my seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called Faith the Lord who doeth all these things and listen what James said he said known unto God or all his works from the beginning of the world God knows what he's doing you believe that church God knows what he's doing blinded his own children for me but he has not forgotten them there's many examples in scripture but look at Jeremiah 31 because one brother Brandon refers to in the fifth seal to behold the days come saith the Lord I'll make a New Covenant with the house of Israel with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my my Covenant they break he said although I was a husband unto them Faith the Lord but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God they shall be my people they shall teach no more every man in this neighbor and every man is brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me he's going to reveal himself to him from the least of them even to the greatest of them saith the Lord I will forgive their iniquity I will remember their sin no more thus saith the Lord which giveth the son for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon the stars for a light by night which is divided to Sea when the waves are of Roar Lord of host is his name if those ordinances depart from before me saith the Lord then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation from before me forever what's he saying if the sun quits shining if the moon quits shining if the laws of nature are suspended that's what it would take for me to forget my children that's what it would take for me to forget Israel in one place even said Can a mother forget her or sucking babe can a mother forget her own little baby he said yes she could he said but I will not forget you he said your names are engraved in the palms of my hands and I believe we can rightly look at that and say that we're as the elect that applies to us but it also applies to Israel Hallelujah the elected of God's people the seed of Israel also shall cease to be the nation before me forever thus saith the Lord If Heaven above can be measured the prayer puts it like this get a measuring stick and go measure heaven and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done saith the Lord as long as there's a universe that they don't know much about as long as they've never been to the core of the earth there is still a nation Israel that God loves and he will not forget them oh what that ought to do for us tonight knowing that we have that same God he didn't just choose Israel he also chose us right I'll say this brother Branham tells us that he said this nation the only thing that kept him afloat was the way they treated Israel right and when the station is good to Israel good things happen you don't we underestimate that when Donald Trump I'm not a big trunk fan just get that out of the way but when he put the embassy back to Jerusalem this country was being blessed anytime we have a something against an Administration against Israel I don't care what else they do if there's an Administration against Israel the blessing begins to go away because brother Brown said that's the only thing even keeping this nation afloat you say well some of those are not elected and that's true many of the Jews that are there won't be a part of the 144 000. there's many more than that many of them will will not be a part of that but let's look at it this way we don't know who's who so you better be good to all of them let me go a little bit deeper the same thing applies to the bride you don't know who's who you said well they message people them and people at the church man they're just a bunch of Scallywags you don't know who's who you better be nice to all of them all we know is the bride comes from the message group Hallelujah and there's a there's a there's 144 000 coming from that Jewish group we better be good to all of them right said he had to Blind his own child think of that blind his own child to give us a chance and we turn it down they don't turn him down if you have conviction in your heart that's a precious thing don't turn him down I'll say you young people that are here you you children that are here don't turn him down he may not he will not strive forever don't turn him down see he he blinded his own child so we could accept him he said now don't that make you feel about so little you could crawl under a concrete block with a 10 gallon hat on and never touch it so that's pretty small you know we cannot cast off his elect amen look at Zechariah 12 9. brother Branham references these scriptures and quotes these scriptures in the seal but I just took it from the scripture so you can see it he said it shall come to pass in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications listen if you can be sorry for your sin you did not do that on your own that come from God if you can if you can cry out to God for forgiveness you did not do that you did not produce that that come from God they will cry out because they will have a spirit of Grace and supplications poured out on them look at the grace of God they shall look upon me whom they have pierced they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn they'll finally see it oh my when the Gentile age is over for the bill they'll finally see it there'll be an elected group 144 000 that'll finally see it amen and once you're saying to him what are these wounds in thine hands by the way where'd you get those scars he says oh I got those in the house my friends talk about Divine love we don't even understand Church we're doing people can be cold and hard never never feel never never had feel anything never how can you do that how can you remain cold how can you remain dead in the presence of that kind of love said I got them in the house with my friends oh he said then they'll realize they've killed the Messiah what will he say the same as Joseph did you did it to serve life don't be angry with yourself because the Gentiles would not have been brought in if the Jews hadn't been done that blindfolded trick so he saved the life of the church by the things that they done don't get too angry at anything that happens might be the gentle tender hand of Jehovah he said so there you are that's the reason today they can't understand this it isn't the hour now look now brother Brown gets several scriptural examples why these are not the bride now I'm going through this slower than I intended to but you all just just bear with me for a few minutes why are these not the right number one because they were killed for the testimony they held not the testimony of Christ I just wrote These down to be clear they were killed for the testimony of the Hill not the testimony of Christ was Revelation 6 9 says it says they were slain for the word of God but the problem said that was the law and for the testimony which they held they held true to that law those Souls have been martyred now he said down through here real true Jews down through there that had their name on the book remember not all Israel is Israel had their name on the book live the right life done the right thing live Judaism to the dot as far as they knew they were living it they were they were doing what's right and all they got for it was to be killed and we know they were not the bride now this is this is fascinating to me it's always meant a lot to me even since I was a kid because they ask for Revenge remember the crowd was a loud voice oh God how long O Lord holy and true just thou not judge and offend our avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth this is important how long you you say well brother Ben you don't understand what I've been through uh you know I have a right to seek revenge well so did they they were martyred by Eichmann and many others you ever studied Eichmann that's a fascinating case Eichmann wasn't a bad man he was raised in an Evangelical Christian family strict Lutheran calvinist Christians he wasn't a bad man he was just caught up in the order of that day the spirit of that day and signed orders and personally supervised loading them onto onto trains and brother Bynum when he preaches the seals he just a couple years before that watched eichmann's testimony and he tells about it it was I believe 1960s when they caught him in Argentina and they pulled him up in front of the world some of you are old enough maybe you remember that don't you don't have to raise your hand but some of you may remember eichmann's testimony but but it was uh it was a striking thing to brother Branham and so he he references Eichmann a lot and not just Hitler but Eichmann because he was the one directly responsible he wasn't even a general or anything like that he was just responsible he was an expert on the Jews even traveled to Israel and things but but what was he got caught up in the spirit right oh don't get caught up in the politics of the day there's no telling what you might do no he said they were martyred by Eichmann and many others honest people millions of them down there them Germans shot them to death and murdered them and killed him hung him on fences and burned them and cremated them and everything else they had a right to ask for Revenge they were hated without a cause and they wanted vengeance listen what brother Brandon tells us he said now if that had been the bride it had been like Stephen father forgive them for hanging them on fences now how do you know that because that's what they did that's what Stephen did that's what men Anointed with that Ox Spirit down to the age they didn't ask for vengeance they were killed they were done the same way but they didn't ask for vengeance why they were oh my these Jews didn't have the spirit of Christ they don't have the Holy Ghost you do yeah then what should we do I don't care what he said but you don't understand the hurt that I have forgive them to be bride material you've got to forgive them he said if had been the bride it'd been like Stephen father forgive him and notice again he says this in the church age book how these are crying out for vengeance they cannot be bride material think about that for a minute listen what Jesus says he said if you from your heart don't forgive from your heart right he said neither will your heavenly father forgive you it don't matter what they did lots of bad things happen I'm not trying to diminish what happened these people were the Holy Ghost is the most maybe the most horrific singular or most horrific event that ever happened on the face of the Earth and yet they yeah if they had been the bride they would have said father forgive them sir all right forgive them Father they know not what they do yet I know churches being destroyed by bitterness people preachers to being destroyed by bitterness sometimes we we in our own lives we let that root of bitterness keep going you better get it out of there because to go in a Rapture to go home and live with the Lord you're going to have to root out every bit of that because the Bible says that there will not be one bitter one Speck of bitterness there unforgiveness say God has to do that father forgive them they don't know what they do that's what makes us the brain one of the signs that we are the bride the sign that they were not the bride father forgive you talk to a Jew by the way I'm laboring on this for some reason I don't know why tonight but just bear with me I I listened to a a Jewish man on talk radio one time and he was saying he said you Christians don't understand he said there's no forgiveness you don't have to forgive somebody in the Jewish religion he says the biggest difference between the Christians and the Jews if somebody kills them they believe they have a right to kill them right you take you you come against my family I'll come against you twice as hard and I for an eye a tooth for tooth that's what they teach that's what the law taught but Jesus said father forgive them if they ask for your coat give them your cloak also if they ask you to walk a mile walk too yeah yeah right it's a completely different system what makes a difference you have the spirit of Christ now another reason why we know that they were not the bride they were given white robes I love this white robes were given unto every one of them but the parent said notice I want you to watch this real close they were given robes they didn't have them they were giving them are you still with me tonight they didn't have white ropes they were given what right robes each one of them he said now the Saints already have one glory to God so I I haven't seen mine yet what what's its fashion where it's righteousness not your righteousness but the righteousness of God they were given roads the Saints already had theirs and gone on right so that it's another indication that they were not the bride because the bride has already been made righteous by the blood of the Lamb so they were waiting he said on their Brethren to be killed like they were Revelation 6 11 it was said unto them they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also in their Brethren should be killed as they were should be fulfilled fellow servants it's the two prophets of Revelation 11. Revelation 11 3 I'll give power unto my two witnesses it shall prophesy a thousand 203 score days three and a half years clothed in sackcloth that's Moses and Elijah how many understand that uh we know it's Moses Elijah because verse 6 says he's had power to shut Heaven that's Elijah right not in the days of their prophecy have powerful Waters to turn them to blood that's Moses the Smite the Earth with all plagues as often as they will in verse 7 when they shall finish their testimony the Beast to the sentence out of the bottomless pit to make war against them shall overcome them and kill them now that's their fellow servants that's going to die and brother Brown talked about the Pentecost was always looking for a great sign he said that's to the Jews we're just looking to go home in a Rapture right he said but now now the Brethren is 144 thousand he said no notice thy Brethren my brethren had yet to be killed which means 144 000 yet to be called in the tribulation in Revelation 7 4 where you find that he said also now watch they have to be martyred by the Antichrist we just come through noticed in his last tribe where he breaks that Covenant with them Jews down there now watch brother Brown goes all the way through this and then he changes his Focus because he uses this because remember their souls under the altar well there's also Christians many of you have loved ones that have went on beyond the curtain of time right there's somewhere and some other random changes is focused from the Jewish Church to the bride and he says the bride is already waiting with white rose they got their white robes here but they wear them there yeah and now he said then that brother tells the story of going beyond the curtain of time and he actually goes there and he sees those people and then the voice spoke to him and said you've been gathered to your people like Jacob was gathered to his people right so there's a people under the altar crying for vengeance but these are not under the altar crying for vengeance these are waiting on us right so now he said all all these my people or all these branhams you know it's not a family affair he said no they're your converts to Christ now brother Branham looked at them and you remember the story he begins to he said well will I have to be judging he said they're waiting for the rewards to be given out he said well if I had if I have to be judged he said well Paul's people have to be judged with under his message he said yes he said well that'll be all right then he said because Paul I preached what Paul preached right I preached what Paul preached and he said millions cried out we're resting on that that's what I'm resting on today amen yes sir so now he said he called attention to these and he said they were the Saints he said if John looked over there and then was his Brethren his Brethren had to suffer a little I'm closing just in a minute just hang with me here he said then see the Lord God permitted me to see my brethren and the saints that were waiting for the coming of the Lord he said they were not under the altar of sacrifice mine wasn't he said but they were more see these were Martyrs see mine wasn't under the martyrs altar I should tell you right there we're not our destiny is not to be martyrs right we don't go in under the tribulation he said look they he said not the ones that the Lord showed me the bride she was not under the martyrs block no the sacrifice alter the martyrs but had received white robes how did she do it not for being martyred but by accepting the pardoning grace of the Living Word how many have accepted it tonight I've accepted the pardoning grace of the Living Word he said Christ would give them a white robe and he said talks about the doctrine of Soul sleeping I don't know if you've ever heard of that but Soul sleeping is the idea that when you die one day you'll just wake up and it'll be the Rapture in the resurrection you won't know anything in between it's called Soul sleeping your soul just like it's asleep brother Brown said that Doctrine was not correct your loved ones are somewhere right they're somewhere and they're awake right they're awake oh my God I love that I love that thought they're somewhere real in a better place than this he said I think this this proves that they're not sleeping they're alive their body's sleeping but the soul not in the grave they're in the presence of God under the altar not under the martyr's altar but under the altar look at Second Corinthians 5 1 for we know someone say we know we know that if our Earthly house that's this all of us live in a house of dust if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God we have not we will have but we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens oh my god brother Paul in one day you're just going to step out of this body and step into that one whether you go by way of the Grave or if it's time for the Rapture will you just step straight into your glorified body that's all you know oh my listen whichever way you go you're a winner right you're a winner because if you go by way of the Grave you come you come up first we could begin to see you and then we take a step right that's what he taught us now look we know this Earth if this Earthly house is resolved we have one not made with hands Eternal in the heavens we go somewhere when we die he said and I'm so grateful I'm so glad that God did this for us in our hour God did this for us so we wouldn't have to be like everybody who's wondering well is it going to be this way is it going to be that way this teacher taught it a certain way that teacher taught him a certain way but in this hour when the seals at the time of the opening of the seals here comes the prophet who said I've been there he said I'm so grateful to God that I can say is your pastor and brother I've seen those people so help me sit in that body and handle them with my hands ever wonder why they each one run up to him and hugged him said my precious brother he had to know they had real bodies oh my God he had to grab I grabbed a hold of them oh it makes me makes me want to overcome my tiredness and Shout tonight they had real bodies Brother David that real body he could handle them there wasn't some Spirit floating on a cloud he handled him with his hands they were real somewhere as I said your loved ones also went on that died in the Lord they they have real bodies oh my you said I truly believe with all my heart that the true Revelations of the revealings of the first second third fourth and fifth seal is now open to us there's more to it than just the Jews but although that's a great mystery it's a great it's a great thing to think that God would blind his own children to save me that's such a great thing but then to recognize that that the power of God would reach so far as to as to give me a light robe while I'm here on Earth even though I did nothing to deserve it and he gave me a lot rope and he's called me up in this hour come up higher and when I go up with him I'm going to meet my loved ones who are in a body it'll be just like mine aren't you glad for that today your body like his glorious body musicians go ahead and come brother Branham closes the fifth seal and I didn't put it on the board but just so you can ponder it and think about it he said if there is in this building tonight that person young or old that has to this time spurned that opportunity that cost God such a price and you would like to accept that offer to God tonight but you don't have to as far as we ever know to be a martyr though you may be but a white robe has been provided for you would you bow your heads with me and if God knocks at your heart now why not accept it [Music] I don't know why you come to church maybe well it must have been I want to be a better person I really believe God sent a prophet you've been given a light robe you could just just accept it and it really is that simple [Music] God is knocking at your heart he would he doesn't do that for everybody there's an elected group in this hour that he goes to he knocks at the door of laodicea but they won't let him in but he's knocking at your heart as an individual today because he knows you will let him in why don't you let him in let him have full control let him go through every room white robe has been provided for you God knocks at your heart why not accept it little horde he said my brother man I've already been saved I've been baptized just let him in let him have full control let him let him anoint you for the hour that you live in overcome every fiery Dart of the enemy we don't give our voices and our strength and our I hope you I hope you I hope I can show you that I want to give everything I have to the Lord I don't give that so you can be good people I want you to be good people I want you to be good citizens but I don't give my life I'm not giving my life to this church for good citizens so while we do it we want to see you in heaven we want you to see you born again by the blood of the Lamb you won't get there because you went to Word of Life Tabernacle you won't get there because you came on a Wednesday night even you only receive it you only you only go to that place because you've received that white robe from the hand of Christ himself and washed for the bleeding word would you just accept it tonight and believe he said is it that simple listen you you young people you kids if you're old
