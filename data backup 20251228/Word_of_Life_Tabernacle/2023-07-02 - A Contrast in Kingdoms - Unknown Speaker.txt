seriousness of every situation big or little Lord you know what it is God you're able to meet it today by the preaching of the word I pray you granted Lord Oh how we love you today we thank you for your presence we want to please you in everything that we do we ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you turn with me to John chapter 18. John chapter 18 and verse 33 I'll try not to hold you as long as I did last week Joel said amen John 18 33 then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered him say it say a style this thing of thyself or did others tell it be of me there's a there's a sermon right there for the Joel for the steward Act are you saying this of yourself or did you just hear it and pilate answered am I a Jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world yes if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from its pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou says that I'm a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate saith unto him what is truth when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and saith unto them I find in him no fault at all I can say Amen to that today he's all together lovely you may have your seats a blessed reading of the word we talked last week I used this text in a different way as we talked about truth and and what the truth was and how we are set free by it and we found out that the truth was actually what God had in his mind of us before the foundation of the world and so we could take that and say that the truth is our word body that's what's true about us and this body is the LIE right so the word body is the truth though this body is the lie and so we found that out but I want to turn a different direction this morning as as I was beginning to think about Pilate and and about Jesus as they were standing there together and they're facing one another and what they represented and and they actually represented two a different and distinct kingdoms that couldn't be farther away from each other that in the way that they were in their manner in their manner of uh of uh of government that they had because one was a kingdom of God and the other one was the kingdom or the Empire of Rome and these two kingdoms still exist today that we still have a kingdom of God and we still have a Roman Empire that runs all the way to the end we find that out in in Daniel's uh in the Nebuchadnezzar's dream uh that Daniel interpreted how that the uh the iron and the clay ran mixed all the way down to the feet and so we know that that Roman agenda about Roman idea is still here today that manner of government that that worldly system that uh that does things a certain way and yet there's a way that God does things and we want to make sure that what we're doing we're doing things according to the way God does things and not things according to the way the Roman system does so we find that piling pilot is an interesting figure he he represents the highest Authority in the known world at that time he represents the Roman Emperor Tiberius who was the highest uh the highest Authority and he come in in tiberius's name to bring uh to bring his kingdom to bring the Roman Kingdom into Judea and then we find on the contrast on the other side that Jesus actually come in his father's name and he come to bring the the kingdom of God to the people of God and yet the way that they would go about it would be very different now pilate was born in Italy probably in Rome uh he was not Roman by ancestry he was probably a Sam Knight which is a actually a tribe that was there in Rome they were the last tribe to really challenge the supremacy of Rome on the Italian Peninsula but actually the Sam Knights say it wouldn't have been born into Roman nobility and so pilate had had to work his way up in Roman politics he and he had to learn the hard way that decisions had to be based on on power decisions were based on might the person with the with the biggest stick the person with the largest ability to bring forth to a situation was the person who won in the ancient world and that's still true today in the world that we live in the people with the most money the people with the biggest crowd the the denominations that consolidate power they're the ones who control things the governments that are superpowers the governments that can bring power to Bear but that is not the way the kingdom of God operates and it shouldn't be the way we operate here in the church yes sir so the the Sam Knights say they were a people who had fought the Romans and then had been assimilated into Roman culture one of pilate's ancestors probable ancestors was uh gavius Pontius who was the one who defeated the Romans at the caudine forks I don't know if you've heard of that battle is the greatest defeat that the Romans ever had they were actually so caught into uh into that place that they couldn't get out of it and had to lay down their arms it was a humiliating defeat by the Romans but that Roman system the reason the Romans won was not because they were more powerful or or even had more men or more money but they had great willpower they didn't care to slaughter thousands of men it didn't bother them to what what they did they were they were amoral in that way they just didn't they it didn't bother them at all so they would just keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back and that's just the nature of the Roman system and so and they didn't the Romans didn't really build anything I I know you didn't sign up for a history lesson today but I want to give you an insight into the culture of the world that we live in that's the culture of today yeah yeah and so the Romans didn't really build anything they just perverted other people's stuff the Romans weren't shipbuilders but they beat Carthage in the sea by by uh by building the new types of ships and and new weapons on the ships and and so the Romans was always adopting things they adopted Greek culture and even Greek gods just changed them to Roman names and they were that's the way they did things can't you see how the Roman Catholic Church did the same thing when they saw the power of Christianity and they saw how the people were becoming Christians and it was taking over that that Roman Spirit got involved in it and saw it as a way and even Constantine said I saw a dream or a vision and it said conquered by this and he saw a cross and it was a Roman idea that they could take over the world using Christianity they had no problem with that they would use whatever they could to have power so now uh this Pilot's ancestor gave his Pontius was the one who defeated the Romans there the general that defeated the Romans and he had mercy on them and it was not a thing you could do with the Romans yeah he let them go and and he famously he stripped their weapons from them and made them pass under the the Yoke and and they went back to Rome but 30 years later they captured him and when they captured him they executed him because they they understood the application of power and so pilate knowing the story as being one of his ancestors and and he would have understood that only Power only the application of power works and and I want you to understand that's the way the world is today people understand that you do what you can do yeah yeah not what you should do and that's the way our government works that's the way many churches work that's the way denomination works we should never work that way because we're under a different Kingdom we don't do stuff just because we can we do it because it's right because it's the word of God and so we're looking to another kingdom now uh the Romans didn't become Rome by showing Mercy and Pontius was the family name the pilot named pilate uh came from his his or his father's ability with the javelin pilate means a good with a javelin basically and so he would have been a warrior he would have been born into a big house when he was born a great party would have been thrown how different that is from when Christ the King was born he was born into a Manger in a stable he was born to a poor family but pilate would have been born into a big house he would have been surrounded by Splendor even though his family wasn't one of the top families but he would have been surrounded by the Splendor of what they called The Eternal City he would have been all growing up of its temples and government buildings and he would have been born into a family with high expectations that would have required him to do his best to lead the family into becoming senators or or even marrying into the Imperial family and so he would have been born with a expectation to succeed he had to make it and I think sometimes we we have to be careful what expectations we put on our children because if we give sometimes we want them to succeed so badly but remember this is a Roman system right we want them to succeed I want my children to succeed I want them to go to school and be doctors and lawyers and everything else but I want them more to succeed in the gospel I'd rather that they become preachers I'd rather they become singers I'd rather they attended the house of God Faithfully than be somebody that becomes some great person in the world so we've got to get our priorities straight so now he did his best to maybe to do what he could to become what his family wanted him to be when he was 18 he probably went into the military women as an officer because of his family name when he was back in Rome after campaigning he would have been in a social class which would have allowed him to be rich enough to own a summer home and a winter home he became a member of the praetorian guard and they were fanatical bodyguards who worshiped the emperor's deity we know that he was a close friend of the head of the Guard who had a an influence with the emperor Tiberius so he had a connection to power he was about 30 years old or at least 30 when he was appointed Governor probably in his 30s when he came to Judea him and Jesus would have been about the same age unlike Jesus we know he was married because his wife told him don't have anything to do with this just man he had a cruel streak he was hated by the Jews for in Luke Chapter 13 and verse 1 it says they were present at that season some that told him of the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices and what he had done is actually he disguised men as Jews and he put them out with the Jews when the Jews began to protest as they often did something he was doing he had them take out their knives and just knife him and hundreds of Jews fell and so that's why he said he mingled their blood with the sacrifice even on the temple porch he understood military power and political power he would have arrived in Judea in about 26 A.D I got thinking about that almost exactly 2 000 years ago here in a couple years ready to project the power of Rome to the unruly Jews the the Romans were very racist when it comes to the Jews say they didn't want to be called Jews that's why pilate exclaims to Jesus am I a Jew he said am I a Jew he didn't want to be called to Jew Jew was a low life Jews always making trouble the uh you see the hear the uh the Romans obeyed orders they were a very militaristic people a very obedient people when it come to obeying orders and so his kingdom represented power it represented War it represented cruelty and force and that's why when it comes in it's in its fullness when it's manifested in the Antichrist that's why the tribulation period one of the reasons it'll be so awful is because he manifests himself fully in that dictatorial that's what he is right and even in the church that's what come down to the Roman Church and but it was not an original idea it originated in the scripture actually with nimrod Nimrod remember Romans the second Babylon I hope I'm not moving too fast this morning but I want to lay this foundation so we can go somewhere today but in nimrod's time the Bible says Kush began Nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the Earth he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord and what that word mighty one means is a he began to be a mighty man or or a man that was greater than everyone else he began to be the great one and remember when it comes to this Kingdom that we live in there are no great ones right but there are no big eyes in little use but when it comes to that one to that Kingdom of nimrod there was a great one he was a great one and he founded Babel Romans the second Babylon and brother Branham says this about it he said now there's nothing in the Bible that would type our modern organizations except Babylon that's the only type in the Bible of our modern organization organized religion because it was founded by Nimrod in a forced Unity amongst religious people we want Unity we want Fellowship we we want all that's why we have these meanings and things we want to have Fellowship we want people to be able to Fellowship freely but it can't be forced not even in the local church you can't force Unity yeah yeah right because that's a Roman idea now he said he said it was founded by Nimrod a forced unity and that's what the Creeds in our denominations do today Force Unity you either belong to this or you're out he said we're coming now so we can see to a forcing all into one great Unity of it but that is a mechanical made advice by a man and it cannot stand it is not God's will it is not God's program no matter how people try to say it is it's not it can't be what is God's program God calls an individual God calls a man God calls the pastor God calls it evangelist but he doesn't call a system yeah that's good are you with me so far I know it's not a shouting message but maybe we can stir up our spiritual gastronomics this morning as as brother Brandon would say you know if you get to eat in something good you get to eat something good it begins to it begins to make you feel good when you begin to eat good on the word it begins to make you feel good hey man you start you can say something about it so brother Brandon said it's just impossible for it to be God wouldn't put his name in such a thing as that that denies his word how can God live in something that denies his own word he cannot do that so pilate only understands Force that's his kingdom yeah yeah we don't get people to come to church by force so the brand have talked about the people in Arizona he was having a hard time getting them to come to go to church some of them still today he has a hard time getting them to go to church but but here he was having a hard time and and but they were going to denominational churches and and when they would go they would want to sign them up he said I went to some of them the first day you're there they'll approach you join our church if you don't do it you're not welcome right and that Spirit still exists if we're not careful it's not like we're you know with the bride can't be deceived but there's times that we become misled by denominational ideas and this idea that well if you're not in our church you don't count preach where does that come from it comes from a Roman system it comes from the other Kingdom yeah yeah right because really all God's people count and we should care for all of God's children we shouldn't care for the elect and the non-elect we should care for our church and other churches we should care for the people of God we should care not because we can you say well we can't change the elect to non-elect that or not elect to elect that's true but we can care for people because it's Who We Are that's just who we are we we care for people we love people but well it's not a fourth thing he said join our church if you don't do it you're not welcome see he said it's a force thing it's forced upon you and that's Babylon but in Christ you come in by election not by force you believe that this morning your heart pulls you in so now the system of force filtered down into the early church and very quickly the Bible says in Revelation 2 15 that has so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate nickel means to conquer Leo which means the laity nicolaitan means to conquer the laity now why is this such a terrible thing it's terrible because God has never someone say never he has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness oh my God now people move with political mindness but God won't place his church in the hands of that yeah I'm glad the message is the way that it is and every church is Sovereign in itself I'm so glad brother Brown said this message would never become a denomination there may be many denominational spirits but it'll never become a denomination why because we're not deaf we don't want that Roman system we don't want we don't want that elected leadership that moves with political minders we want men of God who know how to pray men who know how to get in touch with God men who know how to how to stand before the people with humility and with a transparent life so now you remember God chose David the people chose Saul yeah yeah right and the People's Choice always moves with political mindedness but now he has placed his church in the care of God ordained Spirit-filled word living men amen who lead the people through feeding them the word not by force but through feeding them the word he is not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood right so when we talk about a transparent life my life has to be transparent so does yours right We Are Holy people not just the holy pastor right and we're all holy by the blood of the Lamb but we're supposed to be transparent I don't mean that you have to tell everything that ever happened to you what I mean by that is the way you live at church is the way you live at home right you're not a sinner at home and a Christian at church but you're a Christian seven days a week it's true the leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation yeah further there's no place in the word where priests or ministers or such mediate between God and the people come on now nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord they are not separated in their worship of the Lord I've got to worship with you if I never worship with you then what happens is I'm not getting I'm not giving any worship to God I have a responsibility not just to preach to you but to worship with you and it's one of the great things that happens to ministers or even the song leaders at times and people is we forget to worship with the people we're not just Leading the People In Worship but we're supposed to worship with the people we're to worship with the people we are also in need of of healing sometimes we are also in need of salvation of our children we are also in need of the power of God to move through we need to hear that we're the elect of God we need to hear that we're we're the pride of Jesus Christ we need to hear that yeah As Leaders we need to hear that yes oh my because we have to we worship with the people not separated in our worship God wants all to love and serve him together nicolaitanism destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people that makes the leaders overlords instead of servants so now this Doctrine actually started as a deed in the first stage it appears that the problem lay in two words elders presbyters and overseers Bishops I I want to go through this it might get a little dry for a minute but I I want you to understand how it come in that early church he said those scripture shows there are several Elders in each Church some began Ignatius among them to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority and control over the elders now the truth of the matter is the word Elder signifies who the person is while the word Bishop signifies the office of the same man right so a pastor would be a an elder and a bishop but there are other elders because in Elders the man he said Bishop is the office of the man Elder always has and always will refer simply to a man's chronological age in the Lord right so you know you can't just tell by how old a person is but but how long and and how faithful they've been to that to the things of God so that could be an elder so he's not an elder because he is elected or ordained but because he's older well that's simple isn't it he is more seasoned trained not a novice reliable because of experience long-standing proof of his Christian experience he said but no the Bishops did not stick to the Epistles of Paul but rather they went to Paul's account of the time he called the elders from Ephesus to my lead us in Acts 20 and verse 17 the record States Elders were called verse 28 they were called overseers or Bishops these Bishops no doubt politically minded and anxious for power and insisted that Paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than the local Elder with official capacity only in his own church why because why do they do that why would they trade the freedom of the spirit and the way that the move of God was operating you realize there were people in that age that saw a move of God understood they saw people rejoicing in Freedom they saw the Devils cast out they saw the power of God moving in such a mighty way in that early church and they said we got to fix this yeah yeah right I said this oh we need some more leadership well we need a little less Freedom we need more we need more control we need a little more don't you realize that same spirit is alive today although we would never allow that to come in among us we need the freedom of the worship of God we need the spirit of God we need the local church to be Sovereign but we don't need the local church to become a cult either or some little place where we withdraw from the world and we and we and we have to tell the pastor has to tell us what clothes to wear on Sunday I'm so glad that's not my responsibility my responsibility is to feed you the word and when I feed you the word your responsibility is to go live It Go manifest it all right huh no power over that just to preach the word though but they wanted men with official capacity that could impose discipline when the Holy Ghost is supposed to discipline the church and God had leadership God does have leadership he has Elders he has a way right he does have men who are called to be in that position but if we do it differently than the way he did it it becomes Roman why would they do that because they were inspired by that Spirit yes that culture was all around them that's right that's right right why was pilate who he was he was just a part of that culture that was just the culture that he was in and so it didn't seem weird to him at all to make judgments based on politics right that was the right thing to do Romans they they looked at the wisdom of a Man based on how successful he was yeah not whether he made the right decision or not right but how successful he was and so pilate made a decision based on his own success to try to further his own his own kingdom or his own government there as he was a representative of that Kingdom of Rome but we today we make decisions based on furthering Our Kingdom and what about what is it our kingdom is Never furthered by wrong means and what that what I mean by that is it's not furthered by doing things the wrong way to reach a desired result no you do things the right way and God will take care of the results yeah right you never do the wrong thing the right way we find that David failed in that bringing the ark back and you all know that story I'm gonna get in trouble if I don't get back to my notes now to them a bishop was now one with extended authority over many local leaders such a concept was neither scriptural nor historical even a man of the Statue of polycarp lean towards such an organization that's what started as a deed in the first stage was made a literal Doctrine and so it is today Bishops still claimed power to control men and deal with them as they desire placing them where they so will in the ministry this denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost who said separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work wherein to I have called them this is anti-word and Antichrist what was it a kingdom of power that come and filter this way down through the church but this other this prisoner the king who was standing there pilate was not a king he was a governor but there was a king standing there and the King that was standing there represented a far different Kingdom then pilate did he was born in a manger he didn't have a place to lay his head he had 12 followers and one of them was the devil and the other ones didn't have the Holy Ghost couldn't follow him correctly he couldn't even keep his own his own followers in line and so the world looked at him as a failure the world said he can't even he run everybody off when he said eat my flesh and drink my blood his church is only 12 people and one of them is the devil right they said he's a failure but they didn't realize he represented a different Kingdom oh God help us today we get wrapped up in numbers we get wrapped up in ideas we get wrapped up in in stardom we get wrapped up in social media and we think the most likes means that but the most liked things are sometimes the most vile things the most liked things are sometimes the hormones what gives the word of God why because they it's the will of the majority but we have to find the will of God and Jesus did nothing except the father showed him yeah we find this example of a different Kingdom shown in the way Jesus interacts with his disciples when James and John come up to him under that influence of a Roman system where there were great ones who would be put up in magistrates and civil Authority they come to Jesus and they said they said when when you when you come into your kingdom we want to be on the right hand and the left actually they had their mother do it which is a Spirits don't die but you know her mom you'd want your children to have that privilege right and Jesus didn't rebuke them but he'd come back he said you're not thinking right you're not thinking right because now everybody else gets mad right because everybody else is in the church the little church is all upset you say well you know this must not be must not be a Church of God if we ever have problems in the church where did you hear that from there was dissension in the early church there was dissension among the disciples the only place were ever recorded that they were in one Accord in one place is when they were in the upper room and as soon as they left and started doing the work they still disagreed oh but I'm so glad we can agree on the big things I'm so glad we have an atonement we can Fellowship around there's something we can we can agree on but it's not going to be every little thing and what kind of pie that we eat or something like that so when they begin to be all stirred up about it when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two Brethren why because they wanted those spots huh oh I can't believe you've elevated him to this office I wanted that office and they were moved with indignation against them but Jesus called them unto him and said you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercised dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them the princes of the Gentiles that's the Roman Kingdom but it shall not be so among you but whosoever would be great among you let him be your minister that word is servant or slave whosoever it actually is the same word for deacon go look it up whoever will be great among you let him do the work of a deacon who the original deacons served tables they waited tables that's what they were they were created for the office of the deacon was first created to help and they've got many other jobs we thank God for our deacons but he said if you want to be great be a deacon in other words be somebody who's helpful somebody who's there somebody who's always available you want to be great in the kingdom of God don't want to don't try to be some big thing where everybody can see you working but try to be something that'll help the people of God on the inner workings of the church whoever will be great let him be your minister whosoever will be your Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many oh if he could give his life if that's why he came why can't we give our life today but the random taught us that eternal life was living for others if his life was living for others as I just listened to Brother Brad and preached out the other day and I began to think oh God how much eternal life do we have because eternal life he said is living for others if eternal life is living for others let me live for others like you did Lord let me live sacrificially let me live with all of my heart let me live with all of my being let me live for the people of God yes sir and I've got responsibilities here at the church but I've got responsibilities to those on the outside too I want to help you if I can I want to help you if I can I think we all ought to be that way we all we ought to want to help one another huh well all I do is take care of children you're helping somebody yeah yeah well the brown talked about a good doctor how there would be a reward for a good doctor yeah who helped people be a reward for people to help children there'll be a reward for people help in the church it would be a reward for Sunday school teachers and there'll be a reward for helpers and there'll be a reward for people who cook and it'll be a reward for people to provide oh my God why because that's part of the kingdom and we don't do it expecting a quid pro quo which is a Latin term because it comes from that system yeah yeah you give something and I give it back you give something and I get something that's not what we do this ain't politics this ain't Republicans and Democrats it's the Church of God it's the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God operates on the move of the spirit of God not on the who gets what that's right are you still with me this morning so good to see that young man on the front row my goodness he's dressed almost like me too I just wish I had that tie Matthew 5 and 1. seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain when he was set his disciples came unto him his kingdom was different he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit that word poor is beggarly needy blessed are the beggars he says not the natural Beggars but the spiritual beggars the spiritual beggars blessed are the beggars in spirit the beggars in spirit are people who have needs in their spirit and they come to the house of God they don't come walking in and say oh what can I do today to make myself great to make my name great to help my my family great rise up in the in the church to help my my people rise up and myself rise up that's the way they come they say Lord today I have a need today I got a sickness today I got family that's in need today Lord would you bless my pastor because I know that by the preaching of the word you can heal my diseases I know that by the laying on of hands I can be healed my family can be healed they can be saved and so the spiritual Beggars come to church that way they come to church like the woman who washed his feet and said is there is there something I can do just to help you Lord Jesus I want to do my part they see a need and they do it yes poor in spirit blessed are they for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven yes you never got to the top in Rome by being poor in spirit you never got to the top in Rome by being by being a good person you got to the top and Rome by lying and cheating and doing everything you could to make it to the top you scratched and clothed but he said it won't be that way in my kingdom that's good amen Hallelujah blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted oh I'm so glad for that yes some of you have been through unspeakable things and I can't even imagine having to go through that I can't I my mind won't allow me to think of what some of y'all have been through when it comes to tragedy with your families and I'm not trying to to work you up emotionally and thinking about that but it's just a fact it's just a reality but blessed are they that mourn those are the ones that are going up yeah yeah those are the ones that are rising in this Kingdom this is the way up how to win friends and influence people and the people of God be a spiritual beggar be a mourner blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth that word means those with self-control oh God help us today those with self-control those with Temperance is what is called in Peter that's what brother Graham says it's not it's not not drinking Temperance is self-control it's that word for Meek blessed are the ones with self-control blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled are you hungry didn't you come to church hungry today is there something in your heart oh God I want righteous I want peace Lord I want righteousness I want I want my family to be right I want my I want myself Lord I hunger for your word oh God if you come hungry blessed are you sir blessed are you it's you hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy again here pilate's ancestor had been merciful and it got executed for it so he had been taught that he couldn't be merciful God it only led to a downfall but now Jesus stood before him and Jesus would even give his own life out of Mercy God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that that as many believed on him will not perish but have eternal life don't you realize it was merciful he loved the world he loved those of his own and even those who were outside the economy of God we have a merciful god right many outside the economy of God will be saved because God's a merciful god because they they accept him in some way or they give a cup of cold water I had was a man drove up this morning to the church and I happen to be here and I was opening up the front door and he drove them to the the Portico out there and he had two bags of vegetables squash it looked really good squash and stuff like that and he dropped them off he said my neighbors don't want these he said I thought I'd give them to the church I guess he lives somewhere around here I said well you that'd be welcome I said we'll we'll take him and use them he said you want something next Sunday morning I said if you're coming by drop some more off and I thought of that when he said that because he may not ever do anything else he looked a little sketchy to be honest with me with you but but when he was walking out there I thought you know that may be the only thing he ever does but he gave a cup of cold water and when he did God will bless him for that he's a merciful god he's a merciful god and don't you think we ought to have an attitude that allows people to be merciful to us we ought to have an attitude that doesn't just run people off and get mad at people and get angry every time fly off the handle every time something goes wrong we need to be careful and you say Well they're not bright they may not be but they may be someone who needs Mercy they may be there because of your attitude towards them blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God oh my don't you want heart Holiness not just that word Holiness but heart holiness blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God peacemakers didn't do much in Rome Rome was a warrior Nation and he said blessed are the peacemakers blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven none of these things would get you ahead in Roman society the Bible says that in Luke 9 46 that the disciples again would begin to reason among themselves which of them should be greatest and Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and said unto him whatsoever whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great verse 49 of John answered this don't you see this influence of this other Kingdom on the disciples John comes down and says Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbade him because he followed not with us we're going to earn some brownie points Master right after he showed him the example of a little child yeah Master won't tell you a story well I went down to that other church and I told them what for yeah yeah I told them they weren't in the message they don't do stuff like we do it yeah yeah fussing and fighting and carrying on they were casting out devils in my name they claimed to believe the message and they weren't doing anything like what we do they weren't with us they weren't of our tribe they weren't following and you would think that any sincere person casting out Devils the name of Jesus would have followed Jesus you'd have thought that they would but Jesus doesn't question their motives why because he was teaching a lesson to the disciples and he said unto them he said uh he said Jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us hey that's why we don't go out trying to make enemies I don't walk around trying to make enemies that's not our job to make enemies our job is to preach the gospel forbid him not he is not against us as far as verse 51 that came to pass when the time was come he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem and he sent messages before his face and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him yeah and they did not receive him because his face as though he would go to Jerusalem so the Samaritans had a party spirit because he was going up to the festival he told him I said well if you're going to that meeting you can't come to ours let's bring it on home you go to that meeting you know why what are you doing over here at our meeting we don't want you down here and they did not receive him because his face was so he would go to Jerusalem and when his disciples James and John saw this well they don't learn very quick do they they said Lord we'll thou that we command fire to come down from heaven him even as Elias did oh the the innocence of Youth you know did you think that through James and John did you think that through you're going to kill innocent children you're going to kill you're going to destroy people because they didn't treat you right oh my he turned and rebuked them and said you know not what manner of spirit you are of you see you're operating under the influence of the Kingdom but not the kingdom of God this would be a different kind of Kingdom I'm hurrying as we get close to the end now they were so used to the other Kingdom he had to speak to them in Parables he said the kingdom of heaven was like a mustard seed in Matthew 13 31 he said that the least become the greatest but also by the Bible says folk of the false church because the roots would come down when it become great then the birds nested in it yeah the Kingdom of Heaven he said it was like 11 in Matthew 13 33 the kingdom of heaven was like treasure hidden a field it's a strange Kingdom the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net cast into the sea so he's telling them there's good and bad right there's good and bad there's some people you have to you'll go to church with that may not be seed of God there's others that are real true blue but you'll you'll congregate together and love one another and care there will always be two Vines he said don't wait until the end the tares will be there till the end and not everybody in Word of Life Tabernacles going into Rapture I'm sorry to say that my prayer is that everybody would my faith is that everybody would but the chances are not everybody will but I'll say this I want you all to go I'm gonna do my very best that you all would go because I'm going all right and that's the attitude we all want to have I'm going yeah I'm one of those that's going but the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls the kingdom of Heavens like a net cast into the sea it gathers everything yeah but the lobsters crawl back and the Crawfish crawl back and the and the lobsters and everything else crawl back all the other things that are there all the crabs and everything else but there's some fish in there too and the fish are kept by the fishermen amen Matthew 13 51 Jesus gets done with all that and he says have you understood all these things they said yes sir it was like the people standing there by the island when he preached when he preached future home they said yes 1500 miles this way that's 1500 miles from Jeffersonville and foreign people are so carnal sometimes yeah yeah we get so carnal sometimes so did you understand what I told you they said oh yeah we understand he said unto them therefore they didn't understand but he told him he said therefore every scribe which is instructed under the Kingdom of Heaven it's like unto a man that is a householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old so oh my that that's that's where we're at today a householder the kingdom of God here we have a message here we have and we're we've got within us we're a householder brother Steward every one of us are we have the ability to bring out new things and old things that will benefit us that will help us you know when someone would come to a householder's house and he'd want to show them oh this is my new chair here's here's my new fireplace you like the way that we did it if you hadn't been to somebody's house in a while or if you hadn't been somewhere to church they would show you all around and show you what the church was like show you what the house was like and that's what we do with the kingdom of God do you not know about faith I'll show you Faith do you not know about by salvation I'll show you salvation do you not know about healing I got some healing here in my house the kingdom of God kingdom heaven told them of 11th Hour workers and a wedding fee I don't have time to go into all this today maybe we'll get to it at some point in a future date then he set his face to go to Jerusalem and they thought surely in Jerusalem they would crown him a king this is it boys gonna get rich make some money now we're going to be the biggest group of them all and Jesus didn't go to Jerusalem to wear a crown of gold he went to Jerusalem to wear a crown of thorns the Bible says for the joy that was set before him because in this Kingdom this kingdom is a kingdom not a kingdom of instant gratification but a kingdom of delayed pleasure a kingdom of delayed Joy there's more on the other side than there is here brother Bill that's why I said blessed in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints why because you realize they got more over there than they do here that we live for another world don't get caught up in this world don't let it take over your mentality your idea the way you treat people there's another world out there much more real than this world no Kingdom of this Earth started by a king who hands himself over to the enemy to be executed but this one did you see the culture of this kingdom is sacrificed it's a kingdom of lambs but the premium says God is a holy God when a man is born of the Holy Spirit he's a candidate he's not only that but he's a king he's a prince he's from another Nation his kingdom is above he's filled with God's power God's presence the woman that does that puts on clothes the man lives decent and true to his wife the wife lives true and decent to the husband why they're influenced by the kingdom of heaven they want nothing of the world their affections are set on things above they're finished with the things of the world how many say I'm finished with the things of the world they're new creatures in Christ they're holy live it not them holy he said but the Holy Spirit governs them they don't have their own mind the holy spirit moves in them that's the reason they act crazy to the people of the world because they've moved by a spirit of another kingdom why do you do what you do why do you come to the house of God on a Sunday morning and sit and listen to the word you're moved by a spirit from another kingdom oh that's good hey man A lot of times women say to me brother Branham it's my American privilege if I want to dress the way I want to dress that's right men say if I want to take a sociable drink they sell it out there there's no law against it that's my American privilege that's right but as a Christian you'll forfeit your American rights if you're a lamb if you're a goat you won't but if you're a lamb you'll forfeit your rights because you're of another kingdom the dove is leaving you oh don't you want him leaving you today amen he said we don't tell them they have to do it we just give him the pattern tell them what the Bible says oh my and if they're born of a Heavenly Spirit then their spirit is no more Americanized it's no more germanized it's Heavenly eyes we're the kingdom of God because we're in another kingdom a kingdom of God we're decency Holiness and power exist we have access to our King how many believe that today we have access to our King we have an interview with him whenever we want to call upon him we have no other intercessors no other mediator between the king and us but that one man Christ Jesus pilate needed a a patron he needed somebody that's the way Roman society worked literally if you wanted an appointment in the military you had to go to a great man's house and just sit there yeah and wait on him take notice of you but that's not the way the kingdom of God works he took notice of us before the foundation of the world and we are not subject to the whims of some ruler here in the Earth but there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus no one else put us in no one else can take us out we are living in a kingdom it's called in the chronology of the Bible the Messianic Kingdom in other words were the Messiah rules in every life in his Dominion ruling the lives of his people called out people from every Walk of Life Gathering them together in a group and calls it his church his called out ones he says again that's what makes it so much different to the world you're from above you're born how many how many are born again today you're born you're a citizen of another kingdom you believe it that's what the Holy Ghost is to make you a citizen of the kingdom of God and if you're a citizen of the kingdom of God how does it make you act like God does in his kingdom he said now what does God do in his kingdom it's Holiness righteousness purity of thought purity of mind power and love amen going to the Lost Healing The Sick performing Miracles doing great things then to the world you look crazy and they say them guys are off at their head but you're a citizen of the Kingdom hey man what is it it's a kingdom of lambs it's a kingdom of lands what'd he say fear not little flock fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom you must come into the kingdom as a lamb the only way Jesus could take on his kingship the only way he could take on his authority is by going to Calvary he had to become a lamb in order to become a lion when John signed he say he saw the lion of the tree he said the lion of the tribe of Judah have prevailed and he looked for a lion but he saw a lamb a lamb is it had been slain why was it a sacrificial lamb is the entrance to the kingdom he said I'm the door of the Sheepfold don't you realize you are a little flock you're sheep you're Lambs and it is God's good pleasure it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom as a lamb oh my God imagine what it must have been like the representative of Rome yeah standing oh my with his Regal robes on him his white toga his tunic standing there it would be so clean that someone could be killed for stepping on it he had not touched an unclean person he was shaved he was hair was cut he was standing there a representative of Roman power and Roman Authority yeah standing there with all of his might with the symbols of Rome behind him the great the great lines of Rome the great Eagles Insignia of Rome behind him and they dragged a little man in front of him that didn't look like a leader so brother Brandon said about him they didn't look like a leader they dragged him in front of him and he had been beaten he'd been up all night as they dragged him from trial to trial six different trials that they dragged him to in 24 hours they dragged him to the to the trials and they began to beat him and they begin to do all those things to him and they brought him before Pilate standing there bleeding standing there quiet and the representative of Rome says are you a king are you a king he said you're testifying that oh my God they stood and faced one another pilate knowing that he would be recalled to Rome and lose his authority if the Jews rioted again three times while he was there the the Jews rioted and when they would Riot they would actually they would actually send letters because he had superiors in Syria that would send letters back to Rome and they would say pilate's not doing a good job and pilate had worked all of his life to reach this point he'd been Governor now for three or four or five or six years he'd been Governor he was only governor for 10 years but that's actually a long time by Governor standards but he had done everything that he could do to remain in power so when he got back to Rome he could have a great estate a great retirement he did everything that he could do to remain in power and he was not going to let this even though his life warned him even though he knew him being a heathen but he knew that Jesus wasn't guilty he had a decision to make all of his life he made decisions based on power what would he do now here he stood the representative of the Roman system the representative of the Kingdom of Heaven they stood facing one another that is still the case today yes brother Branham taught us that he said the crucial hour is here again what is it crucify them crucify him we can't all make them all methodists we can't make them all Baptists we can't make them all Oneness and make them all Trinity we can't make them all this out of the other but we can have a council or you disagree as far as the East is from the West the whole thing is wrong it's a satellite to Rome it's part of that it's why they operate the way that they do oh Church that's that system it's not the people it's not the people's good people in there but they're under a Roman system pilate was probably a pretty good guy deep down but he's been raised under this Roman system so now as an individual I'm going to ask you what will you do with this anointed word you stand in Pilot's Hall this morning you stand with the with with the choice to follow the word and to keep the word alive or to crucify the word every day we stand in those Straits as an individual he said I'm going to ask you what will you do with this anointed word which is the Christ the word that was promised for this day you as an individual pilate never got it off his hands you know that he screamed cried every scheme he could do he failed to do it pilate finally made a decision because the tumult of the people cried and crucified he wanted to let him go he wanted to get right with God yeah yeah but he waited yeah yeah he waited just a little bit too long he said crucify him I'll have another opportunity but he never would and the thing is he lost his governance over that he thought he'd prevent a riot and in just a few short years there was another Riot and he ended up back in Rome and then being exiled they believed to France and brother Branham said that there was still a pool that bubbled blue in Switzerland actually there's a mountain called palatis which is the mountain that uh that that they say that pilate died on and there's a pool of water that bubbles blue at a certain time of year or so the legend goes because that's where pilate committed suicide mother said he never could get the blood off his hands never could get it off his hands he couldn't even be a successful Governor why because he had chosen he had chosen the Roman system he never did get it off his hands he screamed and cried never scheme he could do but brother Brown said he is on your hands it works this time the Bible is preached the Holy Ghost has identified it any sinful man he said I Dare You To Say It Isn't So the Holy Ghost in these last days and the words that's been spoke said it would come to pass and here it is right before us don't try to do it he said don't let your end be like pilate he should have accepted him in his heart that's the only way you can get him off your hands is to take him in your heart oh my God all that is left a Pontius Pilate is a single Stone with his name on it that is all the physical evidence that they found of Pontius Pilate who had such great dreams is a single Stone to let us know he actually existed or let them know don't believe the word few small coins with this picture on them but the kingdom kingdom of God the kingdom of heaven he said what's left of Jesus Kingdom you are you are and one day we will crown him king of kings and Lord of lords there's coming a day when he will rise up in power and majesty and he'll and he'll rule with a rod of iron but on this Earth We're still Lambs we're still a kingdom of lambs we're still a kingdom that follows our King the kingdom of the wolf and the eagle is broken apart and gone if you go to Rome today and look at the Coliseum or look at the other buildings you'll find they're broken down and they're only a monument to what was if the Lord carries someday a miracle be in that same position yes we think we're so great we can stand behind this American System but if you look in the context of History we're a Young Nation and we're going down faster than other nations did this the end of this country is nothing but but but but debris and and smoke and Flame even the whole Earth itself will be burnt off the elements will melt with fervent heat that's the end of the world but the kingdom of the Lamb will be Eternal the kingdom of the Lamb is the same yesterday today and forever yes when the angel come to Mary as I'm closing musicians go ahead and come the angel come to Mary and he spoke to him and said his name will be called Jesus said he shall be great it shall be called the son of the highest the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David yeah and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end well I'm so glad I serve an eternal Kingdom they called Rome the Eternal City but Rome can't even keep its garbage picked up they call Rome the Eternal City but it's just a filthy place with all kinds of sin in it but there is a city amen that he's going to prepare for you and I there is a sea that'll settle down on this Earth one day and

Bow your head's with me what will you let your life be run by prejudice hate it's like for somebody a desire to get ahead doing everything you can to move up there's some admirable qualities to that when it comes to our American System getting ahead a man that doesn't work shouldn't eat it has to work and he has to Humble himself to be able to do that to work we shouldn't eat maybe people can't get ahead but many people find ways to it's a good thing it's a good thing to be a self-made man you can't do that in the Kingdom of the Kingdom of Heaven we don't even get to pick our field of service [Music] we don't we just do what the what he tells us we try to do it our own way we end up in trouble the king is merciful today aren't you glad he's a merciful King maybe you've not been as much a lamb as you should be I I know every every day I I talk to God say Lord make me a lamb make me a lamb it's easy to get caught up in yourself whatever ability that you have person doesn't have to have much ability to be extremely proud of it don't get caught up in that let your life be a surrender to God become a child of the Lamb still I don't understand the message I don't understand everything about it just surrender to the lamb let Christ the holy spirit in you guide you and lead you he will lead you into all truth let him work in your life would you do that this morning
