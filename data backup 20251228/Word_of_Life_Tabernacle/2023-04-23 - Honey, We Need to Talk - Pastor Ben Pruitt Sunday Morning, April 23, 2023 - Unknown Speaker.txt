have brother Seth coffee and brother Solomon Huffman with us this morning God bless you guys Happy my little Amen Corner over there on the side and and y'all just make yourself at home uh brother Steph's going to be preaching for us tonight brother Solomon's going to greet the people too and I'll just leave that up to y'all y'all can talk about how much time by the Solomon gets there so if you want to give him five minutes or 30 minutes and go ahead but we appreciate having them to both ministers we've we've had Brothers Seth here a couple of times and what a blessing he's been here the times he's been here before and I'm thankful they come out of the woods this morning to come to church so glad to have him today do you love the Lord I know I already asked that but nobody said amen so ask it one more time do you love the Lord amen I believe you do or you wouldn't be in church this morning Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 10. read down through verse 16. I want us to pay close attention to the word this morning not that you don't anyway but there's just some things I'd like to say and and we want to get all the way through it I don't want to I don't want to get distracted or get you thinking about something else we need to think spiritually and not carnally today but I'd like to title my sermon today honey we need to talk I know that's a little bit odd but you just bear with me and we'll get to it Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 10. it says we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore Jesus also we might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate he said let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually you want to do that this morning continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices it's a sacrifice God is well pleased pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated I was pleased with the wedding yesterday as well I thought things went real smoothly and praying the best for that young couple there's no words I don't think that are more dreaded by a man than to hear his wife say honey we need to talk now you just be honest this morning I I think that's probably true because so many times we don't know what we did and and yet nothing good happens in a in a in a partnership in a marriage in a business in a church without communication in fact the Bible tells us that by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God by the communication of God to the Earth and you know his thoughts were always there the thoughts of God are Eternal how many know that his thoughts are eternally they were always there but it was not his thoughts that produced a son it was not his thoughts that produced an earth it was not his thoughts but it was his word which is his thought expressed so it is not by you are not healed by just the thought of God but you are healed by the expression of God in the word he sent his word and healed them aren't you glad he talked aren't you glad he communicated with you and he caused you to be able to understand that's what the message of the hour is in our days of communication of God to us he talked to us he said honey we need to have a talk and and it was not us talking to him it was him speaking in this age and saying we need to talk and he come down in my situation in your situation into the part of the world that you were in and said we need to talk and when he did what happened he began to communicate to us how much he loves us and what our future home will be and everything about he began to communicate with us all the things we needed to know to get out of here aren't you glad for that today God communicating his thoughts she glad he didn't just sit there and take it yes well I I think healing I'm so glad that he said I know the thoughts that I have towards you and he didn't stop there thoughts of peace thoughts of healing to give you an expected end he tells us what the thoughts are that's right he doesn't just leave us with thoughts and we believe we are a thought of God we're in his thoughts but that's not where it ends we become a manifestation which is what a word is is a manifestation of thought oh you might say well I I spoke without thinking but that's technically impossible you just didn't think correctly before he spoke so Paul is telling the people he said two things to do good and communicate right do good that's that's pretty self-explanatory and he said communicate and the word communicate is in the scripture is Koinonia it's an important uh Greek word in the New Testament it speaks of sharing participation it speaks of commonality solidarity shared responsibility among households or individuals so it's more than just speech but it's it's a sharing of words or a sharing of finances or sharing of ideas or sharing of suffering the Bible speaks of all kinds of different types of Koinonia and so it speaks of a shared conviction a mutual responsibility a mutual status sharing of resources and so here in uh here in the Scripture it speaks of when it speaks of this Koinonia it's talking about two people that are communicating in such a way that they can they they can work together and that's what the church is supposed to be that's what a house is supposed to be it's not one-sided it's two people both sharing with one another and producing something for some purpose for some uh for some a goal that they share together and so in in this case Paul is talking about Koinonia that the Saints in the Greek world the Saints in in the Philippians and the Saints in the Corinthians they had to share with the Jerusalem believers they had to share their resources because they had money and the Jerusalem Believers were in a drought and so they took up an offering and they shared with them just like we do today when we share with the Believers of Malawi or we share with the believer in sin that the Philippines you all have done that before or in Africa somewhere we're giving something to them because we we're sharing we're communicating with them and they let us know and I'll ask the brothers what are the needs that you have and they'll say well we need this and that and and we'll present the need to the church and and then we share with them of our abundance yeah all right so that's Koinonia sharing one of the meanings now Paul writes to the Philippians and he uses this word in Philippians 4. now he's just written to the Philippians from prison from prison and he tells him rejoice in the lord always yeah again I say rejoice he he writes to them and he says he he says whatever things are good whatever things are lovely you all know the scripture Philippians 4 but he goes on after he says that writing again from from a prison house and he's communicating with them about their communication with him and I wonder if this epistle had would ever have been written had they not communicated with him and let him know that they were still there and the way that they did that by what was by sending him money has actually happened that they sent him basically a care package or money or some some way of this or maybe food but they sent him resources so he could be able to live because he was in prison and they wanted him to be cared for while he was there so they were sharing with him I hope I'm not boring you this morning but we need to understand these things we we do you may not think that you do but you do I do too they were sharing with one another and so he says in verse 10 but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly aren't you glad you can Rejoice even in prison aren't you glad that your circumstances don't they don't don't take your praise away when your circumstances go down so JT you might end up in the hospital but you still there's something about you you can there's still a worship there to God God I'm in pain but you're still worthy I'm hurting but you're still worthy of my praise so he said your care he said I Rejoice that your care has flourished again so they had given in the past he said now they're giving again he said we're in you were also careful what he means by that is that you cared about the situation but you lacked opportunity he said not that I speak in respect of want now remember he's riding from prison yes I love this he said I have learned in whatever state I am there was to be content whatever state I'm in I want to be content don't you and he's speaking again from prison he's in a rotten fested hole in the ground and he's writing to the people and he says I can do all things look at verse 12. I can do or verse 13 rather all things somebody could send him into that today I can do all things he was in prison people thought he was crazy Paul what are you doing right and I can do all things when you're in prison you don't even have two coats you don't have anything people have forsaken you all over the world people have turned against the messenger the hour people don't how can you say I can do all things he wasn't talking about himself but he said through Christ which strengtheneth me I believe this morning that you and I can say I can do all things I can do all things regardless of circumstance regardless of where I'm at in my life and how much money I do or don't have in my bank account I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me he said notwithstanding you have well done he said it's not because I needed it that I'm writing this to you but I'm thanking you he said that you did communicate with my affliction you communicated you showed me you cared I got that letter I got that card I got that that gift I I could have lived without it but you showed me you cared old church if we could only learn to communicate like that it's not all about the gift itself but it's the thought behind it you've heard that many times but yet it it's really true it's communication he said now you Philippians know also but in the beginning of the Gospel when I departed from Macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but she only yeah he said for even in thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity not because I desire a gift but I desire fruit that may abound to your account they were in communion with him so when they saw he had a need they were in communication they saw he had a need they were in Koinonia so they communicated by giving to that need now I want us to go all the way back to the beginning well those are scary words when a preacher says them aren't they because anytime a preacher starts in Genesis Anything Could Happen but I want us to go all the way back to the beginning we're going to read Genesis 2 18. but I want you to think about Adam for a moment because Adam was living the single life right he had everything going good for him and I've been thinking about marriage because the young couple that's gotten married and other young couples that have gotten married recently most of them aren't here this morning but you're here and no matter how long you've been married then you still need to learn to communicate with each other and and in the beginning that that God see Adam was alone he was single if you're single this morning uh we content in that state right you don't have to you know amen my mother says well praise the Lord so be content in that state so anyway it's uh boy that threw me I'm trying to get her married off and here she is but I said it's still the truth anyway if you're single be content but now and but he had the perfect setup think about it yeah Adam had the perfect setup but he had no one to communicate with yeah and you might say well if it was just me and God we get along pretty good I don't need a church I don't need a wife I don't need a family it'd just be me and God we'll see how well that went for Adam yeah the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone and will make him a help meet for him now and I'll watch that verse 19 out of the ground the Lord God formed every Beast to the field every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle into the fowl of the air to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him I want you to think deep for a moment what did Adam need help with think about it he was able to speak and things would appear what did he need help with he didn't have any laundry there were no dishes to wash that we know of we know he didn't have any laundry so it wasn't like there was big piles of laundry all over the garden and God looks down and says Adam needs help right it wasn't that couldn't be that so now it wasn't bad it was not dishes but listen to what brother Brandon says he said before he made man he called himself see God has a right to name himself right he called himself Eli Elohim he said the word means in the Hebrew the self-existence all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence there ever was self-existence one El Ila Elohim means the all-sufficient all-powerful almighty self-existent one you know we could call him the single God the unmarried God right the single God but he had everything right but he did not have communication oh God look and in Genesis 2 he said when he made man he said I am y-a-h-u-j-u-v-u-h Yahweh Jehovah what did it mean I am the all self-existence one now watch I'm the all-existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine to be a temporary or an amateur little one of mine I love that you don't learn that down at the Baptist Church so now the self-existent hello him said I'm going to create something off of myself the quietest morning but you're listening I like it watch it easy eating something off of himself he's making of himself the self-existent God he made something a little God all right so it's no longer Elohim oh my Elohim is his self-existing name Jehovah or Yahweh whatever that however that was pronounced in the Old Testament that that was his name of God but now in in in this time his name is Jesus that's his his bridegroom name it's Jesus now he gave man to be he said Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made man an amateur God so he isn't self-existence anymore I love this he's not single no more it's not without a family anymore he exists with his family Eli Eli Elohim he said now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family he said now God made man to be the predominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion he said is that scripture then if that's his domain he was God over the Earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so he did not need help with washing the dishes he did not need help with washing the baseboards or keeping the house oh my remember the dual covenant didn't exist till after Eden right where she would take care of the home he would take care of the field and work at the sweat of his brow and she would take care of the home and children would be born in sorrow but they would work we found that out not long ago where the brand who said Heaven is a real place just like this he said we work and he said but there's no toil in it no anxious toil and so the work that we have would be different because there's no anxiety in that work but now that's the way his work was in the Garden of Eden so what does he need what did he need help with he was lonely he needed somebody to talk to then we shouldn't complain when our wives want to talk literally what they were made to do yeah yeah that's called positive effect to you young preachers you know think about it for a minute shouldn't complain about that he was lonely he needed something yeah yeah so God removed the feminist part from Adam which was unexpressed because brother Brown said he wasn't like what we have today a man don't know if he's a woman or a man but he he was expressed it in a certain form and God removed the feminist part and then the feminine part become the woman and he was the masculine the man now what did he need partnership fulfillment because by dividing only God can divide one substance and make more of it than what it was in the original that's that's the way to understand the godhead by the way only God can do that so now Adam now Adam had not did not need anything done he needed somebody yeah see and the same thing goes with your spiritual walk with God you can't come to God saying I need this done I need that done I need that I need this I need that but you come to God Lord I need you I want you I want communion with you I want partnership with you I don't want things I don't want gifts I want the giver and then he'll give gifts he'll do things but I don't want the things foreign my wife always jokes with me and tells me that she married me for my money that is a joke but really I think she wanted me because there wasn't much else that I had to offer of my job at Burger King are you with me now it wasn't a whole lot I I saw that she would be a good mother and I saw she would be a good housekeeper and I saw all of those things but that's not what I really wanted what I really wanted was her what she really what you really want from God what do you want today if you approach God and say well I want healing I want I want this I want my life to go better what do you want from God you should want him I want you I need you I don't need anything else no if the only reason you get married is to satisfy lust or to have someone to do chores around the house or to have someone to protect you from danger or make you better off financially it will end in divorce most of the time why you think about this was an incredibly strong marriage that God performed in the Garden of Eden because it survived the worst thing that can happen to a marriage the worst thing and Adam stayed with his wife now why did he not put her away no we know that we know what he did right we know that Adam did not put her away that he went out with her we know that he was her Redeemer in that sense and yet he could not die for her because he had sinned as well but we know what he did but but why why look at Genesis 2 21 the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the Flesh and stood thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and he brought her to the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed think about that now they had complete Koinonia with one another that complete Fellowship nothing was hidden everything was right remember when Jesus was tempted by the Pharisees they come to him and said is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting him Mark 10 2. and he answered and said it to them what did Moses command you they said Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce but to put her away and Jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female counterparts right one is not whole without the other for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God had joined together let not man put asunder he's describing to you why Adam did what he did because God joined them as one flesh he could not tear off Eve without getting rid of a part of himself so when he fell he fell with her but when the second Adam came and he died for our sins and he rose again on the third day when he raised we raised with him we could not be separated from him Hallelujah now tells us all of that I don't have time to read the quotes this morning but listen don't you see what Jesus did he communicated yeah with our sufferings he participated what was Adam doing he was communicating he was in a Koinonia with Eve and they had to go out together Jesus participated he didn't remain God in heaven but he changed his mask he changed his form and he came down and communicated with our sufferings he condescended he became us so we could become him and what God joined together let no man separate what God joined together no preacher can separate what God batting his thoughts and expressed in his word let no man put asunder we don't have a right to mess with the word and we don't have a right to mess with God's people we cannot take them out of the I didn't put you in I can't take you out if you were in the mind of God what can separate you from that kind of a love nothing stay with me this morning nothing what can who will separate us from the love of Christ nothing what God joined together let no man put asunder I heard I read in the message where brother man told the story about the couple fighting you remember the story they're about to get a divorce they're fighting and fussing they go up the attic they're divided everything they go up to the Attic they didn't have nothing in common it seemed like but they go and they start taking stuff out there had been a little baby born that died in childbirth and they found a little a pair of baby shoes and they both grabbed for it when they did they realized they had something in common you can't separate that right that's us that's we we that that's our Unity brought that to pass there's there's no way to separate it what God joined together let no man put asunder we have things in common that's why there's such a danger when you begin to have fewer and fewer things in common and I'm preaching to you older couples this morning because many times when the kids leave the house you begin to find remember brother Perry green said years ago there were so many times what happened is when the kids leave the house the parents discover they hate one another because they were so busy during the time the kids were there that they never spent any time they had nothing in common yeah they were just chauffeurs for the children and we should be wary of that marriage needs communication you've got to have things in common oh my you see the amazing thing I love the story of Adam and Eve because the amazing thing about them is not that they fell apart or that they fell but that they stayed together afterwards now they were dependent on one another they had separate covenants hers was childbearing this was worse if they were going to get along they had to learn to communicate with one another for the first time she had to ask him to take out the trash they didn't have laundry before but now they did right they didn't have any trouble in Eden with those things imagine what that must have felt like to Adam the first time trash I'm an amateur God I'm I could eat and I could speak man when I was single I could hunt anytime I wanted to I could huh but you're not now Adam now you got separate Covenants now you're living at home and how there's laundry to do now there's dishes to do now there's help that needs to be between the two the communication you realize the church is the same way it'll just run off and do our own thing yeah right we need each other we communicate with each other we've got to we've got to because what God puts together let's not tear it apart placed you here in the church and we want you to be here if God has placed you here then don't Don't just run off doing your own thing but stay a part of what's going on try to try to try to be a part of of the furtherance of the ministry of the church and when the church rejoices you rejoice when the church suffers you suffer we're being a part of so so proud so many of you showed up to the wedding what are you doing it's not your wedding it's not related to many of you but you showed up why because it's a part of you yeah there's two types of people you should never marry should never marry an unbeliever you know the Bible teaches that right should never marry an unbeliever second Corinthians 6 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers we'll read the rest of that and the next verses in a minute but the Bible said no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances this goes to my kids if nobody else right they're not old enough to get married here another 20 years or so they will be no believer should ever marry an unbeliever there are no circumstances should always marry Believers he said brother Ben I Married An unbeliever well God has Grace and I've seen it work out but it doesn't change the word no believer should ever marry an unbeliever because you always there always be problems in the home you should wait if that person comes into the church you should wait until that believer has been sealed by the Holy Ghost I don't mean that they danced at camp or they jumped around a little bit they got excited I love that I believe in that but that's not being born again right you could have two people have the same sensation the same emotion one God at the other didn't watch their life what kind of Life do they have and what kind of a what kind of thing that's the thing brother random the standard that I can see that brother Branham held for his children was not so much how they dated and or how they corded if that's the right word we get all involved in how things are done but Branham is much more interested in who if you look he's much more interested in who and then when you find that who that person even let George and Rebecca get engaged but he wouldn't let him get married because he didn't have the Holy Ghost and when he did then it was it's time to get married right because you can't you can't just put people together that don't have similar don't have similar tastes don't have similar desires and you cannot have the desires of God without the Holy Ghost second Corinthians 6 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion there's that word again Koinonia that's light with Darkness yeah what Concord hath Christ with Belial what part has he that believeth with an Infidel what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God you're filled with the Holy Spirit you're sealed away into the presence of God what how can you have fellowship with an eye an idolater God has said I would dwell in him and walk in him I will be their God they should be my people you say I'm already in a relationship like that where my husband or my wife doesn't believe then you should do everything you can to be a good husband and a good wife and by the comp by your lifestyle they can be one that's what the scripture says but yet you cannot join in the idolatry yeah until the sanctuary has been cleansed Idol's removed the holy spirit in Residence the temple will continue to be taken right and it needs a rebirth it needs a cleansing oh every one of us do today if you're born in sin shape and iniquity come in the world speaking lies you need the Holy Ghost do we believe that today do you love the Lord this morning see we will be the product of the nature and nurture of our genes until the Holy Spirit begins to rule in our life and then he doesn't take those away but he overrules them right that's why when you would do something you'd do something that was wrong in the Holy Spirit if he's on in Residence and you haven't grieved him he's there to tell you no don't do that right and a Christian stops right and listens to the leading of the Holy Spirit and those who walk in the spirit won't fulfill the lust of the flesh so we will be the product of our of our upbringing and our genes man that Gene thing's a problem but Andrew touched on that while he was here I believe it was brother Andrew that preaches on that that's a real problem isn't it because if you go looking at your family I've had two phone calls recently of second cousins of mine who were looking because they found because I did my DNA and put it on ancestry.com and there was there's people on there that found me and I've had two calls from second cousins who don't know who their father is wanting to find their father and they're my age and but they're second cousins of mine and I got to thinking about that and I thought oh God what would that be without your grace what would I be without your love I'm not better in my own flesh than anybody else but God by the by his grace brought me to this place by his grace if you're here this morning you're not better than anybody else you may have failed spectacularly Paul said such were some of you but you've been lost you've been Sanctified you've been washed by the blood of the Lamb yes you should not be all in the moly grubs about what you were but you should be excited and worshipful and praising God for what you are today this nature that we have the Bible calls it carnality carnality First Corinthians 3 1 said our Brethren could not speak unto you as in the spiritual but as in the carnal even as in the babes in Christ fed you with milk and not with meat for you are not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able you're yet carnal whereas there's among you envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men see how different this is from the Philippian church that he wrote to and said hey I want to thank you for having communion with my sufferings communicating with me and here's this carnal Church no communication right right because they're they're divided among themselves he said you're carnal you see you must receive the spirit and then walk in at Galatians 5 16 this I say then walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust or the desire of the flesh but the Brown says today and I want to read this quote this this is it but it's a rather lengthy quote but this is I want to get to this and we'll close this morning now brother Randall said people today a lot of modernists believe that the days of Miracles are passed we don't believe that do we don't believe there is such a thing as a miracle but yet I believe the world is full of Miracles the Lord whether we're going to preach on miracles on on Wednesday night because that's a gift of the spirit he said the world is full of Miracles he said I believe the Paradox is constantly he said for instance I believe that every born-again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves I believe each one of you Methodist and Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost was in some formal Church it did not believe in the genuine New Birth has now received the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox look at your neighbor if you have one this morning and say you're a perfect example of a paradox you're a miracle something that cannot be explained Hallelujah he said unless that happens you cannot be a Christian there must be a paradox for you to become a Christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and give him New Birth outside of God God Alone is the only one can do it that's why all the counseling that we can do over and over and over again and I'm happy to do it that's what I'm here for I'll do it over and over and over I'll be glad to do it but all the counseling I can do can only take you so far if you're not born again all the teaching that we can do how to conduct yourself in your home how to do all that all the teaching that we can do will only take you so far and I'll tell you what I don't think much of your experience if you can't communicate yeah right right hear me Church I said but I cried I wept I I spoke in tongues but can you communicate and I don't mean are you good at it I mean are you willing it's not are you fluent are you willing are you willing to talk to one another as a husband in life are you willing to communicate with God are you willing to communicate with the church it's I'm a Christian I just haven't found anybody I can get along with you need to check your experience I'm a Christian I found no church that I can be a part of you need to check your experience I'm a Christian but I I just can't my wife you know I love Jesus but I hate my wife you can't do that it's literally impossible right and vice versa as well God's got to change that spirit do I know I have the baptism the Holy Ghost you need a refilling today fill you with love a baptism of Love brother Brown calls it yes where you can love your neighbor love your enemy even if that enemy lives in the house with you God Alone is the only one can do it and it's a miracle how that God could take a man's thinking in his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it now you do understand that not everything changes at once so a person might get born again and those desires now his desires are of God but yet his ways are untrained remember the Bible says train up a child in the way he should go and the way he should go in the original that's according to his bent right the child has a certain dent because when he's talking about training which I was speaking of a bow and he's talking about that they would use a certain type of wood for a bow and the wood would be burnt would be bent a certain way and you wouldn't try to turn it against the bent but you would use it with the bent of the wood right and so you have to deal with your children like because God made them a certain way and God made you a certain way allowed you to come up a certain way but when you received the Holy Ghost it doesn't it doesn't immediately it doesn't immediately cause you to just be perfect in every way but what it does is such new desires and you begin to learn new behaviors and and you don't have that stubbornness that you did you don't have that that unbelief that you did and that Pride that you did that was keeping it away from you but every time you hear the word preach and it begins to wash over you you begin to conform to it you begin to conform to it and slowly God Heats it up the wood he heats up the wood and he heats up the wood and he bends it and he bids he ever seen him work with iron or work a blacksmith work with iron what's he doing he gets it hot and he pounds on it a while and he gets it hot and he pounds on it a while what's God doing to us all through our Christian wall he gets us he Heats us up real good puts us in Revival and then he pounds on us a while yeah and then evangelist comes by we're getting Revival then the pastor pounds on us for a while but what's he doing yeah he's making some and he's got to get the clay to cooperate where he wants it to go but without the Holy Ghost it'll never cooperate amen amen it'll try to go along for a while and then it'll fall back because it just can't do it now watch he said only God can do it change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it he said for instance a few days ago I was called in on a scene a little something going on there's a fine young man a very fine boy I was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family this boy all of a sudden come up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away we don't do that from our marriage from our home in this case it was just he'd promised somebody to take her out and didn't we don't do that yeah yeah we don't treat people like that right he failed to communicate he said oh just a little deal my kid man he was raised right he's okay but you watch those things yeah you watch for a pattern of that right I don't know about you I know what's in my family so I'll watch for those things show up in my kids because they're just before they're converted they're just unconverted me and my wife mixed together plus passed on genes that may have skipped my generation that's a problem so so what are you gonna do you you failed to communicate it seems like a little thing he went he took what happened is what what I've been told is that he he went to church he was going to take one girl to church with him and he took another girl and failed to tell the first one brother said he did something wrong to the little girl and as much as promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it some of you guys I'm gonna get myself in trouble some of y'all buy new vehicles without talking to your wife and I'm not saying you sinned but listen what if that over and over if you do that over and over you're not communicating yeah boy got quiet must have been a lot of that going on brother JT you failed to communicate now if your wife gave you per I gave you permission but really I mean come on you're one flesh tell her about that new bow I had him up until then and tell him about that new gun if you can't tell them about it you shouldn't buy it same thing with the wife I can't tell him about them Amazon purchase you shouldn't buy it now brother remember he did something wrong to the little girl as much as promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do it just wasn't in him to do it and the father and mother called me to the scene said we would desire to know what is wrong with our boy he said now it's not easy to do sometime but you must be truthful and honest he said therefore the boy was a Christian as far as a Believer he had repented and had been baptized had his position among the Believers but yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter how much he thought he had he said you thinking you have and having it it's two different things you might be able to try to say you have you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump run sensation speaking in tongues or shouting or whatever you might lay it upon which is all right he said I believe in all that too but unless your life copes with your testimony you haven't got it yes hey man he said because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them so now this young fellow's parents his mother is German no reflection on the German but there's a strain in that family I got a little bit of German in our family and many of you do it's common here in the U.S but it's not just Germans and again not all Germans are this way but it was strain in that family there's a strain in certain families and that shouldn't offend Us by the way it's just the way it is everybody's got something but Harvey some of us are just cheap and it's praise the lord it's just just a strain that runs in our family right and I don't think brother Harvey's offended maybe the way I said it I'm sorry for the Harvey but but you know what you know that you know that it's just you watch and you have you have more in the end because of that right some people just say wait some people like to buy like to spend money that strain runs in my family knows what I'm talking about you see that new car up at the Toyota place that new van man you want it you want it and so you you find a way to get it and some of us like to spend money and it's a strain again we shouldn't be offended by that it's just the way it is but we have to watch that make sure it doesn't contradict the word because when it does we want Christ to correct that in our lives we want the word to correct that now brother runs through the restraint on that family now if you you all know the story I've talked to you about it before this is Brother Brandon's brother and sister-in-law he doesn't say that publicly because they still went to his church the boy would be his his nephew and you kind of see it when he explains it he said that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face he's talking now about his mother's family he said this girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister I've come down the street many morning this young lady be sitting on the yard and I say good morning to you and she just look at me we run into a strain of that in Egypt not among the Believers because some of them at least have been converted but the people there and some of you have been in those Arab countries know what I'm talking about they just look at you yeah yeah they can't they don't let if they understand English and many of them do they don't want nothing to do with you and in some parts of the world are like that it's just a strain and so he'd say she'd just look at me and and I'd stop and I'd say sure a fine morning she'd just stand look right at you an intelligent woman he said I'd say come up see us sometime she just stand and look well her brothers are that way father and mothers that way he said now the father of the boy is strictly an Irishman this is Brother Brandon's side of the family Moody and high temperate High Strung he said that's his whole family like that except one other out of the family converted yeah he said this father and mother both are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the Lord and now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old something along their very fine kid he's been a real model boy at home nice kid he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girls the mother's family lives close to a fine Church and we've seen this heavenly he said but do you think they'd ever come over there no they know it's right he said but when he says close to the he's about to say close to the Tabernacle he said they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning they just won't do it just not in them he said now the jeans and the father and the mother at this point no matter how much they are converted Still Remains the flesh that's been integrated out to this boy therefore the boy's got a complex in him just like from his mother's family they're not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where that boy stands now watch he said he should never get married until he has the Holy Spirit because he would never communicate with a wife in a way that will allow them to have a Christian home he might never hit her he might be a good provider but he will never say I'm sorry he can't make that sacrifice it pleases God oh God he'll never say I forgive you I find many times the problem among men and this is not always the case but many times among men the problem is saying I'm sorry and among women it's saying I forgive you I forgive you it's hard isn't it it's hard to forgive it's easy to forgive when the wrong that's done to you is something Petty right it's harder to forgive when it's real yeah when it's like Corey ten Boom who stood there and watched this they those German guards killed her sister hard to forgive yeah it's hard to forgive someone who did something terribly vile to you or to your family it's hard to forgive but Jesus didn't leave us any outs he said when you stand praying forgive and if you don't forgive you won't be forgiven it's easy to say I forgive you when it's simple what if it's not but that's the problem many times you can't say I'm sorry you can't say I forgive you so you can't have a Christian home the way it ought to be because you can't do it you need the Holy Spirit I said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up I said now look at you out of your family all them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting so forth I said now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people just sit there won't speak very independent irreverent to religion I said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers you're sweet kind and forgiving so the parents had the Holy Spirit he said what does that your tree part of that family tree yet you've received the Holy Ghost he said that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives in you I said let me that be my testimony today it's not my people anymore it's not the Prudence or or the taxes it's not my people but it's Christ yeah yeah forgive me Mama tell a story on our family we were mom was telling me some stories and and she wrote a letter to one time to find her grandfather because she I guess she'd never met him she's 16 years old she wrote a letter to the Texas state highway patrol to find him and they wrote back and said if you do find him let us know I thought he was a cattle wrestler but I'm not my people anymore how many can say Amen to that this morning I'm not my people anymore I belong to God I'm a part of his family tree my family tree has Abraham in it who believes God it was imputed to him for righteousness my family tree has David in it who send me yet he was a man after God so hard and he repented quickly my family tree has Jesus in it amen this child I belong to him you love him today do you believe that today my family tree is the acts of the of the Apostles amen where they did signs and wonders and miracles that's where I belong that's my family tree I'm not my people anymore it's Christ that lives in you amen I said to the boy look at your family practically all them drunks and so forth said how moody and high temper and high stroma but you're not you're kind forgiving God help us today my grandpa had a son they didn't care if he existed and my grandpa was a good man we had that strain in his family my grandpa and my dad's side I had a son who didn't care if he existed didn't care and the son ended up becoming becoming living a homosexual lifestyle and leaving his dad wouldn't bail him out of jail when he's young I don't say whether it's right or wrong but he just wouldn't have nothing more to do with him and he got in a little trouble it caused all kinds of problems in his life but I'm not my people anymore I'm being open and honest with you today because I want you to think about your own life your own family not my people anymore he said you know more what you are he said I said now that same thing has to happen to your son the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ water baptism in the pool said I know my son has come to Christ I said that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a Believer with the Believers but until he has regenerated born again I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's spread between father and mother yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it but he can't do it he'll never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect Paradox when a man is born of the spirit of God Hallelujah he said I've seen critics stand off and make fun and carry on of a holy ghost Revival and after a while god get a hold of that same man and change him and here he stands right in the Pulpit preaching the same thing he once hated it's a paradox now that God can take the unbeliever make a Believer out of him he said I wonder if a man thinks that Miracles is passed I wonder what kind of a scientific medicine you could give such a person to change that disposition in them listen they don't need scientific medicine they need the Holy Ghost right take that he said take that hatred in Malice and strife out there's no one can explain it but it's a paradox because it's a miracle of God when a man has changed from the person that he is to a new creature in Christ Jesus he becomes a new creation he is no more what he used to be he is absolutely a new creation in Christ let me be that new creation let me be that new creation like Adam was when Adam and Eve come together and he said she is Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bones who else will I communicate with I'll communicate with her or aren't you glad God's that way the Bible says if any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away all things are passed away behold all things have become new all things have become new is that your testimony today old things are passed away behold all things someone say old things this morning all things have become new you have that testimony today all things have become new honey we need to talk find yourself you can't communicate your marriage will suffer you can't continue like that and I'll think spiritually for a moment what if you can't communicate with your lord what have you never talked to your communication only goes to the pastor he don't want it just to be through a third party there is one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus you don't want it just to be through your pastor you don't want it just to be through well I listen to tapes sometimes all right you need to talk to him yes you need to hear from him yes communicate communicate talk what were they doing on the road to Emmaus they were communicating with him he had to come down in a form that they didn't understand and they didn't know he said why are you so sad you see the husbands dad's God help me I feel like knocking myself in the head sometimes what are you doing recently walking along sad very sad the hurry we talked about that this morning what where are you sad way well you leave church with your face looking like that was there something said you watched at home all the time why why are things falling apart things aren't like they used to be well I don't know don't be don't bring an accusation why tell me tell me what you're struggling with tell me what you're going through I got teenagers I know the last person they ever want to talk to is their father but tell me tell me what you're going through I want to be available I want their mother to be available to him but tell them tell us what you're going through don't don't hide it don't do that don't I don't hide it don't hide it in the church you don't have to act good if you need help come to the altar you want to act good yeah paper it over don't put a fig leaf on standing in the garden with fig leaves on and God comes down to communicate with his children yeah yeah and begins to call Adam Adam where are you he didn't wait on Adam to come looking for him he never would have but he come looking for Adam what about it husbands we need to do that wife where are you children where are you Church where are you Paul said have that same care one for another were you in a Koinonia Fellowship where you can talk together where are you you always doing your own thing running off on your own you know your wife is going to suffer from it but you do it anyway yeah it's nonsense you need to come back to Christ come back to the word can live two separate lives and be a Christian marriage and that's what we want why why settle for less we can have the best we can have the best in the church we don't have to be like the Baptist or the Methodist they can have good things in their church that's wonderful but we can be the best why not do it this message just isn't long hair and long dresses and a husband who hunts and fishes that's not what this message is this message is communion yeah yeah communication God said I want to talk to you I want my bride to know what I'm thinking want you to Bow your heads with me before the musicians come this morning there where you're at for just a moment and I'll tell you when to come up I just want you to talk to the Lord if there's something you need to make right with your spouse you need to talk to them you promised God say I'll I'll take care of it I'll take care of it you hold you you stay with that promise because you really can't be right with God until you write with your brother your sister your spouse maybe the communication is broken down between you and God that's happened to me before huh we're human beings we're two-thirds unsaved and yet that Soul dominates Our Lives if you feel with the Holy Spirit but you think about it you have a body and a spirit there's still just the same old genes same old things why don't you talk to God just a moment Lord I want to communicate with you today I just want you to I want you to be the primary source of my strength I want you to I want I want to talk to you I want to be in such close communion that when your body has some need that I'll be quick to to fill it that's my desire church I want to pray with you and then we'll then we'll let the musicians come Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we sit here with our many husbands and wives Lord and some that are widows or some looking to be married some not some single Lord and some just serving you some children some teenagers Lord but they all have communication with you they should Lord I pray you'd help them to realize they can't really communicate with you like they should without the Holy Spirit would you just give them that Revelation today Lord if we've gotten hard or cold or distant or we want to be right we we want to be in love with you oh God I want to be in love with you I I don't want to live with a distance between us I don't want there to be no communication between me and you I want it to be right Lord I want to be like the ones on the road to Emmaus as you begin to talk they begin to talk and finally they saw you do something that you did before before your death and they knew it was you oh God I've seen that at this age we've seen it oh Lord help us to recognize it's you today oh God you've communicated with us in this age may we communicate back
