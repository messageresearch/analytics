the hospital I've been sick too but not like he had been I believe the Lord is just completely and so we're we're trusting that today and believing that and that that's the case amen I want to turn to the Book of Job Job chapter 29 I love technology job chapter 29 verse one moreover job continued his Parable and said oh that I were as in months past as in the days when God Pres preserved me when his candle shined upon my head when by his light I walked through Darkness as I was in the days of my youth when the secret of God was upon my Tabernacle when the almighty was yet with me when my children were about me when I washed my steps with butter and The Rock poured Me Out Rivers of oil I pray the Lord that His blessings to the word you may be seated oh that I was young oh to be young have you ever thought that like that oh to be as young as these guys and have that much energy and that kind of that kind of ability to put to the things of God oh to be young that's what job thought he said oh that I was young I I want to be young again in and yet we know that job was a great example of what we talked about this morning a suffering servant he's a great example of a servant of God who stuck with it who remained a servant of God who was who was somebody who was not shaken by the enemy Joel I can't hear myself out of these he he was not shaken by the enemy he was not shaken by uh things that would that would happen to him and and I want you to understand I want you young people to understand tonight bad things are going to happen life is not a Bed of Roses it's not going to be easy but you're going to make it you're you're going to make it you're going to be okay and and and it's not going to bring you down it's not going to take you out and and how do you know that because you can look at the example of job and you can look at the example of of others that you know and people even here in the church you can see that that thing this is not going to take take you down this is not going to be the end of your life this trial that you're going through this struggle I know it feels like that you're never going to make it and that this is the end of it and and you're never going to get any better and you're never going to get that girl to look at you and you're you're never going to you're never going to get a job and you're never going to be able to drive and you're never going to be able to do that but it's going to be okay you're going to make it because we made it and believe it or not we were young too once thanks trip oh that was him I blame trip we were young on we we we once we once we're young we once we scared to get up in front of people and sing and we we know what it's like to to make mistakes and we still make them but we've overcome we've made it and and you can look at the at the greatest person in the church and and and and with job the thing is with job was he was so such a man of integrity that God looked at job and and he and and he was proud of him in fact the Bible says that job was a he he was a man that uh that was perfect and upright in Job chapter 1 he was perfect and upright one that feared God and ASU evil so he was perfect and upright he says four things about him he was blameless he was upright he was reverent and he lived a holy life and you can't ask more of a man than that and God looked at him and said that's the kind of man he is and God's so proud of him that he goes to the devil and he said have you seen my servant job now you want to be recommended for promotion but how about being recommended for a trial job is in is such a good man he's such a man that God loves and and cares about so much that he actually recommends him and and and the thing is we look at job and we say well he he he made some mistakes he did some things that maybe he shouldn't have done and and and and yet he made it through all of that and we look at his trial and how he made it through his trial but what I want to know is how do I get so close to God that he actually says he can take it right he can take it he is he he is going to make it how do I get to a place where God trusts me so much that he says he's not going to give up is that what you want to be as as as young people when you get older because you're all getting older believe it or not you're going to get to our age you're going to get older if the Lord carries you're going to grow up and as you're growing up you want to be that person who doesn't quit you want to be that person who never gives up you want to be that person who stays in church even when everybody else leaves you be that person that doesn't leave right and how can you become that person how do I get from where I'm at and especially the older youth how do I get to from where I'm at to be that person how do I do that well you're going to have to be a servant of God you're going to have to be one that God can go speak to the devil about and say have you noticed job have you seen my servant job and then the Bible tells us in James 5:11 he said we count them happy which endure in other words the ones that make it he said you have heard of the patience of Job have seen the end of the Lord the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy so how do we get to be job how do we get to be job and let me make it a little bit more personal than that is everybody paying attention this afternoon come on let's make it a little bit more personal how do I get to be Danny Ward you boys how do I get to be girls how do I get to be Vicky where I want pick on them because they they're pillars in the church how do I get to be them you know they didn't get to be them by by just taking a pill of some kind of magic pill and then suddenly you become Danny Ward you just don't become that right you don't just become sister Vicki by and being such a blessing to the church by uh by everybody just doing everything for you there's some things you have to do you're going to have to make some decisions you're going to have to step up and and you're going to have to you're going to have to start becoming a person that will not turn your back on the word a person that notices the word and and wants to be and and maybe you don't understand everything but what you do understand you're going to stick with it you're you're going to make mistakes but if you'll remember the C your creator in the days of your youth while the evil days come not because I think all of us that are older especially you that are very much older than I am you can say I wish I was young again I wish I was I wish I had my strength but I wouldn't give up I wouldn't want to give up my faith I wouldn't want to give up up what I am because God has made me what I am so how can I become that how can I be that and you become that by becoming a faithful servant a faithful Steward of your youth that's good and I want to speak to us as parents too because we want to be faithful stewards of our youth to use a little play on words of of our young people and how do we become that how do we do that you see if you want to be a faithful servant you've got to be faithful in your habits yes amen you got to be faithful in your habits I've asked some of the elders what's the best thing we could do for our young people to make sure that they stay in church and they said most everyone I asked said the same thing they said be faithful to the house of God Amen just go to church yes the Bible says wherewith all shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereto according to the word not only going to church but when it comes to reading the Bible when it comes to praying we need to develop faithful habit you young people start right now start right now don't wait till your parents do it start right now you say well we don't have a family altar in my home you have a family altar amen you got Bibles you got You' got the ability to even many of you have the message you got the message on on your phone if you have a phone or on some device in your home you read that you may not understand it all but read it and listen to it and and and read the Bible find out what God Said for your be faithful to those things that's how you become a job that's how you become somebody who can stand through the trial by by actually choosing Godly habits in your life if you want to be a faithful servant be faithful to the sacrifice yes the Bible tells us that job was faithful when he come before God he'd come continually for his children continually he offered a sacrifice for his children because he believed that the sacrifice was effective listen we've got to be like that I'm going to go continually Before the Throne of God as parents we're got to go continually Before the Throne of God for our children don't quit when they leave the house don't quit when they get older but continually Before the Throne of God Amen with the brand an altar call he says he says this he said talk about people that were standing up he said I pray you'll you'll bless those who are standing pray you'll give them the desire of their heart if it's lust if it's indifference if it's fear if it's anything they have need of Lord cleanse their hearts and souls this day may they go from here a changed person if they've been neglecting reading the Bible because many times that's what leads to those other things when you neglect the word may they read it every day for it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God he said may they read it and live on it and thrive on it and pattern their life to the word of God and they shall have the promise of God do you want the promises of God how many young people want the promises of God to be fulfilled in your life I I I need healing in my life I need salvation I want the promises of God then how are you going to get the promises of God you got to be faithful to the house of God you got to be faithful to the word of God and I want to challenge you that you can do that now you don't have to wait to do that do it now be a generation that changes the culture of the church be a generation that that says we're not going to do it no more we're not going to take a a back in religion we're not going to be L to see it we're going to be on fire for God we're going to do what it takes to have a church that has the power of God you can do that that's good so David said one thing of I desire of the Lord and that will I seek after I dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life let me be like that let me have that desire to serve God you say well my parents won't go will you go if you're old enough and once you get to a certain age you get old enough to drive you get old enough to have a job no it's on you you can't blame your parents for not being spiritual anymore it's on you at some point you're going to need to step up and be a Christian that's right you're going to need to step up and read the word yourself you need to step up and and learn what it's like to repent of your sins and admit when you're wrong and be able to be a man and or be a a young lady that'll that'll be honest about it and take it and and do what's right tell somebody about it when you need help you got to take that responsibility don't wait on somebody else you do it amen to go to church say well that's you know you can't preach to kids to go to church because they get drugged there anyway but I want you to I want you to start now how did job continually offer a sacrifice because at some point during his youth he looks back he says I wish I was young again at some point during his youth he went to the house of God made a sacrifice maybe his parents did it maybe they taught him how to do it I don't know but he did it right and brother brandham tells us that he said how can you stay he said how can you say you can stay home and be just as good a Christian as you would be at church now what does that say you you all you you young people can read what does it say you can't do it right right right you can't stay home and be just a Christian as you would be at church you can't do it he said read the word the Holy Spirit feeds on the word the Bible is God's spiritual diet for his church and the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in the heart so what is he saying you got to go to church where the word is read but then the Holy Spirit Waters it brings it to you and places it in the heart with Thanksgiving you water it and every Divine promise will produce just exactly what God said it would do aren't you glad for that promise today it'll produce young people that are on fire for God it'll produce a generation that will not make excuses that will not will not rely on somebody else but they'll believe God for themselves it'll produce a people like that oh I'm so glad that our God still produces children like that that's good now if Satan can get you separated from the church he'll attack you and he'll do anything he he can to do that and you got to take responsibility as you get older for those things and I say as you get older some of you that are younger how many 10 year olds or above have we got here in the front how many are you 10 or older brother Stuart told me a story today when he was about 10 years old he made his mama go to church he made sure she was in church he wanted to be in church and his family serves the Lord today maybe because brother Stewart wanted to be in church amen that blessed me cuz I was that little boy I got on fire for God at a young age I wanted to go to the house of God I wanted to serve God and you got an opportunity right now you've got a few years you you just got a little bit of time we got a little bit of time to work with you Now's the Time to make sure your heart's right with God don't wait another service don't wait till tomorrow today's the day of salvation if there's something you need to deal with deal with it now don't wait until you get in trouble and you end up in jail somewhere or or are you get in trouble and you make some mistake that's going to alter the rest of your life take care of it now do the right thing now go to the house of God if you got to if you got to Bug Your Parents you bug your parents when you want to go to the candy store huh you do if you go buy you go buy candy you go buy an ice cream place and you want ice cream what do you do you holler for ice cream oh that we could be like that we could desire the house of God like kids do ice cream some of us Elders ought to say Amen to that brother Brandon said he watched the wolf and the deer he said the if the wolf can catch a little deer out to itself that's the one they work on if he can catch a deer away from the herd he said that's what the devil wants to do he said so to you young ladies he wants to go out you to go out with a boy that's not a Christian to you young men he wants you to go out with some little paint of Jezebel that's not a Christian he said that's where he wants to break you up that's where he wants to its teeth into you and this little deer will get out to itself away from the herd he said that's the one the wolf works on we need to stay together right he said un to you old man or woman huh I'm look over these young ones now for a minute to you old man or woman when you separate yourself from Believers people say I can stay at home be just as good a Christian as I can at church you can't the Bible said not forsake our assembling ourselves together that much more as we see the time coming he said if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are and fellowship with other Christian how many you say Amen to that he said see you cannot stay away from church and live the same life right you can't do it because it's like I'm hungry but I'll never go to a table I'll never eat I ain't going to do it so you've got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship one with another he said we need one another more now than we ever did need each other can you say Amen to that he said when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them make yourself a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that you're getting on Dangerous Ground right then keeping away from church he said find the one of your choice remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them that's the way to be a real Christian he said then we've got Fellowship protection people love you and pray for you you know that people love you you young people I want you to know that we love you I want you to know there's people praying for you I want you to know that the elders in this church are pulling for you we want to see you happy we want to see you we want to see you make it we believe you're going to make it but to do that you're going to have to take some responsibility and say I'm going to be a Christian I'm going to be a Christian if nobody else in my family is I'm going to be a Christian if nobody else if I if everybody else going to be a hypocrite I'm going to be true I'm going to be real I'm going to take the responsibility to be a Christian and do what it takes make sure I'm at church make sure that I'm doing what I need to do you know dare to be different everybody stays home from church be somebody that goes amen I want to talk to you young people and then you parents close your ears for a minute make church non-negotiable can I give you that advice you want to be a job you want be somebody that makes it you want to be somebody that's a pillar in the church make church non-negotiable that's make now now Now's the Time make it non-negotiable we're going to go to church if I can find a way to get the house of God I'm going to go to church and then what I'm going to do is I'm not when I get old enough to get a job I'm not going to get a job it takes me out of the house of God Amen I'm just not going to do it it's not worth it it's not worth it I know I know some people in different circumstances I had to work because I supported myself when I was 16 I had to work and I remember what it's like and I don't want to because it sounds like back in my day you know what it was like but but I used to go I used to work at McDonald's they won't wouldn't give you free food at McDonald's I switched to Burger King I used to go in the basement at McDonald's cuz I didn't have any money I used to go in the basement at McDonald's and eat the the ketchup packets I showed the kids the other day it's still pretty good cuz I was that hungry but I made church non-negotiable I switched to Burger King Burger King told me he said you got to uh we we'll let you work for us but you got to work on Sundays I said I can't do it said but I need this job and so the manager told me she said well she said if you really want it she said you can come in Sunday afternoon so I would go to church on Sunday morning change in drive to to work change into my work uniform work the afternoon and come back to church in my uniform that afternoon and nobody made me do that I did that because I wanted to be in the house of God cuz I had an experience with God I wanted to be right with God there's something in my heart I wanted to be with the people of God you got to have that kind of dedication in your life I'm going to go to church amen I'm going to make it non-negotiable I'm going to I'm going to serve God cuz some of you there's got to be preachers come from somewhere there's got to be deacons come from somewhere somebody's got to be Danny Ward when Danny Ward's gone if Lord God forbid somebody's got to be Ben PR when Ben puit is gone somebody's got to do it I said somebody needs to get down to business with God I passed a church the other day a place the other day where I used to go and pray when I was 16 years old I I worked and I was away from home and I had to in the afternoons I had nothing to do so I prayed I went in church and prayed for two or three hours a day I can't do that today I don't have the time to do that but I thank God that I took the time while I had the opportunity to reach out and learn how to pray and get alone with God I say take the time Now's the Time that sounds radical it does sound radical it makes you different we're going to have to make be different people to make it in a Rapture so you need to be you know job is gives us a little bit of a clue you forgive me tonight I'm just talking to you in my heart job gives us a clue of what kind of a person that he was he made a covenant with his eyes the Bible says in job 31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes why then should I think upon a maiden this is more for the older ones but I want you to get this the brand said what do you desire when a woman comes down the street dressed like that and you men turn your head gaze around like that you're not using the thinking man's filter because when you do that you're committing adultery for the filter said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already turn your head thinking man get away from her she's not pretty she's a serpent right twists like one acts like one stings like one say well that's pretty harsh well that's what the Bible says the way to her house is a house is a way of death and the Bible tells us he said if if your eye offends you pluck it out and that does not mean you need to pull your eye out or poke it out what it means is do what it takes to live a Christian Life to keep your thought life right and if that requires you to be without a phone you'd be better off without a phone then with that in your mind amen if that requ if if that requires you to uh have a counselor and and talk to somebody and tell them things that you maybe wouldn't want anybody to know but you're we're willing to do that why are you willing to do that because you you want to go to heaven you want to make it you don't want to deal with those things you don't want to carry those things into marriage cuz it doesn't get better so you're going to have to do what it takes I want to challenge you young people start now amen start dressing right not because somebody tells you to dress right but because the word says it start living right because the word says it it's better to be like without a phone than to than to see some of the stuff on it yeah that's the truth yeah you got to wrestle with that word yourself we're not going to make a law says you can or can't do certain things you got to you got to take responsibility and do that and I think as as we get farther along it becomes younger and younger that we have to deal with those things brother brandom says sometimes you may think it doesn't pay off you say well this is hard Ben he said but it certainly does pay off yes it's got to pay off I'm a testimony today it pays off all the hard work brother Jason all of it it pays off down the road I I can testify to you that you you girls that it pays off that if you'll do what's right if you'll if you'll keep your eyes right if you'll keep your mind right if you'll keep it pays off down the road he he said you cannot be going east and west at the same time you can't be going right and left at the same time the Bible says why stand between two opinions some of us older ones need to need need to hear that why stand between two opinions you can't be going one way and the other way at the same time you you got to come out he said if you'll set your mind and eyes and motives and objectives in life on the right thing you got to come out on the right thing that's the only way no matter how much you're tempted to do the other side turn your head from it do what's right and you know you're right he said you'll feel better and you are better that's just all there is to it you're going to come out right do you believe that amen I want to tell you kids are you still listening look for an opportunity to do good right all right job did job 29:15 he said I was eyes to the blind feet was out of the lame I was a father to the poor the cause which I knew not I searched out how do you become a faithful pillar in the church how do you become how do you become somebody who you want to emulate how do you become job how can you become someone who is an example look to see how you can help listen if you get older you get old enough to a job to have job your parents shouldn't have to make you pay ties or your offerings or show up if you have a truck or a vehicle and able to show up on a work day parents shouldn't have to make you do that why that that's you looking for an opportunity to do good especially the household of faith amen you want to help somebody the Bible says let no man despise your youth be an example how many young people want to challenge you older young people Esther be an example Peter be an example you old are young people be an example to these young ones we got a lot more young ones coming on we do older ones but be an example don't let anyone despise your youth be an example of the Believers in word in conversation or lifestyle in in love charity in spirit in faith in Purity be an example to others and that's your opportunity others have had an opportunity but let me find my opportunity to do good you say well everybody wants to sing a special but what about helping somebody who needs help what about when there's a work day at church what about when I've watched some of you help with the chairs and things that's good that's what you should be doing that's how you become a pillar of the church just doing what needs to be done that that's how you end up being able to make it that's how you end up like job where God says I can trust him even in the hardest trial why because he he was somebody who was willing to help out when when there needed help help needed to be done see you don't have much time now look at me for a minute look at me you know you're only a kid for 12 years or abouts and then you become a kid and you don't know it you become an advanced kid and they call that a teenager you know how long you're a teenager 2,190 days today was one it's about six years 2,9 190 days what are you going to do at that time you look back one day and like but David and I are looking back and say oh to be young again but you stand at the crossroads you're you're only you're only young you only get this opportunity to to set who you are in life just for a few short days and then it's over and if I could go back and do it again what would what would I do I want to do what I did give my heart to the Lord yeah when I was young like I did and I don't have any regrets in that there's there's mistakes that I made and things I wish I'd have done better but I don't have any regrets in giving my heart to the Lord I don't have any regrets in in becoming radical to my to even my associates and other young people in the church I don't have any regrets in that because it made me who I am today brother Brandon says this to the young people he said to the young people he said I would say this he said after 48 years in this life 20 some odd years of that 24 years I spent for the Lord Jesus he said as a boy of 23 I started preaching the gospel if there's any regrets that I have he said if I could touch a button this morning and go back to the fabulous age of about 16 or 17 he said I would only want to do it for one thing to serve Christ he said that's what it means to serve Christ Alone he said God who knows my heart knows that's true serve Christ Alone he said I've never seen anything or thought anything that ever compared with this blessed anchor of Christ in my heart I don't don't know nothing he said I've sailed the Seas I flew through the air I've seen the sights the world has I've seen the seven outstanding sights of the world he said I've seen all the mountain sites pretty near of the world wouldn't that be nice to be able to hunt anywhere you wanted to hunt be able to go to all the different places and be able to fish wherever you could fish wouldn't that be wonderful that some of you young people would love to be able to do that be able to travel and go across the world he said I've done all that and I wouldn't trade any of it for Christ he said I I've fished I I've rode horses I've ranched I've done everything I knew to do and I'll say this they're all of it put together he said won't make one little dot to the love of the Lord Jesus Christ what could I do he said oh yes he said these little kidy here he said I've had my little girlfriends you boys never had that did you brother brandom did he said slick my hair down put my windshield back on my car I don't even know what that means and they they used to drive around with them off some of you older Elders are going to know what that means and tell me after the church after church but he said I slick my hair down he was a man just like we are how do you become William brandom and I don't mean to have his gift but how do you become the kind that have that kind of Integrity how do you do that he said I used to be young I used to Slick my hair down put the windshield on the caruh he said went out with my date but it just didn't satisfy some of you think well if I could just go out on a date my life would be so much better been there and done that don't want to go back he said it didn't satisfy there's something you're lacking all the time he said I've seen the girl with the Pretty Brown Eyes I've seen the girl with the Pretty Brown Eyes I married the girl with the Pretty Brown Eyes I married the the only girl I ever dated and and you know at the time I thought well my life's complete but I wouldn't give even that for Christ he he said I thought that was just it if I could only have the date with this young lady it would take all my anxiety that would just settle it I'd have a date with her be out with her 15 minutes and look for someone else not brother Brandon well he was a human like we are said it just doesn't satisfy oh there's nothing but that blessed hour blessed be his name down a little old Coal Shed in the back of a building kneeling on an old grass sack in an alley where I knelt down there in the wet ground and said Lord Jesus can you do something for me I wonder if we could say that this morning you young people Lord Jesus can you do something for me I I I need you Lord I want you to be in my life I want you to be I want you to lead me I want you to guide me I need you Lord he said that's when a peace that passes all understanding anchored in his heart of mine it's worth all there is in the whole world he said I've never seen nothing to compare with it I trusted him in the hours of sickness and accident it'll come I've trusted him when the airplanes was spinning in the storm he said Lord Jesus are you finished with me if not straighten this plane out and see her smooth around her right condition I stood in the clinic where the best of doctors in the nation they look at me and say just a few more minutes to live He's going when the best doctors could be got for me I said Lord Jesus are you through with me all of a sudden I was back to myself he said Oh Amazing Grace how sweet that sound how I wish I had tongu to explain what it is it's too great for the human mind take my word don't you take a substitute friend don't take a substitute don't just go and say well now I do this I'll tell you what I'm a pretty good person don't rely on that some of you young people say well I'm a pretty good person I'm a good old boy you you good old boys go to hell just like the bad ones but there's got to be something take place in your heart don't just say I'm a pretty good person just stay there until something just reaches out takes away all the sin puts a kiss there he said that just burns I love that you've been kissed by heaven when the Trials come you don't have to wonder if I'm going to do that it just something holds right oh that that's what we've been talking about all day you don't have to wonder something holds there's something holding me as a middle-aged man now he said I've got to come down and think this that one of these days I got to go if Jesus carries I got to go I don't know what it'll be when I get down to the end of the road I don't know he said I'm not trusting on my preaching no sir I'm not trusting on the things I've done oh God no he said don't let that be far from me I've done things since I've been a preacher neglected and done this and that I don't want to trust in nothing no sir he said I don't want to say Lord I've won a million souls to you he said that has nothing to do with it not a thing the only thing I'm trusting is his grace his promise his word oh how do you become a job trust trust him Lord you said though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil you said I'll never leave you nor forsake you when I'm pressing that pillow and the cold death sweat is running off my brow he'll be there just as sure as I'm standing here he said he'll be there when I preach my last sermon close the Bible and walk away the last time the work is over he'll be there and just as sure as I believe that he's coming when he comes again I'll be there too not because I married he said it's because he has for me and I accept it upon the basis of his eternal word and I know by that there was something happened something happened he said not how much noise I can make how well I can say if I was the greatest preacher in the world if IID raised the dead whatever has nothing to do with it it's because something happened something taking place in here it taken all the old jealousy and bitterness and evil and everything from my heart now I just love him day and night something happened I want to see him someday said I want you to I'll say this as I close you need to listen to the voice that says come follow me I want y'all to listen to that tape when you get a chance it's only I think 36 minutes long it's called come follow me if you don't have access to it ask your parents to get it for you come follow me brother brandom in that tape he talks about he talks about the Rich Young Ruler and he had his opportunity and Jesus said come follow me just an opportunity like you had today and he heard the voice of the Lord say come follow me and he just didn't feel like he could do it he just didn't want to give up what he was and he ended up lifting up his eyes in Hell yall know the story wishing that Lazarus would rais from the dead so he could he could bring a little water make things a little bit better and brother brand tells a story in there about a a prospector that had found some gold and he had an old dog with him the more faithful dog and the dog would always warn him when there was something that would that would happen that was bad you know and something was near dogs can smell things and see things we can't and so the dog would always warn him Miles when there would be a danger around and he he got the gold and he thought boy I'm going to be a rich man tomorrow I'm going to be a rich man and he stopped at this cabin he didn't know there was some Outlaws that were going to take the gold from him and they were sneaking up around the outside of the building and and every time they they get a little bit closer the dog would bark you know he just just go crazy and the guy's sitting there thinking boy tomorrow I'm going to be rich I'm going to buy this I'm going to buy that and that old dog he just got tired of hearing it just barking and barking and finally just walks over and shoots the thing kills it that night he died the outlaw killed him took the money why cuz he stopped the voice that was trying to warn him of danger the voice that you're hearing that thing that tells you that's wrong that's bad you shouldn't do that all of you have that you've been raised so many of you in church you know there's something there tells you when something's wrong listen to it follow it don't stop it and if there's something there it's something telling you this is wrong you need to change that deal with it you you older ones deal with that don't wait you deal with that I talked to a I got a letter in the mail a few years ago and and it was from prison it was a young man that I dealt with as a young man like like these young people here and he had a problem with temper and he come to the Altar and did some things but he just he just never would completely deal with it he never would completely die to it and in his temper he just get so mad and finally left church and he got out and he got a girlfriend and then she went with somebody else and he got mad and he ended up taking a knife cutting her face up shooting her boyfriend and when he did he he wrote me a letter he said I wish I would have listened end up in prison for many years said I wish I would have listened I wish I I wish I'd have paid attention wish i' have heard the voice I don't want to see any of you end up like that I want to see you on fire for God in the
