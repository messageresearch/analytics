spirit and so we're so thankful today thankful that you created a desire in us to soar in the heavenlies of your word father we we couldn't give that to ourselves you had to do that so we humbly ask you today to just bring us up higher lord and make us more like you help us lord to cast down every thought that would be against your word every little thing lord maybe a hurt feeling or or something that would keep us from receiving everything from you i pray you would cast it down today and just let us receive from your word lord where eagles gathered around the carcass of the killed word lord the fresh kill the message of the hour i'm so grateful for that today and i pray you bless each one lord you know the needs on every heart you know everyone how they're struggling lord and whether it's financially spiritually lord or or perhaps mentally in this day that we live in or physically lord i pray that you would just move in their lives and father that you would move me out of the way and all of us lord that we can just surrender ourselves to you today i pray you'd grant it lord you know the need in my body and the different things going on we know that you're your lord to meet every needle we thank you for that in jesus name amen amen god bless you you may be seated for just a moment it's good to have brother david back this morning leading songs and as testimony of the grace of god in his life we're grateful for that you pray for me this morning just got a little bit of a cold i'll try not to get too close to you but the lord's still good isn't he he's good all the time now i wanted to tell you thank you for your mission offering a couple weeks ago about brother jason demars we were able to give him two thousand dollars to go towards what they do is they pay help pay the rent for some of the churches over there that's where that money goes and so that's some of the money be given for that and they just come out of the mission fund we didn't take a special offering but i appreciate you giving to missions and you've done that faithfully over the years and we appreciate that very much so that money will go to that and we'll try to support him on a more regular basis and then some other brothers as well that are spreading the gospel the bible says when the gospel of this kingdom has been preached in every nation then the end will come so we're almost there i believe that so uh we're going to i want you to pray also for brother allen today brother gregory's preaching for them today and i'm glad that our young ministers can get out and preach but we miss with alan and his family when they're not here so be praying for him on the roads today and then my grandmother as brother david said is very sick she's taking a turn for the worse they call they've allowed the family to come in and i want to commend the doctors for that it's a very humane thing to do to let the my mother i just got a picture before i left the office that she's all uh robed up and they have to wear double masks and things in there but they are able to see her and to touch her and thank god for that because i know others that have passed on without without that and it's a terrible thing not be able to see your relatives so she was able to do that but if the lord doesn't intervene i don't know what'll happen there but we're trusting that god will and but she's 89 years old and she's ready to go and so we we thank god for that but you just be praying for my family in that situation and i'm sure every one of you have needs as well we'll be praying for um i know on tuesday nights i didn't write this down but on tuesday nights brother darrell ward has been kind of organizing a prayer meeting they're going to do that again this tuesday night at seven o'clock our time so if you have time to if you're at home and you're able to do that that would be a good time to pray for the needs of the church or the bride here in the united states and overseas where this colvin thing has been so such a hard thing and it looks like it's letting up it looks like we're coming out of it and so grateful for that so grateful that god has blessed us like he has to bring some of you out of that and and we're grateful for that today now we're going to make a little change to the service so i want you to listen actually i guess it don't matter because you'd just be here early but the service times we're going to change the service time on sunday morning to 10 30 instead of 10 o'clock so on sunday morning at 10 30 and that means sunday school start at 10 15 instead of 9 45 so everybody heard that 10 30 and i'll try to remind you and the reason for that is so many of you are driving and you're not able to be here early enough some of i know some of the kids it's hard to get them in sunday school at 9 45 and so we're going to try to do it at 10 30 on sunday mornings and we'll still be out around noon most sundays and floor will help me to do that and uh but that'll give you a little bit more of a chance i think and help a little bit and we'll try that now so 10 30 on sunday mornings no change to our wednesday service but once a month we'll have two services on sunday i want to try to have a dinner in between that service so once a month we're going to try to do it on the first sunday of every month and the the first time we're going to do that is march 7th and we'll remind you that we'll also have communion foot washing that day so we'll have two services on march 7th at 10 30 and 3 o'clock so we'll be able to stay for that and eat if you want to and and i i hope that will help you in some way and uh we i just want as many of you to be here and be as comfortable as you can be and i know if we try to make it as comfortable as we can but you're not here for the pews or the the seats or or the decorations and i'm so thankful for what sister vicki and my wife and different ones work but mainly sister vicky brother danny worked on and brother mark helped as well on this foyer and so they've made that look really nice but but that's not why you're here you're here because of you want to worship god and you're here because you want to hear the word and so we want to still make that the focus of what we do and so anything we can do to make you help you to be here and and be able to be on time is is what we're going to try to do you love the lord this morning amen remember that 10 30 on sunday morning so you'll be early if you show up at the normal time and i'm okay with that but it we're going to change to 10 30. lord willing acts chapter 26 verse 13 let's stand together i told you i was going to begin to get into this absolute i've just been really soaking in the sermons brother branham preached on that and so i want you to think with me today and and pray with me and as we go through this i want to just take a part of that sermon but not just just take what brother branham's preached but kind of really dig into it and what the absolute means to us and what it means to to meet that absolute and i want to talk this morning on an absolute experience an absolute experience which may sound like a paradox because we know we don't go just by experience but there is an experience that you can have that can become an absolute in your life and that experience is meeting christ the word if you meet him that becomes an absolute in your life and that's what we want to talk about this morning acts chapter 26 and verse 13 at midday o king i saw in the way of light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue also i persecuted thou me it was hard for thee to kick against the pricks and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee to open their eyes to turn them from darkness to light aren't you glad he did that for you from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins an inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision but showed first unto them of damascus in that jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance let's approach the lord one more time heavenly father we've been giving these announcements for a little bit but we thank you for your presence this morning we felt in the song service and we believe you're still here with us and we ask you to just come and anoint your word as only you can we pray in jesus name amen you can be seated the word absolute from webster's dictionary is free independent of anything extraneous and that's what it literally means is freedom freedom and it's complete in itself it's positive and absolute declaration unconditional that's an absolute promise existing independent of any other cause as god is absolute unlimited by extraneous power or control as an absolute government or prince not relative as absolute space so in other words it's not it exists by itself it's not relative to anything else existing there's only been one thing in history that ever brother david existed by itself without anything else and that is elohim who is the self-existing one right he is the the absolute literally the absolute in that sense that nothing it takes nothing for him to live it takes nothing for him to exist he didn't have to have anything to be you it's hard for you to even imagine for me to even imagine a a power like that an ability like that that took nothing and needed nothing and yet came down and that absolute poured himself out into a body of flesh become a baby you can imagine and needed everything that's god but it's hard to even wrap our minds around that but that would be the only thing that you could really say is is absolute human beings cannot be an absolute in their flesh it's literally impossible because it takes something for me to live right for me to be here today so many other people had to do so many other things my parents had to get together and we talked about how what the odds are of you being you and going back so many different generations what what that would be and it took a lot of things for you to be here it takes something for you to live somebody's got to work somewhere as a farmer farming produce and things out of the ground for you to have food for me to have food somebody's got to run a fire department somebody's got to run a police department somebody's got to serve in the military there's so many things that it takes for us to have this american life but god is not dependent on any of those things right so an absolute would be something that's not dependent on on flesh it can't be dependent on flesh because if it's dependent on flesh it's literally not an absolute right and but we know then that the absolute as i said last sunday is what god says right because anything that comes out of god as an absolutely never has a second thought he never had he never has to rethink it and think oh i was wrong about that but everything that he ever said oh i feel his presence here this morning everything that he ever said is just saith the lord it's the absolute right whatever god says and however he says it the voice of god if you put it that way what god says it's the absolute so human beings can have the absolute but not be the absolute does that make sense you can have the absolute but not be the absolute this is the absolute word of god i have it but i'm not it as a pastor i'm not the absolute even though i have in some ways the final say in the church but i'm not the absolute right and even in that the churches when i say that i have the final say in the church unless the church voted me out right so i'm not even absolute in that i i couldn't just stay here regardless right and so none of us are absolute we're all dependent on something right and so but the absolute exists independent of everything else and that is the word of god thus saith the lord nothing nothing can change it it'll go for its purpose he said i'm the god that healeth thee that's an absolute right it's exactly what he said it was amen now and so human beings are subject to circumstance james 4 13 says go to now you that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain so in other words you're planning ahead your business life and what you're going to do he said whereas you know not what you'll be on tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanish at the way there's no absolute in human life there's no absolute of that if you make your absolute enjoyment or pleasure or happiness there's no absolute in that right because what makes you happy today may not make you happy tomorrow and someone said what what what do you as we talked about what do you want but i don't mean to repeat myself i'm sorry about that but sometimes you preach in the same place day week after week you repeat yourself a little bit but what do you want well i want to be happy well that's that can't be your absolute because i'm happy when i eat and if i just just want to be happy just go by that i'd be 600 pounds i mean that can't be my absolute there has to be more than that than just being happy but he said you ought to say if the lord will we shall live and so just we may not even be alive he says to be able to make those plans that the lord will we shall live and do this or that we don't know what tomorrow holds and so an absolute if you think about it like that an absolute human being would be deity in flesh and that's why i say that we could have the absolute but not be the absolute because every one of us are given a measure of the gift of faith every one of us have a measure of christ we have christ as brother brown says in measure but but jesus christ himself was without measure right he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so we could say that he was absolute because he was the word so jesus never did say anything that was wrong nothing he never did get in the flesh you think about that that's almost hard to wrap your mind around as as someone existing on their own right jesus never had to apologize to the to the disciples for getting in the flesh i've told you before that jesus went and used the whip but i'd like to see you do that without getting angry in the flesh right jesus got angry and didn't sin not one bit right he did not sin that's how we know that you know we know he got sick but he didn't sin he was subject to all the temptations but he didn't see it he never did amen and that absolute is in you right which can keep you from every sin but the flesh is the center always will be one day it'll be changed aren't you glad for that one day we're going to walk out of here but it's always going to be the moment you go in the rapture your flesh will still be a sinner and it's changed and then it's not a sinner no more but you have a body amen that's worthy of that absolute that's on the inside amen now so i want you to kind of hold that thought so that's the only thing that could be absolute is the word now would would be the word is god now brother brown says the word absolute is an ultimate he said therefore i think that everybody should have an ultimate and every great achievement that's ever been achieved there's been an absolute behind him no matter what it was it's had an absolute behind it and every person in order to achieve something has to first have that the absolute he said you've got something you have to tie to in other words it's the final tying post to every achievement and you think of a typo something you tie down to and i know around here there's a lot of trailer homes well you have to tie them down right when you get one you got to pull it up there and you got to tie them down because otherwise it's going to flip over it's going to blow away wind gets underneath it's going to blow away so you time down to the ground you take a horse back in the old days they take a horse and tie it to a hitching post it's got to be tied to something solid if the hitching post is movable the horse can go it'll just take it with it so it's got to be something solid a boat has to tie up on the shore to something that's solid wave's not going to carry it away it's got to be something solid and brother branham says it's the final tying post to every achievement he said it's somewhere it might wind through many different things till it gets to that thai post but there is the amen to all of it so you might have experiences you might have you might have church entity you might have been raised in the message but you wind through all of those things until one day you get an absolute it catches on something that won't move because if you catch my spirit that'll move if you put your confidence in me that'll move right you put your confidence in the person you sit beside of the pew that'll move a husband a wife whoever it might be but if you ever get your confidence in that absolute he won't move so he said it'll wind through many different things till it gets to that typos but there is the amen to all of it there must be such a thing there must be such a thing he said you cannot go on through life without having one amen now but the right answer to achievement anyone achieved anything if you achieve something you look at what are my achievements well that would be my life in christ the life that i now live how did i get here because i met an absolute something there's something in my life to tie to and the reason you have to have that is because of the presence of evil paul said if i would when i would do good evil is present i have the flesh and the flesh my own heart even is deceitful there's got to be something greater than my heart the bible tells us if if your heart condemns you there's one greater than your heart right and so there's got to be something you can tie to that's greater than just well i i believe the message is true i i went to church and i felt good but there's got to be a reality to that that you know that no matter what comes you're going to stand amen now acts 23 11. says the night following or actually this is written about paul the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou has testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome now it was a long journey to rome there would be evil president on the journey there would be shipwreck snake bite that's quite a journey paul had to rome but he had an absolute that held him on the journey and you have an outfit that holds you on the journey of life because there's lots of obstacles in your way your family may become an obstacle your your spouse may even become an obstacle here your church may at times be an obstacle even the south phoenician woman come to jesus and jesus himself was an obstacle to her because he said it's not me for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs but she said that's true lord but the dogs eat the crumbs to fall from the masters table why because she found her absolute she was going to believe what he said no matter what even if her feelings were hurt and so paul said he said told paul he said you're going to bear witness with me at romans so no matter what paul went through from that moment on he had an absolute he was held by something through his life philippians 1 and 20 and these are scriptures where the random uses in the absolute sermons he says according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but that with all boldness has always so now also christ should be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death he was absolutely sure but glenn that it was going to happen he was absolutely sure of heaven i don't believe we have to equivocate on that i think we can be absolutely sure of where we're going absolutely sure he says i have fought a good fight i've kept the faith henceforth there's laid up for me a crown amen not to me only but also to those who who welcome his appearing he says he says death where is your sting go read the writings of paul he's not sitting there saying well i hope i make it by the skin of my teeth maybe i'll make it maybe i'll if i could just stay man but i'm doing so many things that are wrong but if i could if i could just feel like i feel in church no he said he said death where's your sting it's been taken away he can stand in the face of death and mock death amen death where is your sting he says for me to live is christ to die his cane amen amen he says i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ go read the writings of paul he doesn't approach it with timidity he approaches it with boldness but the jt is saying i know whom i have believed amen and i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day i know that's my absolute amen you see that's why it's so important to teach our children the scripture because there'll come a day maybe they'll go back and forth and they'll they'll try to tie their knot to different things relationships and churches and different things but one day they'll realize there's something they had in their life and if they can ever meet the word the person of the word then all of a sudden that scripture becomes alive that they learned as a child that scripture that they learn all of a sudden they that scripture anchors in their heart and i know my redeemer lives i know that i've i'm persuaded he's able to keep me becomes the absolute in their lives when the word is the abstinent in your life you don't equivocate about it you don't you don't go back and forth and and mealy mouthed and wonder well should i do this no the word is true it's always true amen regardless of what i do regardless if i get sick the word still he says the lord heal is i'm the god that healeth all thy diseases no matter what it says it's still there no matter what you go through when you get in the lowest moment of your life at the very end of the end of all your expectations in life all your dreams are shattered all your hopes are gone and you get at that moment in your life and you recognize i know i still know that he's god i still know he's the same yesterday today and forever i may be on my best bed but i know in whom i have believed you don't get that by education you don't get that by good feeling you get that because you met christ amen he was absolutely sure because he had met the person of the word brother branham uses the example of marriage in the absolute he said you when you got married there had to wind back through your mind something until you hit that type post he said it should have been love for your wife or your husband i ask people all the time who having trouble why did you get married there has to be a reason why did you get married well i loved them well that should have been a type post if you loved them in the correct way that don't change now you may fall out of out of like with them you may not like everything they do but your love don't change some of you have lost your spouse you know that love doesn't leave you just because you lost your spouse love doesn't leave you you're still still there it's there with you it's a type post he said well maybe she isn't as pretty as john's wife or she well she not this that you shouldn't express those thoughts out loud by the way he said but he said there's something about you about her that it strikes you he didn't say she strikes you it strikes you you might not be as pretty as the other he might not be as handsome as the other but there has to be an absolute there that that person is different and there's where you hold on to he said if that isn't there you better not get married that typos that absolute so that's a good illustration now brother branham then uses three bible examples he uses first job and job knew that he had made a sacrifice and that was an absolute in his life brother brother says oh in time of sickness if we could only tie ourselves to that absolute amen job know that he had done jehovah's bidding amen and he had faith in what he had done because jehovah required it he said we can just do that jehovah required a burnt offering for his sin and job not only for himself but for his children had made a burnt offering and that's all god required oh he said you might say i wish that's all he required today listen what he says he said it's less than that amen you don't even have to get wood together are you with me now you don't even have to drag an ox or a sheep or lamb or whatever to the altar and cut his throat and build an altar what do you have to do believe because the sacrifice has already been made he said it's less than that just faith in his word and you if you make his word you're absolute you can he said any divine promise in the bible you can tie your soul to it no matter how much the waves whip you around you're still tied you're absolute amen it's an absolute now he still had to come to a place of absolute but the rhino said then when he come to the spot now watch and i want you to get this because each one of these these examples brother brown uses goes to a a timeline where they believe god but then they come to a place where they're sure and so it's like but the verb says that absolute winds through until it catches hold of something and job does that he believes god he's made his sacrifice he trusts that that's for him but there's still something that he needs and so he said when he come to the spot when the absolute hell he said finally he began to feel the strain tighten up he said that had been running loose bouncing around but it began to tighten up and you begin to see in someone's life when the absolute tightens up to the word right because immediately they begin to just naturally live the word it's not a forced thing you don't have to yell at them all the time but the absolute hell but howard it's there it grabs hold of something and when that absolute hit job he said the spirit come on him he stood up being a prophet he said i know my redeemer liveth look how sure he is i know my redeemer liveth he said he had tightened up to his absolute that's interesting language brother i'm using this now because so many times we get to we get to thinking well i had this experience i was saved and then i was sanctified and then i was filled with the holy ghost but you realize that every every day we need to tighten up to the absolute your experience with god doesn't end because you had an experience with god but it just begins so you have to come in contact with that absolutely you've got to pull up to it not because he would leave you but because you you would grieve him away i would grieve him away just by everyday living so what do you do you tighten up to it he said he come in contact he knew that he had done what was right and someday he had to pull to it he said how long does that take well it takes the rest of our lives because someday we're going to pull through the scripture with a joke that says they'll not sleep but they'll all be changed i'm not all asleep but they'll all be changed someday it's got to pull to that absolute word that promised in the moment in a twinkling of an eye that's going to take place so until that happens we just constantly pulling pulling that string gets tighter and tighter until it finally grabs hold of that and our body changes and yet we have an absolute now but we're tightening up to it now he said he'd come in contact he knew he'd done what was right someday he had to pull two he said i know my redeemer liveth stays he stands upon this after the skin worms destroy this body and in my flesh shall i see god he knew then in his absolute anchored and job could say in job 42 5 i have heard of thee by the hearing of the year but now that's the place we need to reach church i've heard of thee but now they don't have to pet me anymore i'm not a hotbed plant now mine i see at thee i have seen christ he said can a man say that he has to say that can a woman say that she has to say that i've heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine i seeth thee i know amen and it's not that it's not faith because you know by the eyes of faith it's not that it's not faith it's still faith but faith is not a movable thing out there somewhere faith is the substance of things hoped for that's what brother brown calls perfect faith it's when you move beyond i believe to i know i know and don't get confused in your flesh now because your flesh will never know if you could keep consulting the flesh it's going to keep telling you to do the wrong thing right every day you wake up flesh what do you want to do well i want to eat drink and be merry i want to sleep as long as i can i want to eat as much food as i can i want to skip church as much as i can that's what the flesh wants to do right every day you wake up and if you keep consulting him well flesh do you want to be you have an absolute oh no i i don't know what i believe but there's something on the inside that regardless of what the flesh says i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now might i see it the i know my redeemer lives amen not depending on what the flesh says genesis well let's let's go back to what brother brown said again but the brandon introduces abraham as having an absolute and abraham had heard the voice of god you know he come out of his out from the place where he was from ur the chaldees and and he brings his father with him for a while finally he gets rid of his father if you could say it that way god didn't call his father called abraham all right and so finally he goes a little farther and he got lot with him and finally lot left him the rest of the lot was always a hair in the biscuit it's a very graphic way of putting it that's that's almost traumatic to me i mean that's hair in the biscuit is a traumatic thing that's a good waste of a good biscuit but abraham had heard the voice of god but there come a day he had to have something more now the bible said he said when his obituary was written he said abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god he said why did you ever think he was absolute positive the only thing he had to do was separate himself from his people and god never did bless him until he did it said he took his daddy his daddy died he took lot went after a lot separated from abraham then god come to him and said now walk through the land so you see the same thing he's tightening up to his absolute genesis chapter 15 and verse 1 after these things the word of the lord came unto abram after what things read genesis 14 after what things after lot he finally was done with lot after these things the word of the lord came into abram and a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and abram asked a good question he he said lord god whereby shall i know how can i have an absolute how can i know that i shall inherit it he'd been confessing it for years he'd been believing it for years he'd been following the voice of the word for years but he said whereby shall i know and god said now notice what he didn't do he didn't come to abram and say okay now i'm going to give you a teaching seminar and i'm going to show you every little thing about what's going to happen to you no he said take a heifer and a goat and a ram and a turtle dove and a young pigeon he said abraham you're about to have an experience and you got to get ready for it so he makes the sacrifice pulls them all up there and cuts them all up and tears them asunder puts the parts out there on the on the altars and so he says take each one of those things in that next verse and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and each piece once again one against another but the birds divided he not and so he's got it all prepared just the way that it should be and verse took unto him all these divided peace against one another but the birds divided he not verse 11 when the fouls came down upon the carcasses abram drove them away because the birds are going to come to try to keep you from your experience the demons out of hell are going to come down and try to keep you from having an experience with god but you can't give yourself an experience all you can do is stand there by the sacrifice and show them away right those birds of doubt those demons of depression and fear and all those things come down and they tried to they tried to settle down on the sacrifice but abraham drove them away and it came to pass when the sun went down and it was dark verse 17 and you can go and read the rest of it there how he put him to sleep and all of that but he said when it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces what happened the pillar of fire the shekinah glory of god come down and made a covenant hallelujah amen oh don't you realize that's what happens every time you come to an altar every time you give your heart to god you stand there in just the pieces of yourself and god comes down and he anoints that he anoints that according to his word it has to be an experience of meeting god abraham met god he never did say how can how will i know again it was abraham's absolute moses the runaway servant prophet god had raised him up and educated him in pharaoh's palace are you still with me this morning moses went out with this theological training he said was the first man he slew he said then the first little defect come along and moses was scared to death why because he had no absolute what he says he only had his mother's testimony of his birth well you were born in the message you were raised on a church pew you're you're predestined moses said praise the lord i'm going to go out and preach in his very first sermon he killed an egyptian boom gonna solder them all you know how a young preacher does so many times you go out there and you just you're just gonna solder them you're gonna you're gonna take them down going to preach against every sin known to man and he didn't he killed an egyptian then realized the people got mad well what am i going to do now he had no absolute he said he was a strange child he had his mother's word about it he had the scrolls that god had perhaps in paper somewhere they had written packed along with them that god was going to visit his children so he had that promise he knew that that was the time very bad he said like we do now we know something is fixing to happen you don't have to have very spiritual eyes today church to know that something's about to take place we know that he was chosen for it but he didn't have an absolute now he says one day on the back side of the desert when he had lost the vision god appeared to him in a burning bush he said moses i've seen the afflictions of my people i've heard their groans and crying those taskmasters punishing them and i have remembered my promise i've come down to deliver them now go down to egypt i said moses complaining saying i don't speak very well my deliverance or my delivery is not very not very good i can empathize with moses here my delivery is not very good i don't speak very well they won't believe me he said what's in your hand he said a stick hey ben hey man what's in your hand a stick he said throw it down it turned to a serpent said pick it up by the tail and turn back again to a stick he was giving him the assurance of vindication now listen to this it's very important when god gives an absolute he gives the vindication to that absolute always always and that's why we've talked about two people can come to the altar both of them cry both of them have tears both of them you feel the presence of god around both of them both of them feel the presence of god there one get up and change man the other one does the same things he always did there's no vindication when god gives an absolute he gives the vindication of that absent always and what is the vindication it's the life that's lived after right it's a life that's lived after now a prophet would have a peculiar vindication but the vindication to us is the life we live after we meet the absolute right that's the vindication to the world he said then moses when he was down there he threw down his stick before the magicians and pharaoh and the magicians coming through down their stick too moses never ran and said oh well i was wrong oh it's just a cheap magician trick maybe i was wrong but he knew very bad he was positive that he met god and he stood still amen he said let's say you've done exactly what god told him to do he said so job done exactly what god told him to do moses said follow his commandments then stand still and watch the glory of god you can't ever have any assurance if you don't do what god says because that's the absolute right if you're just not doing the basics of it if you know and that's why people sometimes are so embarrassed when they come to church and feel so bad but you don't have to feel that way just do what god says he said but you don't understand what i have been doing just speak the word of god over that and repent of that and go on how long does it take to be forgiven that long as long as it takes you to say he already knew it he wanted to hear you confess it and get right back with the absolute don't stay down there in that wallow in it moses was tied to his absolute sure he made mistakes but he was tied to his absolute his commission and he stood still when he did his serpent swallowed up the rest of the serpents he said see he was tied to that absolute amen he met god he said well if i'd seen the pillar of fire in a burning bush i believe that too i'd do that too that same pillar of fire is still here that pillar of fire is in this building this morning he said well that's a that's a hard statement to say listen what a prophet said he said you're in his presence now he is here he is absolutely here the great holy spirit he said that pillar of fire that was with moses is right here now you say well brother branham had it he was right there with brother branham oh wait branham tells us you can go find the quote i didn't get it but you can find it but brother brown said that that pillar of fire followed paul all the days of his life i don't it didn't just stay with him when he was when it was visible are you with me what is the pillar of fire the pillar of fire is the visible form of god called the logos right it's the logos it's the word of god right you can see it now that pillar of fire whether you can see it or not see it physically with physical eyes it's there if the holy spirit is with you what is the holy spirit's christ the life of christ if you have the holy spirit you have the pillar of fire otherwise you make them two separate things right you've got two different gods so he said that pillar of pharaoh that was with moses is right here hebrews 11 26 we're told that moses esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect and the recompense of the reward the reproach of christ brother brown said was christ then as the angel of the covenant that logos that pillar of fire that was christ he went in the wilderness he said with christ and any bible reader knows that the pillar of fire was the angel of the covenant the logos that went out of god which was jesus and when he died he ascended up into heaven and when he met saul on the road to damascus he had done turned back to the pillar of fire again and even put paul's eyes out with brightness now if we make the pillar of fire it's only being with brother branham and i do recognize the exclusivity of that sign for that ministry are you with me now that it was only given to one man i don't have to have it it's picture taken with me we've already had it vindicated it's already been done that's been given to our age we don't have to have it again but i'm so grateful that we had it aren't you and i don't say you couldn't see the pillar of fire just say it was that was a sign for him for his message you understand but now and it showed that the same god that brought the word to moses brought the word to paul was with us in our day not to bring a new bible but to but to as we said do the replay to show us to confirm that what we had was right and to bring out the revelation of it now brother branham says when he said now he's here tonight the same yesterday today and forever he's here tonight the same yesterday and forever and then in another quote where the brown says now if that pillar of fire is right if it's here it'll do the same works that he did because it's the same nature you say what is the absolute well you had to meet the pillar of fire that makes sense i don't mean you'll see it with your physical eyes but you've got to meet the logos the word because what else could be absolutely that's what existed by itself you got to meet more than a preacher you got to meet more than than even a a message because just the message by itself a dead letter you got to be more than just this bible because this bible is the logos in print but you got to meet him right or this bible can't become real to you you can't live it in this day unless you met him amen it'll do the same works that he did because it's the same nature hallelujah now are you with me now paul met that pillar of fire that was this absolute now remember brother brown said he was a scholar beforehand he was a mighty man of the scriptures but he didn't have any type post but the sanhedrin that would back him up and a diploma from a great teacher and preachers today make a sanhedrin they a group of preachers they can get around they all agree with one another and that oh yeah i can go to my group of preachers and they all say hey man to me and so i know that i got the absolute no you've got to meet god for yourself not in a group of sanhedrin a group of preachers that's all paul had was a group of preachers that would back him up a diploma from a great teacher he was a great man in his field but he was waiting only thing he had his absolute would only be as strong as his organization was so church if we if we become organizational we become get a denominational mindset where we just fellowship with certain people and and we have this little clique that we get around and we all agree with one another then our absolute is only as strong as they are we don't want that that's all the stronger he could be with the sanhedrin but i'm so glad for a strength that goes beyond that aren't you what was it paul had an experience with god on the road to damascus one day all of a sudden a light shone round about him and knocked him off his horse amen began to speak to him and he said who are you lord amen who are you lord because brother brother said he recognized that pillar of fire had to be god who are you lord he said i'm jesus who thou persecuted us it's hard for you to kick against the pricks hey man have become his absolute every time he got in a tight spot brother said he come back to that experience brother branham says how the nation how the christian world this morning needs that type of absolute he said those who'd creates and traditions that tried to withdraw the men to disqualify god's word to being the same yesterday today and forever he said they need an absolute an experience of meaning on a damascus road amen the living god who can heal the sick you believe that today amen they need an experience of meeting on a damascus throat the living of god who can heal the sick and raise the dead and cast out devils a genuine absolute you've got it from a historical standpoint but may be able to explain all these things but if you haven't got an absolute haven't got an experience and if that experience that you claim you have makes you to not deny that every word of this isn't just as true to the church today as it ever was now now hang with me he said you have to have an experience but that experience got to go back to the word if that experience caused you to deny that every word of this isn't just as true to the church today as it ever was and you're trusting upon your bachelor of art degree or whatever you might have if you're trusting upon the thoughts of your organization that would say the days of miracles has passed we have no divine healing and the baptism of the holy spirit like they received on the day of pentecost is not for the people today he said if that's all you got my precious brother and sister you need a damascus road experience amen hallelujah do you believe it today i'm i need to quiet down a little bit my wife told me today she said you're you're sick don't get excited he said just get up there and talk i have a hard time doing that hey man if that's all you got you need a damascus road experience you need to meet this living god amen are you struggling today do you not know which way to come in go out sure the flesh will struggle but are you struggling in your soul you don't know what's right what's not right you need this living god hey man you need to meet this living god where you not only just a mythical thought in your mind not some shiver some kind of a sensation but a taut he said an experience of a real genuine the same jesus that walked in galilee is living today alive forevermore do you believe that today hallelujah and he's the same yesterday today and forever and absolute that you don't have to take what anyone said you know for yourself not some sensation amen hey man now listen brother henry says here and i'm closing in just a moment he said if the sensation that you've had he said somebody he said it might have been a real bible sensation now brother bruno changed me he said it's not some sensation but maybe you had a sensation that was a real bible sensation remember they had a sensation on the in the upper room they staggered out like drunk men sure they did they spoke at other times they did those things there they had a sensation but it's not a certain sensation it just when that kind of power comes down on a human being what's it going to do amen but now look he said if that sensation you've had somebody it may have been a real bible sensation and somebody tried to explain away from you saying those things were in some other day be careful that's what they're saying it's for somebody some other day be careful he said it is true be careful but there is a way to know test it with the word amen so i'll accept any sensation that goes back to the word i'm not gonna make fun of somebody for crying or speaking in tongues or running or shouting whatever it is if it goes back to the word if there's a vindication behind it you see a life changed are you with me now he said that's the blueprint if the house goes up contrary to the blueprint the contractor will tear it down rebuild it but it's got to go to the blueprint no matter what your experience is then if something in you listen tells you that the bible isn't true that power of god apostles prophets and teachers and pastors and the gifts of the spirit just isn't the same i wish i could hammer that today because that cessation doctrine comes in in churches even with pastors and and people who don't believe in preachers that cessation doctrine where you put it all back some other age he said but if something in you tells you that the bible isn't true that the power of god apostles prophets teachers and pastors and the gifts of the spirit just isn't the same as it was when it flowed through them apostles at pentecost there's something wrong with your absolute oh god help us today it has to tie to a denominational creed instead of to god's bible watch what people do when they believe something they say well i believe that there's no preachers anymore i believe there's no gifts anymore the spirit of god you say by the men we don't hardly ever see speaking in tongues you believe in speaking in tongues absolutely how could i not that's in the bible we don't see a lot of prophecy in the church well number one i think we see more than you realize but you take that and think you know things happen and sometimes we don't recognize god moving but do i believe in it absolutely because if i don't believe in that how do i stand up here as a minister i can't separate the nine spiritual gifts from the five ministerial gifts right you can't separate those two and if you do away with one you've got to do away with the other right you're doing away with all of it what you've done you watch somebody that'll preach that they'll take you to a creed well so and so said brother so-and-so said that that this this is past we don't do that no more but what does the bible say it has to tie to the denominational creed instead of god's bible when he said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail he said watch what your absolute is amen watch what your absolute is now watch why your absolute has to be a person what person did they meet they met the person of elohim the absolute manifested in the logos the pillar of fire john 1 1 said in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made that was an absolute right all that god was he poured into christ yeah verse 14 says the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld its glory the glorious of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth we beheld it we met the absolute and they met christ first corinthians 15 3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received i'm not going to be able to finish all this musicians come we got more services so i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received now that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures that he was seen as cephas then of the twelve after that he was seen of above 500 brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are falling asleep after that he was seen of james said of all the apostles he's running down a history of the people that saw a resurrected christ he was seen of james and of all the apostles and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time and i love that because he wasn't born with all the others but that word if you go research it one point out of due time it's like one born prematurely one born traumatically he didn't bring himself into the message amen he was born amen by the word of god hallelujah he says i last of all he would see to me also what does that mean i saw him just as much as they saw him even though i didn't see him in the flesh amen he said for i am the least of all the apostles that i'm not meant to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god amen i think we can all stand on this today by the grace of god i am what i am amen could you stand with me today by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain there was a vindication that followed the absolute but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me amen could you bow your heads with me today by the grace of god i am what i am oh if we could just think of how far he brought us how deep we were in sin how how much paul had persecuted the church he had his own ideas he had his sanhedrin for an absolute but there come a time there come a day when he met christ and when he met christ everything changed and on those sacred sands brother adam talks about sacred sands going look it up in the message sacred sands it's that place where god meets you that place every one of us has to have a sacred fans john wesley met him luther met him in a convent john wesley met him in a little mission in alder's game he said my heart was strangely warmed it was sacred sands brother branham met him in a little shot a little shed outside the house and he said that was my absolute amen he there was sacred fans i met him in the basement of a house amen with sacred sense amen and i can go back to that moment but let me tell you today we still are on sacred stance we can meet him today if you have a need today if there's something in your life that you need to you need a supernatural god you need an
