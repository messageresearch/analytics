just a good group of young people we got here goodlooking group huh amen 1st Samuel 16 And1 and the Lord said unto Samuel how long wil thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel fill th horn with oil and go and I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have provided me a king among his sons amen you can be seated here this evening just want to speak to you tonight this a title um elected to be anointed and a young people after God's heart and uh just thankful for these young people tonight amen well we look here that how me knows that that God searches the heart of a man he searches the heart of a man and a woman and the word is which is God knows the very thought and and intent of every heart he knows what we're thinking uh he knows there's nothing that you can hide from him God knows our intents he knows our desires he knows every thought and but and here the the heart God searches the heart and the Heart Is that inner man come on the innermost being that is your will that is the soul that is the understanding of a man but in the beginning we know that Satan chose the the Mind as a Battleground and God would meet him on that Battleground and and but that's what Satan wanted to control he he wanted to control the mind he wanted to uh to have mind control of of our lives but Satan chose the mind but God brother said God chose the heart and the heart that he chose the heart as his and and God's desire is not just to fill your mind or just to control your life as the devil would and and try to ruin your life but God desire is to is to dwell in Your Heart by his love amen he's not he doesn't want to rule You by a law but he wants to rule You by his grace amen he wants to rule You by his love by his omnipotence and that that word omnipotence means that he is all powerful that God is all powerful Satan is a powerful being and he can do so much to our lives and and certainly he is a powerful being but Satan is not all powerful as God is but God wants to rule in your life by that omnipotence by the power that he has to sit on the throne of your heart that's good amen and and and reveal himself as that that on om nipotent God to manifest in your life every promise of the Bible and so and God in his supreme power and love he mean he doesn't just want one way but he wants uh he just doesn't want this love in one way but he he wants something in return he wants something from our lives he wants something from you he just doesn't want to project himself as his God but he wants something from Return he wants someone to love him back oh yes someone to believe him that's good and so he he wants to reveal himself and and we receive that into our hearts and believe his word from our heart that's what God want God wants somebody to believe his word in this hour thank the Lord he wants somebody to desire that indwelling of his presence you know you could there's a lot of people that go through their entire lives and never have that thought cross with with God coming in my life would God fill my life but we want to we want to impart that to you as young people we want to impart that to our children and that desire and and pass that on that that that there is a desire that that can be in your heart that if you desire that there's something there that can feel that thirst amen a desire that God would come into you that God would indwell in you that he wouldn't just be a God to you uh but but that you could have a relation relationship with him come on Amen it's hard uh preparing to preach to young people you got to be on your toes you know they're listening and so yeah come on I don't know it's stressful for preparing for preach for these little Fellers we want we want some to preach something that'll help them amen so what a what a what a great thing that would be to desire say God would you come into my life would you come and fill me with your presence amen how many young people have that desire and no doubt we've got young people here that have that have been filled with the Holy Ghost and no doubt we're going to have more that's going to be filled with the Holy Ghost but you've got to have there's got to be something in you longing for that and I say it's for you here this evening it's here for you in this hour it's here for you amen when you when you come into this place Amen in this atmosphere amen there's something you can receive if your heart longs for it there's a God Amen that that plac that hunger there and there's a God that can fulfill that hunger and that thirst that you would have for him and the only the only way to truly have that this this this relationship and a love for the things of God and love for the the hearing of the word and and the things of God and and what what goes on in the house of God and and the power of God that that can become personal to you amen amen it's not just it's not just something out here uh that you can just just casually walk by but there's an indwelling of that power that goes with you with you that walks with you that'll never leave you nor forsake you but that that it will be part of you and so we must we must search search for these things and God places that desire in you amen we can't search out God but God places that desire in US amen and if you've got a little bit of that desire amen God himself deposited that there yes amen something that you would long Amen to to be in his presence to have his presence be in you now I pray that there's some young people here that know him in that way here this evening we look here in the scripture that we read we see here the prophet Samuel mourning for Saul because he had been rejected by God as king and SA was the people's king and the people that day they had seen the Philistines that they had a king to lead and to rule over them and so they wanted the same thing and that the the the the name Saul means desired and the children of Israel had chosen Saul out of desire to be like the world but he was chosen from the wrong desire they had chosen him over God's provided way that he had made for them to walk in they had rejected the prophet Samuel the prophet who had the word of the Lord for them and Samuel was a type and represented the Holy Spirit to God's children and this Prophet only spoke as God led him to speak and and when the people called for Saul to be King Samuel said when have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass have I ever walked misbehaving before you have I ever begged you for money or or took anything from you but all that I've said has been for your good all that I've said has been from the Lord uhuh but they rejected they rejected God's provided way they wanted a king out of the wrong desire but even in this Samuel prayed and told the Lord to hearken under the voice of the people for they have not rejected you but they have rejected me we look at Saul just this character just for a few moments if we can Saul being uh the desire of the people but the wrong kind of King Saul was chosen by the people to be king he was a great and a mighty man in so much that the Bible said that the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he prophesied and they said among themselves what is this that has come under the sons of Kish the Bible says is s Paul also among the prophets but why did God reject him Saul disobeyed in his heart listen now Saul disobeyed in his heart and was turned from following the Commandments of the Lord come on and the Bible says when they had fought and destroyed the amalekites he and the people spared AAG the king and the Bible says and they kept the best of the sheep and the axling the o and the fatlings and the Lambs and that that what was good and did not destroy it as God commanded them but they used it to sacrifice and so there Saul became backslid in Israel the Bible says brother said the that Israel fell into a backslidden condition and we'll read here in 1st Samuel 15 I hope this is all right this evening 1st Samuel 15 and22 and Samuel said hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams verse 23 for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolater because thou has rejected the word of the Lord amen and he has has also rejected thee from being King and we look here at Saul we look at this character he was so full of rebellion and stubbornness to the word yeah and and and this evil spirit this evil spirit that would come upon him and and if you uh have a problem with the word if you have a problem with with this verse and this verse this verse and this verse you're just allowing the Devil to come in if you've got a problem with the word that is a wrong spirit and so Saul had a problem with the word he had a problem with obeying what the prophet told him to do and and Disobedience uh to the word will only make way for sin and and these evil spirits no doubt no doubt Saul was a good man and and and and the prophet Samuel mourned the Bible says because that God reject him but an evil spirit will take you from further than you want to go it'll take you places that you never thought you would go and we look at this he says for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and we look at it even years later uh Saul had an evil spirit on him and he got to a place where he couldn't hear from God he would he would inquire of God and God turned his ear to Saul and the Bible says that he turned to the witch of Endor to call the spirit of Samuel and Samuel when when Samuel came forth Samuel asked him why have you disturbed me why have you disturbed me oh that seeing that you've been rejected why have you disturbed me but but but Saul wanted to know a question he wanted to know what would happen in a battle and Samuel told him him and his sons would die in battle and that they would be with him soon listen see Saul had made himself so great that he got above the prophet amen he made himself so great that he got above the Commandments of God and but God but God wanted him to they wanted him to listen God wants us to listen to him God wanted him to not spare the king AAG he he didn't want him to spare the the best of the best and the The Oxen but he wanted them to go in and destroy the enemy because if you don't destroy your enemy your enemy is going to destroy you and that was go that's what was God he couldn't let that go on Amen it was s it was such an Abomination before him because because God's got a People amen and we've got to go after the enemy and not let the enemy hang around preach come on Lord help me to preach amen again if you if you don't destroy your enemy if I don't destroy my enemy my enemy will destroy me and God has given us the power Power by the blood of Jesus Christ to destroy every enemy to destroy every bit of sin young people anything that would try to hold you bondage God has given us the power to overcome that we look here he got so full of himself and I I was sitting last night um rocking my baby boy to sleep and I was thinking Lord what am I going to preach tomorrow but this came to me that Saul got so full of himself W that's right but but he had a king he had somebody on the back side of the desert that wasn't full of themselves but somebody that was longing to have the anointing poured upon them amen Saul got so full of himself that he leaned to his own understanding he was above the prophet he was above listening to tapes he was above listening to the message amen if we can just say something here this evening amen amen have a desire for the Holy Ghost have a desire for the word of God have a desire to get into the message of the hour because that's what's going to bring the anointing upon your life amen to come under the anointing of the message of the hour not the anointing of a man but what God sent in this hour amen God sent to you young people to fight with to overcome with amen have an interest in what God has spoke to us in this hour absolutely but he got so full of himself and that's why God rejected him come on and we've we can all identify with Saul we've all all been there we've all thought we were bigger than the word amen but let's have a different Spirit here among us this evening let's reject that that old life that old man that what we were that disobey God we were all like that but thank God for grace in this hour amen that that just that one piece of Disobedience that God writes us wres us off and reject us and bring somebody else in thank I'm thankful for the grace of Jesus Christ for my life amen so that's why God rejected him but there was a young person that's why he rejected sa but there was a young person on the backs side of the desert amen whose heart was pure amen and his name was David I I just love David I love that character and his name his name meant beloved amen his name meant beloved I I want to be I want to be identified with that I don't want to be identified with with Saul and desired by the world but I want to be identified with David in this hour beloved of God that that that God is with me that God fights my battles so his name was his name meant beloved he knew God by experience and he was a witness of his love and grace you've got to have an experience in this hour young people you can't just take somebody else's word for it you can't take my word for it but you've got to have an experience for yourself in this hour and I love how brother R put he was put there on on the back side of the desert he shut himself away from his Brethren he shut himself away amen out there ending the Sheep out there being about the father's business amen and what you do in secret what you do in the shadow it will manifest in the light amen amen what we do behind closed doors that that proves what your character is amen and David there Amen in his position at his post of Duty amen doing what the father had called him to do standing there amen he was happy amen he he was all out there by herself tending the Sheep but that's what he was called to do he was called to protect the Sheep he was called to watch over the Sheep thank you Lord well David he knew the power of God and David depended on the spirit of the Lord to fight his battles oh yeah amen and he was someone who had a heart to serve God someone who had a heart to obey the voice of the Lord to follow the Commandments of the Lord and that was the type of leader that God had for Israel that's the type of leader that Israel needed someone that hated sin amen someone that their heart was not defiled amen they weren't full of themselves full of the world's desires but they were able to come to God able to come to him empty amen and not full of themselves amen you young people are at a good time in your life the older you get the things of this life the things of this world will try to harden you they'll try to take the very knowledge of God from you the longer you go in life the more the more to this world you're exposed amen you're at a perfect opportunity you're at a perfect time like David On The Backs side of the desert amen we're all alone here in this hour we're all alone in this service amen amen for God to come and speak to your heart for God to come give you an experience amen amen where you hadn't been hardened from the things of this life amen anden your heart is tender your heart can receive I say receive him this hour receive him in this day man not just what Mama and Daddy has but something you can have for yourself that's good have a pure heart Psalms 24 and one have I been preaching for 30 minutes no somebody tell me no I messed up last time I preached that was my fault I read the time wrong but I got a pretty good idea where we're at now amen that's right Psalms 241 I love this Psalm of David the Earth is the Lords and the fullness there of the world and they that dwell therein verse two for he hath founded it upon the Seas and established it upon the floods and who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place Place verse four he that hath Clean Hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted his soul up unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and the righteousness from the god of his salvation and that word pure there means to be pure clear and sincere and mean it means to be clean and to be empty and I want to emphasize that here this this evening Amen to be empty to be pure is to be empty not to be filled with the things of this world not to be full of yourself but to be emptied out to be able to receive the blessing of God to be able to receive from God every service amen that we come to amen and we as a church that's that's the way we've got to come not full of our own intellect not full of our own ideas amen but come with an open heart come with an empty heart say God fill me AR fresh God fill me a new with your spirit he that hath clean hand hands and a pure heart an empty heart not full of himself not full of how great they think they are but an empty heart to be able to receive God gred Lord this Pure Heart Bible says who have not lifted up his soul unto vanity and that word vanity means means emptiness it means it means falsehood it means nothingness it means emptiness of speech or or ly I say this this evening blessed is the man who doesn't open himself up because because Satan Satan knows what kind of vessel you are and Satan is looking to fill your life with nothingness he's looking to fill your life with void amen he wants to control your mind he doesn't want to give you something in your life that'll help you he wants to control he wants to destroy and he know he's study man for 6,000 years he knows your ins young people he knows your outs amen the sins of your parents the sins of my parents it's visit upon us every bad strain amen that's ever been it's wound up in you and me amen and we've got to deal with that amen but I believe we've got a word I believe we've got a blessing in this hour we've got an anointing in this hour amen that there'll be a young people that'll break the cycle cycle that they won't they won't lift themselves up to this nothingness of Le de see but they'll cry out for the fire of God they'll cry out for the anointing of God say God come and fill me I've got just the least little bit of Hope I've got just the least little bit of desire and if you got just a little bit of that there's a creator that created that amen and there's a deep call to the Deep there's got to be a deep to respond amen there's a God that will come and feel that yeah that's all this world is is nothingness that's all denomination ever was was nothingness and and Saul type denomination he placed fear upon the people when they were in this backsliding condition it brought fear they they didn't know if they're going to win the battle or not and that's why it took a David it took somebody after God's Own Heart am mean somebody that had courage Amen to break the bonds of denomination to break the limits that Saul had placed upon the people and I say in this hour that's what the message of the hour has come to do amen amen and we're not just out here thinking outside of the box amen there is no box in this hour for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the limits have ripped off amen amen you are set for the skies amen yes sir yes sir thank you Lord come on amen that's what the spirit of David does that's what the spirit of the Beloved does Amen there's no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus

life don't let no smut come upon it we're living too late now we're living too late in the hour let's live it clean well my life your life all of our Lives need to be picked up before God and he goes on here and we understand it you know that they were going from Tucson to to to Jeffersonville and you know there there wasn't really message churches like there are now there wasn't established churches so they didn't have really have a good place to worship but he says there are young people just ride around from place to place from show to show and drifting further and further away from God he said that's the truth I see it in my children I see it in myself getting to a place he said you've got to assemble yourself together to worship to worship God he said the Bible we see as we see the day approaching that much more come together and he said that if there's only two people here he said you be one of them come on and if we come together to worship then we just amen there's something another about it Jesus said when two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the mid amen we've got to come together and worship in this hour not just come Amen in in just any old way but we've got to come with pure hearts we've got to come with Open Hearts empty Hearts amen that God would come and fill our lives come and fill our children's lives aren't you thankful you got a place to come amen amen if God would would allowed in these walls here amen oh yeah my children would receive help your children would receive help if these walls if if time holds and amen there will be a people that go from these walls here from hearing the word of the Lord that will not taste death come on that death amen death is brother Ben said this morning death will be defeated death will have its End Amen and from these walls from this generation from this royal priesthood amen as the word of the Lord amen Faithfully goes forward amen there will be people delivered there'll be people that are filled with the Holy Ghost there will be people that are healed of cancer there will be people that are healed of all kinds of things why because the word has returned in this hour the pess of the word amen and we've got to lift ourselves up to that pure word oh thank you Lord and let it have its preeminence Among Us amen we've got to come together in Worship in spirit and in truth we got to come together in an atmosphere amen amen I don't want my kids drifting here and there I don't want my kids in and out of church amen but I I want them to receive something that'll hold them

baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire thank you Lord amen amen amen amen amen how many am I up to is anybody counting how many ain't no way I'll listen to brother Wayne Lawson I turned him on I turned on a couple guys just to see brother Wayne Lawson was just as bad as I was and that sermon that I listen to I said nobody can say anything amen amen please stop no don't stop [Laughter] amen well we come I said we come in these These Walls here yeah we come to these walls to hear the message of the hour amen where the light of the hour can go forth to strike amen the light and the anointing of God can come forth and strike the predestinated elected seat of God Amen we come to empty ourselves we come to empty ourselves this evening Amen in 1956 I just love this he said the blood of Christ through the Holy Ghost is the only thing that will separate the church from the world denominations barriers and so forth and education will never do it it'll take the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our heart to pour itself out amen before God and empty up and when God has filled up that person then they are led by the Holy Ghost he says amen I like that he said now he's made a preparation for us listen to this he said he beat the life out of Christ sin did that at the cross oh my what a powerful statement that is that he beat the life out of Christ sent sin at the cross sin did that to Jesus man such a powerful thing is the cross in this hour amen when you come to the Cross amen it's a place of death it's a place where you empty yourself out it's not a place where you come built up in yourself where you come full of yourself but it's a place where you can come and die out amen and the powerful effect of Calvary what it's had upon the believer God didn't just do that to be doing it but he did it amen to deliver you out of hell he he did it to deliver you amen from every type of barage every hell that we live in this hour he did it to deliver you from leosa he did it to deliver you from Every curse of sin oh thank you Lord he didn't do it so we could be defeated so this be something that we could talk about something that we could just Adorn him for anden but let it have an effect amen Amen Let It Be a place where you come and die to yourself thank you Lord we've got to empty ourselves out at Calvary and he said in that life was beat out of man out of a man that lived and ate like you and I do and it has poured into us when we are emptied up and made light amen he didn't die to make us rich he didn't die amen amen that we could be that we could be in barage amen he who who knew no sin became became me that I might be become him by his righteousness Lord help me to speak tonight good amen you love the Lord tonight oh thank you Lord here he says here in 1962 we don't have to be smart we don't have to be educated we have to believe we have to Humble ourselves and empty ourselves for God to manifest himself through US empty up yourself get yourself out of the way the the biggest enemy you've got is yourself how many can say Amen to that come on I can raise both hands I'm my biggest enemy on sure you try to do things on your own you try to try to figure things out on your own but God just wants us to empty ourselves out before him God wants hearts that will stay true to his word and as we read in the scripture the Lord like this the Lord told Samuel go fill thine horn with oil I've got an elected king of my choosing that needs to be anointed amen God is looking for somebody that he can anoint in this hour God is looking for young people that he can move upon he's looking for hearts that have a desire to be filled with the Holy Ghost he's looking amen for hearts that have a desire to be refilled with the Holy Ghost amen and we should always Place amen emphasis on that experience amen before you build a life before you build any type of success in this life before a relationship with a boy or a girl before even food or drink amen the Christian is not a material minded amen person they are christm minded and Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and everything else will be added to you amen I I don't want to live material minded but I want to be christm minded amen I I want I want to put God first and everything God help us to put God first if you'll put him first amen before food or drink amen he'll give you the desires of your heart God will provide what you have need of thank you Lord but seek first his kingdom that word seek means to seek seek in order to find amen it's something that's obtainable it's not something that's Out Of Reach amen but it's something that's obtainable if Jesus gave us a promise Amen in the Bible said if if he said be ye perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect Jesus has got to make a way for me to be perfect and I can never be perfect Within Myself I can never be in perfect within this flesh amen but there's a perfect blood amen and mean there's a blood that can wash away every sin amen every filth amen from every person's life amen there's a blood that can make you pure and white as snow thank you Lord amen you believe that tonight yes thank you Lord Jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit for THS is the Kingdom of Heaven he said blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth it's not how great you can make yourself how full of yourself you can be but how you can empty yourself that's he goes on blessed are those that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled do you want to be filled tonight you want to be filled every day filled in so much that the devil don't know what to do with you that's how I want to live amen we look at Jesse's Sons here in first Samuel 16 we'll try to hurry Jesse's sons look here from from the oldest to the youngest the prophet Samuel called Jesse's sons and called I called them to a sacrifice in 1st Samuel 16:6 and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on alive and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as a man seeth for the man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart this here was the oldest of Jesse's sons and maybe the prophet was sitting there looking at him as he as he passed by and maybe he was similar in stature to to Saul and maybe had bring brought back memories of of how Saul carried himself and he said surely this is the the anointed that that I am to anoint him there he had great big shoulders brother B said tall and handsome amen maybe it was the best looking he had seen the way he carried himself maybe he was the best dressed and even the prophet thought surely this is him the Lord said look not on those things for I have refused him that's right and brother Bram says here questions and answers listen young people and today everything is based upon Hollywood Beauty and things like that when beauty is the secret thing of the heart not in outward appearance he said let them Adorn themselves not with an outward appearance but inward of a Meek A Gentle Spirit he said that's the Christian amen and and he says on here in 1962 he said we can never compare with the world we're we're doing wrong by trying to act like the world we can never compare with them and we've got no business on their grounds bring them over onto their grounds he said we've got something that they haven't got but he said you go to acting like them he said then they know we're saying something we have in God he said let the world come to us not us go out to the world he said you know Hollywood shines but the gospel glows he said there's a lot of difference between shining and glowing amen glow not shine with the outward appearance but glow on the inside by the Holy Ghost listen young people with sweetness with meekness with gentleness patience and love glow don't shine shine is after the world oh yes and I like what brother Ben has been saying as we're as the tree is being restored we're coming back up to the pyramid amen and brotherly love that love that meekness that gentleness amen not being hard to deal with not being contrary all the time just being a good old Christian amen that's what's going to that's what's going to Glow in this hour that's what's going to that's what's going to Glow the world's makeup will shine but the word glows come on you ain't got to try to dress up to the world standards to Hollywood standard Hollywood is going to burn it's literally it's it's literally burning amen these past few weeks it's literally been on fire those people they don't even want to rebuild they want to leave that place amen they know something is setting in amen you they know the judgment is is setting in in the land God help me to preach in this hour amen Hollywood is going to burn but the bride is baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen this world's going to burn this world's going to end up in Tribulation but the bride is going to leave here in a Rapture I believe I'm preaching to young people amen that have been elected to be anointed in this hour to overcome this Hollywood overcome this hell and go in a Rapture don't count yourselves out young people this message amen it it doesn't classify anybody it didn't just come to the old people or the middle age or just to the young people amen but this message is for you it's for every one of us don't rule yourself out just because you're young just because you're little come on come on just cuz you're little Luke come on that's cuz you're little buddy Paxton I can pick on them boys a little bit you love the Lord tonight yes sir amen thank Lord each son of Jesse came before The Prophet the oldest down to the youngest from the tallest down to the shortest 1st Samuel 16:11 and Samuel said unto Jesse are all thy children here and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest I thought of y'all when I when I Was preparing for this there remain of the young behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither Prophet said I'm going to stand here till he comes all right because he the last one he is the anointed yes sir oh yeah and he sent and brought him in the Bible says now he was Ruddy that means red like Esau I guess maybe he was redheaded or something I guess he was Ruddy and with all B says a beautiful countenance and godly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of the O listen to this for Sam then Samuel took the Horn of the oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward and so Samuel Rose and went upama there in the midst of his Brethren was he anointed and I thought of Jesus there at the at the river that day when he was baptized there anointing and the the Holy Ghost fell the anointing came down down upon him for his three and 1/2 years of service the anointing came down amongst his brethren in so much that John said behold this is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world but that word anoint there that word anoint means to to smear and to anoint to spread liquid to smear so there in the midst of his Brethren the prophet takes the oil and he smears it upon him like this went all over [Laughter] him your hair looks good I won't do it to you your hair don't look that good he took the oil he smeared it upon him and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren amen am man poured the entire thing out out upon him not Des sparingly come not just to drop but he poured the entire thing upon Him amen and if you're the elected seed of God in this hour if you've been elected to be anointed that's because you are the seed of God we understand that the anointing can fall upon anybody but the seed of God is what the anointing was for to manifest that seed that was within you now I can't say this one's got it and this one don't or this one don't and this one does because I'm not God but God knows who's his and when he anoints them when he anoints these young people when he anointed me when he anointed you God didn't do it halfway but God poured the fullness of that anointing upon that seed amen come on the fullness of the power thank the Lord amen the fullness of the power amen the fullness of the word is coming this hour I know Jesus had the anointing the fullness of the anointing amen but the fullness of the word has come upon the bride in this hour and the fullness of the anointing is here amen and we're not just going to take it with a little little bit of this and a little bit of that amen but God gave us every bit amen the the fullness of the anointing the pillar of fire when God Came Upon the scene with a pillar of fire that was the fullness amen that was Jesus and God identified himself oh if our eyes could be open the spiritual our spiritual eyes could be open in this hour what is Among Us amen amen there's angels in this place amen amen there's Angels amen we're we're in an innumerable company of angels amen amen we are the Church of the first born Amen in this hour we have come to Mount Zion we have come to the fullness of the word not just the old people not just the middleaged but to young people you have come to the mountain in this hour amen and we're going to take the mountain we've come to a showdown amen and we're not going to leave our young people we're not going to leave our old people amen everybody's going amen when they when they left Israel amen they didn't leave a hoof behind they didn't leave a child behind amen and under the token under the token message they came forth in Victory amen amen the Pharaoh said just get out just leave I'm try not to spit on you buddy they got so tired of them they got so tired of the Judgment of the plagues they told the people of God to leave they tried to barter with them they just the men go no we're all going yeah just the preachers go no we're all going come on we're all going in this hour sir I'm just preaching to you come on I pray God smears each and every one of you amen we look here 1955 your great warrior David I was thinking in the back I give every bit of my hair preach like brother Ben would you trade [Laughter] me I wish I could preach I'm I'm giving it all I got here tonight you love the Lord amen the great warrior David he said notice David was called by election yeah he was elected called anointed in place elected by God called from sheep her in to be the king anointed positionally placed and that word elected means elected together elected or chosen by God to eternal life amen to Proclaim there in another place it says to Proclaim anyone is elected to office to announce as appointed a king amen we have been divinely appointed in this hour we have been divinely appointed by the election of God this is David and so by the election amen he brought David for for by that calling and anointed him by the prophet amen he poured the oil upon him not just a little bit of it but he poured the entire thing upon Him amen and when he received that anointing then he was King yeah he he he he wasn't going to be king he was King God had identified him to be king though Saul was still King over Israel that was God's anointed man amen that was David was God's anointed king that he was bringing into power and he would positionally place him right that's good and so we look here he says how many Christians here raise up your hand he said you're not a Christian by your desire you're a Christian by God's desire he said no man can come to me except my father draws him first you was elected by God before the foundation of the world to be a Christian Amen to live in meekness to live in gentleness to have brotherly kindness to believe the word amen to to to accept the word to believe the word to have agape love to have God's love in you amen you was you was for ordained by God to be a Christian he said the first thing you was elected then when God elect you then he called you amen and you heeded to his call and then he poured the anointing oil upon you the Holy Ghost Amen in that cruise of all he said what does the O represent the Holy Spirit and when the O poured upon him he baptized him with the Holy Spirit he says I hope you get that just come fresh he poured the oil upon him it just went all over him the whole for hold full of it not sparingly thank you Lord and he says that's the way God pours the holy ghost on a man not sparingly just baptize him into it anointing with the spirit notice right then that when the anointing struck him he was positionally placed his King he said in your positionally placed in Christ Jesus as Kings and Priests is that right the moment you receive the Holy Spirit God places you in the kingdom and there what a beautiful place there you are amen I want to say I want to kind of finish with this God is not looking to set up another king but to positionally place Kings and Priests under the King of Kings I'll try to finish here to positionally place you not that you could build your own kingdom but to place you under the King of Kings amen amen to take the message sir to take the message and to

generation amen there's got to be somebody that will take the message and to carry it on amen and I say in this hour we don't just have any old message but we've got the king's message amen and this
