stand up and and just uh just take your time just just take your Liberty amen all right Genesis chapter 22 and verse 1. and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place so far off and I want you to notice they had traveled three days and then he looked and he saw the mountain where the Lord had told him to take Isaac and Abraham said to his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you I love the faith of Abraham here I and the lad will go and I and the lad will return and now he knew what he was going there to do but he would call things that were as though they were not the faith of Abraham and Abraham took the wood and the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here my my son he said behold the fire in the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an off an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the word tonight I just love the story of Abraham here because it is showing you the faith that he had in the midst of a trial and they had waited on this sun for 25 years and they had they had he had to believe God for this so they had to wait all this time to get a son and then when they have this son he gets up I believe brother Branham says he might have been around 12 to 14 years old so they have this son they raise him up and he's a little teenager now or a preteen and and God says take him up to this mountain and offer him as a sacrifice now I'll be honest with you if the Lord told me to take my son and offer him as a sacrifice I don't know that I could do that thankfully he hadn't done that to me but Abraham knew that the same God that brought Isaac in the first place after all he was a promised son there was nothing that he could do to have that child but God restored them back to where they could have a child so God gave it to him and the only way he could keep that son was by obeying the will of God that's what he had to do his whole life but Faith was speaking when it looked like the works were against the promise and brother Bram talks about this and and and now if you believe God gave you this son and and by him you would father Nations and would you take him to an altar and sacrifice his life and brother Brandon goes on and and he said see Abraham's Faith was not in the works but in the promise that he kept the word and believed God then God would make the promise come to pass even if it looked like it would be impossible God Specializes in the things thought impossible brother Branham says this he said there's one thing to teach something there's another thing for God to confirm it and say it's the truth there's one one thing to say something it's another thing to do something it's not hears it's doers show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith said Paul by my works if you believe it you'll act upon it that's it then your faith becomes works I would like you to notice that the works don't produce the faith the faith produces the works and and if you watch Abraham here he said now when the little boy was born he said God proving that after Abraham had held on for all these years when he was about 12 years old God said now Abraham I'll show the world that you got faith in me I've made you a father of many nations and this boy in him I'm going to call the seed from Isaac and I say this that I want you to take Isaac out here and kill him he said the only hope that he had was in Isaac the only hope he had in his seed coming forth was in Isaac he said so I imagine Abraham couldn't even tell Sarah that he was going to take this fine little 12 or 14 year old boy down here a little curly hair hanging down around his shoulders and his only child both of them getting up in middle age again remember they had already gotten old once but they were going back again he said both of them get back in middle age again and he said well how could they do it take that he said I couldn't tell poor Sarah so he got all the wood together and put it on the mule got a couple of servants and noticed he went three days journey and then he looked afar off as the Bible said there and then he saw the mountain which he was to go to offer Isaac for sacrifice he said now ordinary man can walk anyhow 25 miles a day I'm not ordinary ordinary man can walk 25 miles a day I can maybe do five I don't know brother Stewart could probably do 20. maybe he's in shape and and so ordinarily in those days when you go in your car everywhere you go but he said them they they were used to walking and he went three days journey he was at least 75 miles back there when he looked and saw the mountain afar off probably another 25 miles so Abraham was told to take this child a hundred miles from home to go sacrificing now that's a that's a big that's a big task that Abraham's going to do here and so he looks often it's probably another 25 miles he said now he's hundreds of miles from civil as civilization he said and then when he comes close to the mountain he said to the servants he took the wood brother Brandon says the perfect type of Christ in God he said he laid the wood on Isaac's shoulders took the fire in his hand and took it took it this he said look at this now he said you stay here and the lad and I are going the honor to worship the lad and I shall return He said Glory I just had to let that come out you got to let it come out and it'll hurt you he said Glory I just had to let that come out look how did he do it he said the Bible said he had received him as one from the dead knowing that God could raise him up from the dead how is he going to come back Abraham you're going to kill him how's he going to return with you but he took God's word knowing that God had promised him that through Isaac God was going to do something he didn't know what but it wasn't his business to know what just walk on he said it's not your business to know what's next but it's your business to stay with the word of God he said well how's God going to heal me I don't know but walk on any out he said how am I going to tell my mother tonight that I got saved I can't tell you how am I going to tell my associates I receive the Holy Spirit and born again he said I can't tell you walk on he said Keep moving on lay aside everything and move on towards Calvary and that's what Abraham was doing here he had no idea if the Lord was actually going to provide a lamb but he said his word told me he would so I'm going to go on anyway he already told you he would heal you so walk on anyway he already told you he would give you the Holy Ghost walk on anyway walk on into the promises of God and every one of them are yours he said How's God going to heal me I don't know how's he going to save me I don't know I can't tell you he said walk on just keep going on move on right towards Calvary he said on they went up the Mountainside this little boy with the wood on his shoulder a type God giving his only begotten son in years to follow but God's showing there that he what he would do he said oh I just love it when he got up to the top of the hill he found a big rock for the Altar and laid the wood built the fire little Isaac said father he said here I am my son he said here's the wood here's the altar here's the fire but where's the lamb for the bird offering he said oh that down that old patriarch's heart he was trembling with the knife sticking on his side to take his own son's life he said God will provide himself a lamb for the offering it's not my business to argue about it or this that or the other he said God will provide he made the promise did he make a promise that you would receive the Holy Ghost after you were baptized then it don't matter how it comes when it comes it will happen he said thine thy house shall be saved if you hold on to that promise it may look like it's not going to happen but it will happen well that'll make somebody happy today it will happen you say well my children have went so far it looks like they could never come back my families went down so far I'll tell you sometimes I think to myself I've got siblings out there sometimes to me looking through the Human Side it looks like they could never come back but Looking Through The Eyes of Faith there is already been a land provided and God said you just go right on forward you keep moving on and God will provide a lamb for that situation every time he'll provide a lamb he said he made the promise he said brother I'm paralyzed I've been in this hand paralyzed how can I when I haven't seen for years I'm blind I don't know he said that God made the promise he said you get that down in your heart he said are you Abraham's seed how many Abraham's seed we have here today are you Abraham's seed he said now listen he said let that Faith come into you Abraham's seed notice when he takes this little boy buying hands in his feet he said Isaac never said a word obedient unto death just like Jesus was at the cross remember Isaac didn't fight until because he believed what his dad told him God's going to provide a lamb Isaac didn't struggle and say well no you're not going to sacrifice me no he was willing just like Christ was willing and he and his father had to be willing as well his father had to be willing to take him to the Cross his father had to be willing to put the wood on his shoulders and say go up here because there's going to be a type and God will provide himself a sacrifice he said notice he said he takes a little boy binds his hands at his feet Isaac never said a word obedient unto death just like Jesus At The Cross laid him up on the altar pulled out the knife the tears may be rolling down his cheeks and laid his hand on his little head brushed back his curls and pulled back his knife just like this raised his hands to plunge the knife into his own son's throat think about it he was willing he said it just like that he said he pulled back to the knife because God had told him to do it just about that time he got ready to act upon God's commandment and the Holy Spirit grabbed his hand and said Abraham stay your hand I know you love me he lets that test come upon you and you get like you just well I'm just going to keep marching on I'm going to keep going on you get down there to where it seems like you can't go any farther without something coming and taking your place and God says I know you love me here I am to provide a lamb for you and he said about that time right over behind him a ram hooked in the wilderness with his horns Bleed It Out he said Hallelujah he said Hallelujah means praise our god what was it Abraham loosed his son remember he was loosed because of a lamb that was provided he was loosed and freed because God had already provided a lamb why according to the promise of God he said what was it Abraham loosed his son went over and got this Ram burnt and burnt him as an offering instead he said I want to ask you something friends he called the name of the place Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice he said where did that Ram come from he was a hundred miles from civilization and beside that the ram couldn't have been there the wolves and lions and things could have eaten he said in another thing it's up on top of the mountain where there's no water remember this is an impossible situation and this is an impossible time when there shouldn't have been a ram up there there shouldn't have been a sacrifice made Abraham was told to go to a place where it looked like God couldn't keep his promise but he kept it anyway it looked like he couldn't do it there but God always keeps his appointments and he'll show up on time every time he said there's no water where did the ram come from he said Jehovah Jireh the Creator spoke the lamb into existence he is there at all times he is there at all times when you don't feel him he's there anyway when it looks like it's dark or the Mountain's too high he said I will be with you even in you until the end of the world and I'm here to tell you if you can just believe and step out on that abrahamic faith God will never leave him he'll never lose one of your children he'll never let you go he'll always bring you back to the place that he called Mariah and say I have provided for myself I have provided myself a lamb and he will take your sins he will take everything away from you why because it should have been you it should have been Isaac that was slain but why he couldn't let Isaac because he was the father of all the nations he couldn't let Christ not raise again because Spirit had to come back to the church the spirit had to come back he couldn't he couldn't leave him in the grave he couldn't leave him there why because he said I will never leave you comfortless so he had to send a comforter which is the Holy Spirit to the church do you believe it tonight he said he's the lamb that come into existence in one minute and die at the next minute see there's the real name of God it should have been Isaac but God had to use a lamb for a type he said he said he is there at all times the lamb that come into existence one minute died the next he said one man taking God's word god providing the thing and he's still Jehovah Jireh tonight that'll provide the sacrifice every time that a man or woman will take his word every time if you'll take his word he will never fail you he will never leave you comfortless he said I will come to you and I believe he's done it for you tonight I look around and I see lives change sitting here in the church Beck should have been out here in the world and Living For The Devil but you're sitting here tonight because God provided a lamb for you and you took the comforter and he rejuvenated you he changed you from the nature that you had and now you can't help but live for him why because the comforter has come the comforter is here tonight right and he's here to change every situation what was it it was a sacrifice on Calvary but then when he went into the grave and he conquered death hell in the grave and then when he come up he sent his Spirit here tonight there's no reason to doubt there's no reason to feel like you're in a vaccinating cold condition but it's your time to take a hold of the promises of God it's your time to say this is my time this is my fight this is my children this is my church I'm not going to let go until I can see God in his full manifestation Abraham was Fearless in his testimony brother Brandon said he talked about all the greats he said Abraham and Daniel and Noah and all of them they were Fearless in their testimony there wasn't nobody could tell him that God wasn't going to come through for them because they were Fearless in their testimony and Faith was expressed through the works think about it it showed that Abraham really had the faith when he went up there and he was willing to sacrifice when you're sick and we've had a lot of sickness going around but when you're sick it's hard for people to see that you actually have faith because you're sitting there and and you're just run down and and they're looking at you oh you don't have faith but when the healing comes nobody can deny the works if you don't believe me believe the works that I do and those Works aren't Just for Jesus they're not just for the apostles they are for you every one of you you say well why did I get over this cold a little quicker why didn't God keep me from getting covered why did he keep me getting cancer remember it looks like it's about ready to take your life but God has provided a lamb it looks like he's about to take you out but God was always standing there remember he's got the Angels sitting up here on the side and every one of them are just looking waiting and at the moment when it looks like you're just going to fall off the cliff they're standing there to catch a hold of you and God will never leave you you say well I love God and I have faith in God as long as things are going well that's not when God's going to show his his works but his show his works when it looks like you're going down when it looks like you have to give up it looks like I'll tell such a testimony sister Stephanie I love to see you in church because I can see where God is bringing you through and the trials that you've been through and you're still here anyway that shows there's faith in there every one of you been through something you say well it looked like I should have give up 20 years ago or 30 years ago it looked like I shouldn't have been here tonight but you are here why because there's abrahamic faith in there even when you don't see it even when you don't feel it he's there to bring you through anyway even when it looks like all hope is gone I serve a God who specializes in things thought impossible in John 14 12 he said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son he said if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it so see you've got to believe that it'll happen and then you can cry out in the name of Jesus and it will happen if you have the faith to believe it so see it doesn't happen The Works don't come over here and I can't come down here with no faith at all and you start healing people and say I'm going to cast out Devils I'm not sure it'll happen no it'll never happen but if you believe it'll happen then it will happen it's not you that's doing it but if you can receive the faith within you then God Will Make The Works come to pass in your life but remember the faith has to be there first and then the works will follow he said the works will follow so if you go on down here brother Brandon said your faith is what God sees in you your works is what other people see in you so the people will see the works but God sees the faith they didn't see Abraham's Faith until they realized that God could produce a son then they're like oh Abraham's got faith and over here he takes his son up to be sacrificed well I and the lad will return but I'm taking him up to sacrifice him had he actually died up on the mountain it would have showed that Abraham didn't have the faith for his testimony because Abraham had the faith then it came to pass because he had the faith for the son in the first place he had the son and it came to pass but you have to have the faith and then the works will follow he said in the works is what other people see in you faith is what God sees in you so remember I may not see the works of God in your life but God sees the faith that you have and when you need that faith it will make something come to pass I believe there's people sitting here that's got children that are out there backslid I believe the faith that God sees in you is going to bring them children back to the Lord I believe it I may not see the works I may never see the works but I believe the faith is in you and I believe it's going to happen I may not know I may not even have the faith for your children but you do because if you're sitting here and you had faith enough for your own salvation and faith enough for the Holy Ghost then the children are coming home every one of them will be there he said I won't leave for one of them I won't lose a one of them oh I hope you hear me tonight church God is not going to leave you comfortless but the Holy Ghost came to show you that whatsoever you have need of every promise in the book is yours it wasn't just for Abraham it wasn't just for Isaac but it's for you because we had a provided lamb in our day who died to take away the sins of the world and he said I'm not looking at the sins no more but I'm looking at the blood and I see you as a perfect sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ thank you so is faith that doesn't produce Works anyone has a right to doubt your testimony he said now do you hear it before we start the prayer line he's going into a prayer line he said if your faith doesn't produce works you can't make anyone believe that you're healed he said say well I don't know see yeah sure I got all the faith in the world he said you don't because if you are God if you got faith then works is married to Faith so the works will happen if you really have faith they're married together he says he said their husband and wife one identifies the other he said let that let's think of Abraham for just a few minutes he said Abraham got that Holy Union incomplete he got the whole thing together he called things contrary to his faith as though it was not now and he acted on the same principle now I hope you hear this just for a minute brother Branham goes into this and I just love this because it really breaks down the faith in the works and he said and acted on the same principle I can imagine he said after about 25 years somebody come by and said father of Nations huh Abraham you said your name was Abraham which means father of Nations just how many children do you have right now Abraham he said that didn't stumble him one bit somebody come up and told you you're not healed of cancer what about that what about that God you serve that shouldn't stumble you one bit well why are your children out here in the world and backslidden that shouldn't stumble you one bit not one bit come on because they're coming back if you believe they're coming back one way or another they're going to make it if you believe and he said that didn't stumble him a bit he said the Bible said he staggered not at the word of God through unbelief he went right ahead making ready keeping all the booties ready in the bird eye and everything he was going to have the baby that's all even Sarah said you know what's going to happen you're going to have the baby but I tell you the way we're going to do it Hagar is my maid and I'm going to give her to you because polygamy was legal in them days and she'll have the baby and I'll take the baby myself but Abraham didn't believe that nope he wouldn't do it but Sarah was inspired to do it so God told Abraham go ahead listen to her but he said yet this is not what I promised you see man tries to make their own way and we try to we try to make our own path but remember God's already provided a way and a lamb he's already provided a perfect sacrifice he's in that watch he called anything contrary goes on he said and his body then dead Sarah's womb the same he was an old man 100 years old Sarah was 90 years old now notice the deadness of Sarah's womb where the deadness of this body wasn't even brought under consideration listen to this for the promise that he should be at the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for it was by the by the law heir of faith is made void and the promise is not effect so if you're living under the law the promise is not effect he said because the law worketh wrath and where there is no law there is no transgression listen to this now why against hope all hopes was gone he said oh every time I go to feeling a little blue here's the chapter I turn to Romans 4 he said as it is written I have made thee a father of Nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and called those things which were not as though they were God said so brother Graham says see who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of Nations now brother Bradham actually says hope is the enemy of God if it's in that way now there is there's there's different hopes there where there's there's the there's there's two different hopes and we won't go into that because I don't have time but the Hope can be the enemy of God well I just hope it happens but you actually have to believe it's going to happen and not just speak it that's a good start that's a good start but you have to go forward and not just speak good things but you actually have to bleed from your heart what the world hears you say is not necessarily going to matter it's what they see happen to you and he said he said he considered not his own body or the dentist and he's staggered onto the promise of God through unbelief but with strong giving glory to God at a hundred years old look his body now dead Sarah's womb dead it wasn't even considered when it's revealed to him that bed is not even considered you're paralytic or whatever you are isn't considered the wheelchair is not under consideration for the little boy he may be paralyzed or whatever it is he said it's not under consideration remember the sickness is not even under consideration when you're believing I don't care how bad the cancer got I don't care how bad my body feels I believe God's going to heal me anyway I believe he's already done it I'm just waiting on the works to be made manifest he said but the doctor said he'll never get out of here the doctor said she'll never come that's not even considered look I'm an old person I'm getting middle-aged not even considered we are the children of Abraham he said Hallelujah not as Isaac was but his Royal seed through Jesus Christ by the faith that he had Abraham's seed coming forth in the last days to shine like the stars you're coming forth as Abraham's seed with the same Faith with the same promise the same thing Abraham had you are not smaller than Abraham you are not a Lester the Abraham you are the Royal Seed of Abraham with a perfect sacrifice he said by faith that he had Abraham's seed coming forth like the stars Abraham's children he said and he didn't consider his own body now Dad we don't consider the deadness of our body we don't consider I know brother JT is in the hospital right now and if he happens to watch us I hope he can hear don't consider the feeling of your own body don't look at what the stroke did to you but look to the promise that healing is the children's bread he said God said he would do it why he was revealed to him remember faith is a revelation Peter had the faith and it was a revelation to him and brother Branham goes into that with Peter and he talks about how he was a Believer and he knew who he was by what faith he had to have faith to know who he was he said when it's revealed to you he said you can't make it happen it's got to be revealed to you then you don't even consider anything else how impossible it is don't consider what the doctor said you don't consider what your mama said or what your papa said or what the preacher said or what anybody else said you just consider what God Said and what he said is always right it may not be what I'll tell you I might stand right up here tonight and I could say something that would be wrong and I wouldn't do that intentionally but I could mess up and say something wrong but what God says and what his word says will always be true and it will always stay till the end it will hold you you didn't hold on to the word of God but that word will hold you and it will keep you and it will keep your family and it will keep your children's children I'll tell you it's time that we start having the faith of Abraham and start believing and acting like the children of God there's no reason to be beat down and acting like we're forsaken because you're not forsaken the comforter has come the faith is now producing The Works in the bride of Christ Greater Works shall you do greater work see one place he said more but greater I believe greater in this age it looks like there's nothing there's not a literal Jesus walking around that can lay hands on you the best thing we can do but the word said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the same faith in that is just as powerful as if you could touch the literal Corporal body of Jesus Christ why because it's faith in his word it's faith that does it he said he considered not his own body it wasn't even brother consideration oh my that just shakes me the body's dead or the deadness of Sarah's womb we're not even brought and we're not even brought under consideration so Where Your Children Are Tonight should not even be brought under consideration they're so far out there I don't even know I don't believe they could ever come back in my human I'm thinking up here with the with the mentals in the mind and you're thinking well they went so far maybe maybe there's children that could be the the turtle lesbian or gay and all these things and and you're like they can never come back God couldn't save that oh yes he can because he made a promise that thy and thy house shall be saved he said if you believe and accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost This Promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off remember the faith that Abraham had was to Isaac and to his seed but the faith that we have came directly from Christ himself when he sacrificed himself remember it was Christ that died so that you wouldn't have to die you could live forever and I believe that's the way it is tonight you don't have to taste death because a Rapture is coming and there's a promise of it and all you have to do is believe for it and God will make it come to pass he said he goes on and brother Graham talks but but I believe that the signs are following the bride if you don't see him you just don't see the faith that God sees God sees the faith you're seeing the works but God also sees things that you'll never see remember Abraham told them told his servants to stay so they didn't actually see the testimony right they didn't see the testimony but Abraham was there the lab was provided and the promise came to pass and it wasn't made of a spectacle or a show but God made it happen anyway he may be working in your children's lives and you can't even see it he may be working on somebody that that looked like they've never been in church in their life and he's working on them and you don't know when they'll be sitting here they could be called to be a preacher they could be called to be a deacon they could be called to be a Sunday school teacher God can use anybody he wants to as long as you just let God work and quit trying to get in the way because God is always on time his word is always true and he will bring everyone back that was ever ordained to be there so what we have to do is quit worrying and quit thinking about it all the time you can pray for him that's right commit him to God but God's going to take care of it God's going to do the work you say well I doubt sometimes I do too I look at situations and I see from the human side of it but I don't see what God sees and God sees the faith in that person God sees the faith in that mother that's been praying all night God sees the faith in that father who has done his best God sees every prayer he knows every tear that falls and he's going to bring that child back home you say why are you preaching on this tonight it's not really in my notes about the children coming back but I feel compelled to do it because somebody needs to quit doubting about their children somebody needs to just believe for it somebody needs to believe for their family when it don't seem like it don't seem possible but sister Stephanie she may have looked like she couldn't come back but she's here today and I don't mean to single you out but I see your parents sitting there praising the Lord and I know that they're happy but they prayed for you and the prayers worked and the prayers will work for you and you and you every one of you the prayers will work they don't ever one go out they never go out void but the children are coming back thank you Lord the children are coming back I don't know how I don't know I don't know what it'll take but they're coming back anyway you say well I maybe you're maybe you're a younger person and you're looking at your your parents maybe they're the ones that need to come back they can come back too all you have to have he said die in thy house shall be saved he didn't say the younger couldn't have faith for the older and the older could have faith for the younger but if you can have the faith of Abraham then every one of them is coming back God won't lose one of them if we don't stagger at the promises of God on we're not going to lose one of them what did Abraham do you staggered not at the promise of God the impossibilities he staggered not at the impossibilities oh yeah just go ahead and think about it you say well it's just it's just impossible my family is impossible maybe your own life you feel like it's impossible to move forward into the Holy Ghost you say well I I've went as far as I can go and it seems like I just can't go any farther can you take God at his word can you believe God that the Holy Ghost is yours it's a promise to you well I did not get it when I got baptized why didn't I get it the next year or the year after five ten years I don't know why but God is holding on to you because you're still here and God is going to get you one way or the other and he's going to bring you in and fill you with the Holy Ghost whether you feel like it or not he said what would a man 75 years old with a 65 year old wife do if they went to a doctor and said we want to make arrangements at the hospital we're going to have a baby brother Bill can I pick on you for a minute buddy Hey Brother Bill and sister Karen went down to the hospital and they said we want to make arrangements we're going to have a baby when's the baby due nine months I don't know it's coming we just want to reserve a room you know we're a little we're getting a little old well I know I know you don't get very many customers like us but but here we are and they would probably take you down to the insane institution you know brother Brandon said they would do that to Abraham but if God told you to do it then you'd do it anyway right no matter how crazy the world says you are you do it anyway and so brother Graham says what would the what would the hospital do he said 25 years later they went back and said doc you still holding the hospital open for us now you were 75 years old the first time now you're 100 going back down there and in 25 years you're going to be more than 100. you're gonna go down there doc walking there on your cane I imagine it 110 or whatever you'll be you'd probably have a cane at that point you walk in there doc doc we're we're still holding out we're gonna have that baby can you imagine the reaction you'd make the news for sure we're going to have a baby you keep the hospital open he said see it makes you act funny your decisions are odd to the world but it's a Believer no matter how strange it seems I love that you're a Believer no matter how strange you see if you go to work and they call you crazy for the way you dress and the way you act you're a Believer anyway I don't care what they say when you go up they can call you gone you're gonna be gone you're gonna be leaving it don't matter what they say you're going to be looking down and they're going to be sitting here and the bombs are going to be falling and you're gonna be up there and and think about it they were laughing at you and now you're really you're up On Eagle's Wings because the faith of Abraham was in you he said it makes you act funny but no matter how strange it seems the Bible said he was fully persuaded that God was able to perform what he said he would do now God was able to perform that he said that ought to be the achievement now I hope you hear this part that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon God is able to keep every word that he said he would do God doesn't lie to people if he said he would heal you then he already did if he said he would save you in the finished work if he said thy in thy house shall be saved just believe it if he said he said forsake all and follow me it may not look like a good decision do it anyway and watch God go to bat for you watch God show up what it looks like he shouldn't be there watch God show up on the mountain when there's nothing around you and there's no life anywhere and it's just dead and there's a desert and you're looking down and you're like Lord I don't see nothing and you step down there and you go to sacrifice your son and God has come on the scene and he said go ahead Abraham he said just pull that hand back and take his life and he goes to do it and what happens next yeah guess who shows up guess who keeps his word the same God that always has and always will he'll never leave you that's where the comforter is so important peace of God the comforter has already come he's already come I will send the comforter which is the Holy Ghost he will come to you he will comfort you he will keep you in the time of trouble when it looks like that you can't go any farther and the midst of Trials and it looks like the mountain is too high your faith can pick up that mountain and move it and throw it into the sea because of the faith of Abraham now I would like to present this to you you may not feel like you have that faith but have you faced the mountain that needs moved yet if there's no other way then the faith is there to move the mountain if there's no other way then God made a way for the children of Israel to get through the sea there was no way around it they had to go through it if your situation is so dire that there's no other way sometimes God will say well maybe you need to look ahead and check out the word maybe there is another way but when there is no way God makes a way when there is no path God opens the sea when the Mountain's too high he can tunnel through it he can move the mountain he can move whatever he has to do because God is still God I hope you can see it tonight the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob is still God he's still here among us today he didn't change he said I am God and I change God he never changed he never gives up he keeps on keeps on keeping on because he's God and remember when he sent the holy ghost that was the comforter that would be in you and with you so when you feel like God's Not There that's just a false feeling from the Devil because God is not just with you he's not riding in the car with you he's in you you are the Bride of Jesus Christ that God has called and therefore you can do the same works that Jesus did because the works that Christ himself did he said you would do well I just don't see him brother Joel I don't see him have you looked at your own life and thought that that was the greatest miracle that could ever happen have you ever looked back and said that's where I was that's what I should have been but here I am I'm serving God today because he brought me out of the Maori clay because he put my feet on the Rock and he said you are my child and I'm not going to lose you he said Abraham take your son up there but you're not you're going to come back with him see Abraham knew he wasn't going to kill the child he just didn't know how long God was going to let it go before he had to pull that hand back and he was willing to kill the son knowing that God could raise him up because he had already received him as one from the dead so if God could bring him out of the deadness of a womb once he could bring him out of the death again and God will never leave you in a dead dry cold condition but he will give you the Life of Christ in you all you have to do is believe it all you have to do is believe it you have to walk out on it take it he said walk on don't stop that's what happened to the children of Israel they stopped but the promises were just ahead but it looked like they couldn't get there because the Giants were in the way it looks like you can't get across because the Giants are in your way it looks like the children can't come back because they've went too far but those are just Giants and we're more than able to take the land because we have the Faith of Our Father Abraham and because Jesus Christ himself has come down and in you today has sent the Holy Ghost to do the same works it's not my flesh that can do the works it's not even the physical touch but it's faith in the word that if I lay my hands on you you shall recover it's not my hands to do the healing it wasn't the woman that touched Jesus it wasn't a physical touch that did the healing but what it was was her faith in the promised son that had come it is not just the it's not your faith and your pastor you say well if you lay hands on me I can get healed remember that is true but it's not his physical hands that do it it is the promise coming to pass that if he lays his hands then you shall recover it's not just the physical of it but it is the god making his Works come to pass by your faith it is for Faith producing the works works is Faith expressed faith is not works expressed works or faith expressed and he goes on he talks about being funny and acting funny for the bill we went through this he said that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon I don't care what the denominations say days of Miracles has passed all this is telepathy it's fortune telling it doesn't matter to me what they say I still believe is that your testimony today I don't care what this church down the street says I don't care what they say on the line about the message that I follow come on somebody else I don't care what they say I don't care if they call this a false prophet I've seen the works I've seen the works of Abraham I've seen The Works in his ministry show me your works show me what you've done he said how can you believe it if the works didn't happen I'm not going to go believe some TV evangelist that tells me they have a gift of God if they can't stand there and just like Abraham turn as the man that visited Abraham and gave him the promise he had to turn around and put his back to the tent and in our day an angel came and did the same thing in a man and he turned around and he discerned the people's thoughts if that don't build your faith and give you the faith of Abraham brother I don't know what will because we have seen the same sign Abraham saw same sign that came to Abraham has come to you think about it no other age saw that you said Jesus was here that's right he was the son of God that came but in just a mortal man that could stand there in the Pulpit just like I am he can stand here right now and he could turn and look this way and with his back he could call out any person in this room if he had never met you before and tell you exactly what's wrong with you where you live he could tell you your family's history you that was not a man that was God showing his Works in our day that he said I'm just showing you that the word is true he was only here to show you that what he promised would come to pass and remember it wasn't a man that we worship it's not just the band of 50 60 years ago that was walking around on the earth that's not what we worship but the god that showed himself visible to the people it was God that showed himself a sign he was producing the same works of Jesus and that's why we followed him Jesus said if you don't believe me believe the works that I do because the works will show see Abraham had he made the claim I'm going to have a son and I'm going to call his name Isaac had he had that child with the other woman it wouldn't have been a a promise of God well I I had a child but it wasn't with Sarah like that like it was promised well then I can't believe the works that you do Abraham because your faith didn't produce the works that you said it would do but this faith will and that's the beauty of the story is that the faith did produce exactly what Abraham said it would produce and when brother Branham came in this day he he knew what the word said and he produced exactly what the word said he would do now I have to believe the message because I believe the word and the word shows me that the message was to come and so I have to believe it it's not following a man or a personality there's many of them you could follow yeah and I can I can show you many of them they would say well brother Branham was a was a real prophet of God but we don't believe his words what nonsense I mean you didn't know who Jesus was until he did the works right had Jesus never done a single Miracle you say well he's still been God I've heard the song but you wouldn't have known he was God and had he not done the works he couldn't have proved he was gone but he did the works that was promised of him and so did Abraham and so will you because you have the same promise it didn't have to stop with brother Branham now that was a gift where he could turn his back but the promise of of believing the promise of laying your hands on the people the promise of going into all the world and preaching the gospel and these signs shall follow them that what believe they had to have faith with no faith you're not a believer so if you have faith in God then you are a Believer then the works will follow and it's not just any works but it will be the same works that Jesus did it'll be the same Works made manifested Abraham's day it'll be the same Works made manifest right in our day because I've seen men that were dying with cancer that have still they're still going I'll take brother Ron Spitzer I was listening to him the other night the man was supposed to have been dead several years ago and he's still preaching the gospel today I can show you where a sister I believe I believe her I can't think of her name right off the bat but I could tell you particular testimony brother Joe Adams told you about it when he was here she was ate up with cancer they gave her just maybe a month or two to live but God miraculously took every cell of cancer out of her body you say well why isn't it happening to me you are the greatest Miracle of all of them because brought you from something he took you out of where you were and you're still here tonight you say if you could only see where I was see where I was 10 years ago there's no way I could see myself standing here tonight preaching to you if you could see where I was if you could see if I could look back at every one of your lives maybe you would never want us to see your life I heard a preacher say if if you could look through 10 years ago at what you were looking at on the internet and your social media accounts he said oh you'd want to burn that you wouldn't want to see that but God brought you through that because why he said greater is he that is in you than in he that is in the world greater is he that is in you than than pornography greater is he that is in you than the things on the internet that you shouldn't be looking at greater is he that is in you than the sickness that has tried to overtake you greater is he that is in you than all the Devils that Satan has every angel that Satan is gone he's got him coming down here trying to take our young people he's got him down here trying to take out our old people he's got them trying to take our families out of church what is it God trying to God is showing you today that you can't overcome by the faith but Satan's over here doing everything he can because he knows the end is near and he knows there's going to be a bride that will overcome all things and he said that bride is on the earth now I believed him I believe that things have happened that has to happen I believe that this generation is the generation that's going to see the finality of it all and you're going to see God come back you're going to see a man a literal body of Jesus come back and take you home with him brother Brandon said Believers believe that yes he said the literal body is coming back he said in Believers believe that I've got the quote in here he said Believers believe that he said that's the reason I do believe that when that bride is called out and elected and said in the Book of Life there will come a sound from heaven that'll take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride it'll take her from the earth in a rapturing Grace I love how he says because Grace is going to take you out of here Grace is going to take you home God promised it don't care how many science and how many astronauts they signed up and everything else and how many millions of miles they can see I don't care nothing about that there's a heaven and there is a literal Jesus Christ and there will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story no matter how it seems it can't happen it's still the truth and God said so he said that's what Believers believe that's what Believers believe there is coming a time when you don't have to be in this body no more brother Bill it could happen right now it could happen in the morning when you wake up and you look in the mirror and you're like oh my goodness I'm 20 years old again but it's going to happen it sounds like a story but it's gonna happen he said you would be turned back just like Abraham and Sarah that same Faith that's in you is going to turn you back like they were and it's going to take you in a Rapture just as sure as I'm standing here it's going to take you home he said that's what Believers believe we are believers today right so Believers believe what that the literal Body of Christ is coming back he said God's God said I'm the Lord heals all thy diseases I am God and I change not God is word and if God don't change how is the word going to change he said I am God and I change not the scripture says that God said it himself and if he cannot change then he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the unchangeable word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he said yes sir God raised up bodies all down through Moses Ezekiel Jeremiah and Isaiah Elijah's all down where his word temporarily come but the full word was made manifest in This Man Called Jesus Christ the full word was manifested there he said which he was God God in the fullness of the godhead bodily he said there he was made flesh he said I believe that every word so again a Believer believes that when God said I am the god that heals all thy diseases Believers believe that if God said thy in thy house shall be saved Believers believe that if he said by his stripes you are healed Believers believe that there's nothing can make you not believe that sickness can come right all kinds of spirits can come upon you and try to make you disbelief that pull you this way and pull you that way but greater is he that is in you and Believers believe that he said Christ was God's word may manifest I'm out of time I'm sorry Christ was God's word made manifest he died gave his life that he might send the spirit take his body up and send the spirit back he said pay the redeeming price he said if we'll believe it that's it right there if you believe it he that believeth on me the works that I do then come the Holy Spirit upon the same word of God now you say where do you throw it upon the Bible then the Bible has got to be in you the word is a seed as long as it's laying here it won't do nothing as long as it's laying here it won't do nothing he said but when it comes in here and when it comes in the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit The Works of God I hope you can see this today and I I I may be pushing this in Russian a little bit here but but if you can just remember the works of God are coming and they're being made manifest not by you but by the holy spirit in you making the works manifest it's the faith in you that is producing The Works he said power comes humility comes all your know-it-all is gone you become nothing Christ becomes alive you die he lives there it is cause he died I live he said and when he lives again and when excuse me and when I die he promised me life and I died out to myself I died after this nature the sticky nature is always going to be there fighting but I died out to self in my thinking to take on his faith he said so and he lives again he said by taking his word his seed put his seed in here by faith and believe it and it produces exactly what the Bible said and it always will it will always produce everything the word says because it is a word seed that has been put on you inside of you and the Holy Spirit Waters the seed and brings it to life and brings to pass every promise of God thank you Lord he said we've went and made schools in Bible schools I'll hurry seminaries built fine buildings he said certainly that was not the commission he said that's all right I can't say nothing evil against him they played their part but he said but that wasn't the commission the commission was going to all the world and preach the gospel preaching the gospel was to demonstrate the power it had to be I love that demonstrate the power it had to be he says it had to be what's the next verse and these signs shall follow them that believe that's the manifestations the demonstrations are the works that the word made positive I love that the word made this so positive to us as we heard this morning and the word has come he said the word is preached signs of the word confirms the word to be true if it doesn't it doesn't come from the heart of faith it doesn't anchor in the heart of Faith he said did not Jesus say that some sowed seeds and when they did it fell by the wayside and the birds gathered someone in Stony ground and Riches of the earth choked them out like the Briars and so forth and didn't he say some went over and brought forth the hundredfold see you must first let the word fall in the right type of faith and then that Faith produces what the word says I love that the word will produce what the faith says all of it tonight the demonstrations are the words I'm going to skip down here and try to close I apologize way too many notes he said John the Baptist expressed his faith by his works when he said there stands one among you just think of that Saint John I got the scripture John 1 26 he said he said they said the Messiah is coming he said what's the matter with you we've been looking for him for 4 000 years see they didn't believe it but John did because he believed he was the one to four run it so many could say well I don't be the rapture's taking place but we see the Forerunner of that time so we know this is the day he said he said we've been looking for him for 4 000 years he said he's standing among you now he said so is he tonight I love it he's standing here tonight the old song Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by I'll do one better oh yes look down into the heart of faith and realize he's right there in you he expressed his faith by his Revelation because it was revealed to him that he would baptize the Messiah you see the faith of Abraham you see every god-called man overcame and their testimony came to pass because of faith in the word and so will it happen today he says I'm going to start I'm going to try to close here I promise he said Abraham staggered not but he grew stronger all the time because he believed by faith what God would do job knew what he had done Jehovah's built Jehovah's bidding he knew that he had done Jehovah's bidding he had faith in what he done because Jehovah required it he said can we just do that Jehovah required a burnt offering for his sin and job not only for himself but for his children God had made a burnt offering he said that's all God he said oh you say that's all God required he said well he said I wish that's all he required today he said it's less than that oh my it's just faith in his word and he said if you make his word you're absolute as musicians go ahead and come if you make his word you're absolute now I'd like to just say that one more time we're not making a man an absolute we're not making a group an absolute but if you make the word of God you're absolute then you can have any Divine promise in the Bible and you can tie your soul to it I'm going to tie my soul to it tonight I'm going to stay here I'm gonna hold on and I'm going to keep looking forward I'm not staying over here on this side of the river I don't care how many Giants are over there to fight me I'm going anyway if God tells me to take everything I've got and try to sacrifice it I know that he'll provide another way and he'll do the same for you tonight you say my faith is weak well you don't have to have the weak faith you can just believe God and when your faith gets weak cry out to him Lord raise my faith in you give me that abrahamic faith and I believe it's there so when you cry out to him then God will make that Faith produce The Works do you believe that tonight can we stand together is your soul tied to the absolute the word tonight that I believe you can take hold thank you Lord Of The Wings of Faith do you know that song Wings of Faith if we try to sing that if there's a need here tonight if you have anything you need just come up here we still believe in laying hands on the sick the promise of God that you shall recover and we believe it tonight don't you can you bow your heads with him for just a moment heavenly father as we bring this to a close Lord if nothing else is said I pray Lord that that you would just show the people that it's not something they have to work into but it's the faith inside that will produce the works on the outside and Lord if there's one here tonight who needs their faith to be raised in you I pray that she would just anoint them tonight with the faith that Abraham had Isaac had [Music] and then the very lamb that we look to today as a perfect sacrifice is coming our day and he sent his Spirit to the church so that we could have the faith then not one of our children would be gone not one of our family has to go by the wayside but we just hold to the promises of God every one of them and lean on the word of God and God's word will bring to pass the works that he promised in this day if there's one in here that would want to put your hand up to him and ask Lord raise my faith there's a mountain in my way there's something in front of me that I just can't conquer take the faith that is already in you faith that brought you to the house of God today take a hold of that faith and watch the mountain move watch the healing take place you could rise to a higher place you don't have to struggle but the faith of God can move and make you something greater than what you ever thought with your head's bowed and your eyes
