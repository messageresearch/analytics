back just to a throne in glory to stay there but you came down again and filled your church Lord with your Holy Spirit Arden we have little licks of fire today that we've brought together Lord and may your presence be felt and be known we're so thankful for it Lord I pray that I would not say anything this morning that would be out of your will keep me under the cross Lord keep me under Lord a sacrificial Lord Ministry that a Ministry of reconciliation Lord I I don't want to step outside of that I I want you to be my guide today and the guide of these people as we look into the scriptures and into the message of the hour I pray you just help us Lord you saw the hands that were raised and you see those that are sick many this morning that are sick and out of church a breed reached down with her out of their streaming today I I pray that a special blessing would come to them as they watch and listen and participate in the service Lord we'll give you all the praise and the glory and the honor for it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen is this one working amen turn with me to Joshua chapter 21 and verse 43. Joshua 21 and 43 and then Revelation 10 7 technology is great if it works I think that's my fault I forgot to check the batteries Joshua 21 43 in Revelation 10 7 brother Joel's in Wisconsin today and brother brother Willie he was looking forward to some time when you would come and get to fellowship with you and then he's gone so I'm going to rub that in that's what he gets for being gone so it's good to have brother Willie Valance and his family with us this morning and maybe someday you can come back and meet the other two-thirds of the church and and a number of folks gone today and brother uh so we'll just have one service today no afternoon service brother Timothy Pruitt will be with us for both Services next weekend so we're looking forward to that and just expect a special blessing from the Lord amen amen but I believe there is a special blessing for this morning how many believe that you come expecting amen let's go to Joshua 21 43 and the lord gave unto Israel all the land which he swear to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that he swear into their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand what did he do he kept his word and then Revelation 10 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished this is not the beginning of a mystery it's the finishing up of the mystery the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets what did he do he kept his word aren't you grateful for that today amen we want to talk about that again you may be seated there ever was an hour that we should not be ignorant of the word it's today it's an hour when when light is coming I got to thinking about me and my wife you know when we wake up we wake up differently I I wake up and I'm wide awake and my wife wakes up slowly and over time and so she'll wake up and she'll go in and turn one light on and and then she'll turn another light on and slowly turn the lights on when I get up I go through all all through the house and turn on all of the lights because because I want to have light I want to be able to see what I'm doing it's morning time and morning is a time for light and brother Branham told us that to the bride he said Shalom he said it's morning good morning it's morning time and I believe that this is not an hour of Darkness this is not an hour when we should walk around not knowing what we're talking about and not understanding the things of God and I know they're it's not an intellectual conception or or an ability just to understand with your mind but there's got to come a revelation in this hour that we know who we are and where we belong and and what our position in the word is and and that's what the the people of Israel were beginning to know as God kept his word to bring them out of Egypt and bring them into the land of Israel they begin to know the word became a lamp to their feet and the promises gave them light to be able to go in and take the land and that's where we're at today and so in Psalms 119 105 the Bible says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path how many could say Amen to that today I was walking in darkness but your word is a lamp to my feet I was I was in a room that was dark but a man came in and turned on the light the Christ came into the room amen and there's light here now this message is not a message of Darkness but it's a message of light so there's light now in the room and again in verse 130 of Psalms 119 it says the entrance of thy words the entrance of thy words now watch when your words enter the room when your words enter my life when your words enter my my brain my mind enter sink down into my heart when your words into the room there is light of thy words giveth light he giveth understanding unto the simple well I'm so glad brother Paul that he included me in that gives understanding to the simple happy birthday brother Paul I thought it was your birthday today God bless you aren't you glad to have light today Hey Man II Peter 1 19 says we have also a more sure word of Prophecy and I'm just building a background now to what we want to say this morning he said we have a more sure word of Prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place denominationalism was a dark place I don't want to go back to that Catholicism is a dark place I don't want to go back to that we've been set free from that and so the light shines in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arrives in your hearts the message is the light of the hour how many believe that today now but we are the Lesser lights and brother Branham taught us that Lester lion the moon or a star was a reflection of that great light and everything that of the moon has or everything that a star has it has no light in itself as much as it is a reflection of a greater light and it's reflecting a light somewhere it's brother Brandon talks about a star in other places he speaks about the moon but he he said if you could talk to the star and say star why do you shine he said well if he could talk he would say brother Branham I'm not shining but what's making you shine it's something shining on me it's the sun shining on me he said brother Branham I just happen to light up the path for you Oh my he said well then the true Pastor in the pulpit if he's anointed of God it's not the pastor Shining it's not him a good preacher but Stuart with Allen he said it's not him he said it's a good past good pastor it's not him it's the Holy Spirit shining on him giving the Gospel Light oh so I want to I'm so struck by that but while I was studying for the sermon but the George Moore sent me that quote and it just struck me because that's the hour that we live in we live in an hour of light light has entered the room it's not a time to be down and despondent and depressed and discouraged but it's a time to be excited because light is here he said arise and shine thy light has come amen do we believe that this morning amen so it's a positive word as we preached last week but I want to now kind of go into a more in depth and uh I struggle with I don't want to get so in depth that the children couldn't even understand I believe our children ought to be able to understand the opening of the word when I say that I mean the opening of uh the message the light that come in our day I believe they ought to be able to understand that I believe every one of us ought to be able to understand that it shouldn't be exclusive to preachers there's a lot there's a land here you might as well go in and take some and brother Brandon said where Pentecost failed he said they went and got grapes and said with speaking in tongues he said they went and got grapes and ate on the grapes and said oh this is all there is he said but there's houses there's land he said there's families there's all kinds of things on the other side of Jordan if you could just go in and take a look around I believe that in the land in the message of the hour is that's where our home life comes from that's where our our church life comes from that's where everything that we that we are and everything that we want to be it doesn't come from some 12-step program somewhere but it comes from the message of the hour that's our home life that's our church life that's everything that we have so we want to enter into that land we want to partake of it not just hang around and say well it's a good land it's wonderful somebody ought to take of it no we ought to be the ones that take of it amen so brother random if you go all the way back to his Commission when he was laid the Cornerstone of the Tabernacle in Jeffersonville he had a vision that he was at the place where John the Baptist baptized people and that they had turned it into a hog lot and and you all know that the vision don't have time to read it all this morning but just to kind of give a background and then he saw his own Tabernacle full of people and and he was so happy to see it full but the angel told him he picked him up he said this is not your Tabernacle took him outdoors and set him under the sky and said the world is your Tabernacle and he showed him the fruit trees where he planted if you'll remember in two different buckets he planted each one he said the Oneness and the trinity in their own bucket right are you following me so far and he'd plant them in their own bucket and they grew up in the branches intertwined together he said in the fruit fell at the cross where the branches crossed and when he was coming out of the vision three times the angel spoke to him and said read second Timothy chapter four read second Timothy chapter four and when he did he read down through verse five and so I want to read that this morning he said I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead and his appearing in his kingdom preach the word so this would be his commission not just to heal the sick although that was a commission that was given to him as well to go and and pray for God's sick children but now his commission would be to preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine we live in that age don't we but after their own lust or after their own desire shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables he said but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry and brother Branham did that excuse me it gets hot on this platform so he said do the work of an evangelist and that would be the first phase of his ministry so he recalls that commission and is this a sign of the answer and he says it's absolutely been fulfilled to the latter absolutely been fulfilled to the letter not one bit of it missed aren't you glad God kept his word God kept his word that there would be a Prophet come and he would have he would have the ability to do the work of an evangelist he would go and do that but he would preach the word all through that time he never got rid of that commission now he recalls that and he says it was fulfilled to the latter now his commission was to preach the word this would be the Capstone of his ministry not the healing campaigns but what we call again the opening of the word that's the phrase that brother Branham used it's not the first or the second pole but the third pole of his ministry remember he was standing there and he's fishing and the first bull attracted little bitty tiny fish and the second pole is just like a skin Over The Lure just a little bit bigger fish but he said the third poll attracted the big fish but he said when it did all the little fish scattered right and so the third poll was what brother Brandon said the third poll was uh the the opening of the seals and the opening of the word now brother random never refers to his ministry in that in during the time he's doing the work of an evangelist he doesn't refer to his ministry as a fulfillment of Revelation 10 7. did you know that if you go back and look and I know I'm just kind of teaching this morning but if you just bear with me a minute but the Branham doesn't he doesn't refer to that as far as I can tell until is this a sign of the answer and that's when you begin to bring out and preach he actually used his text from Revelation 10 1-7 in that in that message and that's when he begins to identify his message as the seventh Church age messenger and so he begins to identify that and and he says he said the seventh angel of Revelation 10 7 is the seventh Church age messenger so he he ties those two together and I know there's some people who still don't have a revelation of that still don't believe that but it is the truth he said is the seventh Church age messenger and I've I've uh edited some of this as far as taken out where he reads Revelation 10 7 so you'll notice a little bit of of uh editing that I've done on that to make it clear on the on the slides now notice he said what was it notice his type of message he said finishing all the mysteries of God finishing huh wrapping up finishing all the mysteries of God that are written in the book he said the seventh angel is winding up all the Mysteries that's laying loose ended all out through these organizations and denominations I I heard an illustration of that and and I thought it was appropriate that when they when uh when it says it's finished if you look at that Greek word it's the idea of tying up all the knots tying up the Loose Ends and we be we don't really realize what that means but a ship before the semen could leave if they were going ashore they first had to tie all the Loose Ends there could be no uh no ropes hanging down there could be no rope hanging from the sale had to be tied up before they could go everything had to be in its place and that's what this message did oh I'm so glad for that today this message put us in our place it had to but Loose sins all had to be tied up he said the seventh Angels winding up all the Mysteries that's laying loose ended all out through these organizations and denominations the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery he said that's what the Bible said finishes The Mystery of the written book how many believe that today but you know when he preached it when he first began to preach it was a lot more difficult than what I'm doing this morning because what I'm doing is preaching to people who believe in a prophet right I believe that all of you do that you believe in a prophet you believe you're you believe in the message of the hour you believe in light that is shined in our day but he wasn't preaching to people who believed he was preaching to people who didn't know and many of them were unbelievers for make-believers and so he didn't he didn't know and or they didn't know what he was talking about and then when they they did the ones that did they didn't believe it and so he began to preach that word or to fulfill his commission people began to leave and if you go to 1962 again towards the end of the of the year he preaches Blasphemous names and he talks about having a vision where he's preached a long message that had two main points I'm going somewhere this morning so I'm kind of skipping through this but I I want you to I thought about coming out and just going full temperate this morning but I won't do it thank you you're welcome hahaha but uh I just can't do that I can't preach for two hours but but I'm going to try my best to get to the point and so you forgive me for skipping over some things but you can go back and study it or listen to the tape and so he said this uh he talked about this long message had two main points where he calls it two climaxes and the people stayed for the first one but he said then they got tired even illustrates that they yawned right they got tired and and hungry physically hungry he said they left he said well I'll come back when the evening Shadows come he said and then I'll I'll preach the rest of it he said in this first message when they'd see it everybody rallied for it said Oh Glory to God or if I could see this that or the other he said they go right away the same way they come in now watch they come to see a prophet they come to see somebody could reveal the secrets of the heart they come to see somebody who had the sign in the hand they come to receive their healing he said and they said Oh Glory to God if I could see this if I could see that but they went out the same way they come in he said and now they think well I don't know he said where would you join if I don't if I don't come to this it'll be this way and I'll be kicked out over here and I won't have nothing to hear he said Brethren sit down and say well what would I do see there they won't stop long enough to recognize it's the word that God promised being manifested and they walked away how many have done that that they would not stay and recognize that it's the word of God being manifested and they walked away he said but don't worry the Shadows are close at hand when I return to the field now this was 1962. uh November 4th now I want you to understand today I'm not looking for brother random to come back and do that he did that you understand he did that he he did what he God promised that he would do because the book is open just like Joshua did what he God promised he would do just like Moses did what God promised he would do so he then uh you know he gets in Blasphemous names he realizes these people are leaving and you'll find this also in the present stage of my Ministry and many different sermons that he preaches during that time and he had read through verse 5 of second Timothy chapter four and he begins though to first for the first time he said I read on down at least the first time thinking about this he said I'm now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand so Paul was telling Timothy preach the word but now he says there's coming a time I've got to leave the field and you can read the rest of it but in verse 10 it said for demons has forsaken me having loved this present world and it's departed unto thessalonica questions to galatia Titus unto Dalmatia and I I'll tell you that you know we we underestimate sometimes how how big and how much of an impact those early meetings had on people it was a major Ministry but most of them left the majority left many people that were healed never believed the message many people that were saved during that time never believed the message never could come to the message of the hour most would leave but some would stay now in is this the sign of the answer Junior Jackson had a dream and there was a number of dreams I believe there were seven dreams that brother Brandon talks about there and the last one was his own and one of them was Junior Jackson's dream and he said I dreamed that there was a great big hill he said like out in the field where Bluegrass or something was he said up on top this hill where the water had washed away the soil he said there was a top rock up on top of the hill like the top of the mountain if you've ever been to some mountains on top there's nothing that grows it's a it's a Capstone of the mountain it's it's a place where it's too high for anything to grow or a bold we call around here a knob a Bald Knob and so it's a place where there's no grass and and it just rock and he said where the water had washed down and cut some kind of readings on these Stones he said you were standing there interpreting this reading on these stones and said all of us and here's the way he put it the Brethren from Georgia and from all around we were all standing together listening to you interpret that mysterious writing on those stone that mountain and said then you picked up something like from the air something like a wrecking bar or a crowbar something like that A Wrecking Bar real sharp and it said how you've done it I don't know he said you struck the top of that mountain ripped it around and lifted the cap of it off you know it has to have a spiritual meaning right he said it was in the shape of a pyramid and you rip the top of it off he said beneath that was White Stone Granite and you said the son of the light has never shined on this before now notice it was a part of the mountain but it was a part The sun hadn't shown on apart the people didn't understand but there will come a day that the wives will understand the Bible says he said seal it up to the time of the end well guess what guess where we're at if you haven't noticed lately we're at the time of the end but we're not at the time of the end waiting on the final Messenger to come we've had the final messenger the final voice to the final we've had it and now we've got to live that and become that final voice you understand now he said the son of the light has never shine on this before he said look upon this hopefully if my Ministry could be encapsulated in one thing again I can't be I can't be everything to I can't be all things to all people not everybody's going to understand it but if we could stand there at that stone that's been uncovered and stand there and say look on this huh and then I'll stand there and say you know and look on it ourselves right because the preacher can't preach what he doesn't know right look on it but not just me to look on it but you to look on it that's the message of the hour that's the light that's come on the scriptures and so he's pointing to the scriptures that have now been revealed said look on this and there's your healing and there's your salvation and there's how to have church right and so I've told people you know I Don't Preach because uh because a prophet in spite of a prophet I preach because of a prophet brother Branham told us how to have church he taught us how to have church he taught us how to how to praise the God how to worship and how to have things decently and in order I've got to stay with that he said look on this huh and he said then uh brother Branham left and said he went over the hills towards the west and he got smaller as he went and he and he said then when I did that he said then the Brethren turned around after a while and said did he vanish where did he go and said some took out that way some took one way and some another but a very few stayed oh I want to be one this state don't you a very few stayed and looked onto what I had told them what I had told them now it was not the action of staying but the action of looking doing what he told them to do was the obedience to a prophet's voice now if you'd stood there and watched the prophet leave you wouldn't have been doing what he told you to do he said look on this oh that's what I want to do this morning look on this Elevate the word make the word preeminent amen amen now we know when the Seven Seals was revealed it opened the entire book it opened the entire book the opening of the book where the Branham taught us that the whole book was a new book we'll read it after a while he said the opening of the book was more than just the series of sermons and and I want you to understand this this morning if you don't understand anything else when we talk about the opening of the seals or the opening of the book or we talk about light on on the scriptures and we talk about the message of the hour this is what we're talking about we're talking about the Bible right that's been opened up so and so brother Brandon and it's an entire message and and maybe if you differ with me on this you just go right ahead and believe and you just stay with the message of the hour but this I believe that it's the entire message the revelation of the Seven Seals it's not just a series of seven sermons and I believe brother Branham taught that now if we look at that you look at what was revealed and I've taken you before through the Mysteries but the random list is this the side of the answer he reads out of his Scofield bible and he reads all the Mysteries that were revealed and then he adds some to them were revealed at the end time you remember that and I we've dealt with that before and I want to deal with a little bit differently this morning but there's several statements that brother Branham makes that that he tells us what was revealed under the opening of the seals right and so it wasn't just a white horse rider a black horse rider a red horse rider but brother Branham taught us that the church Ages were revealed under the opening of the seals he said immediately he's talking about uh The Sword in his hand I remember the story he took the sword sword struck his hand he said it's the king's sword right I know we're deep this morning I don't do this very often but just just hang with me he said it was a king's sword the king's sword he didn't understand what it was and but then he said it was the word right the word was in his hand right and he said this is that third pull you go back and look at the vision or or the the things that happened to it he said he felt like a real a real sword struck his hand so he tells that story he said immediately after that the angels of the Lord appeared and told about the Seven Seals I was to return back here to Jeffersonville and preach the Seven Seals he said in there if I ever said anything that was inspired it was in that he said there's where the angel of the Lord met us and the Bible become a new Bible there it opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things had left out he said it was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ all together new to us but perfectly exactly with the scripture that was the word which has always been I love this I was so inspired and directed now he goes on to talk about the trumpets he says the trumpets were not profitable to the church because they were to the Jews and we all understand that he said now the hidden mysteries of Christ was fully revealed someone say fully revealed fully revealed in the Seven Seals he said it revealed first the seven Church ages now think about that the seals revealed for it's the opening of the word right it's not just seven sermons but it's opening up it's bringing light to when the book is closed there's no light on it but when it's open the light comes on it you can read what's inside and so now he said it revealed first the seven churches opened up the ages and placed them positionally both with history and with the Bible and set them in position how they was right and this is why I don't get caught up in dates and certain things that people say well this is the time when the the angel or the lamb left the throne and this is the day that this happened I don't get caught up in that because we realize it's all the opening of the word right some things brother random even taught before the seals were open but if you watch it there's more and more light as it comes down to the end until we can just see perfectly Where We Are now so he said he said both he said open up the ages place them positionally both with history and with the Bible and set them in position how they was so the church Ages were open under the seals what else was open heaven was open to us what heaven was I love this he said I do not think that heaven is a place that my mother used to tell me about I believe the church has grown from that to think it used to be a hundred years ago or two he said I think the old-timers used to think that everyone had died that died went up to heaven and had a harp and set up there on the clouds and played a heart now that that sounds good for a while but after a while you get tired of playing a harp I mean Peter can play them drums and that bass and that guitar and that piano he's got in the basement for a long time he's got him a whole band set up down there of confiscated instruments so he just found her or some of them are mine some of them I think someone belong to church but we have to work on that but but he's got he's got instruments down there and and uh he got him a sound system he loves to play but after a few million years and you might get tired of that but that's not all heaven is and so but the random even talked about how he thought that they were just spirits and they could say hi brother Neville but he could never shake his hand right he said now they know that there was a place called heaven but they he said if that be so he said all the musicians would have it on us he said but it isn't that kind of a place it isn't playing Harps at all he said I believe I don't believe the Bible teaches that he said but that was a conception that they had before the fullness of the word came into existence or the opening of The Seven Seals that's promised us in this age that we then understand aren't you glad for understanding but when did Brother random go beyond the curtain of time if you go back and look at the sermon beyond the curtain of time he said I believe it's 1962. now it's before he preached the seven sermons right and we know that he didn't even know what those were yet but you're watching the light come on the lights coming on it's getting brighter it's getting brighter and all of those things become perfected under all those teachings become perfected under the opening of the word now can we go on this morning so the church ages the uh Heaven itself serpent seat is another one he said you people follow these tapes with our brother here he said now you've heard me preach on the serpent seed that that cannot be denied he said that was opened up in one of those Seven Seals he preached Serpentine I believe in 1959 if I'm not mistaken brother Brandon says that by the way more than once several times serpent seed was open under the seals now again what what is it God's doing something that was his job what's to what's to take the book from the lamb who opened it the lamb opened the book and he said he gave it to his servant the seventh angel and he showed it to us uh what does this message mean it means everything right it's light on the on the scriptures now again election and serpency goes into election because if you don't understand serpency you don't understand election correctly so that's what serpency in fact I think that's why we know serpent seed as it is and it was hidden in previous ages is because the reason we know what it is is because of election we have to know who we are in this hour we are we're the seed of God the spiritual seed of God now uh he talks about the seven angels and how they come down in the cloud he said I've seen then what it was he said well as soon as I got my commission in the scripture he said the Seven Seals which is the seven Mysteries now he goes on he talks about how he tells this story several times that a man come to him and told him his brother Brandon want those seven Thunders he said be some great thing that's not written in the book you've heard him tell that we've read it before he sent me some great new mystery I said it can't be that way because see I believe the word to be the truth how many believe that this morning it all goes back to the Bible I believe the word to be the truth and the Bible said whosoever shall add one word or take one word from it it has to be in this word it's the Mysteries that the people has overlooked for right there is where come my message of serpentine and the true belief of the security of the believer he said I'm not disgrading my Presbyterian Brethren there and some of you Baptist Brethren on the way that you have security I'm not saying this to be different but you didn't have it just right he said that's right but I had it wrong too that's what he said I had it wrong too but when an angel stands from heaven and tells you and here it is right in the scripture that's true Glory so it takes both you understand and listen it takes both with us too a pastor can stand here and preach it can teach it can explain it to you some a whole lot better than me but if they can stand here and tell you that's part of it but the Holy Ghost has to reveal it to you so both sides he said an angel came down but he said if that angel came and told me something that wasn't in the Bible I wouldn't believe it but he come down he showed him where in the Bible to find it and so that's what I challenge you to do that there's something you don't understand about the message of the hour some of you young people even trip sitting here and and Esther and and Peter uh that are back there working and some of you younger couples that maybe some of you that are watching if you don't understand something about the message go back to the scripture and find where he got it in the scripture and then if you can't find it come talk to me come talk to me or talk to one of these other minister brothers that can show you where it's at because it's there it's there you need to know the scriptures and you need to you need to be digging in the message of the hour because there's something there for you there's something that'll help you at school there's things in there that'll help you at work see this message again it's not just seven sermons preach I had somebody tell me the other day said well it was mostly about the Catholic Church you know it was about me I saw my name there identity I found him in the opening of that word Hallelujah I can't be anything else it's hard to unsee it but the spirit once you can see it you're looking at it that's me like like the little uh the little boy looking in the mirror he said Mama that's me it's open it belongs to me the public didn't know it but I I looked at it and all of a sudden it was revealed to my heart amen but he said he always speaks exactly with the scripture the word is always right and I've told you before scripture should stand on its own we shouldn't have to say well I don't believe in Preachers anymore scripture should stand on its own Ephesians 4 11 shouldn't have to be denied or explained away and a prophet didn't do it right a word Prophet doesn't do that and now you could take any other thing that we believe it's not just that but it shouldn't be explained away whatever the scripture said how the scripture said to have communion brother Brandon brings light on that how the scripture says they have church brother man brings light on that how the opening of the seals the things we didn't understand over the years he brought light on those scriptures now we know what they are right now look but the word is always right we just needed that top of the mountain pried off you understand so we can see what else did he tell us the Book of Life you go back and look at that it sounds confusing if you go to the church age book you find brother random talking about it in a certain way and and brother Branham explains what he meant in the church each book later on in worse is Faith expressed he talks about that book he said there's only really one book of life and he goes on to some detailed explanation and talks about the uh the wheat and and the and the Chuck and all of those things he talked about the different parts of it he said but there's only one book of life he said so that's where it is it's all in that great Revelation there and he talks about the different parts you understand there's a there's a bride part there's a part there that their name will never be taken out of the book aren't you glad to be part of that amen the Lamb's Book of Life that'll never be taken out of the book but he said so that's where it is it's all in that great Revelation there which was made known during the time of the Seven Seals made known during the time of the Seven Seals I don't remember him talking about the book of life during the seals and he may have mentioned it I don't remember him talking about that but it's that opening of the word again it's like Joshua going in and Jericho is the key to the to Canaan and he walks in and and uh here's the walls around Jericho and he walks in they walk around seven times and the seventh day they walked around or six times the seventh day they walked around seven times and when they finally walked around at that final time there was a shout the people made a shout and when the shout came then the walls fell down and now Canaan was open to them I believe that that's happened in our day that our Joshua Ministry has come and I believe that's that's a Prophet by the way and I'm going to show you that after a while but that was a prophet's Ministry it was our Joshua Ministry also a type of the Holy Ghost but it's a type of our prophet's Ministry and he walked in and the walls come down but where are we at what are we supposed to do go in and take the land how the walls have come down let's not rebuild the walls we read that to you last week Kirsten is the man that rebuilds the walls he loses family if he rebuilds the walls church if you rebuild the walls of denominationalism if you rebuild the walls of Catholicism till some Pope somewhere can tell you what to do until a sovereign Church what to do and how to act when you rebuild those woes you lose your kids a hundred percent of the time but we've been called to Freedom we've been called to an open land it's yours go take it are you with me this morning amen so marriage and divorce is another thing he said now you see what happened there in marriage and divorce the Seven Seals was opened and brought out the real truth of it oh my aren't you glad for that and people say well that's condemning no it it gave a way out it gave Grace aren't you glad for Grace today amen told us the truth of it so our children wouldn't have to go through that so we could preach tell our children the truth amen marriage is for life now look it wasn't so from the beginning polygamy wasn't so from the beginning you get one one shot at it oh I'm so glad that God has a way he said I don't know what to do I don't know who to marry God has a way to lead you and guide you to the right one you just you just pray and get in the word God will take care of the rest of it aren't you glad of that today I never thought Nolan levi'd be married but here they are this morning in church the kids grew up uh and brother obvious when I was there and I I never thought that that would happen but God knows what he's doing and we don't know I don't think Noli ever thought that would happen I don't know about Levi but only in my dreams right but God has a way here this morning but God put them together I don't know why I'm talking about this but I see my own kids get a little bit older and begin to think about these things and God has a way you just say in the word you stay in church stay with God God has a way of bringing you to the right one amen baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was another one you remember there's a distinction there not just in Jesus name because people had that but brother Brandon tells the story the same story about that man that come and said want to be something great that comes he I said no sir it can't be because the Bible the Seven Seals on it had the seven Mysteries hid he said it was already wrote but they didn't understand what it was and he goes on he said watch how they plowed along with that being baptized in Jesus name he said see that wasn't it the name of the Lord Jesus Christ aren't you glad to know that today we can have confidence in it and he preached that his entire Ministry almost but it was yet it was in the opening of the word all the hidden mysteries were revealed and more light shine as he come fully into his ministry now look we could go on and on and I don't have time this morning but we could go into church order we could go into the fivefold ministry we could go into tribulation period these are not things that we can just mess with this is the opening of the word this is what he taught the tribulation period the future home aren't you glad you know what your future home is hey man the Rapture uh the order of the family the place of a man and a woman we didn't don't just go back and change those things those things belong to us that's our land that's our possession communion and it's such a thing that's been left out in many places but I've tried to have it more regularly because it means something it's there for a reason we do it for a reason don't let it just become a something we do but let's do it for the right reasons we were taught how to have communion we were taught about Divine Healing if you're sick this morning we were taught about how to believe like a gentile believer if you're not here this morning say well I can't have hands laid on you but you're a gentile you say speak the word speak the word and my family can be healed we've been taught about our families and how that they'll come back and our children aren't you glad you heard that last Sunday night what a wonderful what a marvelous messages brother Joel preached about about how that our families we have a right to our families and they'll be coming back and and he didn't say how but he said they would and and so that was revealed to us under the opening of the word under this message of the hour I'm going to hold on to that I'm not going to take that lightly I believe in that hey man we think we get the feeling sometimes I to be people that have left the message you just indulge me for a moment some of these people that have left the message it gets feeling like and they'll use this they say well brother Brandon was a false anointed one well you didn't even know what a false anointed one was without this message you're using a message Doctrine to try to disprove a prophet right I mean they just don't even understand we take it for granted sometimes I want us to know he kept his word amen he said then back out there at the beginning of the Seven Seals when those seven angels come down in that pyramid form stood there and told me to return back here and speak on those Seven Seals and he'd be with me amen he said he'd show me what they were the lost things he'd show me what they were the lost things you know again he said it couldn't be something not written but he goes on down he said so it is a mystery it's been in the book in these seven Church ages each one of them produced a mystery all about water baptism and these other things that they fumbled about so long but I'm so glad for the opening of the word today I'm so glad for the opening of the seals so we can see the book is open and my name is there it didn't just open up it didn't just open up the uh the scriptures but it opened up who I am in the scriptures where I belong so now again another term we use for that is the seven Thunders I know people are scared of that because people come along and taught that the Thunders were the virtues but brother Branham said the Thunders were the Mysteries that were hidden under the seals all right revealed under the seals and so a thunder is a voice look at Revelation 10-1 it says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun his feet is pillars of fire he had on his hand a little book open he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice is when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders out of their voices now Thunder is a voice that was not understood but now John understood it but but the Thunder he started to write he said don't write it but the voice was a thunder you find that in John 12 29 brother Branham uses this example the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered remember when he said I both I've glorified he said father glorify thy name he said I've glorified it we'll glorify it again and what was it was a thunder and and but but to him it was The Voice it was revealed to him and brother Branham goes on about that he said it's all revealed in there he said in the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was are you with me now you go back and get the whole quote now look so I want to present to you today this way he kept his word can you say Amen to that I talked to you last week and said he kept his word in our church we've seen him do it I've seen him keep his word it's not just about us we're part of a body a global body of Believers we may not all agree on every little thing but we're there's there's a bride out there somewhere there's got to be he keeps his word and we're part of that bride he kept his word the book is open and it can't be closed back up that we can't rebuild the walls we come into the land and he opened the land to Joshua and he told he told Brother Branham he said preach the word that's what he told him he said go to second second Timothy 4 go to Second Timothy 4 preach the word be instant in season of the season and and he told Joshua he said be strong and of a good courage for under this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance to land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous the thou mayest observed to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that means Prosper with or so ever thou goeth what was he doing he was telling him this is this is what I want you to do Joshua this is your commission preach the word divide the land which that Paul calls us he calls the ministry he said as stewards we are stewards of the mysteries of God a steward is a is one who divides an inheritance he set up over a family and he goes in and he takes the family he gives so much to the servants and so much to the household and his job is to be like an accountant he he goes over everything and he he finds out what belongs here what belongs there and that's where the ministry is important because our job is to is to rightly divide the word right and but not to take it away from its original meaning but to take that part of the word and say I'll just make it simple like someone is here maybe they're suffering with uh something that's happened in their family and the ministry under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost God anoints them to preach and and they begin to preach about the family and they begin to preach about things like that and that person in their heart just begins to be struck because they realize I didn't talk to that preacher I didn't tell him what was going on but what's he doing he's taking the word but he's dividing to you the portion that you needed that Sunday morning the portion that you needed on that Wednesday night that's what we do it's not our word it's not our light we're just reflecting the light that come in our day but we're stewards of the mysteries of God dividing each portion and we have to be really careful with that because we're not using our word we're using his word so we don't get to divide it just how we want to but according to the instructions that we've been given in the leadership of the Holy Ghost now watch are you still with me this morning got a few more minutes Joshua conquered the land and he gets to the end of it that's where we're at in Joshua 21 he said there's not a man that stood before us God kept his word we could all look back over our own lives and say God kept his word he kept me safe he kept me kept me whole kept my family God kept his word god did what he promised he would do and I want to testify today if you'll stay with the message of the hour God keeps his word and I told you I preached that when I was 16 years old here in this area and I preached that Pastor but really I pastored your your father and mother for a little while and I preached the same thing only I hope I understand more now than I did then but but God kept his word from then till now and he'll keep his word tomorrow and some of you Elders could stand up and say Amen to that because you've been through it but you know you're a seed of God God kept his word you came up like the seed it comes it'll find a crack somewhere to come up and reach for the sunlight God keeps his word hahaha but now there's something specific left to do Take Your Land right Take Your Land Joshua come in and and the walls of Jericho fell down at the shout all right but now there was some land each tribe had to take and Joshua said it's finished it's been the Lord is taking care of us it's at the end of his life but there were still areas that hadn't been taken but it belonged to them it had been revealed to them remember it was Caleb who went out and found the land found a specific place oh God the place of the Resurrection I don't have time to go into that this morning but Caleb found Hebron he found the place for the resurrection and he comes back out and he says he said I want that place and I'll tell you today I'm not satisfied I know this message restores us back even to Pentecost it restores us back to uh to gifts and to and to all these things and to have Services where we enjoy the presence of the Lord it restores us back to that but it even restores us further back because we're not content with just any old part of the land we're not content with what Wesley had or what Luther had or what the Pentecostals had we want the resurrection we want a rapture so Caleb goes out he finds that specific piece of land and he says I want that mountain nobody believed it but 40 years later he's still following Joshua around Moses is gone but Joshua's still there oh my watch brother Branham you can go read the whole thing again pick up your pen and write it from the church age book and brother Branham reads it what he had written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit he wrote it and they wrote it in the church book he said he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride someone say that the bride who are you is there something left to do who's going to do it who's going to be his hands his feet now again there's nothing left as far as a worldwide sweeping Revival no more prophets to come we're at the end this is it the Lord the Lord has has settled down we settled down in our age the the uh the boat the ship has come in and the Sinker or the Sinker the uh the weight has gone down we are we are we are steady the anchor is down the boat is anchored but Danny we got an anchor that'll Hold Us unlike that one we had in the river we're anchored to both ends of the boat we're sitting there where there's good fishing right we're stable that's the hour we live in and yet again there's something specific for us to take what is that what is that sister genius our joy our peace our satisfaction our family our churches they belong to us they don't belong to this this world that's gone nuts they belong to us there's a specific work left for some for to do he said he did not complete all his work in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride onto that next slide he did not complete it she knows that he said for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time and he goes on he said now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did he said now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church now we know that brother Branham came as that end time leader but we also know that the son of man Ministry was not just brother Branham it was the word itself that come in our day to be a leader to us brother Branham taught that he said he was a son of man revealing these son of man so the son of man Ministry is the word the brother said the son of man is the word he was not just the anointing but he was the word and so now that end time leader will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua oh God that's what I want to be again what did Caleb do Joshua 14 and 6 says in the children of Judah came into Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of Jeff and of the kennestite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kenneth bernia in other words we could look at it like this you know what you told me and pick up your pen and write I don't know about you but I take the the words of a prophet personally I wasn't alive when he came but I take it personally he spoke to me when he said there was a specific work left to do when he said if you if he has any hands through your hands if he has any feet to your feet when he said that all that Christ was he poured into the church that's me mama that's me and so he said you know the thing that the Lord said unto Moses concerning me know what he said oh my we need to remind ourselves of it today and then he goes on to verse 9 Moses swear on that day saying surely the land were on thy feet of trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast holy followed the Lord my God that was totally Paul let's do that today Church let's holy follow the lord our god let's give him all of our mind all of our strength all of our all that we have give it to him you may not understand what I'm talking about this morning but if you could just give him everything you do to understand everything you do have everything you do want everything you do everything that is yours today you take that and believe for that he'll reveal the rest to you amen he said yes that's the Holy Father the Lord my God in verse 10 he said now behold the Lord has kept me alive oh there's going to be some who are alive and remain at the coal mine he said those there will be those that were alive and remain as the coming of the Lord the Lord has kept me alive these 45 years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and five years old 85. now not many of you are older than that maybe a few y'all been married 61 years you've got to be getting close to that but we won't we won't ask this morning it'd be 85 in March so brother Caleb you've been getting picked on a lot lately haven't you said I'm as strong this day as I was 40 years ago I believe he's speaking by faith he said I'm just stay for scoring five years old he might have walked up there with a walker and a cane and everything else but he believed he was 85 years old in body but he had the same Spirit the same the same idea the same desire to take the land that he did when he was 45. amen he said I'm as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now this should be our testimony today maybe you're getting older and I know some of them that are watching this morning getting older it's hard to even come to church hard to get you out of your chair nearly but remember you're as strong this day as you were the day you heard the message why because you have strength inside of you it's going to make a Rapture one of these days whether you go by way of the Grave you'll come up first in the resurrection if you are here on the day of the Rapture you'll be you'll be alive and remain and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we shall be changed the Bible says amen do you believe it this morning that's what Caleb stands for he says I want all the land amen I'm a strong this day as I was the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now I want to testify you to you today he kept his word even if it's my streets now for war both to go out and to come in and verse 12 he said now therefore give me this mountain give me this mountain wherever the Lord speaking that day I read in the message and my family could be at peace give me this mountain I read in the message where a prophet told me that I could have joy give me this mountain I read where he talked about Divine Healing I read in the scripture he said I'm the Lord thy God that heals all thy diseases give me this mountain are you with me this morning whatever you're facing give me this mountain Hallelujah word of the Lord spake in that day for thou heard just in that day how the anakams were there and the cities were great in Vince Caleb volunteered to take the worst one the Bible says The Last Enemy that'll be destroyed is death it was that was the hardest one but don't you know it's already been destroyed amen so Pokey crowd say death where is your sting grave reason the be of death stung Christ on the cross he pulled his stinger out hey man that's the last Mountain [Laughter] oh God you gotta have faith during these times that's what brother JT the other day I hope you don't mind me telling this sure they're watching her we'll watch it JT the other day they were going to have to do a procedure on him he was worried because it's one where they had to stop it would have to stop his heart I said brother he said well I'm a winner either way but then he kind of got down a little bit because no one wants to leave huh who wants to leave I said well we'll pray that they don't have to do it we'll pray that they don't have to do it and the next morning he called me I was coming back up to see him he said he said they said they're not having to do the procedure I'm going home so we thank God for that [Applause] I watched that and I watched that and I I watch his face as he was there and I thought Lord I know when I come down to that hour and none of us have any guarantee brother JT may live longer than I do that's just the truth of it no one has a guarantee the people that we love it if they live long enough eventually they all die that's the one thing we all know is that we all die I remember the story about a man that a woman that was there at 9 11 and the plane hit beneath her and she was one of the upper stories and at some point she realized she wasn't going to make it she was on a 9-1-1 call never forget it she said I'm going to die aren't I and I thought about that and I thought every one of us could say that none of us know none of us though heard another story about a woman that got dropped out of a plane she dropped out of a plane for ten thousand feet strapped to her seat and survived we can't go until it's time we can't go till let's hope we hear it today but when the time comes let's be like Caleb I'm a strong today I may be weak in my body but I'm as strong today in my faith as I was the very day that I heard this message let this encourage you today this message is still the same my body may not be the same but this message is still the same I may not have as much voice as I did as a 16 year old preacher but this message has not changed brother Bill this message I've changed but the message hasn't changed you've changed but the message is still the same it's still the same for going out the same for coming in amen it's still the opening of the word to us and we're here for a reason we're not here to sit down sit by ourselves and segregate into our own homes and not fellowship with anybody we're here to fight a war you don't fight words by yourself [Music] you fight with your brothers and sisters you stand together he said now therefore give me this mountain if that mountain facing you is death give me that mountain doctor gives you a report says it can't be it can't be any good you're going to die give me this mountain I believe your report Lord over the door what the doctor says give me the mountain the Lord spake of in that day I love that so you can't be sure of taking any mountain he didn't speak about are you hearing me you can't be sure taken but I'm so glad the message covers it all the Bible covers it all it's all here everything you need to live some false Doctrine or something you can't be sure of that he said the cities were great and fences so be the Lord will be with me I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said laughs musicians go ahead and come Joshua coming into the land opened up the possibility of the sun standing still I may know that this morning no this is important don't get distracted the sun is standing still they didn't need it in in the wilderness not not didn't even need it in Egypt but there come a time in the land that they needed the sun to stand still and Joshua stood there and said Son stand still and it did it obeyed the voice of a man and the Bible says there was never a day like that day when when the sun obeyed the voice of a man but we're living in that day one of the things that the opening of the seals opening of the word opened up to us was Mark 11 23. you know what that is brother said I
