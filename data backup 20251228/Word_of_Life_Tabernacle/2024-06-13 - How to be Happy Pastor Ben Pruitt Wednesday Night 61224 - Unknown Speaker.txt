people bless each hand that was represented that was raised I pray Lord you'd meet that need ask it in Jesus precious name amen thank the Lord amen Psalms chapter 88 going to read verses 1-9 to begin Psalms chapter 88 I don't know if you've ever read Psalms chapter 88 but it's a it's a sad song in fact it's considered to be the the saddest song saddest Psalm in the Bible and I want to speak to you tonight on how to be happy but we're going to begin that by reading the saddest scripture or what's considered the saddest scripture in the Bible but I hope that it makes sense when we get done because we all want to be happy and yet we know that there's a deeper happiness and joy than what the world has that's for us as Christians Psalms 88 and one I appreciate your your offering to brother Danny it wasn't uh it was the brothers in the church had that idea to do that and I'm so thankful that you love one another and care for one another we should all do that look out for one another and show our appreciation especially to those who have put in the work and and and stood here over the years and we wouldn't have a church here I don't believe if it wasn't for brother Danny Ward and and so I'm thankful at least I wouldn't be here so I'm thankful for brother Danny and and for each one of you that are here tonight you're you being here on a Wednesday night matters and and and I don't let the devil beat you up about that just you being here the good so good to see you and sister Sharon tonight you being here matters and and because you're here I believe God will give you an extra helping an extra blessing tonight Psalms 88 And1 oh Lord God of my salvation I've cried day and night before thee let my prayer come before thee incline thine ear to my cry my soul is full of troubles my life draweth nigh unto the grave I'm am counted with them that go down down into the pit I am as a man that hath no strength free among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave and th rememberest no more they are cut off from thy hand thou Hast laid me in the lowest pit in darkness in the deeps th wrath lith hard upon me thou has Afflicted me with all thy waves Sila CA means stop I think he had to stop you couldn't just take this Psalm all at once we'll read the next two verses thou H has put away mine acquaintance far from me th has made me an Abomination unto them I am shut up I cannot come forth my my eye mourneth by reason of Affliction Lord I have called daily upon thee I have stretched out my hands unto thee I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this is uh literally in the title it's a song of Affliction or illness To Be Sung mournfully by The Choir it actually says to sing it in a mournful way and the writer is a man named uh h e m an is pronounced hymon hmon is a levite he's a seir he he prophesies in music he's a singer and he's a symbol player and so we could say he was a drummer uh but he had a he had a something that happened in his life and we don't know what it was but it seems to be sickness chronic sickness that that was uh something that overtook his life and he just got to a place where he only writes one scripture one chapter in the Bible and it was Psalms 88 and he's an interesting person because his job in the temple is literally to sing joyful songs all right that's that's his job is to sing joyful songs in the temple and in 1 Chronicles 15:16 David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their Brethren uh to be the singers with instruments of music sultes and harps and symbols sounding by lifting up the voice with joy so there was people appointed just to sing Happy songs I you know I I think we had some of that tonight and so there was people appointed to do that and you say well that's just working people up no sometimes people need to remember that they have something to be happy about and and sometimes we need to do that so there were Levites that were done just that were there just for that purpose so the Levites appointed hmon the son of Joel and his Brethren Asaf the son of barakah and the sons of marari their Brethren Ethan the son of kayah and then and and uh verse 19 says so the singers hymon Asaf and Ethan were appointed to sound with symbols of brass so they their their job now it's hard to be mournful uh on the drums it's difficult to be mournful with symbols right it just kind of breaks that up a little bit and and yet so that but his job was to take the symbols and actually Clash them together and yet and and it was more than just a job but it was a it was part of his life he he and all his children prophesied in their music in 1 Chronicles 255 it says all these were the sons of Amon the king seir in the words of God that's a powerful it means he he he had a a prophecy in music there was something that God used him in a not just in a regular way but in a prophetic way in music and so we know that that Psalm that was written was inspired we know Psalm 88 was inspired by God so he he was one of the wisest men of his age he he was uh the Bible says he was one of the wisest men except Solomon he was counted as one of the three or four wisest men in the Kingdom at that time he stood before Kings and played joyful songs and yet the only song he wrote that we still have today almost needs a trigger warning right when you read it I'm just being honest with you you know when you read the Psalms you get to Psalm 88 you're looking for the hope you know cuz usually David's all up and down you know he's singing he's he's writing Psalms that I'm going down to the pit but Lord you're lifting me up right and David's always like that he's up and down even There's Hope even in Psalms uh uh 53 I believe it is the one where uh he uh actually uh at his prayer of repentance There's Hope in that he said he said restore unto me the joy of my salvation and you find Hope in that but there's very little hope found in Psalms 88 in fact the only positive thing that I could find is that it is a prayer to the god of Salvation and I'm so glad that when we're in our darkest moments and in our worst moments and in the worst parts of our Lives he's still the god of our salvation and so I want to tell you tonight that hmon was not an unbeliever he was a Believer yeah but he was just going through some things huh and the longer you live the more you realize you're going to go through some things I heard an interview today with a singer and and they said that they sang a song it was about God being a way maker not the one that we commonly sing but a different one and they were uh they were singing about that and and the first time they sang it they took it to a young person and the young person said oh it's okay but they took it to an elder and the Elder said sing that that means something to me and the songwriter realized that that the young person couldn't had hadn't lived long enough to actually have reached a place where they'd ever experienced the kind uh of place that that song would speak to them and I think uh for some of us that have lived a while and some of you have lived a whole lot longer than I have you eventually experienced the kind of place like came on experience you you experience something in your life that there's just nothing good about it there's no positive part of it and yet God is still God he's still the god of Salvation how many can say Amen to that tonight he's still the god that's going to bring us out and so the very fact the the song is a prayer it's a prayer and that means if it's a prayer he still believed in God now he was faithful to pray even though he was evidently Afflicted from his youth he wanted to do something for Jehovah in Psalm 8810 it says well thou show wonders to the dead shall the dead arise and praise thee CA shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave or Thy Faithfulness in destruction shall thy wonders be known in the dark th righteousness in the land of forgetfulness but unto thee have I cried oh Lord and in the morning shall my prayer prevent Thee I love this he's going through a dark time and it wasn't a temporary Darkness it was something that seemed to consume his life but he says I'm going to pray even though you don't seem to answer I'm going to I'm going to call out to you Lord even though it seems like the heavens are brass I'm going to pray anyway I'm going to keep going to the house of God I'm going to keep doing what God called me to do why because I know somehow somehow he'll make it right somehow he's still God somehow it don't make sense to me but he's still God it it it doesn't have any Rhyme or Reason to it but he's still Jehovah and he's still worthy of my praise amen yes but there's sometimes you can't sometimes you just have to express what you feel and that's okay that's all right yes sir come on sometimes I know that's not positive thinking and we should always be positive but sometimes you do have to acknowledge hey I'm sick I need help Lord I need you need you to move sometimes there has to be a desperation in our lives yes in order to get anything from God he says Lord why castest thou off my soul why hidest thou thy face from me I am Afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while I suffer thy Terrors I am distracted see brother Joel talked about that on Sunday night sometimes we we're distracted by by things of the world but sometimes we're distracted by things God allows in our life that's right and it's just it's a burden it's a it's a terror it's a it's it's a hardship and so he says thy Fierce wrath goeth over me thy Terrors have cut me off they come around about me daily like water they Compass me about together lover and friend has so put far from me and my acquaintance Into Darkness you say well brother Ben read the next verse there is no next verse that's the end of Psalm 88 I admire the writer of this Psalm how can you be that unhappy in your flesh and yet be faithful to prayer and joyful In Praise how do you play your symbols with joy when your life looks like that come on that's pretty dark picture Psalms 88 paints for us and yet he was the leader of of singing with joy down at the temple see most of us I think that I would have given up and I'll say this sometimes it's good to take a reflection you you can't just keep beating your head against the wall you can't just keep doing what you've always done sometimes you need to express it sometimes you need to take some time but in the end you're still a Christian when it's over when you come down through that Valley and you get you know there's got to be an end to it somewhere there's got to be there's got to be a mountain somewhere there's got to be a place you can see you've been going through these brambles and these briers and this forest and and you and you walked all the way through and and you just seem like there's no end to it but you know being a child of God there got to be a a top of the mountain somewhere there's got to be a hill somewhere got to be a place of praise and a place of joy and so you just keep going and you might have to take time to stop and complain but you still go you you might ask God why but you still go on oh I'm so glad for people of God tonight that are willing to do that come on Amen sometimes we just need to be truthful in expressing how we feel to god notice who was addressed to to God he didn't get on Facebook although he it did get put in the Psalms you can imagine what it must have been like in the temple theyd get around they'd sing the Psalms in order and they'd sing Psalms one and planted like a tree in the rivers of water it seemed Psalms 100 and the psalmist says everybody clap your hands clap your hands all ye people singing to God with a voice of Triumph and what are we singing today well today we're singing Psalm 888 pretty rough one by the Paul it's pretty hard I'm just preaching to you from my heart tonight but it's pretty hard to to take anything good out of that service and yet I think there's a depth to a Christian that you understand that even though you go through that you know that there's something good on the other side yes and and so what is he saying really I'm sick but but I'm addressing my prayer to God God you're my healer yeah I I'm lonely but God you're my friend how many can say Amen to that today I'm dry but you're the water I'm poor but my wealth is found in you I may be struggling but I know where the one where where the God is that can end my struggle I just got to I just got to get his attention I just got to get him on the phone I just got to talk to him one time and I know everything would be okay as job would say if I could just come to this where he is if I could just find his throne room if I could just get to the place where he is he says the Lord gives and takes away blessed be the name of the Lord the skin worms May destroy my body yet in my flesh I will see God that's pretty graphic language is he's acknowledging his condition brother brand in one place and I haven't found the quote but I know it's there I just don't know the words to search for exactly but I'm paraphrasing he said that he said that if you have cancer you don't say well you just you don't refuse to say I have cancer you acknowledge it he said but then you say But I'm Healed right you don't just say I have or I don't have it you say well yes that's what the doctor say But I'm Healed right I if you're hurting you acknowledge that you're hurting but but I know the one who's a pain taker if I'm in bondage if I can't worship like I need to if I can't praise like I need to I know that's my condition but I also know there's a God who can bring me out of that [Music] condition amen I'm a human see that's what you're acknowledging right when you acknowledge pain you're acknowledging humanity and every one of us is Afflicted with that condition do you know that we should all form a support group humans Anonymous yes you realize your pastor would be a member brother brandom would be a member Paul would be a member Moses would be a member let me shock you Jesus would be a member that's right because he come in flesh we're human oh my and we acknowledge the pain but also the one who can take away the pain that's I'm human but God is my helper Paul says it this way we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellence of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed oh my we are perplexed but not in despair oh if you can't find Hope in that your Wood's wet on now persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body I want us to ask the question tonight as we move along what would make me happy what would bring joy to my life and I'm talking about real happiness here Satan will try to answer that question every chance he gets and what Satan answers the question with is whatever you desire now think about it for a minute Satan answers the question to how can I be happy with the desire of your heart or your flesh right some desire that you have and Satan says if you would just do that you would be happy if you would just let yourself go there you would be happy I I had a man come to me he was trying to explain what he was doing in regards to his marriage and he just he just is about to make a terrible mistake go against the word and and and I asked him said what do you want he said he said I want to be happy but the worst way to make yourself happy is to go against the word especially if you're a Son of God or a daughter of God right the way to make yourself happy is to line up to the word you may temporarily be more unhappy but in the end it'll work out all right we have a you know I know people would tell me these young people sometimes said well you know if I had a girlfriend or I had a boyfriend I would be happy oh you bet you better watch what you wish for right know we've got a dog and and I've told you about our dog our dog is a Pampered dog he was a happy dog and I say was because he just recently started getting out of the fence he' been in that fence for two years and just all of a sudden he starts getting out well evidently he'd smelled another Beagle up the street and so he finds this other beagle which is odd you know it's funny birds of a feather flock together he's only half beagle but he don't know that so he he anyway he finds this other dog there's dogs all over the the place but he finds this other dog like him and he wants to go to it he he just got to that you know he's got to have his girlfriend he he he he he tunnel under the fence and trips been at my house three times I think trying to fix that fence and he just the dog just won't he won't let it alone he'll dig through the Rock and finally they got the fence all fixed up and and they thought well he can't get out now and Esther caught him climbing over the top he never did that before but what was he trying to be happy skip just wants to be happy he's trying to get out of his pin and don't realiz got everything he ever needs all he's doing is making his life worse right cuz cuz that just ain't going to happen he's going to end up with a visit to the vet right but you know that he's just making it worse on himself see getting and if he got it you know it'd be like well then it just he'd want more and more and more and see that's just the way we are as human beings isn't it right well if I had a girlfriend if I had a boyfriend if I had a better house if I had a better car if I had more money if I could just get the perfect job then you find out the perfect job doesn't exist if my wife was gone if my husband was gone no one say Amen to that oh I'd be happy then but none of those things will fill the hole in your heart right so you got a hole in your heart yeah and you you can't blame that hole on anybody right you can't you you can't fill it with just anything thing oh my look at Solomon when he wrote Ecclesiastes Solomon was should have been the happiest man on Earth he had everything he had a thousand wives maybe that's the source of his unhappiness but he was he should have been a happy he could have had whatever whatever Soloman desired was at his fingertips look how he puts it in Ecclesiastes chapter 2 I said in my heart go to now I will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure behold this also is Vanity his life was one long Caribbean vacation right that's all he did was just take a vacation and he and he and he had his wives and he had his wine and he had his he had all the things he could ever want his beautiful home and I said of laughter is mad or in other words it's crazy and a mirth what doth it I sought in my heart to give myself to Wine yet ainting my heart with wisdom and to lay hold on Folly till I might see what was good for the sons of men which they should do Under the heaven all the days of their life I made me great works I builded me houses I planted me Vineyards I made me Gardens and Orchards I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits I made me pools of water to water there with the wood that bringeth forth trees he he irrigated his Gardens I got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house also I had great possessions of small great and small cattle and above all that were in Jerusalem before me I gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar Treasure of kings and of the provinces I got me men singers and women singers and the Delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of All Sorts so I was great and increase more than all that were before me in Jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me the gift of discernment that he had was still with him right he had all of that plus the gift of discernment still had wisdom okay you'd think he'd be happy but he still just couldn't find the wherewithal to to be happy yeah you realize Solomon was maybe the richest man that ever lived he he may have been the richest man that ever lived if you take the things that the Bible says that he had and you up monetary value he may well have been the richest man that ever lived and yet he said I whatsoever my eyes desired I kept not from them you see what he's doing anything he wants he takes it I withheld not my heart from any Joy my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor he said I just did the work that I wanted to do you realize he had self-care down that's a a word a phrase we hear now self-care you need to treat yourself right and I I agree you do need to treat yourself right but after you've treated everybody else right right everybody else comes first first God and then everybody else and finally me at the bottom and that's that to me that's what the scripture teaches but yet that's what Jesus did when he was here yet he he said I wanted to be happy so I did whatever I wanted to do I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought on the labor that I labored to do behold all someone say all was vanity and vexation of spirit there was no profit Under the Sun Solomon proved that things won't make you happy people won't make you happy more money won't make you happy you were made for more than that amen see the Bible tells us in Hebrews 13:5 let your conversation let your manner of Life be without covetousness in other words wanting what other people have be content with such things as you have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee aren't you glad for that promise today brother brand said I've had the privilege of being in King's palaces from that to the lowest haunt on skidrow and I've never seen a contented sinner in my life that's right there's no happiness or contentment outside of Jesus Christ I've seen them so rich till they had bodyguards with them I seen them so poor till they beg for a drink of whiskey and from the one to the other there's no satisfaction in sin you see but brother man how can I be happy well the last time that human beings were happy all the time was in the Garden of Eden what changed that sin came in right right when they started trying to make themselves happy that's when they become miserable because sin came in and took over over yeah listen since then we've been unhappy but I believe today and I want you to understand this that sometimes God even uses that unhappiness to draw us to him he uses that moment of sorrow and that time when we're living Psalms 88 he uses that to just draw us closer to him right because we could never appreciate the the good times without the bad times we can never appreciate heaven without having to live here what do we do sometimes we feel like Paul oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death but I'm so glad he followed that up and he said I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord we may struggle we may have trials we may suffer in our bodies but brother Brandon says but in the but in the depths of our heart yeah there lays happiness it's there somewhere somewhere in the depths of your heart there lays happiness because that we know that we are absolutely someone say absolutely we are absolutely secure in Christ Jesus Hallelujah listen when Jehovah wrapped himself in flesh and came down to earth he came as a suffering servant he was born into poverty rumors swirled about who his father was he must have stuck out like a sore thumb because he was a teenager that did no sin so he must have been different from all the rest I see that amen sign back there as an adult he never had a house he was literally homeless cuz he said the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have Nest but the son of man hath not where to lay his head he had to send Peter fishing to pay his taxes I'm almost to that point myself he walked everywhere he went he had to borrow a donkey so the scripture could be fulfilled right he only had one set of clothes never owned a suitcase right and I get to look in the mind sometimes say that's about needs to be replaced it's been to Africa it's been to the Philippines it's it's been been to Africa twice been to the Philippines been uh to Egypt and it's just about it's about done I need to go replace it with a nicer one Jesus never even had one listen the Bible say says he's despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows in accord with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not yeah surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted the brand said the king of glory came down and tabernacled among men from the ivory palaces to take upon himself not the form of angels but a servant of man right clothed in humility wandered about no place to lay his head slept wherever he could scorned by the ones that he loved and was made finally a bleeding sacrifice but he pleased the father in so much he said this is my beloved Son hear ye him oh that's what I want to do I want to please the father don't you yes that's the way to be happy see the Bible says all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution we look at the Old Testament Saints Hebrews 11:37 it says they were stoned they were saw ther they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skin and goat skin being destitute I don't know which of those would stink more you know but that's what they had to wear being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy see today we look up to the to the successful Ministries to the people with lots of an aura of success around them an aura of wealth but that's not what they were they were men who no one would listen to they were men like Noah who preached for a hundred years and nobody got converted except his own family even one of them was a was a devil right you you you you realize that that that these men were men that had to stand even though nothing seemed to go right for them Abraham waited 25 years for the promise of a baby 25 years that's after he was given the promise yeah they were already decades into their marriage when they first started waiting but the world's not worthy of Abraham the world's not worthy of these others all right why brother BR said sometimes I wonder what Christianity expects today a preacher going to a town has to some new church or some new charge calls himself a prophet walks up there and says well if they'll give me so much money if I can have the best car if my salary will be raised every six months we have to have the best we have to have the best homes we have to have the best clothes what will we do and we stand in the presence of those men wandered in Goat skins and sheep skins no place to lay their heads wandering about in deserts and somebody can make fun of us and we're ready to quit church and not go back anymore he said what Christianity requires today we ought to be ashamed of ourselves oh God he said be merciful to us yes I don't have a problem with you having a nice house or a nice car or I don't have a problem with myself having one I'll say this we shouldn't go we we shouldn't spend our whole lives looking for that I don't believe we should necessarily overextend ourselves in debt to get it either because what what are we doing we're just pushing it down the road right and if we're not careful we're looking at the wrong things say well if I could just be like so and so but you don't know what so and so's like in the in the dark without the lights on some of these influencers let me give you a tip about social media you young people I hope you're not on social media yet but if you are I'll say let me give you a tip about that if you're if you look at social media especially like Instagram and Tik Tok you realize most of those accounts are fake I just found out that something that was a funny little video that we I just found out it was fake the other day it was something we had laughed about and quoted and stuff and the whole thing was made up and it's like Joe I was like what you know here people are trying to be that and trying to live like that and trying to do that if you watch people fish on Instagram you'll never go fishing again in your life fishing don't work like that come on church I you got real quiet but I know you watch stuff like that I some of y'all send me stuff so I know but what what what is going on what what is it it's a fake many times usually it it at least obscures the truth but what did Jesus do with all the suffering he went through now watch we suffer but we suffer with purpose we go through valleys but there's a mountain on the other side now look in Psalms 8814 let's read that again he said Lord why castest thou off my soul why hidest thou thy face from me look at the similarity with Matthew 27:46 about the 9th hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli Lama sa that is to say my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me have you ever really thought about that he wasn't saying that because well I got to say this to fulfill the scripture no it was rinsed out of his life that's right it it was pulled from him what was it it was his Humanity speaking right right because God had forsaken him he said he would never leave us but yet he he forsook him on the cross we know that he had to pay the penalty of sin which was more than just getting a a nail drove through your hand but it was the separation for the first time in his life he felt distant from the father and he never did anything to cause it and he cried out my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and that was not a sin right sir think about about it for a minute it he was not sinning that's right because he was discouraged right he did not sin because he asked God take this cup from me if it's possible and see so many times we beat ourselves up say well if I was a real Christian I wouldn't have talked like that I wouldn't have been that negative I wouldn't no he was not sinning when he was a human right right but he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done yes sir see it's when we try to escape it's when we try to go the wrong way it's when we quit church and decide we're just going to go out and be happy with the world that's when we begin to mess up he went ahead and did what God called him to do look brother beny was a man when he died on Calvary for a sacrificed bleeding the blood running out of him like a mortal spit hanging all over his beard he was a man disgrace standing there hanging in shame taking our place he was a man when the pains got so great till he cried my God my God why has s for for Aken me that was a man there but when he rose up on Easter morning he proved he was more than a man glory to God there was a grave but there was also a resurrection there was a Friday afternoon when it seemed like so dark when even the Sun blotted out but yet there was also a Easter Sunday morning right amen what made him faithful to the Cross but now go back to Psalm 88 what made hmon why was he faithful to prayer remember what he said in the morning my prayer will prevent thee he said I cry out daily to you why does he keep on going why does he keep on praying why does he keep on coming to church why does he keep doing that it must have been difficult but the but the faithfulness of of hmon speaks of the faithfulness of Christ who was faithful to the cross and the Bible says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every way and the sin which th so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him is called delayed gratification right he could have had instant gratification and come down off the cross but he didn't do it because he was willing to delay his happiness for a future time oh Hallelujah right look listen he said he for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God he recognized this Darkness was temporary the whole that was in his heart now look he had a hole in his heart just like you have a hole in yours and it's for the same thing he only ever prayed one prayer to the father you only ever asked for one thing rather what was it your fellowship all right that's the only thing he ever asked for he had a hole in his heart and there was only one way to have it filled that's to pay the penalty himself aren't you glad that he did oh my and so he was willing to in order to fellowship with you he was willing to go and die on the cross so that hole that emptiness could be filled our temporary unhappiness and spite of all that we have reminds us there is a place in our lives that only he can think about it Psalm 42:1 as the heart panth after the water Brooks so panth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God you see there was a hole in David's heart he said I'm like a deer that's been wounded and I'm I got to get the water that's the way I feel about being in your presence Lord my soul thirst for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before we got to present a living God if you don't present your young people a living God they'll begin to run after every other thing they begin to run after every satisfaction every every little bit of happiness the world can afford them why because they don't see a living God oh I pray we would present to our children a living God he's still the same yesterday today and forever he still raises the dead heals the sick cleanses the leper changes lives there's still joy in the house of God right amen it's a blessed thing to thirst for God Jesus said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled brother Braham teaches us that in thirsting for life and other thirst other sermons like that why do people smoke and drink and run around with women they're thirsty they're un they're unhappy that thirst is an an unhappiness is a thirst it's the desire Satan's trying to fill it with other things God made a way of Escape he said but they just won't take it what makes people do that because God made a man to thirst how dare any man try to satisfy that Holy thirst with the things of the devil don't you try to do that you'll never be satisfied it only brings heartaches makes you take a pistol and blow your brains out he said that don't have real life in it real life comes from God you can never be satisfied he said imp perfectly happy he said one of these half Christian supposed to be is the most miserable person in the world oh my more miserable than the sinner is the Halfway Christian that's never really committed himself to God he said oh I can't do this if my church knew I did that God knows you're doing it what difference does it make right there have your whole heart centered right on God and stay right with it you want to be happy he's telling you how to be happy stay right with it then you're happy walking peacefully with him how can I be happy how can I feel the whole that's in my heart find him he he died the death that he died to have us so he could be with us to fellowship with us and you and I to be happy we got to find him job said if I could just find him but he's here today in the form of the Holy Ghost he's here all you got to do is find him amen he said brother Ben that's simplistic that doesn't factor in my needs you realize it's the devil telling you that that's right he is the answer to all of our needs how can I be happy find him see you are his Joy did you know that you are the joy set before him fellowship with you is the happiness that he sought oh my if you're his Joy why don't you let him be yours why don't I let him be mine that's how be happy Luke 6 and 20 he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said Blessed Be you poor for yours is the kingdom of God blessed are you that hunger now you shall be filled blessed are you that weep now for you shall laugh blessed are you when men shall hate you when they shall separate you from their company shall reproach you cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake what does it sound like Psalms 88 Rejoice ye in that day yeah and leap for Joy other words he said if you're being persecuted you ought to be jumping in the house of God can you imagine somebody coming I know we're human beings right when we get healed we want to and God's still a Healer you believe that we ought to praise him for our healing but when we get healed we want to come in and and we're excited we're happy when we have a particularly good service when we get a revelation about the word something good happens to us or we get a good job or we're happy we're going to come to church and jump for joy I'm afraid to jump afraid I break the concrete but I bounce a little bit but you know that's what we're that's what we we we we do we tend to jump for joy but what did he say when the last time you had somebody come to church and say oh praise God I'm so happy today thank the Lord what happened brother what did you get get a new job did you get a new wife what happened to you no brother I got persecuted today today they called me names today they cast me out of their company and the scripture says when that happens to me to leap for Joy I think we'd have church are you with me now you can't do that outside of Christ hum The Human Condition that doesn't allow us to do that right outside of the spirit of God said but W to you are that are rich for you received your consolation other words you got what you wanted here you got everything you wanted but remember there's something in across the veil that's more real than this see Leia think they Rich have I got five more minutes I don't want to take up all your time tonight Lea thinks they're rich so there's no future joy to look forward to right they say I'm rich I'm increase with Goods I have need of nothing and Jesus is outside the door come on I want in come on now and they don't even hear it because they're they're rich what do they have need of what could he possibly offer them that they don't have see I think today we need to understand we we may be poor I think all of us are poor by lab seeing standards just by nature of where we live probably but we're rich compared to other people in the world but we may be poor by latery and standards but I want to testify tonight that I found the one who makes me Rich I found the one who gives me water I found the one who makes me happy I found the one can you testify to that tonight I found [Music] him some of y'all need to find him tonight ReDiscover him we all need to come to church say brother been I'm already here I know about to close brother Brandon looked at that bubbling brook remember told that story over and over again that Brook was bubbling he sat down by it and he said he said if I could have talked to it if it could have talked back I just said little Brooke why are you bubbling so he said is it because the animals drink from you he said no that's not it is it because the is it because I drink from you prophet of God you know said no that's not it sowh are you bubbling little Brooke what makes you so happy you would say this you see I'm bubbling up CU there's something behind me pushing me there's something bubbling inside I can't hold it it has to bubble out and even when I'm in my darkest moments I still pray there's something to be said for that church even when I'm hurting in the worst moment of my life I still pray there's something bubbling inside I can't hold it it has to bubble out sir and every man that's born of the spirit of God has the inexhaustible Fountain of Christ inside that's bubbling out just something that you can't hold your peace why are you happy in church on a Wednesday night I I believe you're happy you may not have discovered your happiness but deep down on the inside of your heart it's there the house of the Lord Brother B say is the joy of the Lord all right this is where we fellowship with one another yeah and with him yeah now we fellowship with him every day but we take this time aside and it's very special because we're focused on him we're not thinking about everything else we're focused on him and he just must he must just love that because that was the joy that was set before him is to be able to come in the cool of the evening that's what he was missing brother Paul he wanted to come back down he was coming down to find Adam to have church with him again so he get have church with him again he was going to come in the cool of the evening under the trees and talked to Adam and Adam hid himself made made goat skins or or made fig leaves and put on him and tried to cover himself and he said Adam Adam Where Art Thou what was he doing it was the Cry Of God it was that that hole that he had to feel he wanted to be in church with you don't you realize that the church he said that the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satisfied giving praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to God he wants you to do that oh can we do that tonight he wants us to do that that's what he wants he said but I've been through so much for the man but that's the one he really wants to hear from yes that's the one it must have been precious to him every time hymon would would would begin to pray and cry out to God it must have been precious to Jehovah because he knew how much he'd been through yeah but he waited because there was something he was doing in his life yes oh my there's nothing spiritual about being miserable right when we are miserable it's because many times we're in our humanity and and that's not sin that's not sin you got to take some time sometimes you got to take a break sometimes you got to step back I'm not saying from church or the things of God God because that's your spiritual side sometimes you just got to give yourself a little bit of relief and quit standing there at the grindstone but your real happiness is found in God nothing spiritual about being miserable there's nothing spiritual about being unhappy because what if we really knew what he had already done for us how could we ever be unhappy again you know there'll come a time and wipe the tears from our eyes do you know that in heaven in at the marriage supper the say go down that line wipe the tears from our eyes that's what the Bible says you'll wipe the tears from our eyes and I'm thinking how could we be there crying but brother Brandon when he saw him beyond the curtain of time I noticed a little detail I just listened to the sermon he said he was talking about that he said they were crying tears of joy Hallelujah they were just so happy to see brother brandom because they knew oh they said our precious brother they come in under his ministry they were identified with his ministry and so they were so happy to see him that they cried tears of joy it wasn't tears of Sorrow some of you are crying that right now tears of joy you know how much he's done for you let's be happy in the Lord there'll come a day and wipe every tear from our eyes we may feel like Psalm 88 but let's sing to the Lord with joy and gladness give him the glory due to his name pick up our symbols and play do the very best that we can to give him what he deserves and give and and let him know how much we love him he's the only thing that can fill that hole in our heart would you bow your heads with me musicians go ahead and come I'm going to very quickly turn over to brother Joel and let him sing but I just want to give you an opportunity to think and to pray and to pray this is the joy of the Lord you fellowshipping with him you just put everything aside for just a moment everything else let's think about him Lord I've been going through some things but I I'm still here Lord still here knocking said ask and you shall receive knock and it shall be open to you seek and you shall find the joy of the Lord the psalmist says is my strength that's a miracle in itself because sorrow brings sorrow brings weakness but joy brings strength and and the to be able to have joy and strength within the sorrowful moments of our life that's a miracle he wants to do that for you would you just talk to him like that Lord Lord I love you I thank you I I worship you tonight I Lord take away every thought of just fulfilling my desires making myself happy Lord let me make you happy by fellowshipping with you let me pick up my Bible again let me let let me begin the prayer closet again let me get back in touch with you Lord that's the way to be happy Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you today we know that our Prophet told us that Lord that you want us to be happy that you didn't want us to be miserable you wanted us to play like children before the father Lord sometimes children get hurt or sometimes we live in Psalm 88 but there's a reason why you allowed that to be put there why you inspired it Lord we think of inspiration as being some great thing but Lord sometimes it comes out of the very depths of the darkness of the place where we live yet it's still inspired oh God I pray you'd help us today Lord if there's someone struggling today I don't know that there is but if there is I pray God you'd Comfort their hearts today I pray you'd help them to know that peace that passes understanding Lord and the joy of the Lord that can bring strength to their life Lord for those of us Lord who have struggled we've come out and we encourage others oh God at the end where they're at is not the end the end is INS sight there's coming a day when all every sorrow will be over every tear will be wiped away we're so thankful for that Lord I pray you bless these people I pray you've met some need tonight I I don't know why I I preach this Lord I it's odd even to myself but I pray God that you'd somehow touch every heart we pray and we ask it in Jesus name amen hallelujah we just worship if you need prayer the altar is open be glad to pray with you I'll stay up here for just a minute brother Joel if you would come and lead your [Music] name oh I bless your name with all your hearts now oh I bless your
