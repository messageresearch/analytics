we're looking for that day I pray you bless this service Lord I I pray I've got these prayer claws in my hand Lord I pray that you'd bless them Lord and the places where they go Lord as we know they took from the body of Paul claws handkerchiefs and aprons Lord and and we know that that is a way Lord to raise the people's faith and I pray that you'd bless them Lord where they go I pray that you'd touch every sick body Touch Me Lord touch every every heart and bring us closer to you in this communion service we pray in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah 2 Kings chapter 7 and verse three I've just got a few things on my heart and we'll get right into the communion service this afternoon Second Kings 7 and three it says there were four leprous men at the entering end of the gate they said one to another why sit we here until we die I want to title our thought tonight why sit we here until we die pray the Lord would that his Blessing to the word you may be seated someone has said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results Samaria was capital of the Kingdom of Israel at that time and they were had been besieged by the Syrian Army and the four men had leprosy so they were already had very difficult lives in fact best they could hope for is to hope for a few coins thrown in their general direction out of pity because they thought leprosy was contagious and so people wouldn't come near them in fact uh they had to holler out unclean unclean if they would go uh down the street and so the people they they just they wouldn't even get near them but they throw coins in their Direction but this was a time when there was no coins there was no money and if you even if you had money there was no food to buy because the siege had gone on for so long and the famine was so great it was scarce food was scarce for them even in good times but now it's non-existent and so these four men come back day after day and I want you think about it for a moment they come back every day and they come back and they sit by the gate and the gate's closed no one's coming in or going out no one has any bread no one has any ability to give in fact it's gotten so bad in the city that the Bible tells us that mothers were were cooking their children I know it's graphic but that's what the Bible says and eating those children they turned into cannibals because it' gotten so bad in the city and here were lepers like the lowest of the low in the city on the lowest rung the last ones to get fed would be the lepers and even the king didn't have anything to eat and the lepers were down here and there by them and and and they come back and I can just imagine I don't know how long they did it they may they may come back for a week week for a month for a year and however long that it was they just kept coming back and they're coming back to the gate and and they sit down and get ready to beg there's nothing to beg of there's no food and they just sat there it just sat there and it reminds me of people you know sometimes we get stuck in a rut we we've been doing something the same way and we've do it over and we do it over and we do it over and we do it over again and and finally one of them looks at the other maybe it's named name was Joe he said you know he said you know Joe he said why don't we do something different how about today we do something different the what we're doing is not working it's not getting us anywhere we're just we keep coming back and the famine still out there and and everybody's scared to move and scared to do anything they said we might as well do something different they said if we sit here we're going to die if we sit here what we're doing isn't working and again it it reminds me of you know maybe things have happened in your family and things in and in mine and I got thinking about things that even in in my own life and things that have happened and and and you look back at your father and your mother and your grandparents and you think well they did things a certain way but but I don't necessarily have to do it that way and maybe in our church we do things a certain way and we come a certain way but maybe we don't always have to do it that way we just want to come according to the word but if what you're doing right now isn't working maybe you ought to try doing something else right is that is that okay tonight and they lived in a time when death was everywhere and I want you to understand today that death is everywhere the death angel has come and he he smoted every every church every home with spiritual death and the only one he can't get to is those under the token but if we've not been living like we should if we've not been if we've not been uh uh if we not been stepping out into the promises of God and we keep falling back in the same traps why not take a chance and step out do something different for a change you've sat there for for 30 years and never raised your hand never raised your voice well maybe try something different maybe you for all these years you'd say well I I've never been a sh maybe try something different uh maybe maybe in your family you you always uh you always were uh uh you always treated your wife a certain way and she always treated you a certain way why not try something different just because you've always done it don't mean you always have to do it that way they said we're Beggars but we're going to die like this and I watch people you know you forgive me but as a pastor you watch people they uh they did things a certain way to get in a certain condition and they get in that condition and then they they they get out of it in some way or another and they get forgiveness or or healing or something like that but then they go back to doing things the same way well if it got you in that condition in the first place if not reading your Bible caus you to be backslid in the first place it'll do it again right why sit here until you die you might as well get up and believe the word of God you might as well follow God you might as well do what God says you know every time you get sick you I know sometimes we feel like well I just can't overcome this sickness why not try to step out in faith and believe what What God Says what you're doing is not working and I don't think that should be a discouragement to us it's but there's an opportunity to do something different and in 2 Kings 7:3 it says why sit we here till we die if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come this guy had a bright idea didn't he let us fall to the host of the syrians if they say alive we shall live if they kill us we shall but die it's like we're going to die anyway huh that's pretty morbid it's pretty dark but the point is we got to do something anything's better than sitting and rotting on a church pew I hope you hear me so well I I you know I never could get really the faith to go up and be prayed for anything's better than staying in that condition right why sit here until you die you sit here in in a bad situation I told people before the only worst the worst thing in a marriage is not fussing it's apathy right and I'd say in our relationship with Christ the worst thing is not fussing it's not that we're we we're we're uh in other words it's not that we're uh we're struggling or wrestling with things that's not the worst thing the worst thing is not caring right because then you're dying and you're sitting there and you might as well do something different you know and many times we resist the word in our lives might as well wholly follow the word of God might as well believe the message of the hour might as well step out in faith and follow and see maybe God will do something in our lives but brother brandom tells us that he said they had a little dingy faith I love the way he put that a little dingy Faith but it was enough to move them and I'll say tonight I want to challenge us how much Faith do we have tonight it may be just a little dingy Faith but is it enough to move us to do something different to apply a different kind of Faith than what we've had not something against the word but something that would follow the word now what what happened in this situation when they said this they didn't realize that that day a Vindicated Prophet named Elisha that was in the city that day he had said tomorrow you're going to be able to buy bread at a normal price right that he had already said that but they didn't know what a Vindicated Prophet said so they said we might as well just go if we die we die right but we're not under that they only went because anything is better than what they were doing but now many times brother Brandon would speak to someone on a wheelchair on a on a c and in in particular and they would be sitting there and he would tell this story to that person and he said it's like the leper sitting at the gate and said why sit we here till we die he said if they go in the city at Samaria they was already starving eating one another's children if they sit there they die died they had to go down to the enemy's camp and they took that chance he said you don't have to take that chance see it's not a chance for us you're not invited to an enemy's Camp you're invited to the throne of your father oh my oh aren't you glad you've not been invited to an enemy's Camp you're not saying well maybe they'll maybe he'll spare us maybe he'll let us live but you've been invited to the throne of your father you remember the prodigal son when he went out when he was coming back home he said maybe my father let me live like one of the hired servants oh that wasn't the kind of man his father was he said father let me live like one of your hired servants he said no bring the best robe bring kill the fatted C put the ring on his finger amen what was it you might as well accept a Father's love you might as well follow what he said to do now look he said the Throne of your father's expecting you to come tonight you're not lepers sitting at the gate waiting taking a chance on a miracle your son's and Daughters of the king so I'll say this when we get up from our seats tonight to take communion why sit here till we die maybe we've done that a hundred times but this time let's make a full commitment to God this time let's follow the word with all of our heart this time let's believe for our healing this time let's believe that our church is going to be in Revival this time let's believe for the Salvation of our children he said but I've come a h hundred times before this time take a step of Faith do something something different try believing try coming to church with a positive attitude what you're doing is not working you might as well do something different right are you with me now I'm not trying to be hard but sometimes we just need to be shook up a little bit just need to do something different why sit here till we die you're not taking a chance on a miracle what does the Bible say is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of Faith what does it say shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven him it's a One-Stop shop he said call for the Elders of the church say well I just you know I just sit here and I got these issues in my life you might as well take a step of Faith what you doing is not working confess your faults one to another oh I think people ought to try that sometime pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much listen if if the more you stay out of church the more backslid you get try something different the farther you hang back from God the more you go out in the world the more you dabble in things you know better than to dabble in try something different come back to the communion table get up from where you're at and just just make a move he said does that matter it matters to God he sees your intent and your faith and your sincerity when you do he said confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much see were not lepers waiting on a handout from a denominational leader or the wife of the king or his bride why sit we here the price has been paid is our home life in chaos start having family prayer again why sit we here till we die are you sick call for the Elders of the church come lay hands on you why sit we here till we die are we in financial need don't sit and worry about it go to work and believe God will provide see Faith isn't sitting at home worrying faith is talk taking your resume to every business in town right it's not just sitting in home worrying about it well I may not be able to make the bills this month and and I've had people tell me that and say well God hasn't given G me a job I don't know what he's waiting on well he may be waiting on you to pick up your resume and take it somewhere right get up and see what God will do walk and that's just a natural thing but that's important to us isn't it we want to make sure our families are provided for why sit in church miserable do something different huh if those old conspiracies aren't working for you let them go if that Grudge isn't working for you let it go you'll die there if that bitterness isn't working Let It Go are you backslid upslide say brother Ben I can't do that take the step of Faith you've ever seen these kids out here half of them more than half of them they all be going the wrong way up the slide you ever notice that in the playground it's want to prove they can do it why don't you begin to start being a son or daughter of God and say well you know and you say well I back said I don't know how to get back we'll start undoing the things you did to backslide or doing the things you failed to do when you backslid see he wants you you're not you're not going to an enemy's Camp you're coming to the throne of the king he's waiting on you with open arms huh if if you quit reading your Bible quit listening to tapes become unfaithful to the church and that cause trouble in your home do the opposite don't sit there and die you don't have to be what your parents were your grandparents were what somebody else was sit there and die listen brother brand says this he said he was ask a question brother brandom I'm saved and I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but how do I get away from a stubborn spirit that I can't seem to break away from well my Christian brother or sister whoever it may be he said now most times when you find people who got stubborn Spirits it's usually a complex that causes you that have inherited from mother father Uncle an or grandmother grandfather somebody like that whoever you want to blame it on and if you'll Trace back down through your life you'll find he said I've taken this by experience under discernment because I've met cases on the platform thousands of those that had that Spirit the first thing you know i' chase that Spirit right back by discernment and find there was a granddaddy there was a grandmother was somebody else back down there and you inherit that by Nature stubborn stubbornness is not of God and only way to get away from that he say is you have to have faith to overcome that that you're a Christian it's not some magic Hocus Pocus or something that make you overcome that you got to have faith Faith you got to believe he said you're a son or daughter of God whichever you may be you'll never be able just to stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it you said it's just like penalizing a rattlesnake he's laying there trying to ready to bite you if you'll just ignore him and listen walk away from him he can't hurt you if you've been striking at it and it keep striking back walk away from it well I can't kill this serpent well go where he's not then right keep having problems with your phone shut it off why sit we here till we die right everybody so why wish the church was on fire get on fire get in your prayer closet me to cry out to God and God will give you the fire why it's just something many times we're not we're waiting on God to do something he's already done all he's going to do he's just waiting on us to make a move the word of the Prophet had already been spoken he said tomorrow there'll be bread in the city oh they had to do was get up from where they were and move to a land of possibility all you have to do is get up from where you're at I pray this would happen tonight as we take communion I know it's an odd communion sermon but we we physically we have to get up and come take the communion made me think of this why sit there till we die might as well take communion might as well serve God say well I'm not able to take communion because I got this in my life well repent of it and if you're not a Christian become a Christian how do I do that acts 238 repent be baptized right you can do that you can do that you'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he said don't just strike at it ignore it and walk away from it so when you feel you got a stubborn Spirit lay the thing on the Altar and believe God that the thing is dead never you'll never have it no more and go on don't even pay any attention to it no more and the thing will leave you resist the devil and he'll flee from you that is get away quickly so that would be my advice how to overcome it he said we overcome the Devil by faith that's what we overcome all evil is by faith again brother brandom has asked a similar question when a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex how may he overcome this he said so should it be if he was the only child caused this in his early youth so they're wondering what caused it brother BR just gives them a simple answer he said take exactly the opposite if you're always wanting your way and that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way turn right back to around give everything you got the other way so you realize the question they're asking why brother BR said that one little brat because they said do I have an inferiority some sort of complex because I was an only child you don't have to right don't speak that thing on yourself you don't have to you may be an only child and you could be uh the best most generous least spoiled only child in the world right if you just take the opposite you don't have to be that way if you're selfish you want to hold everything he said then start giving what you got do whatever just go vice versa that's the way to overcome anything is an antidote old southern mother used to say hair off the dog back is good for the bite right and just do it he said that applies this way too he said but brother Ben that's not spiritual enough it's very spiritual it was a it was the only thing that would save Israel is for four lepers to get up and do something different are we discouraged we need to encourage ourselves in the Lord like David listen I've read this quote to you many times but I just read it here and then we'll close in just a moment but he said if you notice it's when you're discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you that's when he gets you if you come to the church and say well I don't know I don't know whether I'll ever get any better or not I've been prayed for twice Oh my he said you might as well get go home that's all but when you can cast that aside God don't want you to be frowning how many believe that tonight God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in his love knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's NE the powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him we're in him and we never come in by our own will but he by choice elected us and brought us into him amen so it's his business to take care of what he took himself other words he bought you it's his business to take care of what he purchased no man can pluck them from my father's hands cuz he's the greatest of all of them he said it's the father who takes care of it who's got any more power than God what kind of a power have you got over you to take care of you the whole power is the creator the universe took the solar system and said I can't even do it blew like that every Star went to its place sure he said he watches over you that's the kind of a father we have do you believe that tonight can we say Amen to that Lord I believe you're able I'm going to take this step of Faith why sit here until we die might as well be happy serve God so you can't live like that can't live miserable punishing yourself all the rest of your life you can't do that and you don't have to see brother brandom he talks to people that are sick he said sir you have cancer yellow jaundice you can't live laying there this is this is a powerful truth it's not very deep but it's powerful he would tell a person laying there he said you can't live laying there and the person is saying well if I get up I can't live I'll just die faster but what does getting up do it's not that they getting up miraculously healed them but getting up was an Act of Faith right because when they first got up they didn't feel like getting up they didn't get up from the wheelchairs because they felt like it they didn't get up because they suddenly felt strong they got up and then received strength that's true in the scriptures remember when they told the lame man such as I have I give and said when they grabbed him by the hand they held him up he say pretty his ankle bones receive strengths and pretty soon he's walking leaping and praising God but what was it he had to get strength but the act of getting up was an Act of Faith right he said he said he said if you lay there you'll die he said but you couldn't he said I tried I don't I can't heal you but you couldn't hide what's wrong with you see it's there you can't live sitting there you know that cuz you're gone they say it's in your stomach and it is it's in the liver which is causing the jaice to come up but do you believe with all your heart and ready now like those men who laid at the gate down there at Samaran say why sit we here till we die you're going to die laying there you've only got one chance and that is to accept him while you're in his presence believe it with all your heart he said will you do that and in the name of Jesus Christ believe it with all your heart rise up take your cot and go home thanking and praising God oh I think we need more faith like that he said do you believe that oh God will give him strength he said don't worry about that he said there is he must have gotten up and been weak he said there he is going to take his cop fold her up and go home Hallelujah he said the rest of you believe stand up on your feet now what about you getting up he said I don't care what's wrong with you raise up oh can we do that and I'm not talking about just literally or just physically but in our Spirits in our homes whatever is wrong with us stand up do something different begin to worship God again begin to have family prayer again begin to cry out to God again why sit there until you die Oh my he said raise your hands and give him praise amen again there was a man in a wheelchair he said you're shadowed for death it's cancer in the lung would you believe that God will make you well you do and if I was in your place you know what I'd do he said there was some lepers said at the gate one time and they said why sit we here till we die let's get up and do something about it if we sit here we'll die and and he said if we go in the city they're dying in there so we haven't got no choice if we go down to the camp they might spare us you're going to die in that condition sitting in that wheelchair Jesus Christ is your only hope now that's right he said so why don't you rise up from there take your chair and go home and be well in the name of Jesus Christ he said Do you believe every one of you then stand to your feet I don't care what's wrong with you now listen what he said stand up on your feet and believe God all that wants to receive Christ at this time raise up on your feet anywhere you want to he said raise up your hands now in praise to God raise up your hands believe him here comes the man up out of the wheelchair he said let's say praise the Lord he said everybody stand up this is powerful he said regardless of your pain the Pain's real but you got to stand up it's not that the Pain's not there it's not that you won't have to face it anymore the Pain's real but stand up or you're going to die doing things the way you've always done it stand up that C's not look not working for you the wheelchair is not working for you stand up look now look you look at brother brandom and think what kind of a man would make hurting people stand up CU maybe they had achieve some level of comfort in the cot some level of comfort in the wheelchair I this is odd tonight but it's just what was on my heart it achieved some level of comfort with that and they're just sitting back there by the west and saying well you know this is pretty good you know I'm listening to the word someday God's going to come heal me and a prophet of God said I don't care how much pain you're in I want you to stand up those that stood were healed Church see what we want somebody to sympathize with us but it's not what we need many times and there's time for that there's a there's a time and appropriate place for that but many times what we need is somebody tell us stand up why because unless they responded in faith to the word they would die sitting where they were he said oh Lord God we look at the Unseen We Believe now that you're Jesus Christ the son of God we condemn every Spirit of devil and doubt may they walk by the Unseen tonight Grant it Lord through Jesus Christ the son of God we ask it he said praise him with all your heart get up out of your chairs everywhere be well and healed in the name of Jesus Christ God bless you brother step out of there and go on home where does brother Bram get that from he didn't just create that but Jesus one time was at the pool of Bethesda you remember the story and he goes down to the pool of Bethesda and he bypasses those people there's a man there with maybe a prostate trouble or something that was wrong with him he could walk but he couldn't get down to the pool quickly enough before he got down there somebody else got in and you remember it was a real strange thing the angel but the pr said God always had some way of healing and so the angel would come down and trouble The Waters at a certain season and when he come down to trouble the waters they had to rush in because only the first one that got in got healed everybody else can you imagine how disappointing that was he sat there for years decades with enough Faith to believe that if he could make it he could be healed but he couldn't make it Jesus comes by because it it was a predestinated moment he was a predestinated seat of God and Jesus makes his way down through the mothers with little children with cancer and all these other things makes his way down through all of that brother BR said we don't understand compassion compassion is doing the will of God Jesus makes his way through all that crowd 5,000 people historians say sitting around that pool and and if you can imagine the scene Jesus makes his way unobserved didn't they didn't even notice he was in the church but he was there he makes his way down there and when he gets down to the to the place where the miles where the man was sitting there he looks at me he said do you want to be well the King James puts it this way wil thou be made whole wil thou be made whole it's a strange question isn't it well I've been here for 38 years you know and been trying to get down here and I can't make it he said before I get in he told him wilt thou be made whole he said if you'll be made well get up and walk pick up your bed amen hallelujah if you'll be made whole pick up your bed do you want to be well if so rise up and walk he picked up his bed and walked home sir what was it that's where brother bandam gets that from if you want to be well sometimes you got to you got to say you do if you want to be well sometimes you got to get up and come if you want to be well do you realize that if you believed it and I I you say brother Ben can you explain it I I can't explain it has something to do with our faith and and obedience to the word of God when we come to the communion table do you realize there's healing in that there's healing in just the act of coming if you would believe that you could get up from where you're at whatever situation you're in and come to the communion table tonight and say tonight I'm going to be well tonight I'm going to have strength in my body tonight I'm going to be I'm going to be better than I was tonight that old besetting sin is falling off of me tonight's going to be different I'm going to get up from where I am why sit here till we die let's get up and do something about it he said well communion is nothing don't you think that there's no power in the literal bread or the wine but there is power in obedience to the word of God do you believe it tonight amen as the brothers would come and I need a piano and organ player let's just bow our heads for a moment let's leave the past in the past say Lord I want to be well I I want to be a real Christian I want to lay aside every besetting sin I believe he is Made A Way by his death on the cross for you you and for me to reach that place where there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit as we pray as we're getting ready to to read the scripture and then take communion I just want you to in your own heart just search your heart and say Lord I'm examining myself tonight before I come to the communion t table Lord I I want the faith to be able to get up and respond to your word and just do what your word says I believe you'll meet me there you'll help me I don't have the strength to stand on my own but if I can just get up you you'll help me the rest of the way if you really believe that you just talk to him that way Heavenly Father we come to the communion tonight we we thank you for giving us strength we thank you for this church Lord of lovely Christians who oh love you with all our hearts Lord I I I know there's maybe situations that we just need to walk away from give us the strength to do it Lord Lord and the and and the faith to believe your word just get up and move do what God says Lord as we come to the communion table May there be strength in US Lord to believe that everything will be taken care of we walk away completely well I pray you grant it Lord we thank you for it in Jesus name name amen I'm going to read just a portion of scripture from 1 Corinthians chapter 11 just believing the Lord is going to do Mighty works tonight Paul says for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do it in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had slept saying this cup is a new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily should be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup [Music] amen Lord Jesus I hold in my hands is the bread which is a type of your broken body Lord may this never become a form but God may we remember in our minds Lord on on this communion day Lord what you did for us by your death on the cross we get up and take advantage of that tonight Lord I pray you grant it now in Jesus [Music] name father for the the wine Lord which is a type of the Holy Spirit I pray God that you'd move Lord May the stimulation of Revelation come in every one of our hearts or just that maybe be a revelation to us just to get up just to make a move do something different and begin to walk with you I pray you grant it Lord why sit we here until we die we we want to be different Lord I pray you you grant it from this moment on as these elements pass through our bodies may we be healed may we be Lord exactly what you'd have us to be we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you the Jeff will direct you as you come and I love that old cross where the dearest and best oh thank
