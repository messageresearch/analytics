Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just come before you yet one more time. Lord, we're just so thankful that as your word says, if two or three are gathered together in your name that you'll be here in our midst, Lord. And we realize in the scriptures that every time that you showed up somewhere, Lord, it was for a purpose. Lord, if it was to heal the sick or to raise the dead or to deliver those that are bound, Lord, there was a purpose behind you showing up. So, Lord, we just invite you into this service, Lord, we just ask that you would be with those needs, Lord. that you would just uh break the chains of those people that are bound, Lord. Heal the sick, deliver those of us that need deliverance, Lord. Whatever the need is amongst the people tonight, Lord, we just ask that you would take those needs into consideration tonight, Lord, and that you would just give them a special touch from you, Lord.

Is there a mountain in front of you that doubt says we'll never move? And you wonder, will God make a way? Well, tell me a time he's not been faithful. Tell me a morning his mercies were new. Tell me a moment he was unable to carry you through. [Music] Tell me a day he was less than almighty when he couldn't roll back the tide. Child, when you look back, you're going to find there was never a time. &gt;&gt; So be strong in the Lord and remember to hold fast to faith and stand firm. Oh, you can be confident the Lord keeps his promises. If you doubt it, just read through his word. Tell me a time he's not been faithful. Or tell me a morning his mercies were new. Tell me a moment he wasn't able to carry you through. Tell me a day he was less than almighty when he couldn't roll back the tide. Child, when you look back, you're going to find there was never a time. Oh, he can work miracles, do the impossible. If you don't believe it, then go on and try. Oh, to tell me a time he's not been faithful. Or tell me a morning his mercies were new. Tell me a moment he was unable to carry you through. Tell me a day he was less than almighty when he couldn't roll back the time. child. When you look back, you're going to find there was never a day he was less than almighty. When he couldn't roll back the tide, child, when you look back, you're going to find there was never a time Amen. [Music] You believe that tonight never a time that he wasn't faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. We're going to sing Lord send the rain. &gt;&gt; He's looking forward to the word of the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We sure enjoyed the service this morning. My goodness, how it all tied together. I told him, I said, "You just about lost me." I said, "Then you tied it all together there at the end." And it just made sense. And so I was uh I enjoyed it this morning, man. The Lord's been good to us. Oh Lord, we are the ones called by your name. We humble ourselves now as we pray. renouncing every sin and wicked way. We lift our voice, seek your face and say, "Oh Lord, send rain." Oh, you pour out your spirit. And I fall all on me. Oh, won't you pour out the fire [Music] on me? [Music] Oh Lord, we are the ones called by your name. [Music] And we humble ourselves down as we pray, reounce together sin and away. Oh, we lift our voice. We see your face and say, "Oh Lord, what you Yeah. [Music] Oh, you pour out your sp. Sing it one more time with all your hearts now. Oh my go pour out the spirit. Let the fire fall. Heal us one and all. All fresh on me. Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise. Amen. Aren't you ready for the fire to fall on us tonight? Amen. I know we sang this at the very end of the service this morning, but it comes to me just now. It won't be long. Amen. It won't be long till we be leaving here. And we just want to sing this with all of our hearts as our pastor comes this evening to speak to us. And Amen. And are you under expectation tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe if you're expecting something from the Lord, you get what you expect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you expect it to be real long, it might be real long. But if you expect it, you know, to go by quick and you expect to enjoy it, it's going to be an enjoyable long time. And so I'll say this, you get what you expect. And I think if the if the church would come under expectation, there's just no telling what God might do tonight. And I know sometimes we get a little tired. If you get tired, just stand up and back the preacher. and you feel better. You feel better. So, just back the word with all you got. And I do believe with all my heart that God can move right in here just like a Saturday night meeting service, just like any other service because there's no limit to my God and what God can do. Amen. We've seen so many testimonies coming in and I'll say this, all the testimonies that have come in. Amen. That wasn't because a certain man was here, but it was the same God that's here every service. &gt;&gt; And you say, "How do we know he's here?" because he promised to be with his believers when they gather together. So under expectation, let's invite our pastor and let's sing this with all of our hearts. So it won't be long. It won't be long and then we'll be leaving here. Oh, it won't be long. Oh, and we'll be going home. [Music] Oh, so count the years as much and count the months as [Music] and count the weeks as days. Any day now. Oh, we be going home. It won't be long again. Oh, it won't be long. You believe it to sing and it will be. Oh, it won't be long. It won't be long. will be going away. Oh, count the years. Oh, so count the years as Thank you, Lord. Oh, count the months as weeks. Oh, can you do that tonight? Oh, count the weeks as days. Any day now. Oh, we'll be going home. Sing that again. Count the years this month. Oh, if you can count the years. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, count the months as we thank you, Lord. Count the weeks as days any day now. Oh, we'll be going home. Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, we're so privileged to be in your house again tonight and to thank you for your goodness and your mercy and your grace. Lord, I pray that you'd just move in a mighty way as only you can. Lord, I pray that our praise would be acceptable in your sight. Lord, our worship, I pray, God, that if there's any need among us, that you would meet that need tonight as we know only you can. I pray that you'd move me out of the way. Speak, Lord, that you know you put this on my heart. Lord, it must be for some purpose. I pray that that purpose would be fulfilled. Lord, move me out of the way so you can speak directly to your people tonight. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn with me to 1 Chronicles chapter 22. 1 Chronicles chapter 22 and verse 5. Good to see everybody tonight. I uh hope I didn't keep you too long this morning. We're going to go right back into the word tonight. Uh you can go back to this morning's sermon maybe if you weren't here or something and kind of give you a better idea what we're talking about this evening. We're talking about building the temple, David's preparation for building the temple. 1 Chronicles 22:5, David said, Solomon, my son, is young and tender. And the house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnical fame and glory throughout all countries. So he's weighing these two things. He said Solomon's got to build the temple. Solomon is young and tender and the house has to be exceeding of exceeding magnificance magnificence of fame and glory through all countries. He said, I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death. Pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this evening. As we talked this morning about David uh preparing, he he made the nails. He made the He he he he made the uh doors, the hinges on the doors. He wrote the songs that would be sung, though he would never step foot into the temple itself. He wrote it. He did that for another generation. And he did that not for his own good but for the benefit of Solomon because Solomon was being a type of Christ was the one that that would enter in. Solomon would uh would would build the temple and Christ was the temple of God. And so we find David preparing for that for that for that coming of Solomon just like John the Baptist prepared uh for Jesus made a way for Jesus just like the message of the hour. uh brother Brandham came to us. He brought a message to us to make a way for Christ the word himself to be unveiled to us. And so we believe that that's happened in our day. Now in his preparation for building the temple, David recognized that Solomon had been appointed. He had been anointed for the job. He was he was supposed to do that. And yet he was young and tender and and it was not appropriate to put Solomon into a position that he wasn't yet ready for. And yet the temple could not be built until Solomon was uh ready to do it until David was gone. So what did David do? He didn't try to push Solomon beyond his years. What he did was he he said, "I'm going to do I'm going to prepare I'm going to prepare the building and I'm going to prepare Solomon. I'm going to build something. He wasn't just building a building, but he was building a person to build a building. He was gathering materials to build Solomon to build the temple. So, it was perhaps maybe the foundation of youth ministry as we know it today was actually was Solomon or David preparing Solomon for this job. Now, the word tender is used in the sense of unspoiled by experience. In other words, not callous. We heard about that the other day. Not callous, not not uh uh not complexed up, not not bitter, not not upset by what's went on in their life, but somebody who was tender, who can still be reached. And and so it it's it's unspoiled by experience. and and perhaps Solomon, he he knew Solomon being the age that he was, he didn't expect Solomon to go out and start buying building the temple and buying nails and putting together a building. That's not what David did at all. So, he wasn't making Solomon do it. He was doing it himself and preparing Solomon for a future work. &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; So, that's what we do as parents and as as pastors, as as youth leaders. We're preparing kids. We're preparing young people. We're not preparing them just to be kids, not to just stay kids. We're preparing them to take our jobs, &gt;&gt; right? We're not looking at that and saying, "Well, with some kind of like Saul would look down on David and say, well, he's coming for my job." But we're looking at said, we want to prepare them, make them ready for that &gt;&gt; while they're young and tender, preach a gospel that they can understand, something that they can grab a hold of &gt;&gt; and be a part of. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, David, while Solomon was young and tender, he taught him to be a king. And there's a way to do that. I want you to go uh to the story of Esau and Jacob. And you'll find in Genesis 33 and:12 that there's a way that you've got to handle those who are tender and those who are young. There's a way that you got to handle it. We're going to look at this for for a little bit of time tonight and and look at it and maybe as parents, as as uh as adults, as as elders, as I identified with the elders this morning now that I've turned 40, but and they even invited me to sit at their table over there. I was so privileged and and pleased to hear that. I I can sit with the elders now and hear their wisdom and all the wonderful things that they have to say. But yet, you know, in doing that, it's our job to prepare the younger people. &gt;&gt; And I'll say this, anybody can look over the at the younger people say, "They're not doing a good job." Anybody can criticize. &gt;&gt; Anybody can look down at people and say, "Well, the preachers just don't know how to do it no more. The people don't know how to do it no more. Why aren't we teaching them how to do it?" &gt;&gt; If they don't know how to do it, that's probably on us. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So, instead of criticizing them, let's challenge ourselves. What could I do to help them build the temple? What could I do to prepare a future generation for a future work? &gt;&gt; Come on. Good. &gt;&gt; So, and again, you say, "Well, the Lord's coming." Absolutely, he's coming. But our job is to prepare as if as if tomorrow was coming, right? Because otherwise, tomorrow will come and we'll be unprepared. &gt;&gt; Because if the Lord comes the in the next six m six months or whatever, that's wonderful. But let me be found in my post to duty preparing a generation because I don't know when he's coming but I know there'll be a bride ready to meet him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; So let's do what we can. If you say all I can do is is pray. Well pray then. All I can do is go to church. Go to church. Show what side you're on. &gt;&gt; Amen. So &gt;&gt; now Genesis 33:12 here, Esau and Jacob have been enemies. They've been enemies all their life and partially because of Jacob's malfeasants. Jacob was a shyster. &gt;&gt; He stole from Esau. He was always tricking him. And yet at this stage in their life, they both matured to the point where they want to make peace. And you remember the story how Jacob sent out a gift in front of him because he wasn't sure how Esau felt about the matter. And but Esau wanted to make peace. and they put that aside and become friends. You know, I think we ought to be able to at least become friends with our neighbors and &gt;&gt; people around us. Maybe not all of our neighbors, but &gt;&gt; but you know, those that will be peaceable. Paul said, "As much as is in you, live peaceibly with all men." &gt;&gt; And and so Jacob and Esau wanted to put those things aside and come together, but yet they still had a difference in their attitudes. Esau was a warrior. He was a hunter. He was somebody who' go went out and took what was his, &gt;&gt; right? Jacob wasn't that. Jacob was building something. He was raising something. And so with their different attitudes, they couldn't really journey together. They couldn't travel together because uh here Esau said, "Let us take our journey and let us go and I will go before thee." And he, that's Jacob, said to him, "My lord knoweth that the children are tender, right? and the flocks and herds with young are with me. And if men should overdrive them one day, I want you I I want us elders to listen. Wake up tonight and listen. &gt;&gt; I want us to listen. I want us parents, grandparents to listen. &gt;&gt; Because he said listen, he said he said, "My Lord knows the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die." &gt;&gt; All right. Preach that. Yes. He said, "Let my Lord, I pray, they pass over before his servant, and I will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me, and the children be able to endure &gt;&gt; until I come unto my Lord to fear." So, there's a lesson here that we can learn. Don't drive the church &gt;&gt; harder than the children can endure. &gt;&gt; Good, &gt;&gt; right? Just because you can do it don't mean you should do it. And I think as preachers sometimes we get so revelated, we get so far out. We've we drive the church to a place of revelation or or a place of obedience. And and I'm not saying those things shouldn't be preached, but we're driving the church to a place and you've left the little ones behind. &gt;&gt; And I know many times people say, "Brother Ben, why don't you preach this or that and why don't you deal with this in the church?" Well, there'll be a time to deal with it, but we can't drive the children farther than they're able to be driven, &gt;&gt; right? You've got to be willing like Jacob was to go slowly if you have to go slowly. Walk softly if you have to walk softly to be able to get them to the place because even if you make it, if you killed the flock, what good is it? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; But you had your say and you said what you wanted to say and you you made your point. But what good was it? &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm the dad. I can say what I want to. I'm the head of the house. Well, you might be able to say it. &gt;&gt; But if you drive the flock too hard, &gt;&gt; don't drive your home harder. &gt;&gt; Your wife and children can endure. &gt;&gt; The Brandom even dealt with that. He asked the Lord to allow him to stay in Jeffersonville until his wife's parents passed away. And because he wanted to make sure that his wife would be okay, &gt;&gt; and God allowed him to do that. &gt;&gt; We have to deal with them with wisdom. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, but we did it. We made it. We we we we put them on a forced march and they made it. But what if the children fell by the way?" &gt;&gt; Some of y'all know what I'm talking about. We did that for years. That's right. &gt;&gt; Around the message. We we Well, you're going to go to church and you're going to do this and you're going to do that and we're going to force the march. You're going to look right. But we didn't we we weren't listening to them. &gt;&gt; We weren't looking to what was going on around us. The kids were falling by the way. And oh, we were professing our love for the message and our love for the Lord, but we left the children behind. &gt;&gt; I said we need to bring them with us. So, we have to walk softly and endure some services. Oh, I'm revelated. I don't need the presence of God no more. I don't need a powerful move of God anymore. I don't need the Holy Ghost no more. Well, you might not, but what about the children? You need to be able to walk softly with the children and let them be able to have an experience with God. &gt;&gt; The children aren't just at youth camps. The children are right here in our services. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; We're not looking just at what's good for us. We're looking at what's good for the children and what's good for the flock. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You might come to a service. You might say, "Well, Brother Ben hasn't preached nothing that helped me for years." &gt;&gt; Well, I wonder how hard you've been praying, you know, but &gt;&gt; but you might say that you I don't ever get fed, &gt;&gt; but are you willing to put that aside for a moment? Say, Lord, let me if if if Brother Ben and Brother Joel or whoever's preaching, if they have to go softly so the children can understand it, let me be willing to put up with that, recognizing that God cares about the children, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, people say, "Well, I wouldn't sit through a youth service. I wouldn't want to have to deal with that." Well, you won't have to deal with them forever. &gt;&gt; You only got a small amount of time. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham dealt with a young boy in the prayer line. I just want you to listen to a prophet's heart. He said, 'How do you do, Laddy? My I like boys with haircuts like that. Brother Brandham, you're a prophet. Why are you noticing this boy's haircut? &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times kids in church, they feel like no, they don't have nobody notices them. If you say something about that, it'll make a difference to them. &gt;&gt; He said, "You love the Lord." You do. Well, Brother Brandon never dealt with adults like this. You watch how his tone of voice changes. How gently he deals with children in the prayer life. Yes, sir. Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I think you're a fine boy." And now, any boy that loves the Lord and loves his mother and father, I think that's a good boy. I think he can't go wrong doing that. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, what if Jesus was here tonight and you were standing before him as you as you are, Brother Brandham?" He said, "Now, Jesus would know just what was wrong with you. He'd come over and pick up his ch pick up children as he did, lay his hands on them, and bless them. You'd get well, wouldn't you? That's right. You'd get well. But of course, Jesus has went away and has sent back his gifts into the church. Is that right? Mighty young to have that, son. He's He's asking for a response from the young man. He said, "Mighty young to have that son. Have a coughing. Asthmatic like in the throat. Isn't that right? Asthmatic cough laying down many times. You have to raise it. Just cough you and hurts you so bad. That's a horrible thing. God bless you, little boy. You got a very tender spirit. &gt;&gt; That's your mother sitting right there, isn't it? You believe too. That's your little sister sitting right there also. She's got sinus trouble. Isn't that right, honey? Your mother also has hay fever. Isn't that right? She has dropsy also. He said, "God bless this little lad with his tears running down his cheeks. Let the mother stand. Little girl stand while the spirit of God is here tenderly. Put your hands over on mother, sister, and mother to the girl." And he prayed for him. He said, "May they all get well?" And he said, "Look, little lad. What's your name? See your asthmatic conditions gone. If all this dust on the floor and things like you'd be coughing your head off if you'd catch that you're healed now. God bless you. He said God and and may God be with you. &gt;&gt; Now why did brother Brandon take so much time with this particular person because he wasn't an adult. There are times and I almost feel bad for the people when brother Brandon will call someone through the prayer line and he'll say, "Do you believe if I just laid hands on you that God would heal you?" &gt;&gt; And didn't tell you anything. They say yes. He'd lay hands on them, pray a little short prayer and send them on down. almost felt bad for the people &gt;&gt; because they didn't have discernment. But brother Brandham could catch that they were mature enough to to accept that and believe that and receive their healing. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you got to spend time with the children. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We want to rush through our services and get everything done in a certain amount of time so we can go home, kick back in the easy chair. Believe Believe me, I'm 40 now. I do, too. I want nothing more than to than to be done with service on Sunday and go home and sit in my easy chair and have somebody bring me a sweet tea or unsweet tea as the case might be. And I want nothing more than that. But I'll tell you this, it's worth it maybe to give a little bit of time to the children. Let them have a little bit of time to worship God and serve God and learn what it's like to be in the presence of God. It's worth it to pray through and have church even if we don't feel like it. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. In moments when we don't even feel like it, maybe in an afternoon when it's tiring and everything, it's worth it to raise our hands and worship God because the children are watching. &gt;&gt; Good, buddy. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Again, at an altar call, brother Brand, I'm dealing with the young people and he says, "That's fine." He said, "Just keep raising your hand as you feel that Christ." He said, "God bless you, my brother. God bless you, little girl. That's fine. God bless you." The little colored girl is here with her hand up. "God bless you, honey. He said, 'You may think you were too young, about 12 years old. &gt;&gt; We got a whole gang, I guess you could say, of 12 year olds, 11, 12, 13 year olds. He said, "You might think you were too young." No, you're not. It's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Speaking to your little tender heart, honey. &gt;&gt; Just love him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come to him now by faith. Look how he deals with her. Come up believing and say, "Lord, be merciful to me a sinner." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will do it. Someone else while we're waiting just a few moments longer. He said, "Oh, many 15 or 20 has held up their hand. God bless you, young fellow." That's a wonderful start to make right now in the adolescent age. Again, in a baptism, I'm just giving you different examples, different scenarios where brother Brandham deals with young people. In a baptism, he said, "You a little scared to come out here, honey?" He's doing a baptism and a little girl comes up the line and with her mother and she's scared to come into the water because the water's cold. I've seen that. I've seen a little ones get into the water and just catch their breath like that. And that would be embarrassing to a parent. Now, just be honest. If your little one wanted to be baptized and they refused to go in the water, wouldn't that be embarrassing? Watch how Brother Brandham handles that. &gt;&gt; He said, "What do you think? Do you want to try it?" The mother says, "Well, it's just up to her. She'd been begging me and I tried to talk her out of it. He said, "You want to be baptized, honey? You want to, honey? Want to come with brother Brandham in the water?" &gt;&gt; "You afraid to come out?" He said, "You want to come, sweetheart?" "All right, sister. It may be a little bit scary to her. Hand that to her." And brother Brandham has him close the curtain. He just so gentlemanly with it. &gt;&gt; And he he said the little girl was standing here just now to be baptized. She wanted to be baptized, but she was afraid the water was too cold for her. And so her mother, well, she asked me what I thought. I said, "Maybe if she'd be scared. I wouldn't want to scare her." She was very small anyhow. But she talks about she wants to be baptized. So she thought she'd wait till the next baptism. Maybe the water be a little warmer. He said, "So that's mighty sweet." The mother, we pray God. He said, "Let's offer prayer for the little girl." He begins to pray. He said, "Lord Jesus, we thank you for that little thing. It should be a rebuke to older people &gt;&gt; to see that when that little heart is tender and young, she wants to come." But the random didn't blame her. Right. &gt;&gt; Now, if you get an older person that's coming, they ought to know they're going to have to get in the water. &gt;&gt; And it may be cold. Like, you'd think differently about that. But a young person, a child, he's it wasn't that that's the way she felt. She didn't want to come. It was too cold. But it was in her heart to come. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said here, when that little heart is tender and young, she wants to come. So, so Lord, shows that you can deal with a heart when it becomes humble and simple. May it be an example, Lord, that you can deal with people. I pray that you'll be with the little girl and help her. May she get older and stronger and bigger where she can be baptized in the name of your son. Another altar call. Brother Brandham, I hope I'm not boring you tonight. We're going to run through a few of these and we'll go on. Brother said, "God bless you way back there in the back. I see it like a family standing." He said, "God bless you, young fell." That's very fine. He said, "God bless you, little boy." Isn't that strange? He said, "These little boys up there not over 10, 12 years old." You say, "They don't." Oh, yes they do. suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not. Such is the kingdom. &gt;&gt; I want to see a revival among our youth. Let's get them let's get them attracted by the message of the hour while they're still young. I remember things that were preached when I was 10 or 12 years old. I remember what it was like to be in the house of God at that age. I remember feeling the presence of the Lord. They'll remember that when they're older. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Said their little hearts hasn't been pulled through too much stuff yet. &gt;&gt; Right. They're tender and they can easily receive Christ. The spirit knocks and all they know to do is say yes Lord. Oh that we could be tender like that tonight church that the spirit can knock in my heart and I can say yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said I love those little fellows that does that. &gt;&gt; Again he said there's here's a little girl standing here. Mother standing here holding two little girls. Little things come up weeping. I wonder if a child children don't sometimes condemn the adult &gt;&gt; from their tender little heart. &gt;&gt; They haven't pulled it through all kinds of disappointments of the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; There been a whole lot of people that didn't come to an altar because they've been disappointed. &gt;&gt; Maybe disappointed by a preacher disappointed by the altar. &gt;&gt; Disappointed because they maybe they didn't get. But you watch little children, they'll come again and again and again. Why? Because they haven't been hardened yet. &gt;&gt; They're still tender and sweet. He said, "I'm watching these two little girls hugged up." He said, "With against the lady, just like they was looking for something to happen." He said, "Sure, God speaks to his little children." You believe God speaks to you, you young people. You believe God speaks to you. Does he speak to you? Come on, church. Does he speak to young people? I believe he does. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; He said God speaks to little children. The Bible said, "Suffer little children and come to me. Forbid them not." He said, "I see a little mother here holding her baby, a sweet little baby holding in her arm. She's come here now to be reconciled to Christ. He said, "Blessed are you." &gt;&gt; He said, "A young man holding a young wife." I suppose he said, "Standing there holding her. She's weeping." He's got his head bowed in reverence. Do you know that's the works of the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon didn't just tell them, "Oh, you need to just leave and receive the word and come up to our level of understanding and then you won't do that stuff no more." But he let young people be young people and young parents be young parents. And people use an altar for what it was made to for. Oh God, &gt;&gt; good &gt;&gt; S. Oh, there's little browneyed girl looking at me about seven or eight years old. Little brown eyes and brown hair. I that little baby back here looked at me this morning and I just about cracked up cuz that's a miracle. &gt;&gt; And I know several of these young people are miracles. &gt;&gt; They're miracles. They got there's something about them just attracted to the word of the Lord and attracted to the the worship of God and they're miracles. And and I love to see that. at him and brother Brandon talks about her face she's expecting something she may be Spanish she said I see a lovely young woman just at the crossroads of life with her head bowed in reverence her arms folded he said I see others gray hairs their hair heads bowed down this is a sacred moment &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; again another another place he said I see you over here on my left some little children he said you know the scripture speaks of a little child leading them in Isaiah the 10th chapter their heart has not been pulled through so much of the world he said they're young and tender they love God loves him. He can talk to them. And so David said, "While Solomon is young and tender, let me do the things that need to be done. Let me prepare during this time. Let me prepare abundantly." &gt;&gt; Cuz I know there's something for these young people to do. &gt;&gt; Listen, he said, "Their heart's not been pulled through so much. They're young and tender. They love God. God loves them. He can talk to them. We've seen," he said, "We've seen so many disappointments and things. It's hard for our hearts and many times we pulled it through old True Story magazines. How many of you have ever read a true story magazine? I see two. I know she hasn't. A True Story magazine. You know, I had to look it up in the back. I'll be honest with you. I had never read a True Story magazine. So I looked up to see what it was and I just assumed it some kind of bad magazine. It was a magazine where people told stories and it basically was it was a kind of a pre-invention if I understood it correctly of social media and brother Brandon said people would read that and pull oh my pull their spirit through that and it hardened their heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was 1950s Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; People telling their story, telling stuff that they shouldn't be telling, you know, stuff that kind of risque and stuff like that. And pull through. &gt;&gt; You pull yourself through that. You can only watch so much of that till your heart gets hard. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you tonight. &gt;&gt; If I was Brother Windle, I'd say I'm preaching better than you're amening. Now, we don't have True Story magazine today, but we have a lot of other things. &gt;&gt; Our hearts get pulled through it. &gt;&gt; Good sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "We should have never been there." He said, "It's callous it." He said, "God will take every callous off you if you just let him make you tender." Oh, isn't that what you want today? Sweet, kindhearted. Amen. Loving, forgiving one another. If you'll just have faith, just believe. He said, I'm just waiting a moment. Again, he said somebody else, yes, little boy sitting here, sometimes them little hearts hasn't been pulled through so many disappointments and things of the world, they're tender. He said, you know, the Bible said in Isaiah 10, a child shall leave them. Why don't you raise your hand before we stop? He said, God bless the young girl. Raise your hand. I I I want I feel the bump. He said, God bless you, young lady. God be with you. That's a gallant thing to do. Don't fear. It's the greatest thing you've ever done, honey. Someday when death comes, you'll remember you did the right thing. You'll remember that before that time happens again. He said, "There's a little girl sitting here. Looks to be about 10 years old." He raised her hand a few moments ago. She wanted Jesus. About the age of my little Becky, I guess, at home. My little Rebecca. I noticed a little girl come up last night when she stood at the altar. No more than she'd stood there. She started speaking with tongues. Oh, no. Brother Brandon was not condemning her for it. &gt;&gt; Come on. I know there's church order. I know that. And I believe in church order. I believe we ought to have church order. &gt;&gt; I believe in everything brother Brandham said about that. But sometimes &gt;&gt; sometimes you got to let young people be young people &gt;&gt; and get overcome by the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes us older folks need to get in that condition too where we get so overcome by the presence of God until we can't talk no more until his presence is just right there with us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. He said some he said someone told me some of the brethren she was running around running all over the church and all the deacons said oh no what what brother Brandon what are you saying she was running all over the church speaking in tonesues and singing in tonesues and everything. How the Lord blessed that little child. &gt;&gt; Get her when her heart's young and tender. How many of you remember what that was like? &gt;&gt; I know it's been a long time ago and there's been a lot of True Story magazines, but do you remember? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. &gt;&gt; Can you remember what it was like to be so young and tender and you hear the gospel and it just break your heart up? &gt;&gt; And a preacher didn't have to preach real good. He just had to stand up there and read the word and preach a little bit and you'd just feel so convicted and tears would stream down your face and you'd stay there in worship or you'd be down on an altar and you'd maybe start talking in another language and and and and some of you you're almost ashamed now to admit you ever spoke in tongues. But I'll tell you what, God still moves in those things. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said someone told me she would run all over the church speaking in tong. But he said it's cuz she her heart was young and tender before she pulled it through old true story magazines and the filth of the world got her little heart all calloused. I like to see the little ones come. Brother Brandham talked about he was given an altar caller. He about about to give one and Sunday school let out. And the little children begin to come to the altar straight out of Sunday school. He said three little boys just walks right out real fast, tears in their eyes, kneels down by the side of the altar. Of course, they're forgiven. How you young people, listen to me. Listen to what brother Brandon was telling you. He said, "They was forgiven before they even left their seats." &gt;&gt; You come up here to the altar and you want prayer and you got to tell me, "Well, I didn't get anything." No. The fact that you came Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Listen to you were forgiven before you ever left your seat. &gt;&gt; When you Their little mind was made up, they just come forward and kneel down there to let the people know whose side they're on this morning. He said, "I think there would be some older people would like to do this." &gt;&gt; Just like to kneel down and say, "Lord, I've wandered far away from the We got any older people here tonight that would like to do that to have wandered far away from the path. I've had so much doubt and sometimes I wandered out and got in sin. I'd want to come back before it's too late. God, I'd like to come." &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh." He said, "I'd just really like to come and kneel down." He said, "Now, Arthur Beams, three little girls, there's a group of little boys, group of little girls about the same size. They come up here, kneel down, said, "It seems to be the children this morning. Little fellas coming out from Sister Arnold's little class, they come straight out of Sunday school, &gt;&gt; consecrating their lives." The whole altar to my right. He said, "It's full of little children." And brother Brandham says, "I guess I had need an altar call." And he he sings, "Lord, I'm coming home." He said, "For the older folks." No older folks came, but the young people did. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Bham said, "Heavenly Father, if there's a coming tomorrow, if Jesus should carry for another 10 or 15 years, these will be the boys and girls that will pack this message along to other generations to come. No doubt in my mind, Lord, but what all the days of their life they'll remember coming up to this altar." &gt;&gt; Yes. And &gt;&gt; their little jewels, Lord, their young and tender little hearts are convinced this morning, not even hearing all the message just come out of the room from hearing our sister Arnold speaking. You you Sunday school teachers don't know what you're doing back there. These young people were moved not by the sermon, not by brother Brandham's sermon, &gt;&gt; but by a Sunday school teacher. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That when they got in the presence of God in a place where there was an altar, they immediately come to the altar. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, let us be tender like that. Let us be young like that." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; In that way. Amen. He said, "They're little jewels, Lord. They're young and tender, not even hearing the message. Just come out of the room, move up around the altar, giving their little lives to thee. He said, "Now, Father, I've got through speaking that in us dwells the Holy Spirit. This holy faith with this spirit does all things." And I believe that this very hour. Oh my. He said, "You forgive every sin they've committed. I'm asking you with all faith that's in my heart. You will keep their little lives down through the road. May they never stray from the way." He said, "This truly is a strange thing." The spirit said this morning we'd see something strange. He said, "God, if you quit dealing with the others, take little children." &gt;&gt; Sometimes you preach, and I'm just being honest with you. And I know as we get older, I get harder to preach to as I get older. You just heard so much preaching. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We just heard so much and we just It's like, "Amuse me, pastor. make me feel good. I'm just opening my heart to you tonight. &gt;&gt; Make me cry. &gt;&gt; And yet the little children many times can be dealt with in a different way if their hearts haven't gotten hardened already. It seems like their hearts get hardened at a younger at a younger age. &gt;&gt; But you see children, God will deal with the little child or young people. Well, God will deal with young people in a way maybe that is hard because we we just we've heard so much. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But if we just take a minute and think about what we're hearing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Just pause a moment. Let that sink in. &gt;&gt; If you ever think about what God done for you, if you could if you could go back if you could go back and think about what God did for you. He said, "You're the virtuous, sinless bride of Jesus Christ." Pause for a moment. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Press pause on the tape player. &gt;&gt; Never heard anybody tell you to press pause. Did you &gt;&gt; press pause on the tape player? Think about that for a moment. &gt;&gt; He a vindicated prophet stood there and said, "You never did it in the first place." &gt;&gt; But we've heard it so much. It's just like brother Brandon talked about that that little child that had everything shook in front of him so much he just didn't move for nothing anymore. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Say, "God, help me to be tender to the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Help me to move." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "We in this morning, the altar call, there's not one adult, but the whole group of little children come up." Yet, it was a great message of hard understanding, even to adults, but the children caught the spirit of it. &gt;&gt; Listen, if you didn't understand what I was trying to say, I hope you can understand the spirit of it. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; If you couldn't catch the meaning, I hope you can catch the spirit. Good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we thank you for them. Father, I give them to you as your servant as the trophies of this meeting, remembering the ever presence of the water of life will flow with them as long as they live. He said, "May they have faith now in just what's happening that God pulled them from their seat and sent them up here. May they have faith in that God all the days of their life. May their little spirits be brought to you in the day of their death, brought back to their body in the day of the resurrection. They are yours, Father. We give them to you through Jesus name." Right? &gt;&gt; See, God deals with young people in a special way. Jesus did the same thing in Matthew chapter 18. I'll hurry to save time. It says, "At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? Who has the best ministry? Who do you think the what Jesus, what's your top 10 preachers?" &gt;&gt; And Jesus calls a little child &gt;&gt; unto him. and set him in the midst of them. So, in other words, here's the disciples in their little preacher group, you know, &gt;&gt; looking around. Peter says, "He gonna say me?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, John's over there said, "I'm the beloved." you know, &gt;&gt; little group of preachers, 12 preachers, and Jesus calls a little child and sets them right in the middle of them and said at the preacher table said, "Verily, I say unto you, except you be converted." Tell them they're not even saved yet. &gt;&gt; Become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, whose same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven, and who so shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But who so shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It were better for him that a millstone, look how drastic this is, were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. &gt;&gt; Right? Why? Because children have to be cared for. &gt;&gt; Right? Children are our responsibility. And if God's given us children in the church, we talked this morning about how many children God has given us here in the church. If God has given us children, we got a church full of children. We are responsible to those children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And we're not we can't just think about ourselves. We got to die to ourselves and let the seed of tomorrow be planted in the soil of our death to ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. Sometimes kids need help. &gt;&gt; Now, David realized that. I'm going to start preaching now. That was all just the foundation. &gt;&gt; We won't take much longer. Are you still with me tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes young people need help. &gt;&gt; That shouldn't be uh that shouldn't be news to any of us. &gt;&gt; Sometimes old people need help. &gt;&gt; Sometimes preachers need help, &gt;&gt; but some especially young people need help. And David understood that when it come to dealing with Solomon. Look at 1 Chronicles chapter 29 and verse one. Furthermore, David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon, my son, whom alone God hath chosen is yet young and tender, and the work is great. For the palace is not for man. He said, we're building something, but not for man, &gt;&gt; but for the Lord God. &gt;&gt; We're not building a house for a man. We're building a temple of the Holy Ghost. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now I have prepared with all my might." I wonder how many of us could say this, church. &gt;&gt; I've prepared with all my might. I've done everything I can do for my family. I've done everything I can do for my church. &gt;&gt; I've done everything I can do for the people in my area. &gt;&gt; Come on. I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God, the gold for things to be made of gold, the silver for things of silver, the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood, onyx stones and stones to be set, glistening stones of diverse colors, and all manners of precious stones, marble stones in abundance. &gt;&gt; Moreover, because I have set my affection, other words, because I love the house of my God, &gt;&gt; right? I have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which I have given to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house. So when he got done preparing he gave a little more. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; even 3,000 of gold of the gold of oper 7,000 talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses with all. Remember he would never walk down those hallways. He would never go into the holy of holies. Come on. &gt;&gt; But he he was able to give the gold &gt;&gt; that would be laid over the cedar. He said the gold for things of gold, the silver and for all manner the silver for things of silver for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing? Now I believe this is a challenge tonight. This a challenge to us as a church. He said, "I've done everything I can do. I believe the message of this hour did the job it was supposed to do. &gt;&gt; I believe God sent a prophet that didn't stop short. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that? God sent a prophet that didn't stop short. &gt;&gt; I believe God brought a message to us that was difficult and and he was cast out and rejected. But he did it so we could have material that we could build the house of God with. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He He made a way. He made a preparation. He said, "I must decrease that he might increase." He said, "Behold the lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world." He did that and God did that through him for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And after all that has been done. Oh church, then the cry goes out, "Who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord?" It's one thing to watch somebody else and to go by and see David. So, David's going to build a good temple for us. &gt;&gt; David's building a good temple for our children. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But who is willing? &gt;&gt; I take that as a challenge to myself, to my generation, &gt;&gt; to those who are now we say middle-aged. We got a kids coming up. Who is willing? to go above and beyond. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To do more than a previous generation. Come on, church. We got anybody willing today? Who is willing? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; To do what needs to be done, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; So the children can have church. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Who is willing &gt;&gt; to do what needs to be done so the presence of God can fill the temple and the post can can move at the noise of the sound of the worship of God? Who is willing to do what needs to be done? Who's willing to put in the work? Who's willing to pick up a shovel? Who's willing to be what God called them to be? Come on, church. Who's willing to be a real man, a real woman, a real mother, a real a real child, a real person that God wants you to be? &gt;&gt; Who is willing to consecrate his service? &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you don't do it, somebody will. &gt;&gt; Somebody will. &gt;&gt; But Lord, let it be me. &gt;&gt; Let it be me. who will give up their home for teenagers to sit up in the tall hours of the night. Oh, it got quiet. &gt;&gt; Those of us who have worked with young people, we've been there and done that. &gt;&gt; Who's willing to clean up after the mess they make? &gt;&gt; We're teaching our young girls, young boys to clean up. I appreciate that. I'm glad that they're doing it. But when they can't clean up after themselves or they don't, &gt;&gt; who's willing to do it? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Who's willing to not complain but to help? This actually a former pastor of mine brought this to my attention years ago and it stuck with me. In Proverbs 14:4, where no oxen are, the crib is clean. So if you want a clean crib, &gt;&gt; with none of that stuff that oxen produce, &gt;&gt; just don't have any children. Oxen, &gt;&gt; right? If you don't have any cows, you won't have any smell. &gt;&gt; But you also won't have any cows, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I love how simple the Bible is, right? It's just &gt;&gt; where no oxen are, the crib is clean. &gt;&gt; Listen, think about this. I'm going to paint utopia for some of us older people. Where no children are, no one runs into you at the food line. No one leaves their stuff all over the churchyard &gt;&gt; where no children are. &gt;&gt; No one No one makes us sit through long Sunday night services &gt;&gt; where no children are. There's no cleanup, &gt;&gt; right? We never get offended. &gt;&gt; Well, doesn't that sound good? You know, praise God. &gt;&gt; But, Brother JT, you and I have been in churches where there's no children. &gt;&gt; Where there are no children, there's no future. &gt;&gt; There's nothing to look forward to. &gt;&gt; Because no matter how dedicated you are, if there are no children, there's no way to to move forward. &gt;&gt; That's right. Where no oxen are, the crib is clean. But much increase &gt;&gt; is by the strength of the ox. Because there's coming a generation that's going to be able to carry things that you can't carry no more. You might have done it for years and years and years, but there's coming a generation of deacons and trustees and church members and and and pray prayer warriors and and preachers and singers and preachers wives and mothers. There's coming a generation of people who got strength in their body to do what needs to be done. So I say, "Let the crib be dirty." If it's got to be dirty, let the let the kids be kids. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I'm not saying don't correct them. I'm saying it's our job to correct them and invest in them &gt;&gt; if you don't have them. &gt;&gt; It's a scary thought. &gt;&gt; You see, we don't have very long with our children. Brother Caleb and I spent some time before church. I believe it was today, tonight, this morning talking about this subject. And I said, I'm g some of this was already in my notes. All was already in my notes. I've told you tonight, but we were standing back there and he brought it up to me how he want to do something for the kids. And I had this in my notes. Who will who will invest what they can do? &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb said it and I have it right here in my notes. You got a brief moment of time. don't have very long. &gt;&gt; A few of the ones we started with five years ago are already getting up in their teenage years. &gt;&gt; And they were the little ones &gt;&gt; where are we going to church? &gt;&gt; Look, in in in a blink of an eye, there'll be a youth group. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they'll grow up and they'll get married. &gt;&gt; How much time do we have? while they're young and tender. This is what David understood about Solomon. While he's young and tender, I'm going to prepare. &gt;&gt; I'm going to do what needs to be done. I'm going to work. It's a lot of work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to do it &gt;&gt; while he's young. &gt;&gt; Because that's not very long. Listen to Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter nine. He talks to the Corinthians. He said, "If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you. For the seal of mine apostilhip are ye in the Lord." What does that mean? It means that it means that Paul was we could say a hard object, right? He he had there was something about it. His character could cut an image &gt;&gt; in impressionable things. And the seal is made of wax which is impressionable. And Paul said, "My ministry in my life," if you go read the rest of the of the chapter, "My ministry in my life is to you. it. I I put a seal in you. &gt;&gt; But no matter how hard you press, if you press down against iron, it won't make an imprint. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But if you press down against clay, &gt;&gt; if you press down against wax, there will be a seal. He said, "And you are the evidence, the seal, &gt;&gt; that the the way I carried myself, the way I conducted myself, it it made a difference to you. &gt;&gt; It changed you." Oh, church. Yeah. Uh if you could just realize older folks and elders, if we could just realize how we carry ourselves, whether we come to church or not, whether we praise God or not, whether we whether we lift our voices in praise, whether we sing along with the songs, whether we You say, "Well, I don't feel like it, but it's about time we got past our feelings and said, "Lord, help me to help the next generation. Help me to build the the house of God. If I can't build it, let me make some nails &gt;&gt; for the generation that will." &gt;&gt; Very good. While they were young and tender, Paul made such an impression by the gospel. He said, "You're my seal, the seal of my apostilhip. I pray, oh God, let my character be such that it'll make an impression." &gt;&gt; Cuz there'll be an impression there. &gt;&gt; They'll carry an impression of what they experienced while they were young. Come on. &gt;&gt; Many of you &gt;&gt; carry the impression of times when you were in church &gt;&gt; and people did wrong. &gt;&gt; You carry the impression of times I mean from years ago. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe you were you were in church and people fought and fussed &gt;&gt; carried on in the name of religion in the name of the message &gt;&gt; fought with one another made an impression on you where you didn't want fellowship anymore. &gt;&gt; Right? Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't want our kids to be like that. &gt;&gt; I want them to be able to fellowship &gt;&gt; without borders and without boundaries. I want them to be able to love God. I don't want them to be afraid every time they hear a preacher that they're going to be deceived. But I want them to be able to receive the word and receive it in a tender heart. &gt;&gt; While they're tender and young, come on church, I'm I'm done preaching. But while they're tender and young, let's make an impression on our young people. Let's do what it takes to make an impression. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now is the time to press. Musicians as you come. Now is the time to press to do the work to make preparations cuz somebody that's younger is going to be the house of God. If the Lord carries, &gt;&gt; they're going to be the church. This building won't be the church. We don't want to get too tied to this building because this building is not the church. But the people are the church. And listen to me. Someday that this building will pass away. But if the Lord carries, there'll be a church. Come on. &gt;&gt; And the difference we make now, the preparation we make now will what whatever preparation we make is how glorious we believe the building will be. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; David said, "Because the building, my God's house, I want it to be great." &gt;&gt; I want it to be magnificent. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Because of that, my my son saw him and he's young. He's tender. So, I'll make preparation. I'll keep him in the house of God. While they're young and tender, I I'll make time for them. Shake their hand. Spend time with them. Do something for them. Help them out a little bit. Come on, church. I know we spend a lot of times we preach to the young people, but I'm preaching at the old people for the young people. I put myself in there with you old people. Oh God, may we make an impression on our children. May we not may we not go another generation where the children just drift out of church. &gt;&gt; And people watch them drift away and never never call out and say, "What? Can I give you a hand? &gt;&gt; Can I help you back in?" &gt;&gt; Can I show you the mercy of God? Can I show you the grace of God? Say, "God, help us today." I know there's several young people here today and a few of our elders and some are gone, some are missing. But I just for different reasons, but I if you're hearing it, if you're watching it today, now is the time to press. This is the time. If they're going to be the seal of what you've done, if they're going to be the seal of your ministry, of what you are, if they're if you're going to make an impression on them, now is the time to press down. &gt;&gt; Now's the time to take that seal that you've got, that token you have, and press and make an impression &gt;&gt; on our young people. God help me. We bow our heads together. [Music] Appreciate you bearing with I was very tired today and coming through strep this week and I I don't want to complain to you but it just we had such a wonderful meeting and the devil just attacked my body and just sometimes you get weak and tired and but God let me make an impression. [Music] Let me make a difference. Think you've heard many times, but that man who was getting stranded starfish on the edge of the ocean and he picked one up and threw it back and picked another one up and threw it back and someone come to him and said said, "What difference can you make? There's millions of those out here. Every time the waves come up, it washes another one up." He said, "It made a difference to that one. Maybe we can make a difference to those that are here. Make a difference to those that we have for just a moment. we hold in our hand like sand. We have influence on them like like holding a a fist full of sand if you're at the beach and it just slowly leaves and suddenly you don't have any anymore. You just have the residue. It's the way childhood is. It's the way being a young person is. It's just fleeting and it's over. Just a moment to make an impression. What do you want that impression to be? Oh, I tried to talk to them one time and they wouldn't listen. I needed help, but they were too busy. The only thing I remember about that person is they yelled at me. God, help us not to be that way. [Music] I love our church. I love how loving you are and how patient you are with our children, but we want to preach these things now so we hold a defense and a guard and we don't want to ever become hard and bitter and oh, we did things better in our day. Well, we may have, but let's teach our children to do things better than we did. God would help us today. Hallelujah. I believe his presence is here. If you need to talk to him for a minute, why don't you just do that while you're sitting in your seat? I know it's been a long day, but Lord Jesus, forgive me. I want to make an impression. Lord, I feel like my wife and I never fuss, but if we ever do, there's somebody overhears it. Oh, God. I don't want my children to take what [Music] your dad's all about work. You don't have time for me to tell him I got a problem. And if I did tell him, he'd blow up at me anyway. God help us, church. God help me. I I just want to talk to him and Lord forgive me. Help me. Help me to be a real father. Help me to be a real pastor. Would you make that your prayer? Whatever your your occupation is, your job is, your position is in your home. Help me to be a real mother, grandmother. Help me to be have an make an impression on my kids. Oh Lord Jesus, I love you tonight. God, I pray you'd forgive me. Lord, help me to be like Paul. I could say that the people that I preach to become the seal of of a of of my ministry. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. Not the sermons that I would preach or the amount of people that would come to church, but the lives of the people. I pray you grant it, God. Forgive me, Lord. Lord, if I if I've not taken the time that I should take where people become afraid and they say, "Well, I don't want to talk to him. He's scary. God, help me. I don't want to be like that." I pray, Lord, that you'd help us to be gentle with those we need to be gentle with. To speak the truth in love, not to drive the sheep so hard that we kill the young people. Pray you grant it, Lord. Help us, Lord. Help us to be gentle. Help us to be loving. Help us, Lord, when the time comes, Lord, if little Junior's going over the cliff and we need to we need to yell. But Lord, may we yell so infrequently that when we do raise our voice, it would make a difference cuz they knew it was serious. I pray you granted, Lord, thank you for all that you've done. Lord, we love you today. We thank you for your presence. Thank you for these testimonies. We've heard of your goodness to us. We love you and we thank you for it. Jesus name. make us better parents, better preachers, better pastors, whatever it is that we are. Pray you'd help us now in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, &gt;&gt; could you sing it now with all your heart? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All my words fall short. Oh yes, I've got nothing new. Oh, thank you, Lord. How could I express? &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; All my gratitude. Sing it now. &gt;&gt; I could sing this song. I'll thank you, Lord, as I ought to do. Every song must every song must sing. Oh, but you never do. Oh, let's stand and sing it now. Oh, so I'll throw up my hands and praise you again and again. &gt;&gt; Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I know it's not much, but I nothing else fit for a king &gt;&gt; except for a heart singing hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Lord. I've got one response. I've got just one move. Oh, can you stretch your arms out to him now with my arms stretched wide? &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I will worship you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh, so I'll throw up my hands. I'll praise you again. Hallelujah. Oh, all that I have is [Music] Oh, I see. And I know it's not much. I'm nothing else for him. Oh, except for a heart sing. Yeah. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Sing it now with all your hearts. Oh, so come on my soul. Oh, don't you dare shine on me. Lift up your song. Oh, you got a lion inside. So get up and praise. Oh glory. Oh, thank you Lord. Oh come on my soul. Oh, don't you get shout on me. Lift up your soul. Oh, you got a lion inside of those. Why don't you get up and praise the Lord? Everybody now. Oh, so I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Hallelujah. All that I have is a hallelujah. Oh, [Music] and I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else big for a king. Oh, except for our singing hallelujah. [Music] Oh, hallelujah. [Music] Let's give him a hand of praise tonight. You love him. Oh, we love you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Some of you didn't get to see, but I Uh, Sister Fritz came this morning and just really blessed me. I didn't notice it during church cuz I don't see so well when I take my glasses off, but Sister Fritz was sitting back there. And last week at the meeting, she was prayed for on Sunday morning. Brother Daryl Ward took the time to go by and lay his hands on her and pray for her. And when he prayed for her, she didn't ask him, but prayed for that she would be able to go without oxygen. And that's a burden to her to carry that around. If you notice this morning, Sister Fritz didn't have any oxygen. &gt;&gt; Now, I know she did that by faith. I know my our sisters, she just said, "Well, I've been prayed for." &gt;&gt; What if we all took that kind of attitude? &gt;&gt; I've been prayed for. &gt;&gt; We heard the testimony of Brother Harvey, Sister Vicky give a testimony of being able to walk in things and do things she weren't able to do before and different ones. Uh we we've had more than a dozen testimonies from our own church of God's healing power. He's still God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't we believe him like that? We believe in church today. And I know I've it's been a little heavy today. I've skinned you a little bit and especially us older folk. And you know, giving us things to think about, but these are things I've been thinking about. I &gt;&gt; I just God help us to take our responsibility seriously. &gt;&gt; I believe that you are. I believe that you do. And so I want to thank you for that. But you just, you know, be like our sister. I believe that'd be example to me and all of us. You know, if if I've been prayed for, God, God's my healer. I just walk away free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be okay. And some of you were prayed for and still holding on for your healing. You just hold on like that. And I just believe God's going to do it. Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. Let's let's bow our heads together. Dear heavenly father, we love you. Oh, how we thank you for what you've done. Lord, it was on my heart just to pray a prayer of thanksgiving for what you've done. What you've done for brother Harvey and what you've done for Sister Fritz and different ones, Sister Lana, Sister Willow. Lord, different ones that you've helped and healed. God, that they put their testimonies. Lord, we thank you. Well, this testimony we gave during the meeting of the baby that was born when the doctor said there was no way. But Lord, you are our way. Said when there was no way, you'd make a way for us. You've done it. We thank you for that, Lord. Lord, I know that you've done that for this church as a group, as a body. I pray you continue to do it, Lord. Those that are with us tonight visiting, I pray you bless them as well. Bless their church, Lord. May you bring revival among us, oh God. Lord, be so real. Brother Brandon said revival was when you a mother would wash dishes at the sink and she'd just start crying and just start worshiping the Lord not just in church but every day. Oh, I pray that would be so in our area Lord a spirit of revival and cooperation, oh God, and strength. Pray you'd grant it. We thank you for what you've done. We give you praise in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you tonight, Brother Joel, as you'd come. Hallelujah. Amen. and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
