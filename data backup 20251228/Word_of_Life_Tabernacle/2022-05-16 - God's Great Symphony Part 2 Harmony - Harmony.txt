we be good ground to receive the word lord and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor for it in jesus name amen amen good to have you back this afternoon matthew chapter 18 and verse 19. matthew 18 and 19. i'd like to continue on our thought of god's great symphony and tonight we're going to talk about harmony harmony and i trust it'll be a blessing to you while you're turning there matthew 18 19. there's some services coming up at the end of the month uh in the area and i wanted to remind you of that i haven't i've forgotten to mention it but brother ivy has meetings always on memorial day weekend we're going to try to go over there we'll be back for sunday but we'll be trying to be in those services brother craig bower will be there and also some missionary brothers they've kind of turned that into a missionary type meeting so i'm sure they'd appreciate it if any of you can make it over and then a little closer but brother danny steeman i believe june 3rd through 5th will be at brother jason jackson's and brother danny's a good preacher and i'm sure it'd be a blessing to them for some of us to go and and also be a blessing to you here and brother danny and so you're welcome to do that as well and i just wanted to remind you of those things then towards the end of the month brother andrew glover is going to stop by and see us and i'll let you know about that during a week and then brother john baduca will be here as well after memorial day with us like he was last year so looking forward to those things isn't god good to us matthew chapter 18 and verse 19 again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven if two of you shall agree on earth amen i believe that's the word of god amen amen you may be seated i think it's an understatement to say that people don't always get along mark twain once said he said i built a cage and in it i put a dog and a cat after a little training i got the dog and the cat to the point that lived peaceably together then i introduced a pig a goat a kangaroo some birds and a monkey after a few adjustments they learned to live in harmony together good thing it wasn't that anything in there wanted to eat the other one but he said they learned to live in harmony he said i was so encouraged by that that i i added an irish catholic a presbyterian a jew a muslim and a buddhist from china along with a baptist missionary i captured on the same trip he said in a very short time there wasn't a single living thing in that cage and we're as christians we're called to live peaceably with all men aren't we the bible says as we look at god's great symphony you know music's not written randomly but there's laws to it and those laws have not been invented they've been discovered right there's already a law of what sounds pleasant to the ear and they can take that break it down into mathematics and and break it down into into laws and and then uh so music is very mathematical and as i understand i don't understand the music theory as a whole but just a very little that i do understand it's very mathematical and so there those laws are discovered to be there they're already there like the law of gravity or something like that and when those laws are broken you know what you get you get heavy metal music music that don't sound good and actually it's very true that rock and roll music actually breaks the some of those laws what chords should come next and things like that and then when it becomes extreme like that it actually sounds bad and then bad is good and so it kind of turns around on itself but good to some people anyway not to me but one of the laws of music is called harmony harmony harmony is a combination of simultaneously sounded musical notes to produce chords and chord progressions that have a pleasing effect harmony is actually what injects melody with emotion and and what that means is if you just played the melody to a song if uh if you're a piano player it would be the right hand and left hand and if you just uh and just play the melody there's little emotion to it but if you play the harmony with it it produces a feeling gives you a feeling and so and it actually adds what's called undertones or things in the music that can't be heard in the notes separately it actually produces a sound beyond just the noise made by the two notes but together the two notes will actually produce more music than they do by themselves each of them themselves does that make sense so you're not just adding two and that's a scriptural principle as well you know one will put a hundred to flight to a thousand or whatever that is it doesn't go up by it doesn't double it goes up by tenfold right and so we find that music together actually produces a sound that you can't get unless you have the two notes together without harmony you have a bunch of notes which are pleasing in themselves but when you put them together say in the wrong way they're discordant that's that's a word that's used in the music discordant discord we would say it harmony discord are also used to fellowship and i'm going to use them in that way tonight as well but but they sound terrible uh discordant in in gospel music we have something called four-part harmony it's actually a classical music thing in the classical world it's a four-part harmony was played on four different instruments or perhaps with four different voices and was written uh with uh with a tenor and an alto and a soprano and a bass uh voice and in gospel music they've taken that and they've got the tenor and the baritone and the bass and the lead singer and those four notes they're all singing the same song they're all using the same music but they're actually singing different parts to that music and i'm going somewhere tonight so just hang with me okay now they're they're pleasing in themselves but when they're played in a discordant way they sound awful and that's why you play certain notes together to make a chord and there's seven notes within a chord you play one of those notes to get those notes together or in some relation to one another and they sound good i there was a group called the cathedrals years ago that did a song called heaven's parade and they showed what it would sound like they would sing each part by itself separately some of you may remember that and it sounded not very good when each one would sing it separately but you put it all together it sounds pretty good and it but it's different you would never sing that way singing solo right because there it's meant to be together and so and i mentioned this this morning but pleasant music pleases our neurons it actually actually triggers something in the brain that sweet sounds carry more information than harsh ones and since the time of the ancient greeks people have known that two tones whose frequencies were related by simple ratio and i'm maybe getting a little bit too deep for myself here tonight but just hang with me as i said that if you get two sounds that are in a two-one ratio or a three-two which is a perfect fifth so if they're in the same octave or in the same or related to one another by fifths in the music that they produce the most pleasing or consonant musical intervals and that effect doesn't depend on musical training in other words you hear that you don't know that necessarily but you hear it right and people that play by ear like sister carla or many of our musicians mostly play by ear they're not reading notes but they can hear when it sounds wrong and anticipate what the next one would be because they're playing the chord and they can hear the difference now so it doesn't depend on musical training even infants have been shown that they know the difference in music when it's played wrong or when it's sung wrong or in other words when the chord doesn't follow correctly or the notes aren't together and monkeys can even hear the difference it's just it's just the way it is it's a law of music and so and again i'm i'm i'm relaying a background for something and i won't hold you too long tonight but if you'll show that next slide i think i put yeah i put the circle of fifths is what this is called and so you can see that the keys are in relation to one another so if you played in c you'd be in c f and g it's right together right it works together to make up the chord and and then you can set a mood by what music is played you know god doesn't want everything to be the same yeah right and so when you look at music music can go make you feel happier can make you feel sad the major keys make you feel happy the sun's coming up the minor keys make you feel sad the sun's going down right but sometimes there's a purpose for that many of the psalms if you go back and play them in a minor key you can kind of get the feeling or the emotion that david was going through right and so there's a there's there's a relation there and if you put those together in a proper way and a good musician it's just somebody who has the feeling or the or the ability to put those things together in a proper way and in a way that maybe they think outside the box and but it's still related together it's within that law but to be discordant is to actually break that law so that next slide is a harmony line just so that you can see it if you know how to read a line of music that the uh that the notes you see the single notes whenever you have more than one note stacked on top of each other that's harmony right and so that's what we are as a church right that don't make any sense to anybody does it right you alone you're you're down here you're you're playing one note as a church you're playing at the same time right but you don't necessarily play the same thing as you would when you were playing one note but when together you're you're listening for the other person you're you're hearing the other part and and together it sounds good but if it's discordant it sounds harsh and jarring now we know as we said this morning that the word is the music the sheet music is that right yeah and the holy spirit is the conductor and we are playing the parts yes right but our part by itself would be okay it would it'd sound good if we all sing solo by ourselves but if we all sing solo together it don't sound good now i'm not talking about music music and singing tonight as much as i am about the way we live our lives and the way we treat one another and the way that we relate to the word of god right because really you want to harmonize more than even what you want to harmonize with one another but you've got to harmonize with god who is the word you've got to stay in harmony with him and with the way that with the with the music as it's written so we're playing a part and and the sound the full sound that the composer of the music called for comes through harmony because now let's go back to matthew 18 19 if you can go back to that esther my my scripture the text that i read it says again i say unto you if two of you shall agree shall agree notice that word that word is symphony symphony agree it's symphony to be of one mind to agree together to play together right to be an orchestra if two of you will be an orchestra if two of you in other words will play in harmony right where you can't all be first filing or second violin you can't all be you can't all play the same note but if two of you shall agree and the one that every note is important i've always thought about the man with the symbols you know he stands there and maybe he's not used all through the whole the whole musical play or whatever that it is but at the very end of it he'll maybe use one time and that's it right he just kind of collapses his symbols together and that's it but he but he's needful he's necessary there was a famous there's a famous piece that was written and i can't remember the name of it but it actually uses real cannons and it don't hardly sound the same unless you use real cannons and so every once in a while they'll get real cannons and play this piece you can find it on youtube where they actually have they play the music and during the music at one point because he's the musical the story is telling us of a war right and so during that war there's cannon fire and it actually fits in with the music but they wait during and they only play one time the the cannons go off and that's all but it's part of it and so you may just be the cannon fire that goes off once in a while but you're part of the music right now so that symphony is is to agree shall agree be in complete accord like the notes of a perfect strain of music and so one man's infirmity is upheld by another's strength one man's short-sightedness is compensated by another's wider view one man's little faith overpowered by another man's firm confidence we were meant to play if i could put it that way or or sing or or live or manifest the word together not not just separately does that make sense now in the scripture again the two of you shall agree it's the word is literally symphonized or harmonized it's a metaphor taken from a number of musical instruments set to the same key playing the same tune it means a perfect agreement of the hearts desires wishes and voices two or more persons praying to god it intimates that as a number of musical instruments skillfully played in a good concert or pleasing to the ears of men so a number of people united together in prayer if two of you will agree on one thing yes you realize the power of that that's pleasing to god he said if two of you will symphonize well harmonize that will be pleasing in the ears of the lord but in order to harmonize many times you must learn to listen and to the other voice and especially if you do it by ear you've got to learn to listen so that you can sing that's the biggest part the biggest reason why we have disagreements is people don't listen now think about it they're not listening and so you're trying to sing your part and and he's trying to sing his part and both of you together are seeing something that may be good may be true but it doesn't fit together and when you come together whether it's in a marriage or whether it's in a church you you have to listen to the other part and sing a part that would be complimentary to that not overriding it right not singing a solo god's not asking you to be the same but sometimes you've got to listen to the other voice and let it be dominant when the music calls for it right let it because there's always a dominant voice he's not asking us to be the same but to complement one another brother brown said i believe that god is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains and little mountains he complains he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it he made the season summer winter spring and autumn he made the season it shows he's a god of variety he made you in a variety some men are real blusterous some are real dogmatic i'm not in this smaller crowd i'm not going to get into who's who this tonight others are fine others are kind fine you know they're just real uh real gentlemen others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom it's different instruments right to be played at different times in different ways but sometimes he wants two or three to be played together right and in that moment when it's not your solo that's the time when you've got to learn to play with other people right well it's me and my family i'll do what's best for my family that's not the way a church is run right you got to learn to listen to what's going on and and and bow yourself to that and when it comes to the bigger picture to the word we've got to learn to do that right to play we know we don't play solo even other churches and i you know i'm not complaining but just me myself i think lord help me to be a compliment to another church if there's another message church that preaches the same i don't want to clash against them all the time let me be a compliment right where we can play the harmony part let's play the harmony part where we can play the solo part it's our meeting it's our time let's do that right but we want to be a compliment when you go to another meeting or you go to another church we're fixing to take a trip if the lord wills it overseas and if he allows us to go and when you go you want to be a compliment you go and find out what's going on and you compliment that you don't you don't go in and just and just tear it apart most of the time you're there not to sing a solo but to be a compliment now look he's got different things because he wants different things he made men and women differently genesis 2 18 and the lord god said it's not good the man should be alone i'll make him a help meet for him help meet for him so it's like adam is out there he's singing league and god listened to that he said there's something wrong with the song it needs a harmony part right he's singing a good lead he's walking out there singing oh you know whatever it is that's a bad song in it but he could he could sing lead but god said it needed a harmony part and so god created that you know ladies usually do pretty good on the harmony part on a psalm many times and many ladies sing a great lead part as well but i've noticed that it seems more natural for women to be able to sing a harmony apart and and i think women were created for that reason they they're singing the harmony part in the marriage right when the marriage is right and so genesis 2 and 20 says adam gave names to all the cattle and the fowl of the air and every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a help meet for him that help meet is his counterpart it's a hebrew word means counterpart a help suitable to him a wife but this is not limited to husbands and wives i want to look at it in perspective of the church because then the hebrew name eliezer if you ever heard of the name eliezer i'm trying to get you to respond tonight i know that you're dead tired we'll rush through it but the name eliezer is derived from the hebrews the reason why i give these young men these afternoon services a lot of times but you know his counterpart and and eliezer was a counterpart and his name literally means god is help moses named his son that and then you find abraham's servant name that eliezer it's god is help it's not just that eve was a help meet for adam but god had an attribute that wasn't displayed fully in adam alone even though he had eve in him you understand but in that format god see sometimes god has to break you before he can remake you what he wants you to be that's a there's a great truth in that huh and so he had to do surgery on that and he had to separate him and able to make him what he wanted him to be so he separates adam eve from adam and in separating her she become the harmony part she become the complementary part that's to help meet for him but now it's not just that but that was an attribute of god so it's not just it's not that he's an attribute of god and she's a second thought right that well we'll just have to do this because it didn't work the first time but she was also an attribute of god and it was an attribute of help and it's a gift in the church do you know that to be a help first corinthians 12 28 god has sent some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles and gifts of healing oh it sounds good doesn't it wouldn't you want to be a prophet or a teacher or a miracle worker or had a gift of healing helps helps governments whether it helps in governments healths and governments are people who assist the prophets and the pastors and the evangelists and the teachers right and assist the church assist one another helps governments diversities of tongues the greek word is it refers to assisting people in need but it also has the idea of calling on god in a time of turmoil so that he can act in the situation with his full power and force some people are given a gift of help they call on god a gift to pray a gift to help the church in that way a gift to show up at church some people have a knack for that a gift for that a gift to be there a gift to be a help to the pastor a gift to be a help to the musicians maybe they're not a musician but they're a help maybe they're not a pastor but they're a help maybe they're not an evangelist but they're a help to an evangelist right it's a gift it's an attribute of god which is what the gifts are you remember the gifts are off of the great diamond the great diamonds there and when every when the light strikes in a certain way and it spreads the prism brother random calls it that's the gifts that come off those light rays that come off of the great diamond then what what is it the help is one of those attributes one of those light rays first corinthians 12 29 are all apostles are all prophets they're all teachers or all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing they all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts he said and yet i show unto you a more excellent way than coveting the best gifts right he's not saying there won't be any more gifts but i'm going to show you a more excellent way than coveting the best gifts he said though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity or love and become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol though i have the gift of prophecy understand all mysteries and all knowledge i have all faith so that i could so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing notice what he types it to he says though i have not though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and i don't have charity i'm discordant right i'm a sounding brass i'm a tinkling symbol i'm out of order right without love i'm out of order oh god help us to realize that today if i preach without love i'm out of order if i if i prophesy without love i'm out of order if the things the things that i do if i do it without love i'm out of order i'm discordant i become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol without divine love the gifts or even the gifts of god are discordant the brandon's asked a question and questions and answers can you have the holy ghost without the signs following immediately i'm paraphrasing that but that's basically what they're saying the ram said now the holy spirit appoints these offices but when you try to force yourself into it he said if i had to eat cherry pie what if cherry pie made you vomit i hope you didn't have cherry pie today he said you're hurt you're hurting yourself that's the way you try to do when you try to force yourself to do something that's contrary to the spirit so he's answering this question he's saying that and brother branham deals with it as if he says it's in the group right wherever there's a group of god's people you'll find these gifts but it's in the group not on any one individual so one individual may not be the pastor or the evangelist or the prophet or the teacher or the helps right but it's in the group and the signs follow the group but the brahman said the signs follow them that believe right the signs follow the group not necessarily the individual although they will but but it's the group it's individuals that make up a group one might have a sign follow him of of healing another one casting out devils another one of speaking in tongues but it's all in the group you understand let me understand that tonight i'm gonna have you start standing up in a minute so but brother brown said if you try to force it you're hurting yourself and he said so can you imagine now think about it for a minute as i said adam had that great voice but he was singing solo and so god said it's it's lacking something and maybe even the soloist would have to in order to sing a harmony part would have to alter his voice because out of him was taking something and then it would made eve and so he even altered his voice and she altered hers so that it would fit together just like when you get married and you alter your ways and she alters hers and it fits together it becomes something entirely new right and so can you imagine how that sounded to god he said this is it it's perfect we know he thought it was perfect because he said it's very good right he's very good and then he he strives to recreate that all through time until finally he does with christ and his bride back in the garden of eden again that's his threefold purpose the third fold of his threefold purpose is to go back to that condition that was pleasing to god right now what about look at look at that they were in perfect harmony what about when this bride on the earth was in an upper room and the bible says when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place amen they were with one accord in one place and that harmony began to exist again can you imagine how he must have felt when he heard that when he saw that i'm typing it so that you'll understand it's as if they were singing it was beautiful like a choir oh i believe that same thing brother branham taught us this harmony exists again at the end time that the great symphony all comes together at the end he said this he said notice what harmony jesus never did anything until scene of the father or the father showed him first harmony between god and christ he said so will the bride amen and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it don't you want to be somebody like that tonight she never doubts that nothing can harm her not even death or if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again he said amen then i got a great big hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ amen to know what he wants done with the word remember the word is the sheet music the word is in the bride she plays by ear hallelujah because she's got the the word in her it's not just on paper anymore but it's become flesh and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord what is it she's a help suitable to him she is his harmony part so now he hears on the earth again a people at the end time that can sing a complimentary part to the word thank the lord right amen now when brother branham was out west you remember the tape boys leo and jean had started a church and the random said this about that church he said but what a greater thing talks about making tapes he said what a greater thing god has did for them to make tapes he said most anybody can make a tape that's got the intelligence to turn on a tape recorder or can sell but it takes guidance of the holy spirit to guide a little group together like this this morning and keep them together in harmony and unity and still clinging to the message now that experiment that they had there failed it wasn't based on with good leadership they didn't stay with that leadership but we've seen that replicated all over the world in message churches that where people that where it was replicated god would provide a gift that would keep them together in harmony and unity and brother branham said it was took a greater gift to be able to do that it takes guidance of the holy spirit than just to make it take now again brother branham said this about the church being together he said notice if every person in here was in perfect harmony perfectly harmony with the holy spirit every one of you was filled with the holy ghost and in harmony with the holy ghost these signs would be just multiplying among you all the time it'd just be constantly going yeah but where there's confusion where there's difference and where we set up in other words we say this one this is what he's gifted to do but wait yeah right he said let let the preacher wait on his his ministry right let the let the uh prophesy wait on his prophet saying what's he saying let's see what god does and then let the officers be filled by those who can do it does that make sense but when there's confusion where there's difference where we set it up the holy spirit can't move itself you see it can't operate through the people that's what he wants to do isn't it yes again he said now the whole church would work in harmony like that then among us we'd be casting out devils taking up serpents drinking deadly things all kinds of things going on but when you try to force that to individuals he said you get yourself that's pentecostal again you get babylon confusion you can't judge that right because you forced it on individuals now how do we have this harmony today notice are you still with me tonight i'll just be a few more minutes when the music changes god in in morphe as brother brown said he changes his mask you've heard him preaching in the unveiling of god and mighty god unveiled before us notice the musicians at that point change what they're playing right god is changing his mask the director is changing his actions the conductor is changing what he's doing and so the musicians change with the conductor right if you had the musicians going on and replaying the same set of music you'd have a problem but when the conductor changes you ever seen them up there that have a bit of cheat music and they'll flip the page guess what happens everybody else flips the page right because they're moving on to the next act the next movement oh god and the bible says that we all with open face beholding is in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory from one movement to another even as by the spirit of the lord but the brown said the same one that come down on the day of pentecost it's the same holy ghost that's manifested today from glory to glory to glory and it's back to its original seed oh that's powerful with the baptism of the holy ghost with the same signs same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation i'm going to fight for that i don't know about you but i'm going to fight for a church that has that same glory in it because that's the glory that it changed to on the day of pentecost right he said it's from glory to glory and the next will be changed from this glory the next will be now notice the next change in this glory we have prophets and apostles and evangelists and pastors and teachers in this glory we have uh we have the gifts of the spirit this is his mask god in his church you understand that's this glory that's what we have it don't change until the conductor changes it the church doesn't change its form until the conductor changes his mask but we had a prophet to come tell us to reveal him in the son of man ministry again so that we we could see he's fixing to change his mask but he said the next thing the next will be the next glory is change from this glory into a body amen aren't you looking forward to that day that'll be a body that never gets tired never sweats never never gets hot amen glory like unto his glorious body he said with the same now he said it's changed from his glory no body like his own glorious body where we shall see him he said abraham saw the same he said notice we see how it was changed since calvary we are invited to share his glory that's the glory we're in now by the way till these bodies are changed since calvary we're invited to share this glory his glory now in first corinthians 12 we're baptized into his body by one spirit we're all baptized not by one water one spirit we're all baptized that's right he said and then we become part of him but it's just like a great symphony that's playing out or acting out a drama he said i don't know too much about symphonies or drama but i was watching this play talking about carmen and my daughter and then was in it they were playing in this symphony and carmen that was acting out the music was acting out the same thing he said that's the way it is when you're baptized by the holy spirit into christ you're acting out the same thing as god changes his mask so do you yes sir oh god so that's the glory that we're in is the glory of god in his church now he said that's the way it is when you're baptized by the holy spirit into christ he said now see many of you has read or heard the story of the great russian composer composed peter and the wolf how that they act that out on symbols and everything anyone who knows the story that's reading off a paper can hear that symphony how it's acting that out the drama playing it out why they know every change they can look at it here and see the change he said but now what happens if the composer writes something we find out that it isn't just acted out right we find out then that there's something that happens there's something lacking right the harmonies aren't coming together why because somebody didn't play their part or the conductor got out of the spirit of the composer he said there's something lacking when we see them he who composed it has made it up and wrote it out and then the symphony is of playing it he said it's a wrong note he said there's something wrong the director gave the wrong motion see he said and that's what's the matter today my lutheran brother and my baptist brother my pentecostal brother and all my brethren from all different denominations that's what it is you're trying to give a note that hit back in the days of luther wesley like that when the actual the sheep music here shows that it's another day we can't live in the light of luther he was a reformer we appreciate his part but we played that out we're way over here at the back of the book now see we can't play it out like that he said now the only way that you're ever going to be able to do it my brethren is this are you listening he said and brethren of the world the different parts of the world i might say there's only one way for the director to do when your life gets discordant when your family life gets discordant when the church life gets discorded there's only one way if you're responsible for something whether it's your life or for your family or for a church there's only one way for the director to do he has to get in the same spirit that the composer was in then he's got it and when the church the symphony itself or the world is watching for these signs and wonders when the church and the composer and the director all get in the spirit of the composer then when they say the days of miracles is passed it don't hit the right note he said but when it gets in the right swing of it and the right spirit of it how are you going to do it until the spirit comes down with the composer and when you say the days of miracles never pass the symphony cries out amen now you're the symphony when we hit and say jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the symphony cries out you understand the symphony is in harmony hallelujah the whole symphony is right in harmony with the word brother brown said there's no more guesswork you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you the symphony cries out i got it amen there's no more guesswork about it then the whole symphony is right in harmony with the word he said it's going clap his hands together probably in better time than that he said that's it oh it's a magnificent thing the director and the composer must be in the same spirit and so must the musicians be in the same spirit to act it all out and the world is wondering what's going on he said let's get back and get the symphony playing right where they of the world can see amen where they of the world can see where the people at school know and the people at church now and the people in the community know this person is in the spirit of the composers oh god they can tell they know i was so proud of esther the other night when her friends came and and peter some of peters weren't able to come but but her friends came to the her birthday party from school just girls from school they're not necessarily someone go to church some don't and they come from school and and i ask them i said what's esther like at school and they said oh she never gets in trouble embarrass esther she never gets in trouble saying man well it's taken a lot of years to get to that point but esther's always been a pretty good girl but you know you have to work with your kids and but it never gets in trouble and they said but this this this helped me more that one girl told me she said she's the best friend i've ever had but you know what the holy ghost can make you a good friend when you're in the spirit of the composer it makes you a good friend makes you a good husband makes you a good wife well you're in the good spirit of the composer makes you a good deacon makes you a good pastor are you with me now you're in the spirit of the composer you may not have all the abilities in yourself but you're in the spirit of the composer and i'd much rather have a musician who's in tune and then with the spirit who can play with the other instruments than one who gets everything right you understand the one who can get in tune with what's going on is more valuable than one who's technically correct in everything and that's the way it is we could we could know all the word we could be able to quote it frontwards and backwards but are you in the spirit of it can you work with other people on it are you a good friend are you a good are you a good christian amen brother branham said let the directors get in the right spirit with the musicians and with the composer everything will be all right do you believe that tonight closing in just a moment he said there were no guesswork about it he said we are identified with him then what part are we acting out today where are we at what's the what's the music show we could read revelation 10 1 where we see a mighty angel come down from heaven cold with the cloud and rainbow was on his head his feet was as it were the sun his feet as pillars of fire we read that and we begin to look at it that's already been played right that part's already been played yeah so where am i at revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished and see if declared to his servants the prophets that's good that's a good part aren't you glad for that part that's already been played right brother branham taught us that in in uh in the sermon is this a sign of the end sir and then he he comes back around when he comes back around preach what is the attraction on the mountain he said what was prophecy is history he said three years ago these things were prophecy now they're history so now these things revelation 10 1 revelation 10 7 already fulfilled but look at the next verse and the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me again the conductor are you with me now speaking to me again said go take the little book which is open it's open it's an open book aren't you glad for that today take the little book which is open and we're in the hand of the angel which stands upon the sea and upon the earth and i went up to the angel and said to him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten my belly was bitter why he was in harmony with what the angel said he was in harmony with the word and he said unto me thou must prophesy again what is yet to take place in your life you've got to keep speaking you're this is the part we're playing now the bride being the final voice to the final age and when you do that in harmony with the word the father looks down he said it's pleasing yes amen you see that revelation 10 1 revelation 10 7 that was the opening of the word but revelation 10 8-9 and great through 11 is the opening of the word in flesh you understand that tonight that's where we're at the word has been opened now he wants you to be opened yes he wants you to be a living epistle red of all men that's what the composer wrote for this hour i say lord help me to live it help me to be it that's your desire as we close tonight help me to be musicians go ahead and come let me feel let me play my part in the music it may be just the symbols it may be just to clap my instrument of 10 strings but let me play my part in the music let me please god let my s let my marriage let my church let my family let the people around me may they see that it pleases god you remember enoch was walking with god and he and he saw the harmony part that he played was so pleasing to god until one day god said that sounds good i think i'm going to bring you up here with me i think you're ready for promotion you've learned your harmony part so well you subordinated yourself to the word there was a day you didn't walk with god but today now you walked with god until the harmony part just comes so well and now you you you're so pleasing to god it has said he we walked with god and he was not because before his translation he had this testimony it pleased god he pleased god his walk please god how not because he was perfect but because he was that complimentary part the bride type are you with me now that's what you are you're the complimentary part and he's fixing to call you up home aren't you glad for that let's bow our heads together heavenly father we're so thankful to be that complimentary part today we're not called to be the soloist that's not what you called us to do but you call the sword to be a complimentary part we're not a prophet but we can compliment a prophet we may not be a preacher may not be an evangelist may not be a may not have a great ministry but we can compliment those who do lord we can be a ministry of helps a ministry lord that helps one another a minister that prays one for the other help us to be that lord help us to sing in that right note not to get too far off of the scale not to get too far away from the note that's being played that's me that was written for this hour oh god that was not to be a discordant note i pray that you'd reveal that to us when we are lord if we're the discordant note in our family lord may we get back together with the music if we're the discordant node in in the church may we get back together with the music lord may you just reveal that to us lord as a musician would hear it it just don't sound right may we be so in tune with the composer that we know that it's not our job to to be the the main note but lord it's your job but we're the harmony part may we work with that lord and we learn to live like that or to humble ourselves because the way up is down until we become so pleasing in the eyes of god in your eyes lord that you just call us home with you i pray you'd grant it now move lord in every heart in every situation lord i pray that you speak i appreciate these people that come on a sunday afternoon lord when they didn't have to it was stormy outside but lord just just us that are here

complimentary part and listen for the voices of others lord to be a complimentary part in the kingdom of god i pray you'd grant it lord you you woke me up at three o'clock in the morning lord with
