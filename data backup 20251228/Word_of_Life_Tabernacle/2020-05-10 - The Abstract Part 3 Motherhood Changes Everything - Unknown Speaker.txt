verses 14 and 15 it's so good to see so many of you this morning and but a Steve good that you drop by this morning thank you for doing that and all of you that are here some of you haven't made it yet since since we've opened the church up and just a second weekend and so it's good to see you I haven't seen some of you guys by the bill in about six or seven weeks so it's good to see your faces this morning and all of you that were able to come and see brother Glen back this morning his wife and different ones and and if I missed you we're glad that you're here and just it's always a blessing to see the people of God in the house of God and we may have to put up with a few restrictions right now but we're going to a place for the bill where there's no restrictions on our fellowship we're so grateful for that amen amen Genesis chapter 3 and verse 14 I also want to tell you while I'm thinking about it before I get to preach in that as but the David already said as Peters birthday Stuart and Allison's birthday they must have been meant for each other we had the same birthday but as Peters birthday as well so it must be a good day to be born and he's back there in on the video and I wanted to say happy Mother's Day to all of you mothers so my mother who's listening today and we're going down there to see her after the service and I'll be gone for a couple of days but if you need me you can call me and then I'll be back Wednesday but but Allen's gonna preach for us on Wednesday night so I'm looking forward to that Genesis chapter 3 and verse 14 the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel I'm so grateful that even in in cursing the serpent there's a great promise for a demo for the Lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated I want to continue in the vein of the abstract but kind of turn down a side road today if you will and and speak to you on motherhood changes everything motherhood changes everything one thing that we can say about every human being that's ever been born no matter how on where he is or I looked at brother JT when I said that but I don't mean that bad towards you brother JT and brother Steve or whoever's on this side but matter how ornery that you are you had a mother that's true of all of us that means that's a simple statement but that's true we can agree on that this morning that we all had a mother motherhood has always had a special status in our culture and and we elevate mothers to a place even today but it seems like that in this age it the meaning of it has been cheapened and and it's been taken from what it was and I hate to see that and I'm sure you do too that motherhood is cheaping to the point where it's seen as a hindrance to a woman to become a mother when actually it's the fulfillment of every woman of the dream that she would have to be a mother that's her dream and even an animal sometimes will adapt we'll adopt a baby when they can't have one themselves and and we find that with mothers they want to mother something and even little girls have that built into their DNA it's just who they are what's this what makes them special because a man no matter what the culture tells you today a man can never be a mother and that seems like a simple statement two boys do it but it's it's hard to for people today to get past the ABCs that men are men and women are women and a man just can't be a mother he can't do it and because it's a special status that was given to the woman to be able to bear children when you blur that distinction between the sexes when you make a man a woman and a woman a man and there's no distinction or there's no difference you also devalue the things that make that person unique and that motherhood makes a woman unique a man can't do that now we looked over the last couple of weeks at an abstract and how that the title deed to the earth was lost Adam lost said the original owner was God and then Adam loses the title deed to the earth and so now he has to go through a process and and come to a place of redemption and so the next thing we found was that they began to advertise for a redeemer there began to be a cry God who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and they looked all over and they found no man worthy to do that but yet one of the qualifications if you look at that advertisement and in your abstract for a redeemer one of the qualifications was to be a kinsman it had to be a kinsman now to be a kinsman would mean that he would be born of a woman this is the qualification to be a human being job's job 14 and one man that is born of a woman he's a few days and full of trouble so it's a it's a it's a qualification or what makes you human you have a mother you're born of a woman this binds us all together as I said no matter how ornery we might be or whatever it might be there's a mother somewhere and so as time went on and and each Hebrew mother would realize that this promise had been made that the seed of the woman would bruised the the head of the serpent and so they each one would would longed to have this seed they would want to be able to to be the one who would be would birth this child who would be the Messiah but then in Isaiah 7:14 the revelation become clearer he says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive so he said it won't be yeah it won't be a just any warm and it won't be a married woman it won't be by the by the a man doing something but it'll be a virgin that'll conceive so it'll be God creating himself in the womb of the mother hey man so and he said he should be call his name Emmanuel it says he'll be God with us right now the second person or a third person but God with us she'll call his name Emmanuel now a woman's identity is tied up in what she is and and in the stages of her life she coach to a point where she's identified originally as a virgin or an unmarried woman and then she comes to a place of marriage she's no longer identified with what she was but now she is a married woman she's identified differently and then she's gonna go to another place and and you know some women if their husband would put them away or it would be a divorce today you have a divorced woman and then you might have a situation where a man would would would die and his wife becomes a widow it's a different identity than she had as a married woman you find that some women get remarried and so if she's been widowed baby she'll get remarried been waiting for my mom on that for many years now that passed away a number of years ago and we teased her about that and I'll find out if she's listening this morning but you know that changed is your status the change is what you care about you know right now my mom gives all of her attention to her grandkids but if she got married she would have someone else to care for it changes who she cares for and then another thing is the birth of a child that would change who the woman is it changes her to a mother and so she has that already in her and even a woman maybe that would be unable to have children she still has that inner but now a woman how's the child becomes a mother and so she goes to these changes in Romans seven and two and this is kind of an odd place to take this but I want to build a background for what we're gonna say today that in Romans 72 says the woman will chasten husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives but if the husband is dead she is loosed from the law of her husband now he's speaking of the law in Christ right the law is the old husband he said you can't be married to the wall and come to Christ you have to the law has to be dead to you for you to come to Christ so he says if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she should be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man so now her status has changed and it says what she has become as a widow but what he says is the reason why your old husband has to be dead it's not so you can live alone and be a widow but so that you can be remarried right that would be a nut nut and not speaking of in the natural now but thinks spiritually that the husband is dead the old husband the law is dead the old husband the denomination is dead the old husband that the world is dead so what does that make it makes a situation where now we have to be married to Christ right the old husband is dead so once he's dead then we're a widow but we don't remain a widow we don't want to stay in that in that state of spiritual widowhood where we find ourself drifting back and forth from pillar to post and place the place and not know where we stand and not know who we are not know if we're born again or not but we have to come to a place where we're married to Christ the word so we don't want to stay in that place as a widow now in Luke chapter 18 there's a story of an unjust judge and a widow and he kind of hangs the key at the door this parable he says he's faking parable unto them to this end that for this purpose it meant not always to pray and not to faint so he says don't quit praying so that's that's what the parable says but he said saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and what she's saying that word avenge us to do justice do justice of my own my adversary so she's in a court of law and you'll find that word adversary in other places the Bible says agree with your adversary quickly speaking of an adversary at law so it would be someone who would come against you in a legal case and so here comes a widow and she's got something against her someone has come against her for what hurts her property whatever that property is something that belongs to her and someone has come and put a claim on it and so she comes to the unjust judge and she cries to him and she says give me back what's mine something belongs to me well I think we ought to learn as we talked to Wednesday night about touching Christ I think we ought to learn how to cry how to call out to God and say Lord I need something from you I need something from you I need to be saved I need to be healed I need to whatever it is in our life we have to ask God for those things there's no better way than to cry for it that just seems simple but there's just no other way sister first that God ever gave us then to cry out to work for what God what we did he'd say what God already knows what you need before you ask but he wants you to ask so you cry out for what you have need of and and so she said avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God no regard man yet because this Widow trouble with me I will avenge her I'll make it right lest by her continual coming she weary me and the unjust judge is a man in a position of power does the right for the wrong reasons he will not be moved by the seriousness of the situation or how well she puts the case before him she he won't be moved by that he just he's just sitting there he won't do it because he only moves when someone gives him a little money you don't fear God he don't care about mahan right he's an extreme example and what a contrast that Jesus draws from our Heavenly Father who knows what we have need oven yet when we come to him and ask him he wants to give us good things so the widow then is a woman that is in this place where she's lost her husband she's lost something she wants it back her cry is a cry for restoration what was mine she finds herself in a situation where she lost possession of something she had and I want us to look at numbers chapter 27 numbers chapter 27 and verse 8 brother David put a reminder on his phone for 11:45 he was being optimistic it wasn't for me it was for him but was tease me about it being a little bit optimistic but we maybe will have you out by that time I need a big clock right there in the back you love the Lord this morning numbers twenty seven and eight is the intestate succession laws of the Old Testament so and first and this was assumed in the law that it first goes to a son specifically the first son would get a double portion of his father's estate and then to the other sons equally but now in numbers 27 and 8 it says that's what speaking of the children of Israel and this is occasion because some some daughters come to Moses and they said hey our father died and left no sons and said we deserve a right to inherit and so they the daughters come and then he says that's what Moses goes to God and prays about and said that's what speaking to the children of Israel saying if a man died have no son you should cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter so those two sons and daughters if you have no daughter than you should give his inheritance to his brethren brothers have no brother he shall give his inheritance to his father's brethren his uncles if his father have no brother and you shall give his inheritance under his kinsmen that is next to him of his family he shall possess it it shall be into the children of Israel a statute of judgment as the LORD commanded Moses now there's something missing there's something missing if you looked at our intestate succession laws today would be different because they've made a place for your wife right and back then there was there was no succession by the wife but yet the wife had to live she had to do something you just have widows floating out there so there was understood that the wife would be able to possess her husband's property but she didn't have a legal right for it she was a like we would call today a trustee or a caretaker or what we would call a life estate as long as she was alive she was able to live there some states so have a version of that it's called our dower rights why for courtesy rights for the man so there's certain rights that she asks but today a wife would inherit a portion of the estate either half in some states or or a child's portion and some states she inherits all so the wife is not given a place now again as I said it's evident that in Bible times she would have a life of state because the story of Ruth tells us that and we'll go to that maybe after a while she could live on it she could use it but she might lose it and then she'd have to go cry to get it back why because she's a will and she'd have to depend on the judge or the King to be able to get it to her give it back to her she was crying for possession of what was hers now this Widow and Jesus story was crying for this and the judge gives in on the merits of the case but because she kept coming back over and over again and I want you to see today that there's different stages or different levels of widowhood because there are some that are widows that don't have the potential to be remarried and there's others that under the levirate law there's widows that would have the ability to be married to their husband's brother or there's widows that could be redeemed right or have their property redeemed and the difference would be if the widow was of an age where she could have children if she could become a mother now this is such a great thing and I know it's it's I'm trying to walk you through slowly so that you get it this morning I don't want to leave you behind because it takes a while to kind of wrap your mind around some of this but she kept coming back this Widow did but now she didn't have the potential maybe and we'll look at a couple of other widows that had more potential than she did but she didn't have the potential of others but she just wanted the benefits of her property she wanted to be able to use it and I'll tell you this morning that there's people in the world today that want to be able to use the blessings of God and so they go to God and ask him and he gives it to him sure he does he's a good god he goes to the rain to fall even on the just and the unjust he's not an unjust judge he's a good God and so he gives to each one as they asked and many times a person with faith will come and be prayed for and be healed even though they're not saved and it's hard to even understand but there'll be a person but they have faith to believe and they'll come and be prayed for him they'll be healed and you feel healed maybe you've cancer something else see another Sain of God they're struggling and having to work through problems in their body say well why can't they be healed well it works me comes off of faith and then there's things that that come in our lives to test us but but here you find a woman who gets what she wants but we've got to be careful what we want there's got to be a desire within us I hope you hear me this morning Church to be more than just beggars to be more than just have a right to live on the land but we want to come back into inheritance again we want to come back in the line where we can have we can actually have our name on the deed well look at another widow second Kings chapter 8 and verse 1 Elijah is speaking to the woman whose son had he had restored to life now this is the woman who had had she'd had an husband and evidently her husband has died in the meantime and now she's been through a lot you remember it's the same woman whose son had been given to her and then the son had been restored to life and now now the husband is dead and so he tells her he says the rising going that down that household insta journey wheresoever thou canst adjourn the LORD hath called for a famine and they should also come upon the land seven years now notice this woman is different because she has a son she has a son now we don't there's nothing that speaks of remarriage with her but she already has a son by her first husband so she can and she can has more of a claim on the land than the first widow did it was only coming and crying but this woman has a son she's a mother and so it should come upon the land 7 years and so the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God this woman believed in a prophet and when the Prophet spoke she did what he said that's right she did what he said but I want you to notice it as it deepens here in and her meaning or her status of widowhood and she wind with her households to during the land of the Philistines 7 years and come to pass at the seven years in the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines she went forth to crying to the king for her house and for her land and I believe we've seen that in this age that there come a time when the people of God began to cry out we see in the Bible that he was the healer of artists Jesus we see in the Bible that they will speak with new tongues and take up serpents and we see mark 16 and we don't see that happening in the church and so the people begin to cry out for something at the end of the seven years they begin to cry out for something from the king she wants more than just the benefit she wants her house in her land and verse four and the King talked with gage to the servant of the man of God saying tell me I praise thee all the great things that Elijah has done isn't it wonderful how God worked this out the key happened to be talking with the servant of the prophet and saying tell me what happened in his ministry and it come to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life and behold the woman whose son he'd restored to life cried to the King for her house and for her land and gaze I said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom Elijah restored to life and when the King asked the woman she told him so the King appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore hall that was hers all the fruits of the field since the day she left the land even until now so he's saying that he appointed to her an officer and brother Branham types an officer of the law to the Holy Ghost you go look it up in connection with the abstract he talks about how that the Holy Ghost was an officer that we could call to enforce our claims to healing to enforce our claims to salvation to enforce the claim that we had on the land on the Lessing's of God so he says restore all that was hers from the day she left the land even until now and so there would come a restoration again this woman has a son the first widow did not the second widow has a son but this presents a problem he can inherit but if she remarries he won't inherit the new husband's property because he's only an heir of his father right so she has more potential than the first widow but not potential of motherhood and so now she cannot inherit by herself but she has a son and he can't inherit from a new husband so in order for the land to be held by a widow in order for it to be redeemed in order for there to be a lineage pass on she would need to move from her status as a widow into marriage now look in order for what Adam lost see that's what we wanted back is what Adam lost it's one thing to go back to all that the church lost one thing to go back even to Pentecost we want all that Adam lost right so there comes a cry in the nominal church for blessings from God there comes a cry in the Pentecostal church for restoration of the gifts but among the bride there's a different cry hey Ben what is that Christ I cry to be married it's a cry for full redemption hey Ben and so in Ruth chapter 1 and verse 3 it talks about the story of Ruth here's another Widow and Lemelin Naomi's husband died she was left her two cents naomi is a widow they took them wives to the women of Moab the name of the one was Orpah the name of the other Ruth they dwelled there about 10 years Malin and chilly undyed also both of them the woman was left of her two sons and her husband now here's three widows here's Orpha who could get remarried but she has no desire to bear a child in Israel or to become a part of the plan of God here's Ruth who had the potential to bear children here is Naomi who could get married but not to bear children she's of an age where she can't do that it is Ruth who the responsibility falls - oh my because she has more potential than just the right to live on the land her potentials and her ability to be a mother because she's going to end up in the very line of Jesus Christ you see why motherhood is elevated to such a status and today sexual promiscuity and all those things devalue it to the point where it doesn't mean anything but in order to be in that seed line a mother would have to be someone who would be married to one of the tribe of juda and she could then become a mother and she was one who didn't have any children by her old husband but now she could produce something her potential was not in the past but her potential is in the producing a son I hope you hear me today our potentials the Bride of Christ it's not in the past but our potential is in the coming of the Lord our potentials in the future potential is in birthing that that word that's coming in this hour we'll talk about that in a moment but her potentials and her ability to bear children oh my so this is for redemption for restoration could only come when she was a widow no longer now I found out some couple few years ago as I was something hit me when I was researching land records I realized that if you take title as a widow we assume you're single because it's understood that no one would put widow after their name if they were married so when you take title or you convey title and you put on their Jane Jones that make up a name to make up a name and my brain don't work too good but Jane Jones conveys to Jim Smith and Jane Jones that says a single person so you know that there's no husband that you have to worry about his rights getting conveyed so Jane Jones a single person but if it said Jane Jones a widow Jane Jones widow and then you would know automatically she's a single person it's written in the law you can assume that because she wouldn't identify herself as a widow if she was remarried and so many times in in the way we come to God we identify ourselves like a widow we identify ourselves like someone who doesn't have any rights we identify ourselves if someone who's just going to get by on the skin of our teeth and bill assert and just make it barely but he don't want us to identify like that he wants us to when we write a check he wants us to say mrs. Jesus Christ now when Ruth comes to boys we find out that her cry is different then the cry that the woman had when she come to the unjust judge or even the woman who come to the king but she comes to her future husband and she doesn't say what she wants but she comes to him and she lays down by his feet and Ruth 3 and 9 he said who art thou yesterday em Ruth on handmade spread therefore thy skirt over that handmaid for thou art a near kinsman she's saying this is my only request be a husband to me if you go look at this what that means be a husband to me me a husband I want you to perform the duties of a husband to me she's not satisfied with just living off his benevolence she already has that she's already been cleaning in the field she'd been gleaning in and she's been he's been good to her and I think we can all say God's been good to us God's been good at all of our life we can look back when we were children to see what God did and how God moved and what God what God meant to our life but brother Steve that's not enough we've got to move beyond that to a place where we know we're not just living off the gifts but we're moving to a place where we had the gifts but we had the giver not just the gifts not just the benevolence not just the trappings of borås she didn't want his house although she would get it she wasn't looking for his land although she would get it she wanted him and at some point our cries the Bride of Christ has to become mature to the point where we're crying not just for the things that we need though we'll always do that there will always be a place for that but we're not just crying for the things we need but we're writing a check for those things right we're not just crying for it but we're actually believe we have the ability to have it so we don't cry or cry it's not in this age just for things just forgets just for blessings but it's for a person Jesus I want you I want you in the fullness of your word I don't want just a gift I don't want just something for that yesterday had my potential it's nothing just a gift my potential is not it just being one of your handmaids they're just one of your people my potential is being your wife instead of asking for things she asked for him wonder when was the last time that you went to God you said Lord let me have you I want you in my life it's not so much about being healed it's not so much about all the things feeling good I want those things my lord I need you if I have you I can make it through any trial if I have you I can make it through any trouble if I have you crawler virus puzzle scare the world doesn't scare me no matter what would happen in the world that I live in if I have him that'll be enough take me to be your wife well I said you rest until I performed all that I need to perform now you remember the kinsman had to make a public testimony so he goes and we went through that how he went through how he went to the nearer kinsman and he couldn't do it cuz it hinder his inheritance but he comes now he couldn't fall into the dirty hands of Satan this how brother branham put it but now Boaz and Ruth four and nine said to the elders and unto all the people he said you're witnesses this day that I have bought all that was the Himalayas oh there was chilly horns and melons of the hand of Naomi moreover ruth the moabite us the wife of Mahlon have i purchased to be my wife why there's a purpose there's a purpose I have purchased her to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance not to give her something new a new inheritance but to give her what Adam lost or he with me now I wanted to give her something new but to give her what Adam lost hey man I had purchased her to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his brethren from the gates of Gators in his place he said your witnesses this state and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses the Lord make the woman notice that has come into thine house notice what they they had wisdom they spoke to him and they said now we're gonna we're going to put a blessing on you the Lord make the woman that is coming to thine house like Rachel like Leah which too to build the house of Israel how by becoming mothers which to did build the house of Israel and do that worthily in effort to be famous and best to him and let the house be like the house of faris whom tame are born did married to Judah of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman oh my now I'm trying to stay focused here because we could go a bunch of different directions now but I want you to notice this maybe we'll get done before 11:45 marriage is not the end result but the purpose is to bear children people forget that in the day and age that we live in and but this was the purpose and especially in those times it would have been a blessing to be able to have children but this was more than just a blessing but it was imperative it was absolutely necessary for this seed line to continue hey men and boys took Ruth and Ruth for 13 boys took Ruth she was his life and when he went in unto her the Lord gave her conception and she bare a son and the woman the women said it to Naomi this should be the Lord which had not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous in Israel and I want you to notice that the story doesn't stop when Boaz does the act of redemption and takes Ruth but the story stops only when Ruth bears a child are you with me now many times we leave off the last part of that Ruth has to have a child if Ruth is childless there can be no there's still no redemption oh my Naomi took the child and and reread verse 15 he shall be into the arrest or of thy life and the nurse sure of that old age for that daughter-in-law which loveth see which is better than even seven sons has borne him and the helmy took the child later than her bosom and become nurse son to it and the women her neighbors gave it a name saying there's not a there's a son born to Naomi they called his name Obed he is the father of Jesse the father of David he puts him right in the line the natural lineage of Christ now watch brother branham when he reads the story of the unjust judge in the widow he does this in a message called The Anointed once at the end time but he reads from Luke chapter 18 and verse 6 he reads the whole story including this part that we didn't read in verse 6 and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge saith shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them he said I tell you he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth will there be anyone crying for the right things now hang with me here because there were many crying for a revival there was people all over crime for a revival I said we need a prophet to return and they didn't recognize one stood right among them a prophet of God stood there and people look at that said if we could only have what Pentecost asked I don't want just for Pentecost hat I don't want just what Azusa Street had that was wonderful I want that but I want more than that because my promise is more than that my potential is more than that I don't want to be just like the church down the road that has the music in the scene the one that's wonderful I want that I want the blessings of God I want the gifts of God to follow on every one of them but I want to give her more than that I want to give her and so he says he says shall he find faith now brother Branham says so that's the question he said here is where I wanted to get you in revelations 10 we'll get to it in a few minutes and another scripture verse he said in the days of the message of the seventh angel the mystery of God ought to be finished he said here is the question if you follow in that line in this hour will it be finished will I find the faith will Malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time he's challenging the people well I find faith well Malachi 4 be fulfilled hey Ben well I find faith for the faith of the children back restore the face to children back to the face of the father's the the word now we can say yes we can look back and say God did send Elijah God did what he promised he would do we lose sight of that sometimes say well I don't see God keeping any promises he kept a promise and he keeps promises to you every day but he kept a promise that he would send a prophet but that wasn't the end of the promise hey man but he promised he said they will not all sleep but will all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye hey man there's coming a time when our faith will become sight there's coming a time of the JC when what we believe for become reality we believe in a rapture we believe in something that'll change our bodies we believe in a in a heaven that's a place we can go to we believe in a literal millennial reign we believe in a heaven in a Christ a literal Christ will sit on the throne for the better that's what believers believe so our faith is faith now but we're looking for that we're looking for that coming if there's still something coming so today what are we crying for we're not crying just for the the he didn't say will will the gifts be restored but will the faith be restored hey Beth will the faith be restored wills us and nothing again the gifts had to be restored but there had to come something further than that there had to come the original word amen so we can say yes that's been fulfilled but what are we crying for today number the Branham in marriage and divorce he said so it is with the church that refused us to become pregnant in this age that we now live in to bring four children of this age now today is Mother's Day and the church refuses to be a mother to the word if we could put it that way they refuse to bear the word in their lives the church nominal refuses oh my what does a person do and they walk away from the message they just refuse to bear the word I don't want that that makes me ashamed it changes me too much I don't want to go through those things in my body I don't want to have to deal with those problems so they walk away and all of a sudden their weekends are free all of a sudden they don't have to plate eyes no more feels pretty good at first you walk away there's pleasure and sin for a season all of a sudden you get to do whatever you want to do you can leave any way you want to but you'll find out there's consequences for that because God's Word is there for a reason hey man and the Christian is the happiest person on the face of the earth if they really know Jesus if they really have him if they're really married to Christ the word and they've given up everything to them just like a woman who's married to her husband and submissive in a godly way she's so happiest person on the face of the earth husband doesn't beat her e doesn't use her as a doormat he doesn't think only of himself but what is it they're one they become or she completes him she's a part of him that he couldn't be oh my if you could only recognize that's you in Christ but you dabble in the world we dabble in things of the world because we're just not happy with what we have remember we're called to bring for children of this age we're not Lutheran's we're not Wesley's with events that neither are we Pentecostals we've got to be the children of this age through the pregnancy of the Word of God to bring forth a child of this age the seed child are you with me this morning I appreciate the freedom to preach this morning it's been wonderful seems like the last couple of weeks maybe I just needed to preach without people for a while or without many people some of you all had to come to run the sound and and do the music and things but without many people it seemed like and then when you come back it seems different maybe God needed to teach me a lesson wouldn't take that for granted again and one day we'll all be able to get together and take the ropes off these pews and shake each other's hands and do all that but in the meantime this is good and so I appreciate the freedom to preach I thank you for that now he says we're not Wesley's we're not Pentecostals we got to be the children this age to bring forth the child of this age so he says again in a message called the choosing of a variety so we find today that the modern church a modern church world the modern world Church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnant to give birth to sons they've both been impregnated they both received seed to give birth to sons one of them a denominational birth that's going to listen to the one of these days at the World Council of Churches will produce to the world the Antichrist there's a great sermon there one of you preachers that can really preach how to take that because it's the incarnation as a result of the seed they received will be the Incarnate devil then what would be the results of the seed of the birth the bride receives the Incarnate Word oh look here the result of that see this Antichrist have produced to the world the Antichrist or a denomination he said I may not live to see it I believe I will but you young people will remember you heard a minister say that that'll finally wind up he said that is the mark of the beast when she forms that World Council of Churches she'll give birth to her son the Antichrist the other is pregnant by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finish body of Jesus Christ which is the bride hey Beth lay bet you imagine Ruth Boaz marries her you know he's rich he's got lots of land lots of things she could sit back there in the house said I got it all now I got it all now man I was down there in Moab I was down there Naomi sounds we didn't have nothing just gleaming in the field I got it all now you don't have to glean the more just sitting here in the house sitting pretty but she found out she had a job to do there was something she had to become what did she have to do first and foremost it wasn't cleaning the house and keep up the servants and do all the same shoes but no that's part of it but what did she have to do before she did anything else love her husband that was her first ad Oh church we forget that sometimes we forget that sometimes that our first duty to God is to love him our first duty is to love Christ and so here she was she had to begin to love him and when she loved him things begin to change and when that things begin to change she began to get a room ready she began to work she began to feel different things begin to happen until one day a child was born why she'd become his they'd become one and now she would have his child listen so it produces it brings forth the finished body of Jesus Christ brother man tells us when the last one comes in we'll go home that'll be the finished body of Jesus Christ you say exactly how it will that happen I don't know but that's our job she will bring forth the finished body of Jesus Christ you are predestinated yes to bring forth the finished body of Jesus Christ you pretest said it for a reason he's called he's justified he justified he's glorified he's glorified and so all these things come on after the other he didn't called you because he knew you would be willing to receive it and he put that willing to see you it was nothing of your home but it was just something that you were willing to do now watch brother Barron speaking of the natural Church in the invisible union of the Bride of Christ he said so you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 2:38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are I know this gets abused sometimes this quote but but brother Brennan said it he actually said it that she don't want none of those kind miserable creatures that she thinks they are maybe she looks at them and has pity on them well you know they that's all just all they can be you know that's they're just religious folk the world today looks at us and says well it's just just about Pentecostals or whatever they might group us in with huh that's not what I am I'm a child of the word hey Betts and as a child of the word they bet as the wife of Christ I have a right to the gifts have a right to speaking in tongues I have a right to the things of God I have a right to be that screaming hollering why I'm a child of the word so when she brings forth she doesn't just bring forth members but she brings forth acts 2:38 members he said she don't want those kind it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical student scientific society church that she belong to here they would throw her out at the next council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth she don't want that kind she don't want the church the word in his fullness so she stays away from her husband and she finds other lovers that'll produce other kinds of children I'm closing in just a moment women who never have children enjoy the equivalent of an extra three months a year and leisure time and I don't say this to make you feel bad if you don't have children haven't been able to have children or there's some that God allows that to be in their life just committed fully to him that's a wonderful thing but for a woman that has children she has extra duties and so they say that it's three months a year that a woman who doesn't have children some of you who recently had your if you had your first child you understand that or you're about to understand that there's a lot to do I was amazed with my wife we started having kids and it wasn't that different for me it was a little different but she woke me up every night I didn't get up but she woke me up but no I you know it was different for me but not that different I still went to work every day but for my wife things were different things were different she was a mother and she wanted to be a mother to those children and I've always thought it was amazing because there's something in my life that she wanted to be home with them she just wanted to be near him and I realized everybody can't be in the age that we live in Pharaoh's got people making bricks without straw so it's an age of slavery almost to have the financial status that you need but my wife wanted to be a mother and and through the grace of God we've lived simply and and and people would call us poor but yet we she's always been able to be at home and I worked in so she was able to be a mother to those children I see how she wanted to always be with them she wanted to be a part of their lives and she wanted to be a mother to them it was to what she does I watched my mother today I teased her so I'll say something nice about her but she my mother is still a mother and she still treats me as her baby in some ways and all of her eight children she still treats them that way and and so she'll give advice even when we don't want it but you know it's good advice many times but she does she does that she'll treat you to come to the house and she wants to cook and she wants to do things in the kitchen and do things around the house because it's just what she does she's a mother and and it takes time and so you see it it takes in some women today look down on that say well there's nothing worse that could happen to you than to become pregnant like it just something accidentally happened and then I mean you have to go out and have an abortion get rid of it or you can't live your life what a horrible thing why they just don't want to deal with it they say that a mother spends about three and a half hours a week just on housework additional housework on a child and about 11 hours a week on child related activities it adds up to about 754 hours of work a year and I think of some mothers who also work and I don't know how they do that I don't even know how it's possible but my hats off to you if you have to do both because it's very complicated it's very hard and again a Satan that that does that even in our culture that makes it where it has to be that way but looks you take that and you think wouldn't it be easier if I didn't have any children but you wouldn't be who you are Beth and now we could take that in turn into a spiritual sense wouldn't it be easier if I wasn't a Christian wouldn't life be easier if I didn't have to go to church more specifically if I did wasn't a message believer wouldn't it be so much easier if I didn't have to do the things that believers have to do and and wear the clothes and the things and the god I've been asked to do by the scripture and it'd be easier if I could watch Esther this morning getting her hair and helped her get her hairbrush out it'd be easier just to cut it surely but she'd been asked not to do that but she could never you can never become you'd never be what you are you lose who you are and it's so much more important than what you the work that you have to do you realize your mothers do the most important job in the world you have the most important job in the world you realize that's the Bride of Christ you have the most important job in the world and it seems like your work is never done but remember there's something that you're molding something that you're forming it doesn't stop when the baby leaves the womb but when the baby is young and as it continues to grow you're a mother seems like your work has never done but remember there's something that's being completed someone has said I took a piece of living clay and gently formed it day by day molded with my power and our two young child soft and yielding heart I came again when days were gone it was a man I looked upon he's still that early impressed bore and I could change it Nevermore why you have an opportunity to form the clay work do it it's worth it now let's look when a additional mother was Mary she was a virgin and she wasn't expecting anything she was just believed in God's Word and one day angel come to her and said blessed art thou among women because you're being given the opportunity to be what Isaiah talked about to become a mother and it won't be by any of your own instrumentality it won't be anything you do or anything you feel but it'll be by the work of the Holy Spirit now what does she do she could have stopped it said man look at the ridicule what will Joseph think what was what was the people think what will what kind of how will my life change how am i she never got an opportunity to be married to Joseph without having children sometimes it's good to wait a little while so that you can become one and get your household together before you have a child she didn't have that opportunity so she maybe thought what things are things are different things are gonna be different but what does she say be done to me according to thy word be done to me according to thy word why because she was becoming a mother and she was willing to go through what she had to go through to see the word formed in her life and to produce that child and then to nurture that child but look at it from the other direction look God chose Mary to do that because he knew Mary would be willing to nurture that child somebody had to feed that child somebody had to care for it it was just a helpless little baby it couldn't feed itself it couldn't take care of herself somebody had to change its diapers somebody had to take care of it somebody had to give it a bath somebody had to train it somebody had to teach it to walk and all the things that a mother does somebody had to take Christ and make him form him in the flesh man into being a man look we've been given a great word in this hour but as a bride we have a responsibility to take that word and let it become what's in it in its fullness since the mother you don't take your child and try to and just change it to what you want it to be some mothers do you don't do that you don't change it said I want you to be this border you do you watch what's in it you watch what the child already has in it it has a seed in it from his father it's got something in it that's growing his father and mother's DNA and it's growing into something you watch that child maybe this one's an artist this one's a singer this one this is good with math and so you look at them and they're different but you're able to take that a real mother will take that in and grow what's inside of that child already don't you see we have to do that what's the word don't get discouraged you come to church there may be a deacon has to come to church and didn't get much out of the service because all he's doing is watching people and trying to make sure everyone's comfortable and thanks for getting none but what's he doing he's taking care of the word maybe a young woman comes to church and and she don't understand she comes and don't get anything out of service because the kids and sometimes the dad's dog anything out of service because of the kids but what are you doing you're nurturing you're forming the word hey man keep doing it that's my encouragement to you today on Mother's Day keep taking care of the word keep taking care of your children ever Parkes you have to play in the body of Christ keep doing it keep walking because one of these days you're gonna walk with God and you're gonna be not hey bad you're gonna walk with God and you're just gonna you're gonna change in a moment I'm physically ill and I why because you've been working the whole time being what God has placed in your heart God gave you a word God gave us the fullness of the word in this hour let's let's mold it let's let's be as protective as we can be of it mother just don't let it run out in everything every situation and play games with their kids a mother don't let her kids run out in front of that what do we do we take the word that's in our lives and we mold it to be in the image of the father God gave it to us for a reason that the body of Christ could be complete you love him this morning let's bow our heads motherhood changes everything receiving the word changes everything you say you're a message believer that's more than just identifying with a prophet but it's saying Lord be it unto me according to that word be it unto me let me become the word let me change however I need to change to take care of the word would you just make that your prayer today maybe on Mother's Day you've never given your heart to Christ I want to give you that opportunity I think we neglect to do that sometimes in a church because we assume everybody is saved but you may all be this morning but I want to give you the opportunity to give you heart to Christ today it's Mother's Day not just because your mother would want you to though I'm sure she would be the greatest honor that you could give her but that's not just because of that because you feel the desire in your heart that word is preached you today you feel the desire Lord be it unto me according to that word she just talked to him for a moment Lord Lord help me I want to be saved maybe you're a Christian today and you kind of gotten away you you you get to a place where you're frustrated by motherhood if we could put it that way you're kind of tired of taking care of the word but God helped us never to be that way and it gets old you know what you need to do go back and find Jesus I said nothing to my mother and my wife it's so tired I'm dealing with kids all day long and I could bring her home things and do things for that's wonderful but she wants to be with me she wants to spend time with me and the best thing that I could do if I remember to do it is to spend time with her if you're frustrated by taking care of the church taking care of the word and doing things and maybe it's just not what you intended for it to be it's maybe the church is disappointed you people have disappointed you why don't you go back into a room with Jesus shut the door but the veil behind the Holy of Holies fallen say lord help me to learn to love you like I did it the first if you're a Christian today let me love you like I did at the beginning let me never become jaded people may have treated me wrong people may have done things that were wrong but let me never become jaded let me ever become frustrated and and just where I don't care anymore let me care for the word in my life heavenly father or God we pray I pray that way Lord sometimes in the busyness of making sure that everything is done we forget just to spend time with you what Ruth needed to do and she married boys was immediately begin to spend time with him be a wife to it so that she could receive the word herself and she could become that word oh god we can we can give up everything else but we don't want to give you up Lord we could give up our our time on everything else but we don't want to give up our time with you we have these precious moments when you come in the services we're gathered together and it just feels like your presence is nearest we have those moments in our homes when we get down on our knees maybe in our study or in our prayer and our devotions maybe in the car on the way to work we have just two moments when we see all we knows that your presence is there everything's gonna be okay help us to maximize those times or to give up everything else but not to give you up as this age makes the church an essential makes makes meeting with you just something that people do an extra thing oh come and we realize the essential value that we have of coming into your chamber closing the door just beginning to worship begin to love you lord that's all our part is we can't change ourselves only the seed can do that we can't make ourselves to be what you want us to be only the seed can do that but we can become your word by loving you I pray you granted today I pray Lord if there's one stuck in that will mentality feeling like they're lost all the time not knowing if they're saved Oh God help them to be married to Christ the word to come fully to surrender everything until they come right to your presence I pray you'd grant it now in Jesus name [Music] Oh in the
