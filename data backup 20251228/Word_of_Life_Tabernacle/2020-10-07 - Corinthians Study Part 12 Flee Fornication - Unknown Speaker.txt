if you would to first corinthians [Music] first corinthians i'll have it up in a minute chapter 6 and verse 12. i didn't want to tell you the wrong chapter we'll read the one verse and then we'll uh we'll go a little bit further we'll finish the rest of this chapter tonight um peter i feel like this is just a little bit loud i'm glad to have my kids they helped me yesterday in the funeral and my wife and such a blessing to to have my children working with me in the house of the lord you know you pray that it would always be that way you don't know but you pray that it will always be that way it's good to have all of you sister lily it's your family your mom and your aunt here with you today it's nice to have you here this evening i've got kind of a heavy subject this evening but i you know i don't want to diminish the seriousness of it but i've tried to cut back as much as i can and not not keep you too long i heard about a preacher who was wearing a band-aid when he would come to the pulpit and he told the people he was sorry said he well he said i was thinking about my sermon and i cut my face and said that they got a note in the offering basket said preacher who said next time think about your face and cut your sermon so maybe we should do that more often amen first corinthians chapter 6 and verse 12 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any i pray the lord without his blessing to the word but let's bow our heads just for a moment heavenly father we thank you that you've allowed us to come together again tonight i pray that you would just come and you would speak to your people you know what we have need of tonight lord and i pray that there would not be one thing said that shouldn't be said but that everything that you want said would be said lord and i pray that you would just reach down in the hearts and begin to work only you can do that lord and i pray father that you would just touch every every heart lord and and somehow you would bring healing and peace and comfort in our lives as only you can do i pray you granted now in jesus name amen god bless you you could be seated this evening paul is responding to an argument in corinthians chapter 6 that the corinthians have evidently made that the law was done away with in christ and so it became a doctrine that all things are lawful and paul says that's true all things are lawful and brother branham illustrates that by saying that if you were given a pass to be able to drive any speeds you wanted to or you were the mayor of the city or whatever you could drive whatever speed you wanted to and the speed law would have no effect on you because you've already you're above that law that's the way we are we are above the law in that sense but he says all things are not expedient and that that word's a little bit tricky but he's the it's a play on words in the original it and it's imitated somewhat in the english by thing saying all things are in my power but i will not be brought under the power of any in other words i can do what i want but as christians and you might ask you know the question might come up why would you preach to christians about these things well the truth is our bodies are not converted and our spirits are not converted and yet those things and we'll talk about it later have to come in subjection to the soul that is converted so we need to hear these things our children need to hear these things and and there's things that have to be said and but we're not to come under the tyranny of supposed freedom boundless intemperance becomes tyranny and the pretense of moral freedom ends in moral bondage so not all things that are lawful are expedient anything that would offend my weak brother or would enslave my own soul is something that i shouldn't do because all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any john wesley uh kind of defined it this way he said if there's anything that would make me uneasy when i abstain from it then i'm under the power of it let me repeat that because that that could hit a lot of areas in our life anything that would make me uneasy if i abstain from it i'm under the power of it and that could be your phone right and i know some of you i know how it is because you feel like you've got it in your pocket and if you don't have it there you reach for it you panic a little bit if you don't have it maybe the rest of you don't do that but some of us younger folk do because it becomes almost a part of you but you're under the power of it if it makes you uneasy to abstain from it and john wesley learned well from his mother and i love this susanna wesley wrote this in a letter to john wesley in 1725 she said take this rule whatever weakens your reason impairs the tenderness of your conscience obscures your sense of god and that's very important because sin and some things maybe that wouldn't be open sin but would be the appearance of evil actually takes us away from the feeling of the grandeur of god and the awesomeness if i could say it that way of god and if it does it's sin and so he said she said obscures your sense of god or takes off your relish of spiritual things in short whatever increases the strength and authority of your body over your mind let me let me reread that whatever increases the strength and authority of your body over your mind that thing is sin to you however innocent it may be in itself brother branham lists the truth of grace not being disgraced as one of the loose ends to be revealed by the seventh angel messenger he says the grace straightened out and this is that quote that next quote if it's on there the grace straightened out not disgrace but real true grace isn't that what you want to have not disgrace but real true grace and he explains that very well in the law having a shadow and i know i'm taking a long time on this one verse but it's very important all things are lawful but all things are not expedient and so brother branham says i'll always do what i want to do god lets me do what i want to do and i'm so glad of it if i did what the devil wanted me to do it's hard to tell what i would do but if i do what i wanted to do like i did before i was saved he said but now there's a new spirit in there and it's not the spirit of a lamb neither the spirit of william brandon it's the spirit of jesus christ that makes me love the unlovable makes me do things that i thought i never would do it's him he said why if it was me you know he said what i'd have said tonight he said i'd have called up mr boze and said boy look i've been up for two nights i ain't had a bit of sleep i ain't slept about two hours the last two nights going and coming and people at the door everything else way in the night and try to lay down a few minutes and get you up again he said then it's broke and then that goes away here's another he said sure i just stayed home but there was something in me that wasn't me that said you're supposed to be in chicago tonight so brother branham ties this this grace this uh this new spirit that he has how he does what he wants to do to serving god in his capacity as a minister he said i could have not come but i came even though i was tired why because there was something in me and that's why we live for god isn't it that's why we want to do the right things is because there's something in us and so he said it was 12 30 at home and about 280 miles to drive through that traffic i said lord i'm going you help me he said he did i got just in time i was here see it's something in you he said there is therefore now no condemnation can't be to those that are in christ for they don't walk after the lusts of the flesh they walk after the spirit and if you love the lord you want to do everything you can to please him if you love god that's what it's about i heard a story that of a king who had four sons and he was telling his sons that he was thinking about which one to give the kingdom to and pondering it and as he was getting older and this first son come to him and said i'm he said i'm intelligent he said i'm the most intelligent person in your kingdom if you give it to me we'll have the most intelligent kingdom there is the best run and the next one said well i'm wealthy i've made all this money and he said i will have the wealthiest kingdom that there is in the world the third son come to him and said i'm strong i'm able to fight he said if we everybody will be afraid of us if no one will will come against our borders if if i'm the one that takes over the kingdom the fourth one come up and said i'm not very strong he said i'm not very intelligent he said i'm not i don't have very much money he said but during this entire time all these others gained intelligence and strength and all these things he said i just learned how to love people and guess which one the king gave the kingdom to because if you love people you're going to do the right thing for them the kingdom will be where it's supposed to be and if we love people and if we love god we'll do what we're supposed to do if you love the lord you want to do everything you can to please him so brother branham said well let's take it this way so that the unlearned would understand if you love your wife right he said i love my wife real good my he said well what if there was such a thing if some other woman would come up and say billy i love you too and she'd be a real pretty girl and say i love you well she won't do it but if she would see he said you know what i'd tell her i'd say look sister kneel down there a minute i want to pray with you a little about it well you say bill you're in africa asia somewhere else your wife would never know it that might be true if she never did know it i'd know it see i would know it and another thing if i love her the right way she you say well if she loves you so much she'd forgive you that may be so too but i love her too much to do it see he said that's grace not nothing i'd done but it's just my love for her and that's the way our love is to christ when we've been born again and realize that we are sons and daughters of god it ain't me after this and have to paul said all things to me are lawful but not all expedient he said so it isn't some law that i have to preach the gospel it isn't some law that i have to do this it's because i love him so much i trust that's why you're here tonight it's because i love him so much that's why i want to come to the house of the lord and he said if you love him like that he said as long as i love my wife like that she don't have to never worry amen and as long as she loves me like that she don't have to worry he didn't have to worry you might say well brother ben if we love each other like that then it shouldn't matter if we're in compromising situations that's false love does not just keep you in compromising situations that keeps you out of compromising situations if you love somebody you won't go into that situation i heard about that boy i'm just in a storytelling mood tonight i guess but i heard about a boy who was gonna go or was told not to go swimming down in the old strip pits where they take the gravel out of and his dad told him don't go swimming he sees him coming back one afternoon and he's coming back he got a pair of swimming trunks in his hand wet he said where you been he said i've been swimming down in the in the strip pit he said well he said but i didn't mean to he said i didn't intend to he said it was just overtaken by temptation and the father said well how come you got to swim in trunks he said well i put them on just in case he didn't prepare him he didn't prepare himself very well did he now and that's what a lot of people do say well i'm in a compromising situation if i really love my wife i don't want anything happen if you really love her you won't put yourself in that situation so brother brown says this and taking sides with jesus and this is what brother branham ties to this scripture this scripture i'm not making that up he ties it to all things are lawful but not all expedient in taking sides with jesus he said many times i'd go to houses and there are women standing out there he says i go to the house knock on the door and a sister would come to the door come in brother branham if her husband is not there he said let's it's a case of sickness and somebody with me i don't go now watch it he said unless it's a case of sickness and there's someone with me i don't go he said and then they call me to a hospital or to a room and say brother branham come over here i'm sister so-and-so from so and so i'm here at the hotel i brought my mother along she's sick he said i'd take my wife if i don't i take some other brother he said i think it would be all right for me to go in there but what if somebody seen me go in there in other words he knew he wouldn't do anything he knew his heart right but what if somebody seen me do it he said see then the first thing you know they would say he went in there where that woman was he's chasing after women he said that would be a thing i shouldn't do see and he said you should never do anything like that because you put a stumbling in somebody else's way he said see i don't believe that i would do anything wrong in there he said i would and trust god to go in there he said no matter what the thing was i would trust god but yet see i loved the lord well enough till i wouldn't do it he said see it's the love you have he said you'll not do it because it's a duty to do it you do it because you love the lord he said you don't have to do it but you do it anyhow paul said to me all things are lawful but not all are expedient see paul could do lots of things maybe he knew the lord understood him and trusted him but it wasn't expedient for him to do it so in the next verse and i think that explains it better than i could explain and in first corinthians 6 13 paul says meets for the belly belly for meets but god shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body so their argument that would class this is something that doesn't matter he said people wouldn't make that argument today they have made it the world is making that argument it doesn't matter and i've had message people make it to me that it doesn't matter but it does matter he said now the body is not for fornication before the lord and lord for the body so they were saying this is the same as eating meat or not eating meat that fornication was the same problem it was no different than what kind of meat he said it doesn't matter what you do because it's a necessity but paul's saying it's not a necessity food is a necessity the stomach was formed for the purpose of digesting food fornication is not a necessity it's a deadly sin it's not a natural necessity but a consuming evil god did make a way in marriage and no other way now first corinthians 6 14 let's look at that and god has both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power now paul is tying us in our bodies and want us to get that tonight he's tying us not just in our soul but our body to christ because when christ when he saved you he saved you to redeem you completely not just your soul but now your soul is not completely redeemed until we take a body change or your body is not right your soul is completely redeemed but your body's still flesh so we have to talk about these things otherwise we wouldn't have to but there will be a time when it's completely redeemed there's complete redemption there's what we call full adoption right but but right now we're living in this condition where that soul has got to take authority over the body but paul says you don't just serve god with your soul you serve god with your flesh right so now he said god raised up the lord will also raise up us by his own power so we are identified in his death burial and resurrection so we identify ourselves body soul and spirit with god verse 15 know you not that your bodies are the members of christ he said shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot god forbid so he's arguing again you don't serve god just with your soul but also with your spirit and your body because you are the body of christ now look and we've heard it said this way that you're his hands that's you're his physical hands right these are his feet if he has physical feet today it's us right if he has hands he physical hands it's us god brother brown says always uses man he always does not just part of the time and so we can't separate and it's a dangerous mentality when we begin to separate well i i live this way but i know i'm saved i know that i'm right but you can't separate that if you know you're saved it's got to take precedence over this other there's got to come a time when when your baptism and your and your experience with god and all those things does some good huh and there's a time to be a baby and there's a time to grow up there's a time you expect somebody to make mistakes and will always make mistakes because of the flesh right but we we got to grow in those right the mistakes you make you still make mistakes as an adult but the mistakes you make are different you make more mature mistakes right and the problem with the corinthians is they kept making the same mistakes over and over again with no maturity are you with me so far so now so we serve god with all of our and that's why when we're baptized we're buried with him in baptism and i guess this is good because our sister is going to be baptized but you're buried with him and baptized you don't bury just a part of you it's not spiritual it's an outward show that your whole body body's going under you're dying and then you're being resurrected and it's the soul that's resurrected now but the body will be right so now brother branham explains this and who is this melchizedek he said then you see he's speaking of christ he said he come right down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is put on the lamb's book of life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear disappear he said then he become flesh and return back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition he said but you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies he said but look when this body receives the spirit of god this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to god he said he that's born of god does not commit sin he cannot sin romans 8 1 and he quotes there is therefore now no condemnation in them there in christ jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's actually romans 8 1. he said there you are he said see that throws your body subject he said you don't have to say oh if i could just quit drinking he said just get in christ he said it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they're dead your sins are buried in baptism and you're a new creation in christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of a life he said like you women claiming you've got the holy ghost and going out here wearing shorts and things how could you do it and brother brown makes that argument all the time it was a very simple thing but he said how could you have the holy ghost and wear those kind of clothes how could the spirit of god in you ever let you do such a thing as like that it just can't be so he said certainly it can't be he's not a filthy spirit he's a holy spirit and then when you become subject to that spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world i love this i love this what do we say the spirit and the word were the same he said that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened hallelujah made a life and when the bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question and what is it it's the earnest of the resurrection amen i love this this body will be raised up again that's why we could have such assurance for our sister when she passed away because this body will be raised up again because it's already started amen it's already started it was once subject to sin admire and corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly he said now that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture it's the earnest hey man you had to have something to have something later on oh if we could only understand there's got to be a change in our life and that's not the doctrine the world teaches today and that's why the churches are full of people who have not changed but but it should not be us we've been taught better than that we we have to change there's got to be because the earnest is here the token he said that's the earnest you're going in the rapture it's the earnest he said a sick person laying dying nothing left but death that's all can happen he said i've seen the shadows of people don't eat up with cancer and tuberculosis see them persons a little after that perfectly normal and strong listen this ties back to last wednesday night he said if there is no divine healing then there is no resurrection because divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection he said you know what the earnest money is don't you it's the down payment he was wounded for our transgressions with his tribes were healed he said notice how wonderful we love him he said now this body is subject to the spirit have not yet entered into the word form but we're still in the flesh form but subject to the word and death in the flesh will take us there aren't you looking forward to that day that's why when you get sick you get healed and you get sick again i know sister joanna don't want to hear that but you get sick again but if you're ever saved you'll never get sin sick again you may make mistakes but you'll never be a sinner again you ever get saved because the soul is what carries you through and death in the flesh takes us there now first corinthians 6 16 he says what only not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit you can't be one flesh with a with any person outside of marriage and be one spirit with god you can't say that i'm one flesh with someone outside of marriage and but god blesses me god he may allow blessings to fall on you because he allows blessings to fall on the just and the unjust but you can't be that and and be one spirit with god it's an impossibility a person no matter you know and what happens is even if you're a saved born-again person and i people say well you couldn't fall into that i don't know the flesh is still unsafe but i know if it's subject to the spirit you can't fall into that right but but there there's something in the flesh that's always unsaved but so that's not for me to judge but but i do know this that if you do that the holy spirit would flee from you you'd grieve him from you right and but that's true of anything you know that we do he he lives in a holy temple but we can invite him back in aren't you glad for the grace of god that when you grieved him you can invite him back so paul says flee fornication verse 18 flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committed fornication sinneth against his own body flee fornication that's all unlawful commerce with women wesley said it this way it was speed with abhorrence with all your might like joseph with potiphar's wife if you have to lose something to flee it still run right if you've got to give up your dignity to flee if you've got to be put in prison like joseph was to run from it still run because it'll destroy your life and joseph knew that he'd rather have his character than his position in potiphar's house he'd rather have his character and you look today even politicians that what they just excuse me for using this language was sleeping their way to the top and and those kind of things it's it's abhorrent to god and and it should not even be mentioned among us as becoming saints now joseph fled from potiphar's wife now that word fornication is porneia in the greek it it's an extremely broad word we've talked about it before but it means any sexual activity outside of marriage brother branham talks about in the invisible union of the bride of christ he said look on these screens and see those movie stars kissing and hugging and slopping around over these women he said a woman does that does that is of a bad character he said she might be virtuous otherwise but in her heart he said those gland sex lamps are on the lips the man kisses the woman he's actually potentially committed adultery sex lands are in the woman's lips and the man's lips he could kiss her on the hand it wouldn't mix the sex glands but the sex glances in the lips and all he said all this nonsense in hollywood today of all this slopping and loving around with women and so forth he said a little girl's looking at all that he said no wonder our morals are rotten and decayed and filthy because it's put before the children i said well it's just put before worldly children that's not true sadly that's not true my kids were very young when they come to me and begin to talk to me about school and say why my teacher is goes to a certain church and she just lives with her boyfriend she's a christian she's a good person why is she not right and have to explain that to him because that's just the way the world is today it's put before the children it's put before them especially on movies and and on tv screens it's put before the children brother brown says it has to be that way for the last day we're living in a rough time i read a survey said roughly one-third of evangelical protestants that's the cream of the crop that's the best of the best that in this nation that you've got it's the group that called themselves evangelical that's what people that call themselves born again brother brown or the survey said that one-third of those say casual sex between consenting adults is always or sometimes acceptable that's one out of three over half of people who call themselves christians say it's okay and if you look at the younger generation the numbers are astronomical the people in their teens and 20s and 30s who believe it's okay regardless of what the bible says but it's not okay it doesn't make it right and we're going the farther the longer we swim upstream the more the stronger the current gets but we're going somewhere we're getting close to the ocean we're getting close to home but the farther you go the stronger and the longer you swim the more weak you get because it takes strength to swim upstream and so we've got to feed on the word to be able to swim because we're swimming against the current someone said that politically years ago someone said politically to be a conservative was to stand a thwart history yelling stop but i think that says something about us as christians more than political conservatives because politics will always go the way that people want it to go but it says something about us as christians you're standing in the current of history saying stop and the whole world won't stop but we still live right we should and i don't want you to feel condemned because maybe in your life you've had problems i don't say that you have but all of us have had problems all of us have struggled with these things as adults especially all of us have but remember god's grace is sufficient and what you've done your past is your past they call it the past for a reason right because it is past and there is grace for these things i believe the grace of god can cover any sin but you've got to stop and move on and i've got to touch on this and we'll move on but virtual fornication is still fornication it would be covered under the idea of porneia matthew 5 28 jesus said whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after earth committed adultery with her already in his heart pornography especially in this age destroys women and men and if you're struggling with that i you know there's an interview that dr dobson did years ago with ted bundy the serial killer and you can find it online and he'll tell you how he got started and that's the way he started and it leaves you with never enough never enough and you'll never be satisfied with your marriage never be satisfied and and so it's one of those things flee from it run from it and jesus said it this way and before i read this i not just teenagers struggle with it adults struggle with it too and the truth is that boys and girls struggle with it men and women struggle with it all you have to do is go to a youth meeting and and and be involved in counseling and you'll find that out but jesus said this is the best advice i can give you on that in matthew 18 9 if thine hand defend thee pluck it out cast it from me it is better or if thy eye rather offend thee pluck it out cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire that's not taking your physical eye out but it's taking the opportunity away and i'll say this and man i feel like i'm preaching at the choir tonight but y'all bear with me i know others will watch this and those that aren't here are watching tonight i trust trusted they are and we're not throwing anything at them either but our kids have to know and we have to be reminded you can live without television you can live without internet you can live without facebook you can live without a cell phone but you can't live without god and if you can't be one body you can't be one flesh with the world and love the world and the things of the world and love god you can do away with all those things and you know what if you've got a problem with it do away with it the worst place that a person that has a problem with that can be is on facebook it's the absolute worst place uh back in 2012 they did a study of facebook one-third of divorces in the uk were linked back to facebook one out of three i'm not anti-facebook i'm on facebook but if you've got a problem with that and you see yourself going that way it's not worth it it's not worth it verse 19. thank you for hanging with me tonight he says what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god you are not your own so he said the holy ghost come from god and it lives in you in this body right it lives in this body what an astounding saying that is that your body is the temple of the holy ghost because there was a day when the living god dwelt in moses tabernacle and there was a day when it dwelt in the temple of solomon you remember that coming like a cloud and even the post of the doors moved that god lives in you the god that was so holy that in in the holy of holies they could only go in once a year as we talked about recently and and then they wore bells on the bottom that if they didn't didn't to make a certain noise that they were dragged out because they would die and they could only do that once a year to make atonement for the sins of the people but now we've come to a to a mercy seat that's been open wide and holy of holies and what is it it's right here that same god lives in you and lives in me your body is the temple of the holy ghost oh i pray that i would act like it don't you want to be his temple then what happened to everything in the temple had to be purged with blood almost everything touched in the temple had to be sanctified with blood and set apart only for temple worship it couldn't be used for anything else then what about our bodies we're to be set aside and there's you know there'll come a day when that's all we'll do is worship huh that's right we're going to be completely set aside to him but now we sanctify our bodies because this is where he lives and so paul says i keep under my body and bring it under subjection let's have him preach to others i myself would be disapproved i don't do that because god's going to lose me god's going not going to lose me i can't be lost if i've been saved he can't unsave me i'm safe for good but i love him so i flee fornication because i love god i have to god help us flee fornication not because you love your spouse though you should do that but because you love god and then you love your spouse the way you should bodies of genuine christians should be holy i don't mean that you'll never make a mistake but all of your members should be employed in the service of god alone and here paul gives us the reason why he says in first corinthians 6 20 for you are bought with a price you were bought with a price i read another story that of course i did about a a slave a young slave girl that was being auctioned off she was about 20 years old and a beautiful slave girl she was so scared because she didn't know what was going to happen there were two men bidding on her the one man was the worst man in the city the other man looked to be a respectable gentleman they bid and the price kept going up and going up until it reached an astronomical sum and finally the respectable man bought her and they walked over and she started crying because she didn't know what was going to happen he walked over to the place and paid the price he turned around began to sign some papers and she began to cry he said don't cry he said i didn't buy you to keep you i bought you to set you free that's what he did for us then we become a love safe to him we owe him the debt of our life he we are bought with a price he didn't just buy my soul he bought my body i'm going in a resurrection in a rapture he bought me all of me and so i should serve him with all of me not just part of me so i'll bury my whole body in baptism i'll just get sprinkled i'll bury myself with him i'll raise with him when i come up i'll sanctify my life i'll make sure i'll get rid of everything that's not right and i'll let the holy ghost come inside of me and live through me and walk through me and be the life of christ to those around me you are bought with a price don't forget the price that you were bought with when you join yourself to a harlot when you join yourself in fornication to someone outside of marriage when you even have have the appearance of evil of doing that you cheapen the price and deny that god is omniscient in your life and he knows everything reminded me of another story but i won't tell that one you belong to god you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods you belong to god i belong to god not to the devil he paid it a debt he did not owe i owe the debt i could not pay i needed someone to wash my sins away he said therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods not just the soul but your body and your spirit are gods glorify god in them you don't have to tell somebody who really loves god to serve god not to beat them over the head just remind them every now and then they'll go right back to the word huh are you with me why because you're a love slave you're bought with a price he said oh lord i didn't mean to hurt you you know you're getting a little tiff with your wife or your spouse you know the thing there is you never know whose fault it is and it doesn't matter but when we get in an estranged relationship with god we know whose fault it is it's ours and it's not the people it's not everybody around us not anybody else but it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer i'll close with this another story i actually wrote this one down many years ago indian youth would go away in solitude to prepare for manhood an old cherokee legend that one youth hiked into a beautiful valley green with trees bright with flowers he began to fast as he prepared for his vision that would show him what his name was and who he would be as their custom was on the third day he looked up at the surrounding mountains and he noticed one tall rugged peak capped with dazzling snow he says i'll test myself against that mountain he put on his shirt and he threw his blanket over his shoulder and he set off to climb the peak he reached the top he stood on the rim of the world he could see forever his heart swelled with pride here to wrestle at his feet he looked down and he saw a snake before he could move the snake spoke he says the snake says i'm about to die it's too cold for me up here and i'm freezing there's no food and i'm starving put me under your shirt and take me down to the valley no said the youth i am forewarned i know you're kind you're a rattlesnake if i pick you up you'll bite and he says your bite will kill me not so said the snake i will treat you differently if you do this for me you'll be special i won't harm you the youth resisted for a while but it was a very persuasive snake with beautiful markings and last he tucked it under his shirt and carried it down to the valley he laid it gently on the grass and suddenly the snake coiled rattled and leapt up and bit him on the leg and the youth cried but you promised and the snake said this he said you knew what i was when you picked me up flea fornication run from it like i used to run from those water snakes to pond run from it like you saw a box full of spiders or whatever it is that you're scared of run from it or destroy your body and this body doesn't belong to you it belongs to god could we bow our heads heavenly father we thank you for your grace i thank you for the clarity of your word lord i'm always so amazed at how you directed paul to put these things and and just just lay them out for us the way that it should be without being bolder but but yet being firm and and telling us what we needed to know i pray you would help us lord we we don't want to ever fall into the current or just just drifting downstream with the culture of our age years ago some of the things we're talking about weren't so abnormal but today to be a christian is to live a strange lifestyle different from the world to be a message believer today is to is to run counter to the effects of the culture lord help us to do it with all of our heart we know we're swimming upstream and and we get weak sometimes lord but i pray you would send grace and those sufficient amounts that we need in the hour when we need it lord thank you for that oh god i i pray you would forgive me lord if i've done anything or said anything that would would grieve you from my heart i pray you would forgive me lord or these people sitting here and those watching those that will watch lord i pray that every sin would be under under the blood god that we could trust in your grace not being something that just allowed us to do what the world does but something that lets us do what we want to do but it changes our want our desire we're so thankful for that lord where would we be without your grace lord it bad enough what we were until your grace came to us and we make so many mistakes but lord we know you're still god lord i place this in your hands god in this church we've been placed in your hands that i i can't change the culture by myself but i'll stand against the current and swim upstream all the other fish may flow the other way but god i want to swim upstream maybe so with every person that hears this today i pray granted lord and move in our midst walk with us through life lord strengthen us in temptation in the hour of trouble father we pray
