so we're thankful for that Lord I pray you'd move me out of the way for a few minutes and as we go into the communion service I pray you bless Lord each part of it we thank you for those that are here and those that couldn't come I pray you'd help them I pray to heal those that are sick today so many Lord the sick and body myself needing a touch here this this afternoon but I pray God that you just move in a mighty way pardon speak to each and every one of our hearts we pray in Jesus name amen turn with me to Titus Titus Chapter 2 and verses 13 through 15. I won't hold you long at all we've we're going to have communion tonight but not foot washing so we're going to do communion but uh we're several of us are under the weather and me I know me and brother Harvey both are and and uh so we're we're just going to do the communion part and then we've got a wedding rehearsal I think this afternoon some of us do so that'll be uh that'll be good I almost forgot about that we weren't able to have church this morning I hate calling off church but they had to uh power outage here and the power actually come on right about church time but at that point we had had to make a call so so we did that and and uh but I'll be honest with you I probably couldn't have come and stood up here this morning I wasn't uh feeling very good and my wife blessed her heart she's home I can't ever remember Britney staying home from church and the entire time we've been married so she's not feeling well she all remember her in your prayers I know there's just so much sickness going around seems like we all uh coven took over for a couple years now the flu's back so but uh you know God is still a Healer do you believe that uh he's still a Healer he's the same yesterday today and forever and I can feel already and I enjoyed the music so much and several several folks are gone I um Joel is over at Wendell's preaching over there today you remember him he was sick last night and I had to preach two services today and and uh so brother Allen's out with some of the boys out in the woods somewhere and uh so it's just just life you know and and I think brother Stewart and them are have all been sick so but so it's my lot to stand here this afternoon so we're going to suffer through amen so you support me this afternoon and then we'll get through it Titus Chapter 2 and verse 13 looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us aren't you glad that he gave himself for you that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works amen he said these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise me I pray the Lord with that is blessing to the word you may be seated this really isn't much of a sermon but just a thought that I had and I wanted to bring it to you and to those who are watching as well that are at home I often think about the difference between the bride and the church and what it means to be the bride and how we can tell that we are the bride we want to be the bride we don't want to be the Church of this world we want to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and yet you can't make yourself bride my wife could not make herself my bride I had to choose her to be my bride and she had to choose me but we cannot make ourselves the bride of Christ because we didn't have the capacity of choosing it was all Grace and you didn't choose Grace Grace thought you Grace chose you and and it come down to where you were come down to the bar stool or come down to the church or come down to wherever that you were to the family that you were in and Grace picked you up and elevated your life and lifted you up over above the things of the world oh aren't you glad for that Grace today Grace unmerited favor of God that that could bring you up out of all the things of the world and and and you had nothing to do with that and and and and so as we look at the difference between the bride and the church the bride it's grace to the bride there's something that has been given to her she's been chosen and I think about the vision that brother Branham had uh that we know as the preview of the Bride and that Vision that he saw on Friday July 3rd 1964 in Jeffersonville he said and I'm taking this from the Masterpiece the very first time that brother Branham tells us this Vision was two days after he had it and he said July the 3rd I was over here sitting in the center over here shopping the center right out from us here he said I never seen so much gum and filth in my life as I see among some people I wonder what a prophet would think today in the age that we live in and the things that we see we've just gotten used to it and and and become almost almost immune to it but but he looked out there and you can imagine a man who lived the way that he did and and lived in in that realm and that prophetic realm and he's watching these these women and these people and the way that they're acting he said I've never seen so much gum and filth as I see amongst them people he said I sit there till my heart ached and the Lord had gave me a vision he said I fell into a trance and when I did there was somebody with me I want you to notice that there's somebody with me he said I didn't see the person it was just a voice he said I looked and as I looked this way he said the bride will come in view for preview and I looked coming to me it must have been such a refreshing sight for the prophet as he's seen all the the women of the world and coming through that shopping mall and he said I look coming to me and I seen the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women that I've ever seen in my life now there's something about a vision you got to understand he's not seeing the actual people of the Bride he's this is not uh going beyond the curtain of time but this is where he's seeing a symbol a woman or woman who are a symbol of the Bride they they're symbolizing something and and so but he said they were clean dressed and he said they were the most clean dress I'd ever seen in my life now we know that they were symbolizing something because there's men in the bride right we're part of the Bride too and uh but uh but here he saw just women because it's a symbol women are churches and so he said each one of them looked like was dressed different and so that was churches from or women from different parts of the world he said they all had long hair and they were longer sleeves and skirts and so forth he said young women they looked kind of I'd say about maybe 20. he said she was looking right at said the one was the one was talking to me and I was standing together so here's this person this unseen person standing by him and and it was talking to him and the woman or the women were looking at them and he said her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life he said look like it could have been a dozen or more said I just don't know how many was abreast but they were just in a group of them and she passed by sweetly with the air with an air or an attitude or a way that she carried herself and he said and her eyes up watching well I believe this is the hour we need to have our eyes up watching hey man he said watch and pray and you won't enter into temptation he said when you see these things begin to come to pass look up your Redemption draweth night aren't you glad for that this afternoon to hear this bride was walking she had her eyes up watching and so as she passed by oh she was beautiful oh she was beautiful I think we need to looking at ourselves the way God looks at us he said she was beautiful he said I looked at her and as she passed by he said now we shall review he said that's the bride now we will review the churches now he's going to get a different picture he's going to see a different group of people and he said and they they come he said I noticed them coming up and when they come up each one looked like got worse we've seen that haven't we he said I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and then it was pointed out to him and I thought it was interesting that here come a group that was identified by nationality the bride was not identified by nationality they were each one of different nationality dressed in a different way but they were all walking together but these Church were not walking together they were walking according to the nation they come from and so now here here was this American church he said Here Comes the American group he said I heard a noise and that's usually the American group he said Here Comes the American group he said now I am an American but this made me sick he said I'm not eloquent enough in a mixed audience to say what was taking place you'll have to read between the lines when the women were coming the leader of them was a witch I had a great long nose and a great big mouth now again think spiritually it's you know I think about it like this well if that's the way the bride is going to be then all the bride has to be beautiful well there will be ugly people in heaven I'm going to heaven but the Bill's going to heaven I mean praise God you know there will be ugly people in heaven and and uh but but it's a type he sees us as beautiful he sees this as beautiful and here was a woman a great long nose a great big mouth but the random said she was the Council of churches who she was he said and all of them was dressed with some kind of a lower close down here he said but the top just had a strap just a little about a half inch strap that moved up and went around them like this each woman had something on order he said they had something holding below them like this holding below them all this part was exposed and you can't even I the mental picture is just awful that he's drawing and he said Each one had a hair cut up real short and Frizzy looking things all over it like that real short cut hair and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and they were walking with this paper he sent him the vulgarity he said now the paper was what was holding in front of them but when they passed the review stand in the back of them to see the way they were going on in their foremost in their back part and how they were acting I said is that the church oh my and there she went and they were singing this here twist and roll songs you know or ever what you call going down seeing that and going by I said is that the church and I was standing there and in my heart I was crying he said they went off to the left and disappeared in chaos that's that's where we're at church that's where we're at we're we're seeing the church disappear in chaos and still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies one side and then the other side and like that carrying on like that walking and I just started to bow my head now remember there's one standing by him and he said well or he said wait oh my the bride must come again now he goes on to explain that this was the purpose of this Vision By the way was to show that the bride comes twice right and the Alpha and the Omega bride so now he said she must come again the bride must come again and I looked and here they come again and they passed by a sweet looking little lady they was all looking right at me as they passed by and I noticed each one was dressed different and one in the back had kind of long hair hanging down had it rolled around like this might have been German or something like that and I watched them and then as they started leaving two or three of them in the back kind of get out of step and I was going to holler at them and they was trying to get back in Step again it was trying to get back in Step again and I seen them just the vision Fade Out and changed from me now what's the distinction between the two think about it look at the differences between the two here's the bride clean dress no makeup longer sleeves and skirts Walking In step like a lady the church filthy dressed makeup nearly naked dancing to rock and roll two different groups completely right two different groups completely but but what was the one thing that distinguished them was it the clothes was it the music was it the longer sleeves or the longer skirts what's the one thing I think about it because if the bride could be distinguished by long sleeves and long skirts and no makeup the bride would could be the Amish right right could be the old the Holiness people that I grew up with around if that's the bride now are you seeing where I'm where I'm going where I'm what I'm thinking about tonight what was the distinguishing thing because just just that alone and that was who they are but it's it's because they were the bride that they walked like that because they were the bride they dressed like that because they were the bride they marched to that beat that they marched to and and they had that certain uh that that certain air about them because they were the bride oh my and again you can't choose to be the bride you can't make yourself not bride aren't you glad for that by your own stupidity you can't make yourself not the bride I'm so happy for that oh my and so here but here they were marching and and you say well what was the difference now the way they were dressed and carried themselves was a symbol of who they were but it did not make the ultimate difference Now watch how did the prophet know the difference let's go back back to the vision remember someone was standing by his side and as I looked this way he said the bride will come now watch the one standing by his side pointed out this is the bride I think church we need to quit looking at what everybody else says about us we need to quit looking for approval from other groups other people we need to quit looking for approval what does he say what does he say about you not what your friends say about you know what the church says about you not what even the pastor says about you not even what a prophet would say about you but what did he say right he's standing there by the bride and I've never caught this until I begin looking at it the other day because there's this idea that well if I do certain things well I'm going to somehow move myself out of this group into this other group no what he has designated this group is the bride these people are the bride right this is it this is and it's why I get people talk about message people and kind of talk down to message people and I I kind of get uh a little bit uh irritated at that because message people the bride is going to be around the message people you're not gonna get a bride out of the Baptist Church not all the message people are bride but the where's the bride going to come from they got to come from somewhere come out of the message people and so in that group and and so that group's been designated this is the bride he said right he identified who who made a profit of profit in our day he come down and said your message will forerun the coming of the Lord what is it he said oh my that's what we ought to be looking at what happened when you got the Holy Ghost the baptism the Holy Ghost he said you were the bride are you with me now it was a confirmation of your faith he said I'm the bride I don't care what the neighbors say I don't care what the people down the street say I don't care what the people on Facebook say he said I'm the bride are you with me now he said it and and so we should quit looking at what everybody else does and what everybody else says sometimes we look at another group of people and say well you know their sleeves are too short they must not be the bride they sing contemporary songs they must not be the bride they do certain things that we don't do but again those things were not they were what the bride was but what made them bright is he said he identified them as the bride I believe that's what he wants to do how does he do that by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then brother Brandon would put it this way he said if God gave him the baptism of the Holy Ghost then he gave her the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said then he gives the Holy Ghost to those who obey him right so you can't you can't have a conflict between the two you can't say Well they're not they're not worthy they're not no if he gave it to them that's between them and God and so again there may be certain things you could do that would identify you with that church group and certain things that might identify you with that bride group but you got to be careful because when you're looking at this church and you're looking at this bride when you see the ones in the bride getting out of Step you might look at them and say well that's not the bride that's the church but you got to be careful about that because you're talking about his wife right and the bride getting out of step is still bright always will be bride they will never walk over and join that other group one's going up one's going down are you hearing me today that takes all the worry and the scare and the fear out of it and he said I'm the bride God gave me the Holy Ghost I believe the message of my hour wasn't just a feeling or an emotion but he sealed me he sealed me by the Holy Ghost and if he did then I I am the Bride of Jesus Christ if I'm the bride I can't be changed from that into another but preachers will use that you know and and I'll preach it myself because we like to we like to hold our groups together and to do that what we do is we say well you know this other group look at them they they do things that we don't do and so they must not be the bride and really what all the preacher is doing is trying to hold the people in their own group huh but really the bride is who God said I'm so glad he said that in my weakness in my struggles in life when I can't seem to do what I would want to do I I looked the other day I think I've preached all but two Wednesday nights here at the church all year I I've been I've been here and I'm not bragging about that it's just I shouldn't do that it's hard on me physically but that's what we've done and I uh two or three Wednesday nights that I missed all year and I got to are not missed but didn't preach and I got to looking at that and I thought you know uh you know that's I want to do more I want to do better than that and I I feel like I don't I'm inadequate but I'm his bride I belong to him and and in my own inadequacies I I want him to step in and say you're the bride you you are who I came for and that's what he's done so we shouldn't be we come down to communion we shouldn't be afraid to take communion because you can't move from this one group to the other get back in line and take communion get back in line come back to church I don't you're not going to be moved over in this other group you're the bride you belong to God my kids May mess up they may do things that are bad but but you're the bride get back in line I'm never going to put you in this other group oh I don't even have that it's not even enter into my mind that you'd be in this other group God gave me my children to be in the bride hey man oh aren't you glad that you you're a part of that group that's going up right amen now brother Branham talks about Moab and Israel and I'm almost done I'm almost I have to be done but but brother Brown talks about Moab which represents a natural denomination in Israel which represents a spiritual church he talked about how they both offered the same sacrifice and built seven altars and offered a clean sacrifice he said fundamentally they were both exactly the same what was the difference in them fundamentally both right but you see Moab did not have the Vindication of God with them they were only a nation a group of celebrities but Israel had a prophet with them they had a cement and rock with them they had a pillar of fire they had a brass serpent for healing they had the blessings of God moving right along with them and they was the called out children of God and no matter how bad they were they could never be moabites you understand that it could never be moabites no matter how bad they were they were the called out children of God in fact here's what David says about him he said when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong oh you think he cares about his bride today brother Brown would get up and he'd say it's you he said if I held in my hands a charger uh something that contained the actual blood of Jesus he said but I hold him in my hand something more precious he said the purchase of that blood which is greater than the blood itself is the purchase of the blood which is the Bride of Jesus Christ he said he said he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he he reproved Kings for their sake saying touch not mine anointed do my prophets no harm we use that for preachers but he is set for the people of God touch not mine anointed Paul puts it this way who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect God that justifieth brother George Moore last week just brought it so wonderfully how that how that we have a uh we sometimes in our minds we begin to think well I have to work my way into salvation or maybe we get saved and we we're chosen by grace and and we even receive the Holy Ghost but then we begin to think well I need to work my way I need to I need to make myself worthy that you can't make yourself worthy all you can do is just love him what can I do David says how can I return to the Lord what he's given me what can I give what do I have in my possession that I can give back to the Lord I Have Nothing all I have he said I'll pay my vows in the congregation I'll come and worship I'll lift my hands I'll I'll say Lord you're worthy and it won't pay you back but that's what I'll do what I can but I could never repay what he did for me hey man it's what we want to look at now as we go to communion aren't you glad he did it for you don't let any person try to take away your identity in the bride he chose you to hear this message for a reason amen musicians go ahead and come again we'll have the communion service but no foot washing tonight there's healing in communion but the Branham taught us that and I know it's not in the literal bread or the literal wine but in the act of taking communion it builds Faith because you're identifying yourself here at the table I'm a Child of God I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I belong to God that's why you can't take communion at your home by yourself can't wash your own feet because you're identifying the public identification but the Branham calls it a showdown The Showdown you're publicly identifying yourself as a child of God so if the brothers would come and and make that ready and you could play something and I want to read First Corinthians chapter 11. [Music] it says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and for the same manner also he took the cup and he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it and remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup right that he doesn't drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged I'm gonna [Music] or Jesus to see the bread Lord the type of your broken body Lord we're so thankful that we can be whole you were broken so that we could be made whole we're so thankful for that Lord I pray you would bless it I pray you'd remove all sickness all doubt all fear Lord I know that you are the same yesterday today and forever you build up our faith Lord and help us to know that we're the children of God in Jesus name His Name Lord Jesus I hold my hands to the wine which is represents your blood or that blood that was shed for us that is an atonement for our sins I'm so thankful for it today so thankful that you came Lord and you didn't just leave us where you found us but your blood paid the price the art and it didn't just pay it but it also the blood cell was broken the life come back on the believer Lord and it's your life today by your life that we take this and drink this wine Lord and so we ask you to come fill us with your spirit Lord come and meet every need Lord may as the elements flow through our bodies me may your life flow through US Lord May healing come a Salvation come we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you as you come [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] oh I'll see and exchange [Music] to hold it [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] me straight from day me to take oh it will never [Music] lose [Music] oh it's blood and it is [Applause] [Music] it dries all right here [Music] today [Music] [Applause] oh it reaches [Music] Valley [Music] it's the blood that keeps me straight [Music] are you thankful for his power tonight the blood I just turned that song over and Anna's sister ain't as a witness brother being denied to talk but I was going to do that song when we entered the community so brother Ben did get a little bit high but we got through that so let's try um forward dismissed let's sing um oh the blood of Jesus [Music] wash his wife [Music] [Applause] [Music] the blood [Music] Y mouth [Music] [Applause] [Music] love the Power in the Blood people love me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Wonder Woman [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] your passions [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] blood [Music] [Applause] y power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
