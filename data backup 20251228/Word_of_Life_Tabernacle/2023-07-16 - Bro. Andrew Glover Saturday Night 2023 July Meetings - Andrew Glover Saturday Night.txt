your question he said it's because you're reigning here amen and then we're not reigning over a natural physical kingdom here but we're reigning over sin and the devil and unbelief amen I believe this Bride is a powerful people don't you I believe she's reigning over every devil in hell I I'm a firm believer that this Bride is a Victorious bride amen and on the day of the Rapture there won't be one devil will be able to raise its head and say nobody in that bride conquered me and I believe every sickness will be conquered I believe every Temptation I believe every devil in hell will be under the

Galena and I'm going to get in trouble so let's just preach shall we amen if you have your Bibles tonight let's turn to the book of First Thessalonians the fourth chapter the book of First Thessalonians the fourth chapter I want to look in the 13th verse and then I'm going to the book of Colossians 1. I have a bit of a lengthy reading I've heard that'll be okay but I just have some things here tonight I want to share with you and pray that it'll be a blessing to you and an encouragement to you and just before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together and let's ask him to come I believe the word is already anointed but how many would say Lord anoint my faith in your word Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Saturday afternoon Lord we realize that to the world it's a day of relaxation it's a day father to go about their their activities their Pleasures as any other day the Lord standing before me tonight is a group of people Lord that have set themselves aside they've set their time aside Lord they've spent their monies they put forth their efforts to be in these meetings this weekend or they're not here playing church but they're here because there is a deep calling to the deep and that's the noise of the water spouture word said that you would answer so father as we come here tonight Lord we've heard such incredible word from the from the men of God that you've put in this Pulpit this week father our brother Wendell our brother Daryl this morning Lord we have come here tonight Lord as it follows our lot to say something to this group of people Lord only thing I have is this message and I pray Lord that you would send the angels of God into this building tonight you would by that every hindrance you would bring a spirit of unity and Liberty and anointing into this building oh god father may you drive out ever sick ever disease ever ever ever bondage it would hold your people may the word to not deliver your people for you said you sent your word and you healed the people may you encourage the discourage may you lift up the down-hearted father and Lord I pray a special blessing upon our brother being upon this assembly here father upon his family dear God I pray that you would open the windows of heaven and pour him out of blessing Lord to Lord for the things that they've done to do a service unto your people now father we commit this meeting in our hands have your way Among Us Lord May the message of the hour may it be lifted up above every idea tonight may it be lifted up so high dear God that the people cannot even see me the only thing they could see was this word and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it to do thy Wonderful Name the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen first Thessalonians 4 and verse 13. Paul said I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you notice how they say this by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep so Paul is speaking by the word of the Lord concerning the coming of the Lord and then he breaks into it and says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord and Paul says wherefore Comfort one another with these words now in the book of Colossians the first chapter we have just read of the resurrection and the Rapture of of coming from our Lord Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1 and 15 Paul here is writing about the Divine preeminence of Christ and he says in the 15th verse who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in the earth that are visible invisible whether they be Thrones dominions principalities Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist now notice verse 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things not some things but in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all the fullness dwell and having made peace to the blood of his cross now our brother Daryl beautiful he covered the cross this morning didn't he by him to reconcile all things unto himself now by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight now notice verse 23 if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church wherefore I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery somebody say mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now somebody say but now but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of his glory of this mystery among the Gentiles here it is which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach so we're not preaching ourselves we're not preaching our church we're not preaching our personality we're preaching Christ warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus Paul says we're unto also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon how many would say praise the Lord for the reading of the word of God hey man I I love the word of God don't you amen from those scriptures tonight I want you by the help of the Lord to just speak to you here and if I would title this tonight I want to speak to you on the Rapture Revelation taking preeminence in the body the Rapture Revelation taken preeminence in the body now brother Branham says in the token 63 he says I'm looking for a time of a Break Forth how many is looking for that he said of the spirit of God in these last days that we're now living in him he says for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for a rapturing faith amen just before it comes everything is sitting straight in order for that he said and I believe that we're now at the time that the word should have preeminence how many will agree with the prophet we're living in the time when the word should have the preeminence I believe the time Amen to lay our side our Creeds lay aside our faults amen and come back to the word that time is right now that time is not in the future that time is not in the past that time is right now now you may say why would it be so important a meant to lay aside our Creeds and to lay aside our faults amen and come back to the word well the prophet of God said because the word is our headship amen the word is our headship he said the body therefore cannot recognize any other headship but the word see because the head is connected with the body and the head is the word it's the same word it's one headship he said therefore denominations and holy fathers and everything else is dead dung he said there is one headship and that is Christ amen amen there is one body in that body only recognizes amen one thing and that is the word again he says our headship is in heaven now when a prophet's preaching this there is an argument going on is the headship in Rome is the headship here but a prophet identified with the headship of the body is he said the headship of the body is in heaven he said therefore I'm not going to Rome when I die he said I'm going to heaven when I die amen because the headship is in heaven amen I want to say this to you tonight friends our headship is not in Jeffersonville our headship is not in Tucson our headship is not in Tennessee our headship is not in Virginia it's not in come on Church our headship is not in Arkansas our heads our headship is in heaven that if our headship is in heaven wherever the head is amen the body is following the head and wherever the head is there the body will be also amen I want to tell you tonight you may be in some situations that look impossible you may be facing some things it looks like there's no way to change amen but if your headship is in heaven amen lift up your head and remember amen that there is a Rapture coming for the church there is a body change let me say this plane as I know how things will not Remain the way they are always amen but there's a problem promise for a change because our headship is in heaven and if our headship is in heaven we're not headed to hell if our headship is in heaven we're not on our way to the tribulation if our headship is in heaven we're not headed to the battle of Armageddon if our headship is in heaven we are on our way to heaven I think it's high time to remember who we are I think it's time to forget what we've been through and what we've done and remember our headship is in heaven and if the head is recognized then the body will be recognized if the head is glorified then the body will be glorified and whom he is predestinated he is Justified and he's already glorified amen then I'll say to you tonight we do not need feelings we do not need emotions we do not seek sensation we do not need the feeling to get right to take a Rapture the prophet said the bride takes the Rapture by the word the bride takes a Rapture by the word and the headship of the body is the word he said we don't need a credential from some church you don't need a denomination to back you up you need the word to take for Rapture with it you don't need some credential you don't need some long history of some school to be healed this morning you need to accept that word amen the word is what does the work amen you don't need a resume to be recognized as a son or a daughter of God you don't need some preacher backing you to be recognized as a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen but the god of Heaven has come into this generation and he has revealed his word and his word has claimed you listen friends amen you're not accepting this Rapture this Rapture is accepting you you're not working your way into it you're not going to fast your way into it you're not going to pray your way into it come on I'm gonna preach tonight you're not going to read enough books and memorize enough scriptures and get a good Sunday School record going to make this Rapture the only way you'll make this Rapture is if before the foundation of the world your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life and you have been connected to the headship of the body amen I'll say this plain as I know how this world has fallen apart there is a kingdom coming amen I'll go and say it there's not a kingdom coming there's a kingdom here and then there's a bride here amen and she is in power and she's not looking at her problems she's not looking at her sicknesses she's not looking at what's happening around her amen the world conditions has moved her into Focus mode on the Rapture that's the only thing she can think about it's the only thing she can preach about it's the only thing she can pray about amen because there's nowhere else to go for this bride amen but where the head is amen the product of God said it very plain he said then what's going to happen is we're going to be called up together how many is looking forward to that to meet the Lord in the air he said think of it missing people you can't see him no more but you're getting together with the rest of the group amen so this is a group this is a body this is not a big eye and a little you this is a body coming together for translation him he said then we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep see they're not dead amen Christians don't die amen they're just taking a little rest amen seeing the Trump of God shall say them and the dead in Christ shall rise first and appear to many and all at once you happen to look amen and see well there's a brother and you know it ain't going to be long when you see loved ones appearing amen it is a direct evidence that the time of change is upon the church in a few moments will be changed in a moment in the tweaking of an eye amen and to think with all that we have seen in the scripture and the clear-cut vindications of the hour that we're living in it could happen before this service ends tonight well I think that's a good point to shout on Amen that the Rapture is not a Million Miles Away amen it's not in some far-off Galaxy amen but the Rapture could happen right here in party Arkansas and around the world tonight because the word has been fulfilled to bring on Rapture amen just think of that this night the Rapture could take place now when you start talking about this let's say what a prophet said he said we believe there will be a Rapture amen if you don't believe in Rapture a bad place to be tonight we believe there will be a Rapture amen all Christians believe that amen that's Bible readers believe there will be a Rapture so if you're not a Bible reader then we don't know what you're believing but if you're a Bible reader and a student of a prophet we know exactly what you're believing you're believing the word that was in the alpha has come over into the Omega and is manifesting itself for change now many don't believe these things and I can't help they don't believe it and neither can you but because they just don't believe it does not mean I don't have I can't believe it come on now amen if somebody don't want to believe in healing that's fine but I still believe in healing if somebody don't want to believe in real Revelation that's fine amen but I still believe that spiritual Revelation amen is God's provided way a mental weapon devil anywhere Anytime Anyplace under any condition I tell you what we need we don't need a church full of feelings we don't need a church full of gifts we don't need a church Fuller I say so no we need a church full of the word in order by the message of the hour to change our bodies in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I still believe in the gifts I can't help some don't but I thank God he sent a prophet to put him in order there's many Protestants he says that do not believe this they don't believe in the physical Resurrection when the man breaks in this he said Protestants don't believe it he said some Catholics don't he said then that's why I've got to be Full Gospel he said I have to believe what the word says He said now I believe in the literal death and burial and resurrection and second coming all is Christ Jesus I believe that he's fully Christ he's the same Jesus that will return and I believe Amen in the person of the Holy Ghost and he's here now hey amen he's not coming amen he's here now his spirit is here amen his life is moving in the church he said there is a heaven and there is a literal Jesus Christ and that will come into a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth amen that's what God said he said that's what Believers believe you want to know what Believers Believe We Believe amen that some morning between six and nine amen Jesus Christ the son of God will come in a form and he will take his bride away from Old Church we're not sitting back playing church we are on the verge of a body change if there's not a Rapture friends then where are we at what are we doing we're age are we living in what promise do we have can we say what a prophet said there's going to be a Rapture well we might as well shout hallelujah right there there's going to be a Rapture amen and the Bible says there will be and it's only for the elected the elected lady the bride in this last days that's been pulled out of the church that's only going to be a change for the elected lady that's been pulled out of the church I love what a prophet says he said there will be a resurrection of the dead he will confirm it there will be a Rapture of the church how's it going to be I don't know but he'll prove it because his words are true he said there will be a millennium and he'll prove it amen there will be a new heavens and a new Earth and he'll prove it because his word said so are you ready for this and only the righteous will be there only the ones that's been made up part of this word see well their part in their position in this word for this age will be the only ones that will be there so we might as well Rejoice that the enemy is not going to be there our adversary is not going to be there brother Danny's sickness is not going to be there heartache is not going to be there misunderstandings and disagreements and all kinds of confusions it's not going to be there as a matter of fact my Bible says that the righteous is going to walk out upon the ashes of a wicked I'm talking about a bride who has found or placed in the word and there ain't enough devils in hell to back her off of her position she knows where she's going she knows where her headship is her headship is in heaven and she is the image of the word and only the True Believers in his word know this only the True Believers in his word know this and can believe it watch a prophet turn and God helps them to prove it so only a Believer can know it and only God can give you the grace to prove it come on church only a Believer can know the secret sudden catching away of the Bride but only God can give you the grace to prove it that's right amen that is the truth how many would agree with me the time of rapture is at hand Prophet said a man asked me a few moments ago about Su coming in the Rapture we've lived the time out the time of the Rapture is at hand we're looking for a Rapture in faith amen that can pull the church together now that is the basis of Fellowship for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen it's not my idea your idea your direction my Direction but for basis of Fellowship for the Bride of Jesus Christ is the shout of first Thessalonians 4 it's the message to gather the bride he said and give it some Supernatural strength amen that can change the bodies that we live in amen that when light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds they've been the body of Christ somebody say that with me the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken into heaven listen friends there's a gathering happening now but there's also a trumpet Gathering of first Thessalonians 4 do you realize why it's going to be in a moment in the twinkling of an eye because on the morning of the Rapture it's not the Awakening of the Bride it's the Gathering of the Bride the bride was awakened under the seventh Angels Ministry amen but when the seventh angel amen would sound the mystery of gods would be finished and there would be a bride who would be in March and order she with thee back in divine order she would be back on this side of the Victor's March listen friends it could happen right now because the bride by the word is back in position to meet her Lord amen you can now that you can scoff it you can make fun of it but you can't outrun it you can let the devil talk in your ear you can let the devil tell you you'll never make it but the devil's about two here come on that that was about 50 some years too late because the message of the hour is a claiming message it's not an education message it's not a Pentecostal idea the message of the hour is a claiming message that when you hear the message amen William Branham didn't claim you amen I didn't claim you but for word that was being revealed in the season that you're living would claim you I'll tell you what the prophet said he said every child of God that hears these tapes May at that time he said I claim them for the kingdom of God he said upon the basis of knowing this amen it's the word that's being revealed what is claiming the bride is the word that's being revealed come on there's a hundred million people carrying the same Bible you're carrying and they're falling apart they're going come on they're going to the same doctor same schools and their lives are falling apart you know why because they've got the word but in this age under the voice of the seventh angel it would be the return not just of the word but the god of the word in other words we don't just have the word we have the author of the word we have the perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine vindication this message didn't play you didn't claim this message this message claimed you and I'll go and say they didn't claim you on accident it claimed you on purpose I know a lot of fangs tried to claim you amen but suicide couldn't claim you cause the message already claimed you depression couldn't claim you because the message already claimed you amen Brooks tried to claim you but they could not claim you because there was a greater claim of the unmerited favor of almighty God upon your life come on church you can run but you can't hide if he's gonna take you out of here he's gonna do it no matter what the devil does to stop it I want to pronounce to you there is nothing that will stop this Rapture it's already in motion it's already in progress the Rapture is in the church and the church is in the word that'll change your body yes sir this is not just a bunch of getting together and shouting and hollering and running around the building they've been this is claiming message this is revelation claiming time amen you say preacher I think we need to hold back on our meetings well I think we need to have more I think if there's ever been a time to have a meeting amen Now's the Time to have it if there's ever been a time to preach this message amen Now's the Time to preach it you know why because 50 years ago we were talking about it people were preaching it but nobody was understanding it amen but through the maturity of the spirit of God there has come a maturity upon this bride and we're no longer talking about a future Brides Revival we got people standing up in the middle of our meeting say it I am the badge Revival I am the manifestation of the opening of a word in the e-time living in I'm not backing up turning around I'm gonna claim my promises I'm gonna claim my inheritance I'm talking about a people who has been claimed by the revelation of God [Applause] there ain't a marriage coming it's already happened a preacher someday somehow or sometime even the marriage has happened now I'm on Church we're not leaving here and going to a wedding supper we're going to a wedding supper in the skies let me rephrase that we're not leaving here and going to a wedding we're going to a wedding supper you say can you prove that I can invisible Union the prophet of God stood there and married you to that new anointed word listen William Marion Branham the seventh angel preached your wedding ceremony he married you to Christ he introduced you hello church he introduced you as Mrs Jesus Christ he did not introduce you as Miss Baptist he didn't introduce you as Miss Pentecostal he turned you around and said five stars lined up to announce the infancy of the Bride upon the Earth but may I say tonight that bride is no longer an infancy she is in maturity by the revelation of the word of God I'm not crazy I've not lost my mind I've recognized my headship the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready how can you make yourself ready unless there's something to make yourself ready by you cannot make yourself ready unless there's something to prepare yourself by so the same message amen that calls you out as the bride is the same message that will prepare you as the word bride to meet the word groom you say what is this hour this message of the hour probably God said they're getting at is a God's promise of this hour of what he promised to do now I don't know about you but I believe that we're living in the hour of preparation the prophet said something beautiful he said if there ever was a time that the world ought to be preparing for the second coming of Christ is now Junction of time he said Noah was working away he was not only performing a miracle but he was also looking for a miracle he said in the church today as it's laboring away under the task of preaching the gospel with the signs and wonders of following amen they are preparing for a miracle listen what this miracle is it's the Rapture of the church and the going home he said see preparing people getting them alive that's what these meetings are for is to get you light to get you unburdened from the things of the world and get their soul set in the presence of God that when Jesus does appear the second time in glory those who are ready amen will Rapture and be called up together to meet him in the air and be with him now can I take a can I take a holy ghost fist to the devil can I punch the Devils that devil has told you amen that the Rapture some hard he's told you the Rapture something real burdensome but listen to the prophet he said just give me a church that's ready that is visualized to see signs and to see the omnipotent God and the great power of God moving amongst the people he said which the Rapture will be an easy thing when Jesus comes well glory to God somebody say we don't want no signs and wonders in our church then when the Rapture takes place it's going to be hard for you but I'm so preach I'm here amen somebody say well Mark 16 is no longer in action by what Authority do you disqualify the identification of the true church that God claims as his home he said from Genesis to Revelation the True Churches of Mark 16 church I'm on Church you know what happens under Mark 16 a change takes place a sick person becomes well a bound person becomes free oh God hallelujah that's why the Rapture will be an easy thing amen cause some of you know what it's like to be bound and in just a few moments in the presence of God to be released from the bondage and defilement of sin and unbelief of own church we might as well enjoy Mark 16 it's going to change her body because the same God that wrote Mark 16 is the same God that's going to rap to the church [Applause] I'm gonna go ahead and say it we're not gonna start believing the message on the morning of the Rapture we're already believing the message we're already believing the message we're not going to go find the tape on the morning the Rapture brother Stewart the tape found us and the word we heard he claimed their bodies then in other words I can tell you tonight we're not waiting to get ready we're already ready probably God said I don't see anything to hinder the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus outside of the Readiness of the church now we're living in a time where the prophet of God said God is preparing a people which is a body Amen to believe all things Amen in other words it's a time that he's bringing people into adoption now he said now what we need is the spirit of God Amen to raise a standard what is it he's pouring in his Spirit he said now watch the church the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection I love these next words that when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and brother Jeff we go in the Rapture then one of the final signs you will see before the translation of the church is the unity of the of the head and the body to where they become so close that you can't tell them apart come on Church oh that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the church see then the unity of the faith is coming from the word that's why the bride is not preparing amen by end time signs she's not studying Blood Moons she's not come on she's not studying astrology amen she's not all called up and into what this eschatology teacher is saying she has heard a message and that message has notified her of modern events made clear by prophecy and the things that are to be in other words this message is not just the coming of the lord it's the appearing of the Lord he said his Spirit working among them ain't been proven that it's him amen getting them ready for the Rapture for the coming of the Lord if there's ever been a time Amen to cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of Lights he said there the day the time is now this day cause there may not be a tomorrow listen that's why we should let Services just come and go and just be casual and I might as well preach I'm here we we shouldn't just let our church attendance become casual they said we're not denominationals we're not charismatics we're not Dr Dobson followers we're in time message Believers and the word says that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together they've been that much more as you see the day approaching but I'm gonna go ahead and preach since I'm this close to it let's bring back Church attendance and let's make Church attendance great again what about it why don't we make Church attendance amen I know it's on the end of your schedule I know it's something you get to when you ain't got nowhere else to go amen but if you got to catch a word and cancel soccer and cancel football and baseball you ought to make the house of God the preeminence of your family the preeminence of your ministry come on church I think it's time to make good Holy Ghost Field standard living back in the church [Applause] I know hell come on church I know we got to where church is just something here but it shouldn't be it should be our focus it should be our everything [Applause] if you're living under the expectations of rapture then you're not going to be acting like a laodicean claiming the Rapture could happen before the services dismissed well glory to God I feel good you know why I feel good because I'm under the message and the message delivered me from being a laodicea and lukewarm sin loving amen pleasure seeking amen person I have been changed by the revelation of the word I now know that Christ is the principal theme of My Talking he's the principal theme of my preaching he's the principal faith if Christ is not the principal theme of your entire life and tear down the foundation and move your family back on the foundation of the preeminence of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] that's a little straight well I don't think we got straight enough we ought to make the house of God important again [Applause] I know what I'm behind no that's not a person it's a spirit and I'm not afraid of that spirit because it come from the pits of hell and it's going back to the pits of Hell there's going to be a faithful people wellander I don't know well if a Rapture could happen and you got to change your identity from laodicea to word is not going in the rapture she rejected the Rapture she rejected the Revelation she put the Rapture on the outside of her church and still hollers raps forever service but that's what the prophet said he said it could happen amen before this service ends now I'm just gonna I'm gonna deal with this for a second amen because I think we ought to be able to say Amen no matter what the preacher's preaching if it's coming from the message I know we got certain points now we amen and we got certain areas amen but whatever happened to whatever the word come forth we just simply said amen well I don't like it well we still said amen come on man glory to God it's Saturday night and I feel like preaching I think we need to bring our amens back in the house of God when the Holy Ghost comes in the service and begins to cut away sin we ought to say Amen well I'm a preacher for a second amen when God anoints your pastors Amen to stand in the pulpit and to preach against sin and to preach against ungodliness amen come on fathers amen you ought to have a backbone to say Amen [Applause] I know what I'm talking about it's got to work now if a preacher says anything but some little devil comes in and he's out of place he shouldn't say it amen since when did preaching the word in the pup head get out of place if we're going to take a Rapture we're going to take it by the word and the only thing that will prepare us for the Rapture is the word it's got to cut away the Hollywood it's gonna cut away the entertainment it's gonna cut away everything I say oh God cut away everything I want to be Rapture at it I want to be ready for a Rapture if I gotta forsake friendships if I gotta forsake this and forsake that I'm willing to do it God I don't want to miss the change of my body [Applause] we're on the verge of it friends it's in this building right now I'm not a crazy man but for Rapture oh God it's in this building right now the power to change our bodies is in this building right now you know what you're bumping into you're bumping into translation power now listen if we're this close to change let me show you how close the world is to destruction he said we're on the verge of the greatest shaking that the world has ever received they said this one 58 he said the nation is on the verge of going into ashes at any minute at any minute America could be ashes and crater he said listen amen it happened before morning if translation can happen before morning destruction can happen Colby if destruction can hit this nation and before mourning the nation be craters then don't tell me that on a Saturday night meeting that's the power of the Holy Ghost cannot come into a building amen and anointed group of people and change their bodies from the inside out [Applause] Where Do We Go From Here the prophet asks the question where do we go from here he said well there's only one book that'll tell us where to go he said and that's the Bible he said now watch it tells you where you come from it tells you you're here and it tells you where you're going so therefore there oh we want to know we're from here let's take a look at the only book that can tell us the only book that can tell us brother Forrest where we're going at from here is the Bible which is the road map which a prophet identified is the road map from the cradle all the way to the grave but here's the beautiful thing about it brother Danny in the last days there's a people that's not going to go to the Grave thank you there's a people that's not going to go to a funeral home in the last days there's a people who's going to be in authority and Power by the revelation of Christ and she's going to be changed in the moment of The Tweak of an eye but remember said how be he reads John 16 13 I hit it Thursday albeit when he the spirit of Truth has come he will what he will guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself amen but whatsoever he shall hear amen that shall he speak and he will show you thanks to come Robin says in other words Allah says that he'll be the one that will reveal the thing you see in other words the spirit of truth will be the one who reveals the thing you see then he goes to the seventh seal he says in paragraph 43 he says now heavenly father as this goes forward now to preach or teach on this Great Mighty event that take place in glory some 2000 years ago was given to the great beloved Apostle John and tonight we're to speak upon it he said let the Holy Spirit it come forward now somebody say now in his mighty power of a revelation that he might reveal to us the thing which he wants us to know as he has in these last few nights I'll come on the prophet of God right there just dismiss the idea that the seventh seal is not open he said he did it in the previous nights he's going to come into the building tonight in the power of Revelation and he's going to reveal to us the thing that he wants us to know do you know what he was wanting us to know brother window is that the book is already opened he's wanting us to know amen that the Revelation is already available who went there say that wasn't inspired word can I have some Liberty now was it the inspired word of God when he foretold it here sent out yondered Arizona brought it right back even with science everything else and proved it so here's his own words the book is already opened that's right listen his next line just waiting somebody say waiting for the seventh seal to be identified amen of the coming of Christ he did not say waiting for the seventh seal to be opened he said waiting for the seventh seal to be identified which is the coming of Christ now the prophet of God identifies to the church that it was under the third pool that the revelation of those seals which would take preeminence in a body to change the body would be revealed he said first pool was healing second pull was prophesied but that third pool was the opening of the word it was those Mysteries revealed and there's no more high order to reveal the word than prophets and remember remember remember the Third was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that has been sealed in the word and what is the word the word is the headship then the power to change the body was sealed in the head but in order to change the body it's going to come out of the head and it's got to get into the body so God sent a prophet according to Revelation 10 7 to reveal the secrets I hope that devil gets out of here running tonight we ain't looking for the third pull we're in the third pool we're not looking for the revelation of the Rapture we're in the revelation I know what that Devil's done that Devil's brought the Catholicism Spirit right around this message and put everything on the prophet Greater Works on the prophet miracles on the prophet amen but have you can you read come on can you read you know what they say they say well John 14 12 is just brother Branham because it says he will do the Greater Works okay how far are you going to run that because John 5 24 says that he has passed from death and alive and if he is Holy brother Branham then he's the only one that's passed from death but I happen not to be a Catholic I happen to be a Christian and the word says that these signs shall follow them that believe and if there's a thief in your hearts there's a word to believe and there's a people gonna believe it we ain't looking for something we are what's happening we are not looking for Revival we're not pulling from revival we are the rich people the Revival is in us it's in our flesh it's in our bones not a crazy man I'm on the verge of my body changing it's not in the future brother Mark it's right here in this building right now I propose to you our God is not dead my God is not dead he's not brother Joe in the museum he's not in the Tomb in Jerusalem he's not in a grave in Jeffersonville he's right here he's right here tonight I can feel him in my hands I can feel him in my feet I can feel him in my bones I can feel him all over me I can feel the anointing of the revelation of the word breaking out on my body and if it feels this good here What's It Gonna feel like hair you can sit on it but you can't stop it you can criticize us but you won't stop it it's already in motion [Applause] third pull is here direct quote or brother Andrew when squeeze comes persecution sets in let's just say what a prophet said it'll be to the absolutely total loss but it will be for the bride the church come on it'll be to the total loss but it will be for the Bride of the church now can I just I don't I just said as plain as I know how the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord all Bible Believers believe the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord now the kind of the Lord is going to be preached by seventh angel who's going to say now my background of the Rapture is Psalms 27. he's going to read this Asama David the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies in my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell oh thank you God though a whole shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident there is one thing have I desire to the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple are you ready for this for in the time of trouble I had just identified to you the time of rapture in the time of trouble for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion yet come on what was the third pull it was not a public show come on the first pool was a public show the second pull they had impersonator but when it come to that third pool It could only be manifested in a wrong in the heart of the Bride well come on church I know they're hollering world war three I know the world's falling apart but here in Hardy Arkansas and around the world tonight there is a bride who has been gathered under the wings of Jehovah the Great Eagle She's Not Afraid she's not nervous she's not shaken she's not consumed she knows her Lord has hit her now now if you're going to go with me in this secret it's going to be a rock and he said now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore I preach it's sacrifice of Joy I will sing praises of the Lord now y'all know what that rock means that rock means Revelation in other words he's going to pull you he's going to draw you he's going to bless you you're blessed he's going to bless you and he's going to pull you by the revelation of the word now come on people say well we don't need to preach the cross no more brother Daryl well they just all this ain't falling a prophet because the prophet actually made the cross valuable to the church again now let's go ahead and preach there the world made the cross a movie they made the cross a pretty necklace they made the cross a place of something fancy but when a Prophet come on the scene he said it was the place of the atonement for the Bride of Jesus Christ listen friends without this message F out this message we don't even have the least understanding of the Cross of Calvary but because of this message we're not just looking back at what Calvary did two thousand years ago but his brother Daryl said this morning we're looking at what calvary's doing right here in this building this evening because we're not under an education we're under a revelation now the Rapture the end of The Province says is a revelation to her he said the revelation of the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture I'm not going to read all this to you you know him he said it will take a prophet he meant to get the Revelation now he says in Revelation 10 he said I believe those through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for Rapture and Faith because what do we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it he said but we don't know what they are yet but my opinion will be revealed right away and when it do don't you love a prophet's English and when it do it'll give faith for that Rapture and Grace for that church to move out well glory to God it's moving time when the revelation of those seven funders will be revealed to the bride it will be her Exodus papers it will be her leaving Leona see a paper this Revelation is going to move you amen from time back into eternity yes sir we just move everything we know of through all the nominations dispensation we've seen the mysteries of God we've seen the appearing but yet there's something in there he said we just can't lighten ourselves with there's something another he said in the breach I love it now it's going to be brought to us in Revelation somebody say Revelations pray for Revelation more than anything more than a raise on your job more than a better home an Asher car pray for Revelation and from the hand of God by Divine Vindication he said then we have now got the Revelation in the last days for the message of the Lord God to gather his bride together who is his bride his bride is his body so the body of the Bride will be gathered by the revelation of the word in the seventh silly breaks in paragraph 390. he says now do you notice on the opening of the seventh seal it's also a threefold mystery he said the one I will speak and have spoke is a mystery of the seven Thunders he set the seven Thunders will unfold this mystery it'll be right at the coming of Christ because Christ said no one would know when he would return He said did you notice when the Jews asked him they compare the scripture Matthew 24 with the seven seal was left out because see Christ said only God himself knowed not even the angels see no wonder it wasn't even written you see they they hush nothing could take place Angels didn't know it didn't anybody know when he was coming but there'll be seven voices of these Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time now I know people took that quote and said there's going to be seven different men seven different voices but a prophet he he goes right over that and says it's not in one man it's not one man taking each Thunder amen it's the word unveiling itself and sounding Out to the bride he said I believe if we don't know it it won't be no to that time but it will reveal in that day in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in now somebody said with Andrew why are you taking time Amen to lay into these areas because I think we need to remember what we believe I think we believe a message and we ought to preach it come on come on Church y'all know me I'll shout right with you amen but when this child is done and the dancing's finished there's some devils to whip and there's going to be times you don't feel like shouting them Devils down you don't feel like dancing them Devils down but if this Revelation has taken the preeminence into your body there will be a strength it'll rise up on the inside of you and you'll denounce that devil on Monday you'll denounce that devil on Tuesday I'm telling your friends the source of the power to overcome 200 000 000 Devils is coming from the message of the hour the Revelation which when that Revelation comes can I have them okay when that Revelation comes Brother David it's going to unite it's going to bring the head down to the body in other words the body and the head is now one unit I feel like shouting on that one the head and the body is one unit they're no longer separate they become one see who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence look at this word preeminence amen it is to hold the first place it is surpassing all others when this Revelation comes into the body it will take the preeminence it will take the first place oh god promise it like this he said now just be as patient as you can I'm gonna can I read this to you Christ the mystery paragraph 97 be as patient as you can for I feel that in here if God will help me we'll reveal and bring in your mind all these things that I've talked on all through the days of the Tabernacle well I've said what I've said well I have done what I've done this is why when a prophet says that he turns rather than the Colossians 1 and reads verse 15 to verse 29 and then he says God has a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret he said now I Believe by the help of God who is present he will show it to us so William Branham was not presuming he was not standing there by himself pulling from the atmosphere to say something but for God who wrote the Bible was not standing but free foot from him and while he was speaking those seals while he was preaching the Feast of trumpets while he was preaching future home he was not receiving it from a school he was receiving it from the headquarters of the Bride which is heaven he said the first fold is God is going to reveal himself to the people then the second fold is he's going to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in his people the third thing he's going to do is he's going to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that failed by sin by the first Adam amen back to her he walked in the cool evening with the people talked with him and fellowshipped with him listen to me Church Revelation 10 1 there was another I know I'm preaching fast but stay with me if you can and then there was another Mighty Angel there was a mighty Angel come down from heaven and he was clothed in a cloud why did he come down to have his picture taken along no to give you a cover on Life Magazine no to give science something to argue about no the prophet said Life Magazine packed the circle of a cloud and a lot there that they could not understand and don't know it yet he said months before it happened it was told here that he's going to bring the body Believers together when that cloud appeared it was the headship oh God it was the headship coming down to the Earth to bring the body together to reveal to them and to take up the Lost ends in other words he was not Gathering us to fight he was not Gathering us to fuss he was not getting us to have to have this dog well I might as well preach this Revelation come together the bride to unify the bride to where we would all be saying the same thing [Applause] now I know I feel that devil pushing at me right now and I will push back amen you ain't got no thought coming you ain't got no little private interpretation that brother Brandon told brother so and so 50 years ago on a log somewhere I'm not under obligation to preach you're private well I might as well take a sort of that's why we can't even fail a ship no more it's cause we built so many finches and we can't get together and enjoy the Holy Ghost that's why when we get a meeting together a bunch of ideas come in the building and the preacher can't even hardly preach cause a bunch of old Devils sitting in there trying to take over the atmosphere but you know what I think it's time to do I think it's time to take a holy ghost bomb and blow them Devils out of the church and bring the unity of the message of the hour back in the people come on church I know there's a hundred Baptist ideas but there's only one message oh there's 30 Pentecostal ideas but there's only one message I know there's 900 denominations but there's only one message if we are message Believers let's humble ourselves and say what a prophet said and bring a unity in the church we have been babies long enough standing we have been in mature babies long enough well I belong to this amen forget all about it we're a body of Believers it's time to unite ourselves and I know what I'm talking about amen it ain't the people caring the egos that suffer it's the people it's the people listen it's a dangerous spot I got a sword it's the people that Suffer Well you know we ought to do we ought to bury all the nonsense we ought to bury all the nonsense our babies shouldn't be carrying 50 year old fights our babies shouldn't be carrying 30 year old church disagreements we ought to bury them devils and pass down testimonies well brother so and so done this and sister soulans hurt sick hey man let it all go let's bring back the unity of the message of the hour it ain't about me it ain't about you it ain't about your idea it's about Jesus Christ let's worship him let's exalt him let's remember him let's glorify here he's the one that deserves all the priests it ain't about who preached what who went where it's about a message taking the preeminence in a body [Applause] it's a dangerous spot devil you better get out of here people need to know how to go can I preach our babies need to know how to go through things and still come to church and be adults I know what I'm talking about I'm a little disagreement come up and we got Elders acting like babies come on Church our young people need to know that you don't sit there and fold your arms and look around cause somebody hurt your feelings you raise your hands and you bless God and you glorify God and you give him the praise and you kiss his feet and you hug his neck because it ain't about a man it's about Jesus it's about Jesus it's about him it ain't about me it ain't about you it's about a body of believers bury it and let's go forward let the past be the past there's a Rapture to take [Music] [Applause] Miranda you better be careful I will not be careful that spirit it's a spirit of division it's a spirit to divide it's a spirit to conquer and it comes from hell and the pulpit ain't the place to fight with somebody you don't like it's the place to preach the word and if you ain't gonna preach the word sit down and let somebody else that will preach sort cause we've got young people that need the Holy Ghost we got marriages that need to be restored everybody we got Sinners that need to be saved [Applause] we don't need to hear about well so and so let it go [Applause] it feels good to Let It Go it feels good to let it go you know what happens atmospheres changes come on whose side are you on I'll tell you whose side I'm on the words brother Forrest Tucson we gonna take we're gonna take sides with Jesus you can call us what you want to but when the dust settles and the Smoke Clears we're still going to be praising God we're still going to be worshiping God we're still going to be saying hallelujah we're still going to be giving our all because it's about him somebody give him some praise Oh Praise Him in the back Praise Him in the front Praise Him in the foyer let's bring the King of Kings and the Lord of lords back in the church again let's bring Christ the preeminent one let's bring him back in our home let's bring him back in our family let's bring the Revelation back in our pulpits that's very personalities let's bear Egos and let's become a body [Applause] it's out let's go forward now now I think that devil got out of here playing a bunch of babies there's a lot of things there's a lot of things listen there's a lot of things we have to give account for and I'll tell you this much right now I pray to God I never stand before God as a baby who hindered an atmosphere in a meeting [Applause] I pray to God I never stand before God as some immature amen preacher that I thought I was something and I come in a service on a Wednesday and somebody needed a miracle and because of my little feelings and my little comfort zone I set the anointing I say oh God take me off the scene before that happens this is about your people this is about two people it ain't about my Ministry it ain't about our ministry it's about the body thank you don't remember what it was like when we didn't come to church and worry about anything we just come together and praise God I remember brother Joe I remember when the Holy Ghost fell and we danced the building down you know why because we weren't all wadded up and tied up we were free well you know what I think it's time to do I think it's time to get free again I said I think listen they already called me crazy so I'm going to give them something to work with I think it's time to get free again I think it's time to quit arguing about what songs we're seeing and what meetings we go to and who we shake hands with I think it's time to come back to the landmark of the church which is the message of the hour and that Christ Let Jesus Christ [Applause] let him take the preeminence of Our Lives well who you after the devil who you fighting the devil it's time to have church they already talk about me so they might as well keep on it's time to have church I said it's time to have church it it's time to have some good old-fashioned Acts 2 38 holy ghost power purifier anointed Services where the liberty of Jesus Christ were the whatever happened to the glory of God coming in the building and feeling the sanctuary to where the minister couldn't even preach it's time to clean the house I said it's time to clean the house it's time to clean the house it's time to make room for the glory of come again Brother David we need the glory we can do without the pews but we need the glory we can do without a wood pulpin but we gotta have the glory the glory is the only thing brother Joel that'll change the situation is the glory ears the glory is the glory what are you saying preacher I'm saying the glory is here it's time to step into it now I know what I'm talking about I know what I'm talking about here I'm talking about what happened to Unity of the message Unity of the message have you forgot what the church age book said the spirit the prophet and the bride will all be saying the same thing [Applause] you know what I'm talking about it's because ideas have taken preeminence and not for revelation preachers ideas has taken the preeminence and not the Revelation that's why you got so [Applause] well we might as well preach that's why you got doctrines about open-toed shoes come on that's why you got doctrines about all kinds of things hair dye come on say what a prophet said wouldn't that help a lot just say what he said just read question answers and say what he said we don't need your legalism we need the revelation we don't need the way you did it in Pentecost we need the Revelation so let's see what a prophet said thank you now preacher are you taking away our personal convictions by no means but the only thing that belongs in the Pulpit is the word not my personal convictions I've got a lot of personal convictions but I'm not preaching him tonight you know why because my personal convictions is not the headship of the body the headship of the body is the word and the word is in heaven so if I'm going to hold a microphone I'm gonna say what heaven backs up I'm going to say with the angels will come into the building and Trouble the waters when the Rarities preached in the church it's a new day I said it's a new day you know what I say it I said it's time to take the land I'm gonna forget this and just preach it's time to take the land we've stood on the border long enough it's time to go over it's time to go over it's time to go over into where all the promises lay we can fight on the border but we can't fight in the promises know what devil pushing back against me but I ain't scared time to bring the word back in the church it's time to bring Liberty back in the church if you preach this message and do away with the measuring rod [Music] somebody said man today so well ain't nobody hardly preaching on standards no more I said well where are you are they might not be but there are some still doing it oh I know I know that that was all watered up right now but I'm gonna drive him back to hell where he comes from the Revelation has taken the preeminence in the body then the way a prophet said we'd rest is the way we dress [Music] somebody shout out to owe me my amen or something let's go forward what about it Church let's go forward Andrew I'm older you knocking at me by no means am I Knocking At You Caleb was an 80 year old man and he was still a part of a new generation do you know what do you know what separated Caleb from the old Fighters was he followed the preeminent revelation of Moses that's what separated Caleb from all the old Fighters was he forgot what they were fighting about and he remembered what God promised him over the island I would that God denied we would remember what God promised us you know what he promised us he promised us healing he promised us healing he promised us a miracle he promised us a Rapture he promised us a body change he promised us the future home he promised us a new theophany he promised us a new heavens and a new Earth let's forget the fact and remember the promise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you better be careful no it's time to bring the message back it's time to say what a prophet said it'll send a lot of stuff just say it just say it it's not that hard I remember I remember oh you can't say this and you can't say that and I remember when them devils and scarecrows kept me out of the promises but when I saw my name when I heard my name your scarecrow's lost all influence the scarecrow's no longer scared me when I could see a prophet said it I was looking for a Pulpit to repeat it because I think what a prophet said ought to have the preeminent again [Applause] it's the Holy Spirit now I got I gotta get this together and close I'm way off my notes it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken or to make alive those people that's for ordained of God to be in the rapture that's it if he is a true Eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true Eagle it's the Holy Spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message and every promise that's made is yours in your possession and the Holy Spirit is here to Quicken that to you what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see God's Great Holy Spirit here to do that when the Holy Ghost itself is here to Bear a record of this hour Jesus said it's the same yesterday today and forever listen how dare any man wipe that out of there [Applause] you don't want to know what calls to fight is when a man tries to wipe your inheritance out [Applause] a cause to fat is when a man tells you you can't have it is when a man says it's not for you I'm preaching to you is when a man says it ain't yours listen if it's got my name on it [Applause] you know what if you now and never get a revelation of your name then they're always going to threaten you and move you around but if you know who you are if you know who you are their threats don't bother you if you know who you are the devil's Scare Tactics don't bother you if you know who you are you know it's got your name on it oh yeah this is heavy but I'm gonna move it I remember one time I remember one time we went to a went to a here a southern gospel group and it was a place there and there was chairs you can send him a Chad have a ticket well the problem was we didn't get tickets well you know just little church little group there come in there's some good good gospel singing so we didn't get tickets well they had some open chairs in there so when we got there I said hey we ain't got no tickets but then there's open chairs in there can we can we sit down he said well yeah you can go in there and you can sit down he said but the problem is that seat's got a number on it and somebody's got a ticket to it because every seat in the house is sold he said so you can go in there and say it but if somebody shows up and they've got the ticket with that seat number on it you got to get up you gotta move so you know what I did it asked me one song they sang I don't remember you know why because the whole time I sat there I was scared to death I was looking over my shoulder I didn't know when somebody was going to show up and say that's my seat get out of it you can't have it so when I went back for next year to hear them I made sure I had a ticket and you know what I did I enjoyed the singing you know what I didn't do I didn't look over my shoulder I didn't look around me I wasn't worried somebody was going to misplace me because I had a ticket in other words brother I had a right to be in the seat in search of the Living God you have got a token and it's called the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if anybody's got a right you got a right if anybody got a right to dance this ride got a right to dance if anybody got a right to preach these message preachers have got a right to preach ain't no devil gonna put me out cause I got a ticket I'm sealed until the day of my Redemption what do you saying preacher I'm saying in closing the Revelation has taken preeminence you can Huff you can puff but you'll never blow me out of position because doc put me here brother Force when you got a token when you got a ticket they can talk about you they can ridicule you but when you got a seat you can say you can't move me cause I got a token and for years people has been backing off the promises of God but it's a new generation who's got a token and they say devil you ain't backing me out if I want to raise my hands I'm going to raise my hand if I want to stomp my feet I'm going to stomp my feet if I want to stand up and dance a little bit I'm going to dance a little bit because I have got rights in this revelation my mama didn't put me here my daddy didn't put me here my seed put me here my seed put me here from before the foundation of the world [Applause] I'm skipping over a bunch to say this it'll have effect in every member there's one body but there's many members [Music] there's one body but there's many members and some of y'all's a part of this body and you've been in your position for 50 years and you know what we say God bless you don't we don't we thank you God bless you you took your position when situations tried to move you you stayed in position so there's all these seats got to be filled but there's one left empty prophet of God says you wonder why the church is kind of slugging along he said well maybe way over in Seattle there's a little girl born whose name is on the Lamb's Book of Life who is a part of this body who has headship in heaven who you can't leave without who you can't leave humble that's why we need to quit worrying about what everybody's doing and preach the message we gotta find the last seed we gotta get the last name in come on Church there's this chair here who can take it that little girl's the only one that can take it what are you getting that preacher I'm saying this there's a marriage supper of the Lamb and this Revelation is working in your body right now can you give me five minutes how quick does it take not to take it up with you Justin how quick does it take to change how quick does it take for a change to happen just like that A Change can take place how can I get personal here brother Ben I remember a few years ago preaching right here in this church on a Wednesday night what hardly nobody here we was just in here having a Wednesday night me brother Dale I was getting ready to come up with your place and do some turkey hunting amen amen I was just in this Pulpit preaching and I could feel the pressure I could feel the spirits I could feel the enemy I could feel the burn to the people and that devil was pushing against me brother Ben just to quit and close and just close up but you know what I do it I knew my position and I knew this message worked Wesley I knew if I would preach it God would back it up I didn't know when but I knew I was called to preach it and let me just stop here and say this amen if a man will preach the message he won't have to worry about a response [Applause] [Music] oh God I know what guys do they get up and think because they got the microphone they want everybody ought to be screaming and hollering well listen because you didn't take no time to study don't put pressure on us to say Amen to a bunch of nonsense [Applause] we're not obligated to amen nonsense we're obligated to amend the message and then they get up and say well I'm just an inspiration preacher I don't study we can tell you don't because you ain't got nothing to say to feed the bride but if you'll study this message you'll have some fresh Keel you'll have some fresh Manna and you won't be preaching for somebody to scream you'll be preaching to whip and Devils you'll be preaching to bring Liberty into a family you'll be preaching to change the situation preach the message [Applause] oh I know it well well I didn't study much I'm just going to get out and preach by inspiration and we can all tell preach the message it changes situations and right here in that pulpit in this Pulpit preaching feeling the pressures of Hell pushing against me but you know what I did I kept on preaching and brother being you're a witness in just a few seconds of time the Holy Ghost dropped right here in this field you was there with your buddy Brother David you was here that night amen and

walked over there and we opened that door and that door was open and people started walking up here and throwing stuff out you know what happened a change took place brother Danny you know what I didn't do I did not put it in them I only preached a word to activate it listen friends if we'll let this Revelation come in the church it'll change our Notions and it will set our affections on things above and the smoking and the drinking and the gambling all those things is dead and it's beneath you and you are quickened and this quickening power will bring your body into a raptured condition already oh if you can only see what's happening in here tonight brother Danny listen friends we are in Rapture condition we're not waiting to get into Rapture condition we're not trying to fast our way into Rapture condition but the preaching or the message as with the devil in his place and the devil's under our feet and Jesus Christ is our head but somebody Rejoice there's a change

it [Applause] you're in position but you put on that Spirit of immaturity just put your foot on it let our musicians come tonight put your foot on it it's time to you've been positioned by the revelation of the word now there's one head there's one body the head and the body has become one when life is in the head it will be manifested in the body when life comes out of the head into the body the life that's in the head will be manifested in every member of the body [Music] when the Revelation come out of the head of Revelation 10 1. dropped into the body Revelation 10 7 ministered by a prophet came in brotherdale to Revelation 10 8 abroad come and took the book brother Bo the same life that was in the head preeminence in the foot had preeminence in the hand had preeminence in the tongue had preeminence in the eyes had preeminence in the feet in the legs y'all got to forgive me but I believe that this I believe that this message has built a body for the rapture I believe this message has built a body for the rapture the entire body is in position for Rapture problem of God said this church will have to be a word he said this church will have to be a word abiding Church whereas God was once manifested here it is y'all y'all forgive me tonight [Music] he said where God was once manifested in one member that Revelation the first fold he said is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once it was manifested and one member even our Lord Jesus Christ watch a prophet cross the mystery he said and to be sure that the whole Rapture now Luther was a part Wesley was a part the prophet was apart but just in the Revelation that they was making up the body the feet the toes the arms so forth until the head he said see that makes the entire Rapture it's the body of the word which is Christ if he abide in me and my word in you ask what you will because you are you ready for this you and the word are the same amen you and the word are the same he has the preeminence he's got the rulership you're a prisoner to him the world is dead you see the rest of people living the way they do but yet you do not do it see you're yoked with him and his yoke is easy your yoked with Christ his word see now now y'all y'all remember a few minutes ago in the spirit Lord come in here and take a sword of that Spirit of division listen to the prophet now what are you going to do when you get the whole group together we're going to sit around fuss in Oregon fight debate and pick and take criticize and put down it no when you get the whole group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God is expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day it will one day then the Rapture will go [Applause] see what this message did it come to bring us together in unity [Music] where it's not my Ministry or your ministry it's church or this idea having the headship of the body but with a word has the preeminence once you stand to your feet with us tonight those of you that those of you that are here tonight you know you know you know the power of this message [Music] now listen God knows my heart I will not be a politician I will be a preacher and I will say what a prophet said and I will say for the sake of our families for the sake of our young people say what a prophet said let's quit shooting back and forth and killing innocent people with Crossfire can we do it too many Crossfire casualties yeah right we got a disagreement let's be a man sit down and fix it but when it comes to the pulpit let's say what a prophet said listen I believe it's time for change I believe it's time for change I believe it's time I believe it's time I believe the rapture's only spiritual bodies in a Rapture condition how many tonight would say Lord let this start with me [Music] let this start with me preachers Deacons trustees musicians pastors Sunday school teachers musicians or a body or the narrower body let it start with me let me become a prisoner to this word now listen I know this may not be shout material but it's the truth how many would say let me move into that maturity of the word [Music] let me you say preacher who you after I'm after the devil I'm after the devil he's so Discord he's divided long enough and I think it's time somebody take a sword of that Devil's Head and preach a message it'll bring Liberty and I believe I'm looking at people that's manifesting that Unity time for change time for change leave it outside but when it comes in here let's have church can you go to your church have church [Music] just just get together and have church just love God believe the message study what a prophet time God knows my heart tonight this is where I want to be as we buy our hearts tonight [Music] it's time it's time for the revelation of this rapture to take the preeminence in the body when this Revelation Rapture takes the preeminence it will surpass it'll be superior it'll be dominant it'll be it'll be rulership over anything contrary to this word now listen I know tonight there's a there's a sweet presence of the holy spirit in this building and I say tonight I want you to just turn and we're going to have a prayer here tonight I don't want you to lay your hand on someone next to you brother to
