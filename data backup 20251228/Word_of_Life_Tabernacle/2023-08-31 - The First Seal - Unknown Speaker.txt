========================================

e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e at the end time and so we know where we're at and you can go and and find all of those scriptures I'm sure that you're familiar with them now in in in Revelation when this uh when John sees the seal when the seal opens he sees it in symbol form and that's the way it was revealed to that early church was in symbol form because because it had to be in a form it wasn't time yet for it to be in its reality form it had to be in symbol and so he sees a white horse riding and he sees one that set on him he didn't know who he was he had a bow and he had a crown or crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so but this had to be known in reality before the end so we know he said I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals I heard as it work the noise of Thunder we know that the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened I you know if people would really listen to the seals and especially this and I encourage you to do that we're going through this if you have the time I would encourage you to listen to the seals that uh we know that the Thunder shouldn't be a mystery to us because the Thunder is just God speaking in a form that people can't understand but once he it is understood it's no longer a thunder it's a voice right it's God speaking in a way that we could not understand but by the message of the hour we understand it so brother Bram told us that the seven thunders of Revelation 10 he said are the Mysteries contained in the seals Revelation 62 uh he said I I Behold a white horse and he that set on him had a bow a crown was given unto him he went forth conquering and to conquer now brother brandom tells us what that white horse means he said what does the white horse mean he said here's where the Revelation come because this this is where all the different theories were on what that was it it represented something and so everybody had a different idea now people understood down Through the Ages that white means righteous so so they thought that this would be the church or that it would be God and in fact one and I've actually read the commentary and evidently brother brandham did too because he references it he said there was a commentary uh that said that it was like cupid shooting his bow of love and so that was the bow that the one had and but you know all no one knew right so but Gabe you had to you had to guess at what it was right but now we we've been and listen to me you've got to believe in a in a in a Vindicated prophet in our day or you could still be guessing about that but if you do believe in a Vindicated prophet and trusting that you do tonight we believe this has been revealed in our day and we believe it fits with the rest of the scripture sir so white means righteous so brother brandham says the teachers taught it that it was the Holy Spirit conquering in the first age but my Revelation by the holy spirit is not that way and so brother brandom taught us and and I'm doing this for a reason going through quickly because there's a lot to get to and I'm going to do it in one night and I'm not going to keep you long so we'll just we'll just that praise God I I kept my word Sunday night and I'm going to try to keep my word tonight so the someone said Hallelujah so brother bandam said here's the lamb and there's the white horse rider now think how simple this is right look at a prophet standing there he said here's the lamb opening the seals and there's the white horse rider now there's only one God right one God three manifestations or three attributes of that God and so this the godhead is key to understanding the first seal because you understand that he couldn't be the right rer that was riding if he was standing there opening the seal that's what brother brandham said now so and I would say this that understanding the godhead is crucial to understanding the message in its entirety you need to know that's that's the the very first commandment here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord right so that's the very first thing we have to understand so he said here's the lamb there's the white horse rider so it's one God and so we know that how could Christ to be out there the White Horse conquering and standing here with a book in his hand he said it isn't though it isn't Christ because we find Christ not seen until the 19th Chapter but it must be something mimicking Christ because it is writing a white horse or it appears to be a righteous thing so it's not like the other horses that come after it the red horse the black horse but this appears to be righteous and so we find that Christ does ride a white horse he does ride one but not till Revelation 19 let's go there Revelation 1911 I saw heaven open Behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful aren't you glad he's faithful tonight and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire on his head were many crowns he had a name written no man knew but he himself and there's something very important there and I don't have time to get to it tonight but there's a great significance in a name name change brother BR said he was Redeemer while he was on the Earth but when he become the mighty conqueror he had a name change right he's still Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ but he he changes his what he's doing he becomes the mighty oh my listen church we have a change in this hour there's been a change come there's been an identification given to us in the opening of the word if we could just grab a hold of that tonight it means that we can overcome we don't have to we don't have to be confused we don't have to be muddled we don't have to be like all other ages have been but this is the age of the Overcomer this is the age when our name has been changed we're not a victim anymore we're a Victor now so I'll just leave that there but Revelation 19:13 he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood his name is called the word of God that's where our Victory is faith in the word as we preached Sunday faith is the victory that overcomes the world but it's faith in something faith in the word that's what his name is called the word of God verse 14 and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean oh I love this it's not just him on a white horse but it's the armies in heaven who is that that's us right we went up in the Rapture can you identify yourself there tonight it's easy to identify yourself as sick or or or hurt or or or depressed or something like that but can you identify yourself on a white horse riding back you said brother been explain that white horse I don't know I don't know I may be a literal literal White Horse it may be a it may be a spiritual White Horse I don't know what it is but I know I'll be on one I can identify myself with that statement are you with me now the armies which were in heaven you got to be able to see yourself in the word and that requires looking up above these circumstances of life and saying I'm on one of those those white horses yes so and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations notice the differences between him and the writer of Revelation five sir Revelation six he shall rule them with a rod of iron he treadeth The Wine Press of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty God and he hath on his vesture and on his thy a name written king of kings and Lord of lords oh my he's coming back he's not coming this time to be cruci IFI again but he's coming this time to be Lord over the Earth Amen to be to reign as son of David so he said there comes the Messiah there he is not this fellow on this horse back here he said and notice Christ has not seen anymore from this time there but he's on a white horse so if this guy's riding a white horse he's an impersonator of Christ right so he's an impersonator I think even our our little ones our children should be able to understand that he said notice the rider on the White Horse doesn't have any name he might use two or three titles see but he doesn't got any name right but Christ has a name what was it the word of God that's what it is in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word made flesh he said now he's got a name that no man knows but he's called the word of God this guy isn't called nothing but he's on a White Horse He said the rider has no arrows for his bow now watch how brother brandom under that prophetic revelation it was revealed to him that day and he goes and preaches it that night he said the rider has no arrows for his bow did you notice he had a bow but there's nothing said about having any arrows so he must be a bluffer he says he he's a bluff oh that ought to give us conviction and courage tonight he's a bluff as the old saying is how do you know he's lying when he whenever he says he's lying CU he's a liar when he opens his mouth he's lying I always get those those things turned around but when he when he opens his mouth just like a lawyer whenever he opens his mouth he lies right but but just remember that he's a bluff that's all he is he said maybe he's got a lot of thunder and no lightning like the Indian chief said about the about the preacher got done preaching they said how'd he do chief he said well I had lots of Thunder but no lightning said but you find out Christ had both lightning and Thunder for out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword and he smites the nations with it he said this guy can't Smite nothing now think about it we give him too much credit sometimes oh he's a good devil but he's just a love he's been DET toothed if I could say it that way he the devil looks like a meth addict he's out there he got no teeth man he he just can't he can't do nothing he can't can't bite down on you he can't why because he he got kicked in the teeth by the that's terrible illustration he got forgive me for that strike that from the record he got kicked in the teeth by by Jesus at Calvary do you believe that huh he had the keys to his own house taken away from him there's a better one am man kick Satan back in the back in the pits of hell where he came from right so so here this guy's a bluff he can't Smite anything who is this mysterious writer that starts forth in the first church and rides Plum out on out into eternity and goes to the end the second seal he said comes forth and goes right out into the end now this is important especially for us older ones so we'll understand now the seals are not like the church ages Church ages so much time it's in age when it's over it bleeds into the other age but but there's there's a time you can put a date on it more or less right you can't do that with the seals because even each one of these four horse riders Blends on out goes all the way out so you'll find that his he is identified he's still riding his White Horse he's still riding his red horse he's still riding his black horse he's still riding his Pale Horse and you can see that in the world today so the second seal comes forth goes right out into the end the third seal comes forth and goes right out into the end so when you have somebody ask you and say something like this well what which seal are we in well they don't understand the seals right because that's not how the seals work right but but there is a there is a truth that there's certain ones that relate to the time that we live in I'll just go ahead and say it here because this where I want to go when we get to the end of all of this is the seventh seal is the seal brother BR said that was the mystery of going that's the one I really relate to right because because we're going home that's the Rapture now now he he talks about that and he said at the end time these books that's been rolled up all this time because it would be a scroll not a book like this it's a scroll and it's sealed with a seal and then when the seal is broke you can read what's in the scroll he said what's been rolled up all this time with these mysteries in them it's broken he said then out comes the Mysteries to see what it is he said but actually they started forth at the first church age so even the if you could say it this way the seals began to be revealed at the first church age so this is not happening in in 60 minutes right the you're watching a a drama over time the lamb taking the book The Bloody lamb standing there you're not you're watching a representation of something so it's not happening just in somebody say Well it happened on a certain day well he said here that uh it started forth at the first church age because the church the first church age received the message like this he said a white horse rider went out so who is he they saw it in symbol form he is mighty in his conquering power he's a great fellow in his conquering power you want me to tell you who he is he is the Antichrist you say well I thought the Antichrist was coming and he was going to be uh like that guy on Left Behind you know some kind of Superman well he is a superman but the Antichrist has been here since since Jesus left right Judas was with Jesus brother they come about the same time leave about the same time when the Holy Ghost came down the Antichrist Spirit came down right so that that's what we're dealing with right now world what we've been dealing with yes sir for a long time I'll show you that in just a moment but one day the Antichrist will come incarnate in a person right but but right now it's the spirit now he said he's the Antichrist exactly what it is now because you see if in Antichrist Jesus said the two would be so close together it would deceive the very elected the bride if it was possible I'm glad that if is there he said it's the Antichrist Spirit which he also identified as a nickan spirit right that Antichrist Spirit Pres presented itself as a nician spirit in the church nician was to conquer the Ley in other words to make it where it was just the preacher just the priest just just the pope and the people had nothing to do with it they didn't have to live it they didn't have to worship they weren't a part of anything listen that Spirit still exists today yes sir right and so it put everything in the denomination or put everything in one man instead of it being a body move but we are the body of Jesus Christ so it was a Nichol in the spirit and then later on that Spirit was crowned he was given a crown he said later he was given a crown he said three of them three on one and that was the crown that the pope had he said that was 300 years later at the NAA Council he said when he started out a spirit of nickan to form an organization among the people and then it kept on going on going on became a saying it become a Doctrine but look but look at this nicolan spirit in in Revelation 2:6 here he he speaks in Revelation 2:6 and he he says but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians so in other words a deed is is a work or a Duty or a task it refers to a task that is accomplished by someone so he says you hate the Deeds of the nicians you hate the works that's all it was they didn't even say it yet they just did it right now you look at any type of of false doctrine that comes in the church it comes in this way first it becomes Deeds it just becomes uh you know before people say they don't believe in church anymore they start hanging out of church and then it becomes a Doctrine they don't even believe in it anymore pretty soon we don't need preachers we don't need anything else and I'll be honest with you I'll be glad when we don't need preachers but that day is not yet CU as long as we got sick people we still need somebody to pray for them as long as we and we can pray for one another but as long as we still got as long as we still got people that need instruction in the house of God there's still a preacher to to give that instruction until we all come in the unity of the faith and I believe that's the moment that we're getting ready to go home amen that's the time that'll happen now so the the Deeds of the nickan is just the way that it acts but the doctrine of the nicians is uh the doctrine of the nicians is actually when it comes becomes a Doctrine and they begin to tell what it is so in one Church age it's deeds in another church age it's a Doctrine he said which thing I hate Doctrine is the actor content of teaching it's instruction so brother bam says this he said he was trying to conquer take the Holy Spirit to just only one holy man he could forgive all the sins and everything do you see why the devil would try to take the message right back to that right and he'll he'll try to take you back to that as an individual where you have so much confidence in one man and it becomes a nickan spirit because you you think well if I could get to that man he he could could tell me what was wrong if I could get that man he could forgive all my sins but even a gift like brother brandom's God didn't leave him on the earth he took him home and his work was finished I just read where he said that today in this first seal he said when my work when I'm done he said that means my when I when I pass away that means my work is finished amen so now he said he's today he said where is he today he said today he's under the disguising of a white horse he said watch how he changes from that white horse in a few minutes he don't only become a white horse he becomes a beast with many heads and horns he had no Crown to start with but he got a crown later when that Spirit became incarnate he become a man Nic and Doctrine become a man then they could crown him he said they couldn't do it because he was just a Doctrine he said and when I love this and when this Holy Spirit now listen that we have how many have the Holy Spirit tonight one day that holy spirit that you have will be crowned right it'll be a person the one that's in our midst now in the form of the Holy Ghost becomes incarnate to us in the person of Jesus Christ we'll crown him King of Kings brother Joe you can't tell me I'm not going to see him I believe with all of my heart I'm going to see him I'm going to see him in the flesh why because the Holy Spirit that's in me becomes a person amen and so brother random taught us he said there is a and there is a literal Jesus Christ that'll come in a body form and catch his but Bri away he said that's what Believers believe so in in the early church this Antichrist Spirit began to creep in are you still with me tonight sir so John in 1 John 218 said little children it is the last time and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come even now there are many Antichrist right many and everybody's worried about the Antichrist coming but they don't understand there there's many antichrists he said whereby we know that it is the last time so he come in he doesn't come in as an antichrist as like a warrior come in uh trying to take over but he comes in peaceably and then he is crowned and he tries to do the same thing in our life right he presents himself as a white horse now here's a way you can apply this to your life he presents himself as a white horse every every idea Satan gives you to try to take you away from God looks like a good thing it always looks good that's what his job is to make it look good he even presents himself as an angel of Light but we have to judge it by the word that's right so he comes in peaceably and then he's crowned so and then he tries to do the same thing he'll come in peaceably try to make you think you don't oh you don't need that there's no reason to do that but then later on he crowns himself and then you say how did I end up with all this depression and fear and anxiet all these things well he come in peaceably and then he was crowned amen Daniel 11:21 in his estate now he's talking about this Antichrist that would come in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honor of the Kingdom but he shall come in what peaceably obtain the kingdom by flatteries trying to make you feel good about yourself right and that's the religion we the world has today that's what Daniel said this Antichrist would do he will fit the people's Place it'll fit their menu for this day I'm glad I'm an eagle I'm glad I'm an eagle I'm glad I don't want a Leo to see and menu every time I go to the go to church I'm not sitting down waiting aan menu is is is make me happy uh make me happy make me satisfied tell me I'm okay but that's not what the bride of Christ wants we want the word the bride feeds on the word of God Amen so now he this Antichrist system fits a lean menu but God has promised that when the word is refused that then people will be given over to their desires and then Antichrist to become incarnate and be Crown so now look he said he'll fit in the people's place they in this church age they don't want the word Christ but they want Church 1 Thessalonians 2:9 he said even him Who coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and them that perish because oh church if I could get you to understand how important it is for you to love the message I don't mean to love brother brandom I don't mean that at all although I believe you should love brother brandham but I don't that's not what I mean I don't mean to love uh to love where brother Bram lived and and love what he did and and the story of his life I mean for you to love the message because the message is Christ love the word sir love the word they receive not the love of the truth and so they flow into an antichrist system but we receive the love of the truth and we will not be deceived by the Antichrist system are you with me now yes for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie brother says that God said if they want it I'll just let them have it and I'll actually make them believe that that's the truth cuz I'll give them a reprobate mind concerning the truth like Janice and jambus who whed Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith if he said they want it they want it so they'll get leaders that'll lead them that direction he said now you see where it's at not only Catholic but Protestant it's the whole thing he said it's all the whole organized world we get hung up on Catholic but that is a that is such a strong but it's such an obvious Spirit but it's the whole organized world the whole Cosmos it's all one now right it's all come together so it's it's a one world religion if we can say it that way and it'll become even more and more that as we go along uh as as as we get closer and closer to the end which I believe we're right there he said that's that white horse rider he said under the way of white Righteousness Church but an antichrist he started riding in the first church age now he rides on down on down through every age look how he got started swell celebrity people fine dress Highly Educated polish didn't want all that carrying on in the church no they don't want all that holy ghost stuff and he said he gave them their desire God will never force you to worship him that's something brother bam teach teaches us in this first seal God will not force you to worship him if you don't want to tally up to God's way of living in things and worship you don't have to do it we are never going to meet you at the door and make sure you worship God Don't force you to worship him but but listen to what he says he says let me tell you something if your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he said you'll be so happy to do it you can't wait for the minute to do it God Don't Make nobody do it so this Antichrist and I'm hurrying along here but I hope you catch it as I'm hurrying he's the prince that was to destroy Daniel's people Daniel 9:26 after three score in two weeks shami be cut off not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined the people of the prince that shall come the brandom said was the Romans Rome destroyed Jerusalem right that happened in 70 AD with Titus so that's the people of the prin that shall come verse 27 he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week in the midst of the week so this is what he's going to do the same Roman Spirit right the same thing this is Antichrist now at the end time he's going to confirm the Covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of Abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determin shall be poured upon the desolate you might say brother Ben aren't you worried about the about the division and thing in things in politics today uh well that is a concern but it's more a concern when they come together the things they agree on is what I'm really worried about when you begin to see the political parties becoming one when you begin to see the churches becoming one but also behind the scenes there's a bride uniting with the word we're becoming one with Jesus Christ so now he said we got our picture and know that he is Rome he says and we know that he's a white horse rider we know he went forth as a Doctrine he said then what was Pagan Rome converted into Papa Rome and Crown he said now watch in the end time not in the early days when Christ was preaching but in the end time in the last part of the week we just took the 70 weeks of Daniel and Christ just prophesied for the three and 1/2 years three and one2 years are yet determined and this prince in that time is to make a covenant with Daniel's people which is the Jews he said that's when the bride is taken out now she won't see it so if you're looking for that I'm sorry to tell you you're going to miss that event right there's not going to be an event that you can see to get you ready for the Rapture I hate to disabuse you of that notion but it's the truth in a moment in a twinkling of an eye in an hour that you think not when everyone says peace and safety when everything seems to be going good when life seems to be going like normal that's the hour it takes place in right and that's why we plant our potatoes brother Allen was talking about finances why would you do a finances class when the world looks like it does because we don't know what hour it might be everything might go good now that's just the scripture there's not necessarily going to be a difficult time there may be and there may not be you say well brother Ben there'll come a day we have to struggle for our food that might be the case that is the case in most nations in the world we just forget how privileged we are but that's not the tribulation right it's going to be much worse than that much much worse you don't want to be here for that time he said she won't see it so he makes a money Covenant I don't have time to get into this tonight maybe we will be able to later but he talks about the gold and the currency from Rome and from Wall Street and how he would make a money Covenant and and once he got a hold of the money he would break the Covenant so in Daniel 8:23 it says in the latter time of their Kingdom when the transgressors are come to the fold look around that's where you're living a king of fierce countenance understanding dark sentences he'll seem like a genius shall stand stand up and his power shall be Mighty but not by his own power he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practice and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people and through his policy also he shall cause craft brother brand said that's manufacturing he'll be good for the economy right man manufacturing will prosper in his hand he shall magnify himself in his his heart listen and by peace so he's not a Vladimir Putin right who kills his enemies right not some guy with some kind of weird Star Wars powers that he can grab a hold of his enemies by the neck and and throttle them something like that yall know what I'm talking about huh except for Joel he don't know but the rest of you know huh but he's not some guy that that can just just telepathically destroy that be how he comes in right he does kill people later on but in the first half of that three and a half years he comes in peaceably he's doing it right now right right now that Spirit I'm not saying the man as he may be but that spirit is here he's doing it right now by peace shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince of princes I love this but he shall be broken without hand that means without the hands of a man remember the vision that Daniel had of the Gentile World kingdoms that Nebuchadnezzar had rather the dream Nebuchadnezzar had and Daniel sees it by vision and he tells him the H the meaning of his dream and he said there was a stone cut out of the mountain without hands and it come and he said it turned it into powder it destroyed it what is it that same thing destroys that Antichrist system he will stand up against the prince of princes but he shall be broken without the hands of a man yes sir now he's going to hold the money the brand said that's where I think it'll come in he said when he gets all the money all under control he'll break this Covenant with the Jews and in the midst of the last half of the 70 weeks of Daniel you'll have all the world trade and the Commerce are packed with the world he hold the wealth of the world completely and that's when the two prophets come they begin to prophesy and they dance in the streets CU they die and everybody sees them which is only possible in this age because of social media where everybody rejoices at two people dying wasn't even possible a few years ago right but everybody's going to watch it and everybody's going to everybody's going to Rejoice over it but we'll be gone church it's not fiction this is truth I can't tell you exactly how it's going to happen but this is coming we can see it coming now and the Great Dragon was cast out now brother Brown said thank God the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory and we won't have to go through that amen he said the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out on the earth his angels were cast out with you brother BR said the church is taken up and Satan is cast out when the church goes up Satan comes down then Satan incarnates himself in the Antichrist he's called the beast then in Revelation 13 He sets the mark down you don't have to worry about taking the mark of the beast the mark of the beast is already here right to do the will right of that Antichrist system and to and to have the market in the head and in the hand it's already here but yet it'll come in a literal form one day where people won't be able to buy or sell but again how do I escape that what what what plan should I use to get over that where should I hide where should I live so that I can I can make a living in in spite of the mark of the beast I'll tell you where you need to live I'll tell you what you need to eat you need to live in heaven and eat at the marriage supper of the Lamb that's the way to overcome it because no amount of preparation is going to overcome this beat system the truth is if you're here somehow you missed it I wonder if you won't be deceived by it think about it it won't you won't think it's what it is there will be some we know there will be some that'll be in fact there'll be quite a few fool what we call foolish virgin waited to too late but they'll recognize it's wrong I question I don't know if that's message people or not i' I've always battled that in my mind I don't know I I don't know I I question sometimes whether we know too much I want to believe that we're all a bride don't you I want to believe that everybody I preached to his bride we'll just let it go with that go to the wedding supper I'd rather eat that than rations anyway now so the church has taken up Satan is cast down the mystery but but that mystery of iniquity already works but the Bible says only he who now lth will let other words the one that's hindering the Antichrist from taking over is the holy spirit oh my until he be taken out of the way when the Holy Spirit lifts off the Earth that's when we're taken off of the earth when he that led it he said the only Christianity is left on the Earth the only Christianity that's left on the earth in its Purity is because him that lth by the holy Spirit that's the only way we can we can have pure Christianity so this Antichrist system comes I'm closing in just a moment he comes with the Antichrist with the false prophet with the Beast he comes in three stages first stage he's Antichrist second stage he's the false prophet third stage he's called the beast and this writer is nothing but Satan's Superman the Incarnate Devil he's an educated genius so not any of the politicians we have out there today I wouldn't think amen yeah but if you listen to our current pope he's pretty educated I don't know I wonder sometimes well the Brandon pointed to the Kennedy debate you know that he pointed to politics he said there's one of his sons he pointed to that debate how well Kennedy did in that debate and he said that he's an educated genius like Kennedy right he said we wanted a Superman we got one he said the whole world is wanting a Superman they're going to get it he said just wait till the church goes up and Satan is cast out he'll incarnate and he will conquer every religion of the world every one of them cuz they're all they've all g into the confederation of churches and the world Confederation of churches they already got their buildings built everything setting right in line there ain't one thing left every denomination is stuck right into it the Federation of churches what's backing it Rome and the pope is now crying we're all one let's come together and walk together what do we have now that brother bam didn't have in his day inter denominational churches there were very few of them in brother Brand's time some of you are old enough to remember there weren't near as many but today they don't call themselves Baptists or Methodist what do they call themselves what what what Blasphemous name I get myself in trouble the people give themselves today well they give themselves a name but it's like I I saw one that was like The Happening Church there's one we passed on the way to Springfield courageous Church they may be fine people but it's but they give themselves another name they they hide their identity why because they want everybody to come in and if you go in the music's all the same the preaching's all the same everything's all the same you can't tell B Baptist from Methodist from calvinist from Armenian you can't tell the difference in most denomination you can go to a Methodist Church and listen to praise and worship music why why why why is that coming in our time well they all got to become one religion right he said these people even some of you Full Gospel people deny have to deny your Evangelical teaching to take such a step as that he said what have you done so blind to that denominational thing you've rejected the truth and truth was set before them and they walked away from it and left it now they've been given over to a strong delusion to believe a lie and be D with that's exactly what it is we talked about that with Deus sharan and them he said Deus has forsaken me Deus sharan Finance William brandham and Joel ost's father and and the direct connection between that move movement brother brand was preaching to those men and there's a direct connection between that and the modern movement of Kenneth Copeland and those who went to Rome I think I put a picture of that on there it went to Rome and prayed in tongues over the pope what was it it's a sign of judgment they thought it was a great spiritual time and they couldn't understand that it was a sign of judgment this happened just a a couple years ago Church where are we at where we've seen an actual fulfillment of Prophecy brother Brown said the Antichrist takes it all someone say all and the Bible said he deceived all a upon the face of the Earth whose names were not written under those seals from the foundation of the world now notice he'll conquer and almost has in his grip right now while he is still Antichrist before he becomes a beast you talk about cruel punishment you just wait watch what them that's left here on Earth will have to go through with and the real Church would go through that if it was possible but you see they are done under this Blood by the grace of Christ oh I love it and cannot go through any tribulation they have no tribulation period the Jews have a Jacob's trouble the the the foolish virgin have a tribulation period the world has a tribulation period but the bride has no tribulation period amen the next thing for the church is Rapture yes sir he said amen and amen praise to God oh how I love this while the Antichrist spirit is becoming incarnate God is also doing something he said just before this takes place God promised he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to return to the original word of God and the faith of the fathers to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost among the people where are we living at church that you say well I'm waiting on that to happen somewhere where's it going to happen it already happened the power of the Holy Ghost is here the bride Revival is here we just need to participate in it we just need to sign up for it I say sign me up I don't want to be signed up for death and destruction I don't want to be signed up for tribulation I want to be signed up brother Danny for the for the power of the Holy Ghost how am I going to do that not by being a member of some church not by being a part of a certain group but I do that by believing the message of the hour by receiving what God has said in my day amen with a message to return of the original word to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost among the people with a power that will raise her above these things and take her in at the same time oh I love let a power to overcome and a power to be changed at the same time not that you'll be left here where you get in by the skin of your teeth but you're you'll actually be raised above these things and go home at the same time and at the same time I love this musicians go ahead and come at the same time you didn't believe I could get done did you that's the first seal now the brother BR says many other things in the first seal but this is how he explains his revelation of what the first seal actually was at the same time that this devil falls out of Heaven becomes incarnate in a man brother the Brandon makes a play on words here he says the Holy Spirit goes up and comes down incarnate men I love that he said oh my what a time what a time to be living in he said brother Ben I I'm worried about that I don't know I'm not sure that I'm where I'm supposed to be not sure that I'm going to make it what do the Bible tell us to do when these things begin to come to pass look up look up I heard a preacher the other day he said don't he said that means more than just lift up your head and lift up your mind lift up your eyes lift up your understanding yes look up lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh you there's no tribulation period for us aren't you happy for that amen let's just make sure we're part of that number how about that let's bow our heads together this is your message I'm glad it wasn't incumbent on me to bring it it wasn't even brother brandom that opened the seals it was the lamb who opened the seals and he handed it to the seventh angel messenger and he showed us what it was you say that's not important brother Ben how what could be more important we know where we're at and the knowledge doesn't make us arrogant the knowledge simply tells us simply tells us I'm gives us Assurance I know that I'm a Child of God I know what group that I'm going to be a part of somehow I know in spite of my failures and my circumstances he never said you'd miss the tribulation CU you were a good person he never said you'd miss the tribulation because you were born in a message family but he said you'd miss it because you were a Believer you received the word of the hour and you were born again one day you realize you were not the son I was not the son of John and Sharon puit but I was a Son of God if you've never had that realization now is the time to give your heart to him and your life everything that you have and everything that you are just give that to him but rest assured little bride there's a good time coming I wouldn't get too caught up and too worried about the the politics of the day these things begin to come to pass you get on these podcasts and stuff you know what it is Faith destroyers it's another way for Satan to get into your mind I don't say you can't listen to a podcast but make sure you listen with faith and whatever is not a faith get rid of it just destroys your faith makes you think well you know I got to prepare I got to do this and that or the other you get your heart right God will take care of us you believe that tonight amen Heavenly Father oh God I'm just I'm just overwhelmed by your mercy Lord I'm overwhelmed by your goodness in my life Lord that you could show us these things and you didn't leave us without any tools to to be ready we're not dependent on some hierarchy somewhere but Lord we have a message Lord you left us a wedding dress to put on Lord and let us wear it may we wear it oh God may we may we put it on and dress in it may we be interested in it Lord May there be something in our heart that cries out for the things of God oh Lord when I see the age that we live in I see people seem like Po pulling away and pulling away but oh God I believe there's a bride on the earth that's pressing forward that's becoming more like you Lord oh God make me a member of that bride today let me receive your word let me be all that you've called me to be let me be in that number Lord that come back from that wedding supper riding on white horses not defeated not hiding in a bunker somewhere but Lord a people that have been raised by the by the power of God Lord that have overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony Lord we believe help th our unbelief Lord help us to walk with you not to become caught up in the things that are going on Lord but to walk with you every day of our life Lord if there's one here that hasn't given their heart to you or that watches this Lord I I pray they would do that I pray you'd give them a desire for the baptism of the Holy Ghost or they they could be marked safe from the tribulation period that's coming on the earth I pray you grant it now we thank you for it in Jesus
