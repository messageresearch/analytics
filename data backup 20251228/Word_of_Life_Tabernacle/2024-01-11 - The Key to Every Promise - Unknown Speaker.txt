tonight Lord and just just work with us every moment oh God bring us close to your side Lord help us to hear your word not just hear it but to be doers of the word Lord Lord to walk closely to you Lord all the days of our life we thank you Lord for what you've already done for us this week we're asking you Lord once again to meet us here tonight and speak to us through Thy word we pray ask in Jesus name amen amen I want to to turn to Hebrews 116 Hebrews 11:6 and Mark 9:23 Hebrews 11:6 and Mark 9:23 we need to keep be praying for uh Gabe and mil they have a a very special unspoken request some things that they're going through and as a church we just need to be praying for them right now gone through a lot lately and and uh sometimes it just seems like one bad thing happens and other bad things come with it but we know that God is in control of all of those things and so we're praying for them uh today tonight and U there's some weather coming in this weekend but we're planning on having church we'll just see what the weather does so we'll wait a little bit closer if you ever wonder whether or not we're having Church all you have to do is is contact me me or one of the deacons and we'd be glad to tell you whether or not we've called off church but we'll try to get a hold of everybody if we have to do that Lord willing we won't have to weon be able to have have service this weekend Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and then Mark 9:23 Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe thou can believe all things someone say all things are possible to him that believeth amen Let's uh you may be seated Lord have his Blessing to the reading of the word there's a great Chasm between faith and doubt brother Peter these uh answer are just a little bit loud there's a great Chasm between faith and doubt and it's so great that he says with faith all things are possible yes if you can believe there's no limit but Paul's good to see it tonight if if you can believe there's no limit to what you can you can have that's right do we really understand that tonight unlimited the the the the power that you you can access the the promis that you can grab a hold of are unlimited if you can believe and on the other side is unbelief or or doubt and if you doubt nothing is possible right because it's impossible to please God without faith so the difference is night and day the difference is life and death you can't do anything without faith and I think that's true just in a general sense in in society in the world that we live in I I I was watching something recently where a man was dropped off uh he was a billionaire and he changed his name and and they give him $100 put $100 in his pocket dropped him off in a strange city and within 90 days he had $5 million because there was something about him that he believed he could make money and because he believed he could make money he went out and made money and if that works like that in the natural I wonder what would happen if we could ever believe the word that we know if we could ever grab a hold of it and say Lord today I'm going to have faith I'm going to believe your word I'm not going to doubt it I'm not going to look back and say it's for another age I'm not going to say it's for some other group of people I'm not going to say I'm not worthy of it I'm just going to say Lord I believe I wonder how many of us can say that tonight Lord I believe help thou my unbelief let me be a believer let me be somebody who can believe God and take him at his word so we we know then that there's such a difference yeah so we also know that Christ is the door to all the promises of God so it's as if there's a room and in that room are all the promises in that room is healing in that room is salvation in that room is your your children your grandchildren in that room is everything you have need of an Abundant Life peace Joy all the things that you need is inside of that room and then that room has a door on it and the door is Christ and he is the word so then he is the door he tells us that in John 109 he said I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture and so we know he is the door and in him lay all someone say all all the promises of God Amen yeah are in Christ yes he is the land where all the promises slay he is the third pole if we can say it that way he is the seventh seal he is the one who can open the book and and loose the seals he is also the book he said well I thought we were the book yes we are because we are him he He Is We Are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen so he is the one who looses all these things the Bible says all the promises of God in him are yay and in him amen nothing negative about him unto the glory of God by us so I want to build your faith tonight because Satan does so much to try to destroy it he does so much to try to bring it down and bring you to a place where you can't believe but if you can believe I don't care what your past has been I don't care what's going on in your life I don't care what's happened this week if you can believe all things are possible if you can believe for healing you can be healed if you can believe for salvation you can whatever it is that you're wanting that's you you've already seen God do it before you can look in the scriptures and see he a God who does that and you can say Lord I believe you can have it if you can believe it 2 Corinthians 1:20 again all the promises of God in him are yay yes he is the fullness of the godhead bodily and all the promises are unlocked by faith in him he is the door so faith is the key and I titled this tonight the key to everything yeah the key to everything yeah faith is the key to everything yes so it doesn't matter the specifics of that faith is the key to it if if I want if I want to prosper in my business and I believe I want to do that for the right reasons faith is the key to that if I want to prosper in my home in my family and I'm doing that for the right reasons with the right motives then faith is to keepy to that if I want to be healthy faith is the key to that are you with me now Faith is the key to all of these things and so the door is open to me if I have faith I have the ability to unlock the door and in the room that is behind the door is everything that I need in Christ so the door is open to me if I have faith and everything in the room is mine but if I do not have faith the door is closed and the word actually becomes a hindrance to me as a door would be if it was locked that we cannot we cannot go in all we can do is stand outside and say well I wish I was a better Christian I wish I was a better person I wish I I I wish that I could get over my depression I wish I could overcome anxiety I wish I could overcome these things in my life what you don't recognize is the answer that you need is on the inside of the door and all you need to do is believe and the belief is the key to get you through the door and you say well I've tried before and it didn't work but that's not the kind of Faith we're talking about we're talking about a kind of Faith like Abraham had that every day his faith got stronger his body got weaker but his faith got stronger and he did that for 25 years and one day the promise came what was it the faith he believed it and it was behind the door good are you with me so far yes so if I do not have the faith the door is closed and the word becomes a hindrance to me receiving my promise just like the sop phenician woman was standing there and the word stood there and said it's not mean for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs but she said even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table she would not even let the word be a hindrance she took the key of faith and unlock the door oh that we could do that tonight you young people could do that tonight grab that key of faith and unlock the door to the promises of God but my family does things this way let me unlock the door and do things differently and we know that knowledge doesn't unlock the door right yeah you can know everything about the message and walk up to the door and say I'm a PhD lld equivalent and whatever that would be in the message of the hour and the door just it's just there that doesn't move the door it doesn't unlock the door the only thing that unlocks the door is the key right and the key according to the message of the hour is Faith so if you can get nothing according to the scriptures you get nothing without faith without faith is impossible to please God and you get everything with faith because if you believe you can have what you ask for so then everything the the the key is the faith is the key to everything and and I want to do this because we believe in Holiness but Holiness doesn't unlock the door right and that's why sometimes somebody can come in brand new and come off the street and begin to receive blessings from God and somebody sit in church for decade after decade and do everything right yeah but never come never come into the promises of God never receive the promise why because the promise is not unlocked by good living yeah all right and I that shouldn't discourage us from good living that's the action of Faith but the Joel preached about last Wednesday night but it ought to encourage us to live right it ought to be something in us why because we believe the word of God so knowledge doesn't unlock the door Holiness doesn't unlock the door begging doesn't unlock the door right yeah you can stand outside the door and say well I've been a good person I've served the Lord all my life I've done everything right and somebody else walk up the door and say I've done everything wrong but I believe what was the difference in the two thieves one was on his right one was on his left but one said that one said oh you know we're just here and they're going to kill us and we're going we're going to hell anyway and we might as well just go and the other one said Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom that was the only difference the one unlocked the door to Salvation and the other one went by the place where he was going don't you realize that's the only difference in you and The Sinner is Faith that's the only thing that's standing between you and the world is Faith oh I say God Give Me Faith tonight to believe your word let me believe that I'm a Christian let me believe that I'm I'm a I can I can understand the things of God let me believe these things begging doesn't unlock the door only faith can unlock the door got to believe it right if I had a million dollars to give you if you didn't believe I had it it would not do you any good because you would never ask of it right I could have all the I could have everything that you need you know they say that's the difference in in uh being successful and and not being successful it's like did you ask right you have to ask they teach you that in sales you got to ask if you didn't ask that's why you didn't sell I I think it was Charles Spurgeon one time there was a man a young Minister come to him discouraged he said brother Spurgeon he said I've I've worked all year and he said no souls were saved and nobody could nobody came to the house of God no one was baptized he said I'm so discouraged he said well at the beginning of the year how many did you expect to come he said well I I I didn't really expect anything anybody to come he said well there's your problem that's right yeah only faith can unlock that door you got to believe it or you're never going to see it you've got to take the action of Faith you're not going to baptize anybody with an empty Baptist tree you're not going to you're not going to unless you unless you prepare for wealth unless you prepare for growth unless you prepare for godliness to increase in your life unless you prepare for Faith to increase it'll never happen right you got to make room for it yeah so you have to believe it now we know when Christ was on Earth he had perfect Faith how many believe that tonight and the disciples could see the difference in their faith and his faith because their faith was limited they believed as long as it was something simple but when it was a hard case they wondered whether it could be done I think about the old song that was talking about the four men that brought the crippled man to Jesus and they brought him up and and each one began to introduce himself said well I was healed I was lame and I was healed but this man's too far gone the other one said well I I was blind I was healed but this man's too far gone and the fourth one finally says my name is Lazarus yes amen right what do you say to Lazarus he's he's already been brought back from the dead he he's already been as bad as he could be I'd like to say I'm like Lazarus tonight I've been I've been dead in trespasses and sin but I come out of it one day yes sir and so the disciples could see his faith was something that could make a difference in people's lives in a way that theirs couldn't and so the apostles come to him and they said Lord increase our faith and Luke 17:16 and the Lord said if you had Faith now look what he's saying he said you don't need an increase of Faith you need to use the faith you have he said if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed have you ever seen a mustard seed it's one of the tiniest seeds that there is and so he said if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed it's tiny but it's pure it can't be mixed he said if you had Faith as a grain of a mustard seed you might say to this sachine tree be thou plucked up by the root be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you boy make Landscaping easier wouldn't it wouldn't it be nice if in the spring of the year we just come out here and instead of doing all this Landscaping that we want to do in the spring if we just come out here and say now you move there and you move there and you'd be planted there and but if we had the faith he said we could do it right if we really believe that we could do it we could do it maybe it'd be better for us if we did it ourselves but but but if we had the faith we could do those things but they could not take the hard cases now Matthew 17:19 I believe brother Joel read this last week but he said then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said why could we not cast him out so in other words there was a an epilepsy case that was a demon that would that was a very hard demon it wasn't just a a maybe some you didn't hear very well and now you can hear better or something like that this was a hard case and they could not cast him out and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence to place so now not just a tree but a mountain and it shall remove and nothing someone say nothing nothing shall be impossible unto you that's the difference in faith and and doubt that's the difference in believing in disbelieving Jesus had perfect faith brother brand said he had it and it come because he was the word and you become the word amen I like this this is not the age of halfway Faith this is not the age of of Faith well just to do a former denomination this is the age of rapturing Faith this is the age of perfect Faith so he said you become the word that's why the word was opened in our days so we could become the word and he said you become the word as you receive the word he said if you abide in me and my words in you my words which he said this word abides in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you you don't have to make compromises with the devil you don't have to live like the world you don't have to make your business work or to make something else work you can just believe God you don't have to give up going to church to have to have enough to feed your family you can believe God and God will give it to you why by faith everything is is possible to you if you say to this mountain I think some of us that have been on the road for a while we can testify that by the bill I know that God has moved Mountains for me it might have moved one set grain of sand at a time but he moved the mountain why because I believed he could Hallelujah he said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe in what you said you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for you shall have it it'll be given to you time space nothing else will ever change it you know it's done it's already over with how me Amen to that today he said now he said to us if you abide in me in my word and you St John here you can ask what you will to be done he said then recognize your position in the scripture as a Believer right now how do you do that well you look in the scripture and you see what a Believer what happened to a Believer and now say you have a need and there was some there's a believer in the scripture and you can see that that believer maybe you just need some more uh loe's and fishes and you realize there was a young boy who gave Jesus his lunch and when he did he multiplied it fed 5,000 you say Lord I just need the groceries to last a few more days you ever been in that situation Lord I just need the groceries to last to the end of the week then you can ask what you will I'm not talking about Voodoo I'm not talking about some kind of a supernatural thing or or or guessing or something like that I'm talking about believing God and many times God will use natural means many times he'll use your own job your own work many times he'll use somebody around you the natural means that you don't even understand what it is but God's providing it I heard a story about a old lady that was a widow woman and she she was always saying that God was going to provide and she had an atheist to live next door so he thought he'd play a trick on her and and he put a uh one day he put a bunch of groceries by her front door and he hid behind the bushes and he watched her and here she come out the door to the oh God you're going to provide for me today she walks out she sees the groceries and she just so happy she said Lord you answered my prayer and he jumps out from behind the bush and he said hi he said I caught you he said that was he said that wasn't God that was me and she said oh Lord I Thank you for answering my prayer and letting the devil deliver the groceries sometimes he'll use just natural things but he it still gets done somehow it still happens why because you believed it am you believe it you can have it so you got to recognize your position in scripture as a Believer if Hannah received a baby because she cried out to God and she and she prayed and asked for it and God gave her the desire of her heart then if I was in need of that that's what I don't need any more kids but if I needed that God would provide it and if you needed if you needed a job God would provide a job because you see others he's provided a job for you can look in the scripture and find that God commanded us to work as men then if you need a job God will provide provide a job if you need healing God will provide healing he said I'm the god that heals all your diseases if you need eyesight he'll provide eyesight if you need whatever you have if you need more oil in the cruise in the tank there there will be a place for that it won't fail until the time comes listen whatever you have need of he'll provide for you now watch he said you got to recognize your position in the scripture as a believer you got to recognize your position as he recognized his position you got to see now he could look at the word and say this is what it says about the Messiah this is who I am this day this scripture is fulfilled you realize that's how Jesus knew who he was in the word he looked at the scripture and this the anointed word the word spoke to the word and he said that's me yes and you and I have to be able to look at the scripture and the word speak back to us and say that's me I was the widow woman in need I was the bride I was the I was I was the the one there in Jericho I was Rahab in Jericho but God saved me and my family I was David facing the Goliath but God brought down Goliath you got to recognize your position in the scripture as a believer I'm not Saul I'm not going to shake when the enemy comes I'm a Believer I recognize that I'm not someone that's going down I'm someone just going up I'm not an unbeliever I'm a Believer I've cross the chasm I have the key to the door yes so he he knew who he was now the BR said you must believe what you asked for if you are a Believer recognize yourself as a Believer you need to look in the mirror and say there's a Believer there's not a halfway there's not a cold lukewarm leoan uh denominational chicken there's an eagle I wonder how many of us could look and honestly say that there's a Believer you need to believe that there's a Believer standing in front of me I'm not some person that's not going in the Rapture I'm going to make it there's a believer in the mirror there's a Believer I can overcome with my family I don't have to compromise I don't have to give in I can believe all the word of God there's a believer in the mirror your heart has got to be assured that you're a Believer assure your heart and and and it talks about that in first John I'm trying to say time tonight so I didn't I didn't get the scripture but John goes and he says he said your heart must be assured said if your heart condemn us not then you can believe and brother brandom picks that up and he says you can't have condemnation in your heart but if you go down in the scripture uh John begins to speak he said we know our hearts condemn us not if we do his Commandments he said what are his Commandments he said to believe to believe that's his commandment believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and he said to love the Brethren well I can do that how many could say you could do that tonight then you can you can keep his Commandments not by keeping every letter of the law but by Believe by being a believer in who he is and by loving the brethren we can all do that tonight believe that's why you're here because you believe now Faith we know is a revelation that comes to you it's not you building yourself up into a place where you can believe but it's something you know you just know it I'm a Christian and I know it I don't know it because I cried I don't know it because oh my I don't know it because I spoke in tongues I don't know it because I run the a I know it because I just know it it's a revelation to me I belong here I'm an eagle not a chicken I belong in the house of God it's a revelation now he said you must believe what you asked for and and so now he he he said the uh we know that Faith being a revelation the Bible says by faith Faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain so we could say by Revelation that he recognized that the antidote for original sin that become a revelation to him that there was a way out and he knew that that Revelation told him that to go and take the action of Faith slay the lamb and offer Blood on the altar because it was a revelation of faith and we know that when the finished work becomes a revelation to us so he recognized that a lamb died for the sins of his parents so a lamb had to die for his sins and if you could recognize if it become a revelation to you today that Christ died for me yeah everything else would fall into place Christ didn't just die for the preacher he didn't just die for my neighbor he died for me he came to get me if there would only been one he would have come for me oh aren't you glad for that today the finished work becomes a revelation a you recognize that he died for you and you really see that and you begin to act on that Revelation now we know that behind this door Christ is God's treasure brother brandom said there's something behind the door worthwhile or it would not be a key to it it wouldn't be locked unless there was some treasure behind the door so he talked about the polio vaccine and he talked about the how polio had come through Jeffersonville and how it had just destroyed all the children and things and that it was and he said the firemen stood out on the corners and took up money to try to do away with polio but one day the vaccine it become a revelation to Dr Sul that there could be a vaccine for polio and it become a key he had the key and when he had the key he could unlock the healing or the prevention of polio he talk talked about uh the light bulb Edison with the light bulb that seems like it it's so common to us now you realize that I saw something the other day they said for for thousands of years people people traveled by horse right thousands of years the mode of transportation wasn't any faster or better for the people in 1890 than it was in in year zero right it just it just wasn't that much different but between then and now we've gone from a horse to a spaceship what what's happening is that once the door was unlocked to Transportation then it just kept unfolding and kept unfolding so once you had the combustion engine then everything else kind of fell into place and that's the way it is with a Christian if you can ever get behind that door if you can unlock the door for your salvation you can unlock the door for your healing if you can unlock the door for your healing you can unlock the door to peace you can unlock all everything else so there's got to be something worthwhile behind the door now brother brand said we read in St John the 10th chapter Jesus said I'm the door to the Sheepfold I am the door not a door the door the only door I'm the way the only way the truth how many believe that tonight no man cometh unto the father but by me I am the door to the Sheepfold and all that comes before me is enemies thev and robbers he is the door of the Sheepfold he is the door to salvation there's not another name given under heaven whereby you must be saved only through the name of Jesus Christ no church no denomination no Creed no doctrines of anything only through Jesus name that is the key he said no wonder Peter could use one of them on the day of Pentecost they wanted to know how to get into that door he used the key and there's only one key cuz there's just one door he said I am the door and Peter had the key to it he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin you shall receive the treasures of God it's the the key to the door and Jesus is the door there's only one door to Healing Jesus is that door there's only one door to peace how many believe that tonight only one door to peace you may go through all the all the training and all the psychi psychiatrist and everything else but there's only one door to peace and he stands here today and says I am the door amen if you could have the faith to unlock that door he's the only door to genuine peace you might think you got peace you might accumulate enough money to buy your home you might accumulate enough money to get your children clothes half deep you might have accumulated enough popularity to be popular amongst people but when you slip off your shoes at night get ready to lay down there's only one thing can give you peace that is if you know you were dying that night there's only one peace and that's Jesus is the peace he is our peace he is our healing I'm the Lord thy God that heals all of your diseases someone say all all of your diseases he is the door to heaven and there's no other door no other way but through Jesus Christ he is the door to heaven and now Jesus he said is the door to all these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door now if Jesus is the door to all these promises of God faith in his finished work unlocks every door someone say every door to every treasure amen every door to every treasure Hallelujah there is inside the kingdom of God faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes F then if we have a promise of a Rapture in this day Faith is the key that unlocks that all faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes the key of Faith does that Faith what in what faith in his finished work a revelation that it was for me a revelation that it took blood that there was a lamb offered for me Faith being a revelation now we we have confidence in the key and in the lock because every time we put the key in the door it works yes right now you'd think it was funny if you got home now my wife the other day she had to leave and and she ended up taking the kids to Sonic but she she left went home and there was an ulterior motive to her being chaperon on that trip because she forgot her key to home and so when she left the house she left my shirt there for the night service and so she had to go back but she didn't have the key so she borrowed got my key and went back and with with the key she could get to anything in the house without the key she couldn't get in now me I could probably find a way in but we might have to repair something but but she couldn't find a way in unless she had the key with the key was so easy she just walked up to the door and turned it and you know what something funny about a key you never expect it not to work you stick your key in your car and you don't ever think about it not working brother Mark it just it just works that's right stick it in turn it and if it ever doesn't work boy you get mad cuz you you're disappointed you expect it to work oh if we could only believe in God like that if we can only believe in God like we believe in our Toyotas or our Hondas or our Fords or or our yugos or whatever it is if we can only believe in God like we believe in our cars if we can only believe in like we believe in Arkansas Department of Transportation think about it for a minute you put more trust in these Bridges out here built by man than you do in Jehovah God help me tonight we put more trust and brother B said faith is like crossing a bridge you don't expect it to fail you expect it to hold up and we expect God to keep his promise yes sir that's that's good but it's because we know that this key moves the levers of the word now lock has levers on the inside but the any correct m key has levers on the the inside of the lock and it takes a certain form a certain shape and keys to turn those levers he said and just one little lever out of the way will mess the whole thing up he said therefore I believe in the Full Gospel every word of God that turns the power of God loose that turns his blessings to the people it's the key to the door that unlocks it oh he said those great Heroes those prophets and great men of the Bible that had that key he said that's the reason they can stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword bring the dead back to life again do all kinds of Miracles he says because they held that key and they knew it worked because it was a scripture born key he said now if I'm progging with a Creed key I don't know what it's going to do if they say my church teaches this I don't know about that now Pop Quiz what is progging never did find out how to lay down your windshield but I did find out what progging was and I thought it was brother brand trying to say something else but it wasn't there's actually a word progging brother Joel did you know this find out something you didn't know I finally taught him something progging is British dialect means to prowl about as if for food or plunder not be sure where you're going be like a a like a like a bum we would say today somebody just wanders around he's progging he's always begging he said if you're just progging around if you're just if you're just trying to make it work he said that's not that's not going to work he said that's like a Creed he said you take it and you're just sticking in the hole but you don't know if it's going to work but if you could ever get the right key and the right lock what is that the word of God and we have the fullness of the word in our day yes sir we don't have to prow about we don't have to beg we don't have to sit on the corner and and put a will work for correct Doctrine sign out we know what the word says we know the light's been shining shined in our day we know we the book is open and what does that mean to us it means I can have faith in all the promises of God I don't have to question the message of the hour I don't have to question the Bible I can have faith and know that it's right I can look at it and say Lord that's for me help me live it help me to become it help me to believe it he said but when the Bible teaches it and I hold the faith key in my hand or in my heart it says that's God's word that'll quench the violence of fire it'll unlock healing for the sick it'll unlock salvation to the Lost he said I have to come to the door everything's in his name whatever you do in word or deed do it all in his name knowing that the key that you got his faith because it's a scripture made key he said enough it's a Creed key a denominational key I don't know what it'll do but if it's a scriptural key it'll unlock why because God said so how many believe that today it'll unlock because God said so that's good you hold the key to the door because the Revelation Faith came to you you saw yourself in a vision brother BR said you have to see yourself in a in a well body and then walk in into that that's good so brother brandom is constantly if you go back in the prayer lines he's telling us people go and be well go eat your supper go be happy go rejoicing go and be well now he's not giv them a prophecy but a statement of faith because someone went out went to the prayer line one time and left and died and and brother random had said you're healed and they told him they said they said well you're a false prophet you they come through and died he said no he said I'm understand what the word says see when they come through the he said the the Visions don't heal you the vision just increases your faith that you believe that there's a real God that can know those things and do those things but but it's actually you that holds the key to your own healing because that faith has got to come to you you've got to see yourself in the vision right and that's why it increased Faith so much is because by the Danny they could look and he' say now you're from a certain certain city and you're you have a nephew who who wears a certain color of coat he lives on a certain Street and he's been up to the doctor and certain things and you take that prayer call to him you'll be well and when they begin to see themselves in the vision they recognize that's me what happens is it increases their faith now we don't have that that gift on the Earth today I I challenge that people say we have gifts like that today we don't have gifts like that today because it was one to a generation one to an age that was a prophet I believe we have gifts but not like that one because it was the sign of the son of man God don't need to do it twice but the r said God didn't need to do it even more than once and he did it thousands of times so we don't we're not looking for that gift but we can still see ourselves in the vision right brother brandom said that there was a missionary in Africa and or going to Africa and he went before the mission board and they began to tell about the dangers and early on many years ago in Africa there was many dangers going there there still is but the dangers have changed but there there was there was a lot of danger in going there and and he was going to take his family be there for years and they told him about the disease they told him about the natives and they told him about the trouble and they said all of these things this is what's going to happen to you and he begin to cry he said but but I know what my calling is he said I know I'm called to do it he said if if I'm in the will of God he said the safest place I can be is in the will of God am oh I wonder if we got a revelation of that and brother BR said he had the key to his calling he had the key to his calling he said when you got the key there's no fear there's no doubt there's no question amen you you know I was born to do this I was born to be a Christian I was born to be a child of God I was born to be a mother or father whatever you do you got the key to that yes you don't have to question it he said you got the key there's no fear there's no doubt there's no question you don't have to ask anybody else about it you know exactly you've got it in your hands you know what to do he said you know what the score is amen hallelujah you know what the score is brother Daryl Ward tells the story of of the baseball game they were all up to bat and they they begin to hit the hit the ball and pretty soon I think it was 11 to nothing and and uh and somebody asked one of the team somebody was up on the up on the scoreboard and they asked the outfielder they said how's the game going he said well we don't know yet we haven't come up to bat it might be 11 nothing but we haven't batted yet oh Church if you only know if you only realize what the score is Jesus already already won for us and so we know that the door is going to unlock he said you've checked the levers you know it's strictly the right thing the door is going to fly open when you throw the key in it he said oh if the church only possessed the keys if the church only possessed that key of faith we could unlock any door someone say any door any sickness any plague any case any plague that includes Co I believe it any plague any any any case say well it's coming back there'll be another plague or whatever any plague if we had the key of faith we could unlock that amen said it could be unlocked to us if we could only possess this key he said this man speaking of that that African missionary he said he had the key to his calling now brother brandham spoke of his own life he said he had the key to that Divine Healing Ministry he said no one was doing it like that but he had a key why the angel met him he was there the Angel spoke to him and everything was against him and we don't realize how hard it was at the beginning because now there's a Divine healer on every every channel on TV if you go late at late enough at night at the right place right places in the country when we were in Corpus Christie if you kind of let it get late and turn on the television maybe I shouldn't admit I did that and you turn on the television you go from channel to channel it's crlo dollar or or Benny hen or and there's one on every channel they've all got healing and I begin to look at that and think boy it's today you know Baptists believe in healing they didn't back in the day that's right when brother brand come along there' been a great liberal movement had come into the church and they'd said that God don't do those things no more and and so they begin to say well it's just all social programs and things like that so when brother brandham comes in in the early 40s and then in the late 40s when he began his ministry I think in 47 it was something that people didn't do they just didn't do that and brother brandom begins his ministry and he had much position he said how are you going to face he said preachers told him how are you going to face with no denomination or nothing else to back you up what are you going to do Bill he said somehow another it didn't phas me one bit for I held in my hand a key they said nobody will believe you you won't be able to do it nobody will believe you I said I don't care there's one thing sure God called me or do we believe that tonight God called me and I must go because God called me I held the key he said he had called me he had showed me he had told me and I saw his PR presence when he commissioned me and the key was there I want to tell you today I hold the key to my salvation I was there when it happened I hold the key to my healing I was there when I read the word and he quickened it to my heart I hold the key what is it to the Salvation of my children because I believe he promised it I have the key I can see myself in the vision so brother brandom tells about thank you for for bearing with me tonight just got a few more minutes we'll close brother brandom tells about the Silver Tip Grizzly why did Brother Bram always tell that story well it's a great example of faith and you know he's he's hunting and he told Bud Southwick who was with him he said now we're going to go and we're going to come back we're going to get this uh this Caribou I believe it was and and yeah it's a 42 inch I believe Caribou he said and we're going to go he said we're going to get that we're going to pack it back out he said on the way back out we're going to see that Grizzly a silver tip Grizzly that's the way the vision was my brother brand had seen himself take the grizzly the grizzly didn't eat him right the grizzly was dead he saw himself in the vision but Bud Southwick had to rely on secondary instructions right so they get out and they they get the the caribou and they and they come back into the camp where the story brother Bisal there and all those things and you you've all heard the story but as they come back in he said they got back in they come up over the mountain he said You Could See For Miles and they had the the the glass and the the scope or whatever they were using to hunt with binoculars and they looked and and they didn't see anything and brother southw started to get nervous and they begin to come down the mountain and and he being reminded brother Brandon he said didn't didn't you say we were going to get on the way he said we're going to have to hurry because there ain't one out here and brother BR said God provided a ram for Abraham and as they were coming down brother BR said we were almost within about 500 yards of where the horses was he said we had to rest again with the heavy horns and things on our back he said he looked around again I seen his face as he looked at me as if down in his heart he was wondering oh I've seen that face before in church we wonder sometimes don't we was because we didn't see the vision somebody else saw it and somehow that has to move as there's that great Chasm between faith and doubt there's a great difference in the one who saw the vision and the one who has to believe it but somewhere you got to see yourself in the vision right so now brother brandom seeing the vision he believed it but here this man didn't see the vision he said I I saw his face as if down in his heart he was wondering see he had hoped it would be there but he didn't have the key now that's where a lot of us stop right there we hope it'll be there we hope if we go to church it'll be a great service and we'll get prayed for it everything will turn out okay but I wonder if we could ever move from that to seeing ourselves well or seeing the the Fulfillment of that promise that God made to us if we could ever see ourselves there it wouldn't matter how many years how many months how many trials how many things comeing our way you said Lord I believe help my unbelief I'm going forward I don't care if I'm all the way back down the mountain God said he would do it he'll do it and he said he was wondering but he didn't have the key he said but somehow by the grace of God he's never failed me when he told me there would be a silver tip there I had the key I didn't doubt it not one bit he said I turned to him and I said Bud it'll be there and just as I turned there was the bear standing right above us about half a mile he throw the glasses on he said Billy so help me it's a big Silver Tip see the key of vision the word of the Lord listen there's nothing can change it or stop it I hope you're listening to me I want you to just listen for a moment and we'll close but but this this is very important nothing nothing can change or stop the vision he said what the church needs tonight is not an education what the church needs tonight is not a denomination what the church needs tonight is not Creed what the church needs tonight is the key to the scriptures the door which Christ is the door and he is the word and faith in the word of the Living God unlocks every door right amen we've got to see ourselves in the vision now watch me for just a moment Elisha needed the key to the portion of Elijah's spirit in 2 Kings chapter 2:9 it come to pass when they were gone over Elijah said to Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me so it was it was a hope it was something he wish it was something he wanted but Elijah said he said thou has ask a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked and behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven so Elisha knew that the promise was if he could see the vision that it oh my if he could see through a prophet's eyes and see what a prophet saw that he could actually have a double portion of that prophet's Spirit now brother brandom taught us that Elisha was a type of the Bride how many knows that that if we can see through a prophet's eyes if we can see but a prophet Saul we can actually be a partaker be a participant in the vision and so now you fast forward years later and Elisha is a prophet and gesi his servant is standing there with him and Elisha knows that God is real and and he knows something about God that God keeps his word even though he didn't see a vision maybe in this particular instance he may have but because in some places brother BR say he did and some places it he talk like he didn't but he may have seen the vision or it may have been just a Reliance on the word but elij Elisha knew God kept his word because when Elijah left he saw through a prophet's eyes right so in 2 Kings 6:15 the servant of the man of God got worried because he Lo he looked out there and the host Compass the city with horses and chariots and they come down there with one purpose to take Elijah back with them Elisha back with them is that right because remember they went down there and every time they went into is their plans were thwarted and I said what's doing it they said well there's a prophet in the land of Israel that knows what the king is saying in his bed chamber so they go down there to take out this Prophet can you imagine an army coming down to take out a prophet and his servant said to him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray the open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha brother brand said it this way we need to opened his eyes around that old Prophet was angels of fire and Chariots of Fire he said then there's more with us than there is with them he said and that's the dimension Now by being born he said maybe you never will see such but you believe it anyhow how many Believers we got the building tonight he said how much greater is their reward who've never seen and yet believe he said but some of us were born for that God places that in the church from baby birth he said prophets are not just put in by man it's a gift born all through the scripture born from childhood so now we could say I have not seen what he saw but I believed I have not seen what he saw but I believed now watch brother BR said gesi was a lukewarm church member he had not seen what Elijah had seen because Elijah was used to walking by faith and he was looking at the Unseen all the time and he knew that God had said in the Psalms the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him so when he's praying open his eyes he's going by the word God said that the Angels encamp round about him so Elisha knew they were there so he didn't say Lord open my eyes he said Lord open his eyes so he can see himself in the vision amen the miracle wasn't for Elisha the Bible said these signs will follow them that believe and if you can be a believer in the word of God if you can believe that God still has Angels surrounding his people today then you can say Lord open their eyes let them have a miracle because I believe the word how many can say Amen to that tonight amen well the miracle wasn't for Elisha it was for his servant he said but gesi had halfway believed it he was just a church member so Elisha said to the Lord he said Lord God give a sign here open this man's eyes let him see what's around him hope we can only see tonight when God opened his eyes he saw horses of fire drawn by Chariots of Fire they were all around that old Prophet they were there all the time but he just didn't see them and tonight he said I'd say the same thing that the God who stood Yonder in the first chapter of the book of Acts as he was taken up the Skies come under his feet he said that same Jesus said Lo I'm with you always I will never leave you do we believe it tonight I will never leave you or forsake you the works that I do shall you do always I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that's a promise can you see yourself in the vision can you see the Chariots of Fire angels of fire now I want say this and musicians can go ahead and come brother brandom we know he was allowed by God to go beyond the curtain of time we know Paul was he said he went into the third Heavens he wasn't even able to describe what he saw where brother brandom went he was allowed to describe it but he said it was beyond description that it just no description that could ever hold how beautiful it was and how wonderful that it was I want to go to that place don't you he was ordained to do that he he had the key to his call calling he believed but can I be honest with you about something can I just can I confess something that Vision has given me great comfort because the Bible says or brother Brandon says he he said when he went Beyond curtain of time he said there were millions that cried out were resting on that and I've always taken Comfort brother Joe if there were Millions there maybe I was one of them he said these were the converts under his ministry but I believe this message is still making converts today you're not here because of me you're here because of the message right you're not just here because well we we got a pastor no you're here because of the message of the hour that's what you that's what's kept you steady all these years amen and so under a prophet's Ministry he I've always been able to do this that I could look I could see that Vision in my mind man I could see that I could see it and and I can see those that are standing there in that crowd and he and and he said well I have to be judged like Paul was judged he said he said I I'll have to be judged in the same way if Paul he said if Paul taught Divine Healing I believe in Divine Healing he said whatever Paul taught that's what I taught and he said the millions cried out we're resting on that and I've always pictured myself in that crowd crying out saying well I'm resting on that I can see my face there I'm there I I may not have made it yet but I'm there I'm in the vision I wonder tonight if you can see yourself in The Vision by faith faith is the key that unlocks everything if you can see yourself inside that paradise if you can see yourself you said well if I go by way of the Grave well that's where you'll go if you can see yourself one of those faces they not just nameless faces they're not just Blobs of people they're individuals all those millions are individuals and I'd like to thank tonight that every one of us can see our faces right there in that crowd and we can see ourselves say Lord I didn't see the vision but I believe the vision and I can see myself in the vision and the faith has become a revelation to me that there's nothing's going to keep me back nothing's going to keep me back from my promise I believe if the Rapture happens in my generation I'll go if it doesn't happen while I'm living I'll go by way of the grave but I'll still be there the dead in Christ will rise first listen nothing can stop you when you see yourself in The Vision by faith in the word what did he tell brother brandom the angel he said he had the key to his calling he said if you can get the people to believe you nothing nothing oh we need to hear that tonight nothing can stand in the way of your [Music] prayer faith will unlock the door and there's Miracles behind the door there's healing behind the door there's joy behind the door there's peace behind the door the door is the word and Faith unlocks the door can we believe that tonight can we just grab a hold of that say Lord I see myself there others may not have seen me there my mama may not have seen me there my daddy may not have seen me there my family men but I see my face I see myself in that crowd I believe I'm there I believe it's become almost a memory to me I know I'm there I know I'll make it because I'm resting on the same promise they were resting on that this Prophet preached what Paul preached and we believe that same word today will take us all the way home do you believe it Heen let's bow our heads together if you can get the people to believe you brother brand said you have to believe in your pastor you won't you won't accept healing you won't accept salvation he said you got to believe I'll take that a step further you got to believe in any man that stands behind the sacred desk or he shouldn't be there if you can't believe or else you need somehow to increase your faith but I'll say this you got to believe in Jesus Christ if you can believe in Jesus Christ as your healer as the door to everything that you have need of you can have whatever you ask don't ever get discouraged and think well it's not for me it is for you whatever you have need of you can have if you can only believe amen you believe that tonight Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're crying out in faith tonight Lord we believe help thou our unbelief Lord like blind barus who cast his aside Lord I heard your Prophet say that he didn't he didn't lay it down where he could find it again but he threw it away because he knew he would never need it again there was something about it he knew if he could ever get to you Lord that was the door to his healing Lord may we be like blind barnas lay aside our blind clothes lay aside our begging clothes oh God and may we come to you oh Lord and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me let that be our cry tonight Lord whatever we have need of Lord those that are watching I pray whatever they have need of tonight that you'd meet that need Lord that you give them the key of Faith to believe oh God they could be in the safest place they could be is in the will of God I pray you grant it Lord we see the weather and things coming this week and I pray Lord if it's your will that it'd be turned aside Lord we know you hold all things in your hand we submit ourselves to you your will oh God lord we believe that you're An Almighty God lord if we could grab a hold of the faith grab a hold of Faith appropriate the Faith Lord to believe your word as I heard your Prophet say that the bride was in a position where we had the power all we needed was the faith I pray you'd help us today Lord to believe that and to walk forward with it we thank you for it in Jesus name amen amen could you stand with me let's sing in all believe oh all things are possible oh can we we just lift our hands and worship him for a moment oh yes Lord I'm only believing oh believe thank you [Music] Lord Oh all things are possible do we really believe that oh if will only believe sing it this way Lord I believe oh Lord Lord I
