why brother harvey come amen sing for us this time he would hey man just had a little testimony about this song i'm fixing saying it really spoke to my heart and it brought back years ago uh when i first went out west and started elk hunting i didn't know a whole lot about it but jeff you'll appreciate this he's been out there with me time and uh i was coming down off the mountain one morning and we killed some game up there and i heard a commotion behind me and i looked and here come up a cow elk come down off the mountain behind me and she hit this valley that i was fixing to go into and i could see for 10 miles there wasn't nothing i mean it was open clear so she started out across this and she had to go however far it was there to get some cover but her tongue was hanging out of her mouth she was just running for all she was worth and uh i never seen that before and it concerned me because i didn't know anything about help i don't know how long she'd last i didn't think she would make it across that valley and there was an old resident that come down the hill behind me he no doubt had spooked her off of there and i told him i said sir i said i don't know a lot about elk but i said see that elk out there i said she just come out here and said her tongue was hanging out of her mouth and said i don't think she'll make it across there he looked at me and he said he said sonny boy said don't you worry about that elk said she's just starting to run when that tongue hangs out he said besides that said she's not planning on staying in the valley she's just changing mountains that's what she said and when i heard this song it was years later but i never i guess if i'd have been inspired and had the right inspiration i would have caught that song but i heard the words to this song the other day and it was a new song that a man has sung and it's called changing mountains and it just really spoke to my heart and sister mary i kind of throwed it on her but we're going to try it we may butcher it up but i want you to get the message of the song if nothing else so this morning when i decided i wanted to sing try to sing it because seeing brother daryl come out and preach like he preached after being through what he's been he's not in the valley he's just changed mountains i can tell you that for sure have you ever seen days like these at all would you be surprised if you heard the trumpet call satan won't stop fighting us no matter what we do when you're in the valley trying hard to make it through don't give in to fussing fighting weary and doubting you're not in the valley you're just changing mountains don't go thinking god can't do something about it he's a mountain mover don't you ever doubt it problems trouble seem to never end god is something better waiting just around the bend i can claim the victory i've been to the fountain i'm not in the valley i'm just changing mountain listen to me brother sister listen young and old we know in the final days that satan will be bold god has said the devil you're in a battle well you're seeing that right now prayer is the one who's living there inside of you and you've never seen a mountain that my savior couldn't move oh dog oh thank you god can't do something about it he's a mountain mover don't you [Music] i've been to the fountain i'm not in the valley i'm just changing my turn oh don't go thinking god can't do something about it he's a mountain mover don't you ever doubting problems troubles seem to never end god is something better waiting just around the pin i can claim the victory i've been to the fountain i'm not in the valley i'm just changing mountains i can claim the victory i've been to the fountain i'm not in the valley i'm just changing [Music]

that today and i know that you are too the blood is still real still alive still heal you still make you happy amen amen the life of the blood has come back on the believer in this day and we we believe that today uh such a privilege to have once again brother darrell ward with us i won't take any more of his time but i told him he could have 30 minutes or three hours but i don't think he'll go three hours but the lord just really helped him to overcome this this covet and this is the first meeting or regular services really that you had a i think one service in dyersburg but first services back to back that he's had uh since he recovered from that and so be praying for him and i believe the lord will help him to help you and that's what a minister is is to help those that he's ministering to a servant that's all we are and you know jesus told his disciples when you get done doing all you're told to do remember your unprofitable servants but there's just something about the holy spirit that can make a man more than a man the words that he speaks can be life to you and and i trust that it'll be so tonight as brother daryl comes uh you know he became me that i might become him by grace i think it's in sea such a privilege to know that it was that blood that he became us so that we might become him it's good to have all of you out here this afternoon i know three o'clock is kind of a hard service but we're so glad to have you here and those that are visiting and the regular folks as well those of you that couldn't come and are streaming today god bless you as well amen let's sing this as brother daryl comes he became me [Music] you believe that today oh he became me so that i might be come here he took my [Music] my place [Music] let's sing it again can we oh thank you lord thank you lord for doing that [Music] hallelujah my place [Music] isn't that wonderful you remember the day the lord first got a hold of your heart i hope i'd never forget that day december the 21st 1981 2 o'clock in the afternoon as a sunday afternoon i'd ashamed to tell you but i'd been out drinking the night before doing things you shouldn't be doing i was in old building by myself the place down in jonesburg tennessee you know antique top story [Music] i felt the presence of the lord come on me i i knew it was him because i felt him when i was a boy and i ran around that store and i got to crying and i thought i got to get out of here i just got out of the army i'm tough you know i run around there and turn the light off and run around turn the same light back on i just i got to the door i put my hand on the doorknob and there's a voice spoke to me just as real as i'm speaking to you right now he said if you go out that door i'll never call you again and right there at that door i knelt down i gave the lord my heart and i said lord wherever you lead me i'll follow you and you think that he would take my place that i could become an expression of christ in this hour and i was out in the field there the other day and i was telling you looking at the stars brother joe and how great they were and i thought you know it ain't hard to understand how we can love you god you're so awesome you're so great because the lord what i don't understand is how someone's so great could love someone like me but he desired her fellowship [Music] isn't that wonderful this morning you remember when you got saved how many still remembers it oh my there's nothing like it in the world i run into some friends of mine they said where you been warned we'd seen you around i said i got saved they said what i said i got saved i said what are you doing now i said i'm preaching they said what oh i'm glad when he changes he changes you amen praise the lord i don't know why i got into that but god god bless you richly if you have your bible this afternoon turn with us to the book of second timothy we want to read from ii timothy chapter 2 sorry i just get emotional but like i said this morning i believe god squeezes your heart and the juice comes out your eyes i've always believed that i'm i'm so glad that people are so hard anymore you know it's just people are hard but i'm glad the gospel still has an effect on me or aren't you this afternoon amen appreciate each one of you coming out and may god richly bless you be our prayer we're going to leave after service and drive so far tonight and then go the rest of the way home in the morning i'm going to have a little cookout tomorrow with my family and certainly enjoyed being here i want to thank you for your kindness and all the good food that was given over there a while ago a little hard to preach after eating all that stuff but it's really really good and brother ben we love you buddy appreciate you good to see you again good to see old familiar faces and it's just good to be here may the lord richly bless you be our prayer and if we don't meet you no more on this side i'll be looking for you on the other amen because i believe it's really really close to going home but brother ben said something this morning praying and we won't keep you alone this afternoon but he said something in his prayer this morning and we just felt led to go this direction this afternoon so we trust it'll be a blessing to you but we want to read now from second timothy chapter two verse one amen do you love him who's gonna help me preach good good thank you second timothy chapter 2 now verse 1 thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ that no man wareth no man that worth entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier amen may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word if we just bow our heads i want to speak to you this afternoon for just a few minutes on chosen to be a soldier heavenly father thy word is true we are so grateful lord that we can hang our souls upon the word of god for heavens and earth shall pass away yet thy word shall never fail and lord we know that men can speak for hours but lord just one word from you and make the difference lord this evening father i pray this we yield ourself to you lord i i just asked dear god that you would take this unworthy vessel speak to the hearts of your children lord if they be one here that's sick or there would be one here that would be discouraged i prayed dear god by the ministering of the word may their hearts be ignited lord and may their courage return to fight once more lord we just love you and we thank you for the opportunity to serve you the lord if there be some here father who hasn't realized who they are may this be the hour that the word reveals to them that they are yours lord grant it father we pray bless your children now we ask these things in jesus name and the bride says amen you may be seated praise the lord there is going on as many of you well know this afternoon there is a war that is going on between two armies it is an army of darkness and it is an army of light and i want you to understand this afternoon that you have been chosen in this army of light to serve on the front lines you wasn't drafted you didn't have to register for the selective service i know they have a volunteer army but this is not a volunteer army you didn't have to nor could you choose to be here but you were chosen before the foundation of the world you were chosen by god to be a soldier in the army of god you say where do you get that at the bible says in john 15 16 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask the father in my name he may give it to you so you can't volunteer for this army you can't raise your pick me pick me but i want you to know god chose you before the foundation of the world to be a part of his army for this last day battle the battle that you've been called to fight in has been raging for years the first great battle that was ever fought it began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started in heaven the battle was in heaven and then it was cast down upon the earth it originated in heaven but it's on the earth this afternoon it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings the battle from angels became human battles and i want you to know as we said this morning that satan has come to destroy god's creation what god created for himself satan hates that amen when god chose you he wanted your fellowship and the devil hates the fellowship that you have between you and god so he'll do anything that he can to break that fellowship satan wants to destroy what god created for himself hallelujah this bride of jesus christ does not belong to an organization she doesn't belong to a denomination she doesn't belong to a man but it's god's people god's bride god's army hallelujah amen amen he come to destroy that was his purpose was to destroy it oh how he wants to destroy young people take their lives while they're young and throw them into bondage of alcohol and drugs and prostitution all kinds of bondage satan was to destroy his purpose was to destroy the battle began on earth and it began in us and it's been raging ever since our commander officer he could have placed you in any part of the battle that he chose to place you in he could have placed you in the battle for justification he could have placed you in the battle for sanctification he could have placed you in the battle of restoration of the gifts but he chose to place you in this hour of great darkness god could have put you in any age he could have put us here when jesus himself walked the earth but he chose to place you here there's something god wants to accomplish in your life in the last day to show satan that his people can overcome amen he placed you in this hour of darkness called to the front lines for this last great assault upon satan's kingdom and i want the devil to know this afternoon i want to serve notice to the devil he the pandemic may be raging violence may be raging rats may be raging but i want him to know his kingdom is fixing to fall satan's kingdom will be torn down not by angels but by man with the power of the holy ghost to cast him out amen oh glory to god should i fill in 18 every minute amen hallelujah call to the front lines called to tear satan's kingdom down you see we are the sham guards of today called by god to battle for a rightful position as sons and daughters of god to be restored back to ever redemptive blessing that jesus christ died to secure for us amen we don't have to live like orphans we don't have to live like step children i'm not a step child i've not been adopted into their family i am a son of god amen god's called me to be what he thought of me in his mind before the foundation of the world hallelujah to be what god thought of you before the foundation of the world in this dark hour of satan's invasion the darkness is upon the people as we preach this morning the battle amen the battle is owned the devil is invading countries he's invading pulpits he's invading churches he's invading people he's invading businesses he's invading cities he's invading schools he's coming into homes amen oh but god help us in this hour to make our stand and pull the sword of the word amen and fight him amen hallelujah in that day of gross darkness the bible says that light pure light will return by pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back our lord not a church member not an organization not a denomination come on somebody but restored back as our rightful rights have sons and daughters of god standing on the earth manifesting jesus christ making him the same yesterday today and forever and with the return of the pure word comes the pure light hallelujah and it returns us back to the original faith that they had at pentecost what did they do at pentecost they cast out devils they raised the dead they preached the gospel with boldness amen they had god o display peter said shiver and go have i none but such as i have give out unto thee in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk hallelujah displaying jesus christ making him the same yesterday today and forever the prophet said we will return to the power of pentecost we will return we will return to the power to the power of pentecost to welcome back our lord how can two walk together except they agree how the he how can the how can the head unite to the body except they agree as one the same life that fueled him fills the church amen hallelujah what was the power of pentecost what fueled pentecost the bible said when the day of pentecost had fully come they were all in one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as the rushing mighty wind and filled all the house where they were sitting not just some of the house not just the preacher not just the song leader but from the front door to the back door let me tell you every one of us today can have the blessing of almighty god it's not reserved for one man come on somebody it's not reserved for the pastor but every one of us today can know god in the fullness of his word amen he wants to reveal himself to you whether you're 16 or 60. oh my he wants to be real he wants to be personal in your life he wants to lead you as a commanding officer he wants you to be a soldier that he can use to fight against the wiles of the devil in the day that we're living in we don't have to point back to some other age well jesus if you was here he's here he said he would be here it's time we rise and take our god-given rights filled all filled all oh how much all where they were sitting and they appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and sat upon each one of them amen i got a lick and you got a lick oh god's children's got a lick a lick of fire amen amen that ought to be a song where brother harvey had he needs to write that song hallelujah i gotta catch my breath with i just feel like i'm 18. i'm really still 60. it's tugs of fire set up on each one of them they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance the power of pentecost what fueled pentecost what was it that stirred pentecost what moved pentecost not don't misunderstand me but it wasn't a miracle it wasn't a gift it wasn't a tongue that wasn't what that was the manifestation of it that was the results of it that was not what fueled it but what actually full uh fueled pentecost it was the power of pentecost is god in his people licks of fire sitting upon each one of them god said in hebrews 12 29 i am a consuming fire hallelujah and god divided himself among his people and there was no less god than there were to begin with hallelujah and he anointed his people with the fire of god what is the evening light in this hour it's not the title of the church it's not the title of a song what is the evening like it's you the word made flesh you are the evening light in this hour of darkness you are the light that's shining god it's god in his people it's god in his army i'm talking about a messiah the messiahs they are the light of the church today the light of the world jesus said jesus said i am the light of the world then he turned around and said ye are the light of the world so who's the light of the world jesus or you did he forget what he said and make a mistake and say it wrong i don't believe that do you he was the word he said i am the light of the world then he said you're the light of the world how can he be the light and you be the light it's easy it's him in you it's christ in me the hope of all glory oh who will be jesus to the woman at walmart who will be jesus to the man at the gas station who will be jesus to the teacher at school who will be jesus do a dying blinded generation who will show them in hardy arkansas who will show them that jesus christ still lives and reigns in the hearts of his people i'll tell you who it'll be his army amen amen we are the light if we are we reflect the messiah light messiah signs follow messiahs these signs shall follow them that believe i don't follow signs and wonders i don't look for signs and wonders but signs and wonders do follow me amen we are the light we are the reflected his messiah light the messiah signs following messiahs the same as it followed the messiah a little while the world will see me no more but you shall see me how lord how will i see you i'll be with you even in you the light of the world an army of darkness we see in this hour then there's two armies an army of darkness and an army of light now satan's army brings diseases amen satan's army coveted did not come from god amen satan's army brings diseases and god's army is commissioned to cast them out every time satan throws anything on to you god's army is to cast him out amen we are an army the christian church today is an army of god we are soldiers soldiers of the cross and let me say friends god's army has never nor will it ever be defeated god's purpose on this earth can never be defeated there's nothing that can defeat it that

god god is the master of death hallelujah christians can't die i can never die they may bury my body but don't you weep i'm not really dead i've just changed dwelling places amen amen do you love him how happy we ought to be resting with the beautiful revelation of the word of the living god there's neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no pearls nothing n-o-t-h-i-n-g nothing can separate us from the purpose of the living god god's purpose for your life will never be defeated he may put you on your back he may make you whatever he would do to get your attention but if you belong to god you will come to god for jesus said all that my father hath given me will come to me and no man will pluck them out of my hand hallelujah hallelujah nothing can separate us from the purpose of living god what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart to bring the past there's no demon there's no power there's nothing that can ever separate god's great immortal eternal plan it must be as god said it must be as god said amen we shall never be defeated my god i don't make you happy you shall never be defeated notice he didn't say

toys we had when we was kids i don't know if still got them or not but it was like a clown and you blew it up and it had sand in the bottom of it y'all remember that you're telling your age you remember that and you would punch that thing and he would go off it was called a punch clown or something what was it called i don't remember but i always knew it you punched that thing he'd go way back and then he come back and you punch him again he go way back and then you really give him a whopper and you go all the way back to the floor you think i've got him now and he [Music] and that's the way we are so oh my papo he was a golden gloves boxer out of knoxville tennessee he fought under the title of doughboy johnson done it many years before i was born but my mama told me she was a young girl about 16 17 year old and my papa was fighting a fight down in knoxville tennessee and she said they bought her a new dress to go to the fight but she said it always made me nervous when my daddy fought and said that night this particular night that they was fighting this man and he was bigger than my pawpaw had a bigger reach had a bigger fist and my mama was scared and she said i went to my daddy i said daddy let's go home please don't fight this man tonight he's going to kill you i said what did he do he said he didn't do nothing he never even answered me he said he climbed into the ring and the fight started my mama said i was so nervous she said about the third round that man put a wall up on my papa said knocked him plum out of the ring he literally went out of the ring people in the second third row was getting out of the way papa laying back there on his back blood pouring out of his nose my mama said i went running dinner took the corner of my new dress whatever that is she said i took the corner of my new dress and wiped the blood off of my daddy's face and i said daddy please let's go home daddy don't worry about what they'll say let's go home don't get back in that ring he's going to kill you i said mama what did he do she said he got up said he wiped the blood off of his face said he pushed me out of the way said he climbed back in the ring and about round seven he knocked that man's slap out and i thought oh god give me grace like that if the devil knocks me plum into the second row god give me grace to get up and get back in the ring and string one more time let me punch just one more time let me preach just one more time amen let me declare god's word just one more time we will never be defeated no matter what takes place well i guess that means we're just on a picnic free from trials free oh no no no i'm here to tell you just the opposite i'm just to tell you when you realize you're in this army you'll fight more battles than you've ever fought in your life so other devils give me a hard time that's a good sign they don't have you amen amen we're not on a picnic we're not boy scouts we're soldiers you know dearest when the boy scout and soldier they both got a uniform both got badges both got medals both wear hats the difference is soldiers have guns we're not boy scouts i said we're not boy scouts we're soldiers of the cross paul told timothy thou therefore endure the hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ endure hard as it means to suffer trouble endure affliction to be afflicted to suffer evils hardships troubles to be afflicted balto timothy endure the hardships that's a good soldier you're gonna be afflicted you're going to have hard times you're going to be in great battles but that just shows you what side the army your own paul said you will take with me timothy your share of hardships and suffering what you're called to endure as a good first class soldier of jesus christ we're not on a picnic we're in a battlefield many people think when they become christians well that's just all they need to do that settles it forever well i'm a christian everything's going to go easy it's more than a cross on your mirror don't never get that in your head friends i didn't become a soldier to be on a picnic i didn't become a soldier just to wear a uniform and look nice in it but i'll become a soldier to fight to fight the good fight of faith i become a christian to get into the battle lines chosen by god to be a soldier for this last great battle we are christian soldiers we have got to be trained and brought up to know all the tactics of the enemy to know how to fortify to know how to fight the fight don't you see the trials and testings and afflictions of life why does god allow them to come if he loves us if he cares for us why should we ever have to cry why should we ever have to suffer why should we ever have to face disappointment god does that he allows those things into our life to mold us demote a character in us that's fit to reign he moses as soldiers to endure hardships amen the characters never earned characters never earned on top of the mountain it's the top of the mountains where you shout the victory you shout the victory on top of the mountain but it's in the valley that's where the victories were amen amen you got to be trained to fight to know how to fight the fight to know the techniques of the enemy i'm here to tell you right now your current situation or your current circumstance your current hardship or your current trial may be a direct result of being chosen by god for his army you see as the battle rages you become a real target the enemy may have an arson of weapons that he may try to keep you suppressed depressed compressed distressed burdened down come on somebody try to get your mind confused gets you all upset gets you nervous gets you down get you to all get you confused about what the focus is but i want to encourage you in the midst of this fight be encouraged and know that no matter what the devil throws at you the bible says that no weapon formed against me shall prosper i may be a real target you may be a real target but i want the devil to know we are a real army are equipped to fight god equips his army for the battle he's called them the fight ephesians 6 10 says it this way finally my brother be strong in the lord in the power of his might but on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore taken to you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand having done all to stand verse 14 stand hallelujah stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth having the breastplate of righteousness and your feet sod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all take the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god don't lay your weapon down stay in the word praying always praying always with proud prayer and supplication in the spirit he names all these weapons and then he gives us one more weapon that if we're honest we hardly ever use it like we should and that is the weapon of prayer prayer is not a burden it is a weapon you can eat too much god knows we do that you can laugh too much you can socialize too much but you'll never ever be able to pray too much paul said i would that men everywhere would pray always pray at the red light well when i get home i can get in my prayer closet yeah there's times for your prayer closet those times we should get in our prayer closet but you don't have to wait till you're in the prayer closet you can pray at the red light i guarantee you start praying at the red light the devil make it turn green because there's one thing he don't want you to do he don't want you to pray come on friends you know it's the truth you get down to pray the phone to ring it'll go all day you won't get one text and you get in the closet to pray why the devil don't want you to pray because he understands that when the weakest christian gets down on their knees to pray all hell trembles and i tell you there's enough of us here to give hell a nervous breakdown [Music] praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there until with all perseverance and supplication of all saints notice there's no armor in the back for we are to stand and not retreat we're not to retreat we can not flee from the devil that's what the devil wants you to do he says blue try to get you to run but you see it's wrong that's wrong according to the scriptures that's wrong for the bible says we don't flee from the devil but the bible says in james 4 7 that the devil flees from us hallelujah it's not the devil saying boo but it's you saying boo to the devil amen amen submit yourself therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you god's army does not retreat it goes on the army of god always marches forward always moving forward endure the hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that wareth entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier no man entangleth that means no man goes to warfare to make a military operation to do military duty to be on active service to be a soldier to fight no soldier when in service gets entangled in the enterprises of civilian life his aim is to satisfy and please the one who chose him he said don't entangle yourself with the affairs of the world don't get so caught up in politics that you get so mad you can't even pray well i'm a democrat i'm a republican they both work for the same boss well gloria i'm going home i'm going soon people get so mad they can't even have family meals because they get to argue over politics we're christians don't entangle yourself in the enterprises of civilian life anyone that's ever been enlisted in the military is familiar with the term civilian anybody here ever been in the army yeah back there's one there's one god bless you for your service civilian it's a term when you become a soldier you understand this term of civilian life when a man is enlisted in the army or the military they find their self in basic training and once you're in basic training certain expectations are required of you the commander-in-chief expects you to act a certain way you no longer act like a civilian which is non-military but you are ordered you are expected to conduct yourself as a soldier and not a civilian so when you say civilian you're saying anyone that's not in the military is a civilian you are military personnel and once you're in basic training they expect certain things of you you can't act like a civilian because of seville let me say that again you can't act like a civilian brother what are you saying i'm saying this you can't act like the world and be a christian amen you have to act like a soldier i was 17 year old i joined the army when i was 16 my parents signed for me i went in a program called delay entry program so i could get the gi bill cause we was poor my mom and daddy couldn't afford to go to send us to college so the only way i knew i could get to college was go to the military and use my gi bill so i joined and they was they was phasing it out but you could join and delay for 11 months and still get the gi bill so i become a part of a program called depth delay entry program and my mom and daddy signed for me and my whole senior year i was already in the military just waiting to go to basic training when i graduated i graduated from high school on june the 9th and june the 14th i was in fort sill oklahoma in basic training oh i'll never forget it i was looking back and i was just a kid i thought what was i thinking they took us in there first thing we did had to take off all of our civilian clothes and put them in a box and they gave us a uniform and then they took us to the barber i didn't put this old boy in the chair i'll never forget it had this big old fro they wore froze back in the 70s had this big old fro and he sat down in the chair and the barber said how do you want it he said cut a little bit off the back and just kind of trim it up to the sides he said the barber said i could do that yeah he cried like a baby they took his throat um you could read the constitution through his hair look we were all recruits and they turned us into soldiers by being taught to endure hardness the hardness we endured is what may the soldiers these brothers will tell you if they was in the military they'll tell you the same thing they instilled in us the army's concept of discipline and obedience we endured hours of drilling endless parades long route marches constant pressure tasteless food that'd been a good time to have kobe we was eating some of that food we didn't have no sense of smell or taste i remember that had monkey bars at the front of the mess hall in oklahoma they didn't have no hood the bars were hot and you'd have to jump up and go across these monkey bars and if you went all the way through you could go in and eat if you fell off you had to go to the back of the line and those bars was hot and they would burn blisters on your hands or they'd be standing there and they'd say ben when's the last time you wrote home if it wasn't the day before they'd send you back to the barracks to write a letter and if you didn't get it wrote and stamped licked and put in the mailbox by the time chow was over you didn't eat you said that was cruel that was hard they shouldn't have done you that way but they were training us for the time when you're in combat and you can't eat at 11 o'clock you can't eat at one o'clock some days you have to go hours you have to go days without eating because you're in a foxhole at the enemy's in their position come on somebody and you have to endure the hardness of the soldier to defend your god-given rights of americans constant pressure tasteless food guard duty bullying of sergeants um thank god for god called pastors that you think bully you sometimes but you see it's only the love of god it's only the love of god when we come here sometimes and being skins are hide and hides are hung up all over the church he don't do that because he likes that he does that because he's called of god to mold you into a soldier who's fit to fight for you to endure the hardships of laodicea and to be an overcomer in this age they call it bullying it's not bullying it's god getting us ready exposure to inclement weather the whole procedure everything they'd done they had a purpose in doing it it was to harden us it was the toughen us up it was to make us soldiers i remember i'll never forget when we went to graduate from basic training i cannot even tell you the things they called us it's pretty bad they called us everything they could think to call us but i'll never forget the day of graduation from basic training and they called us to attention and they said we've been hard on you and we've called you some bad names and we've said some bad things but i want you to know today you are called soldiers he was a great starter brother it was a great honor to be called a soldier he proved you had endured the hardship you had took the training hallelujah he was not overcome by the hardship he was not overcome by the affliction but you used those things to make you a good soldier the roman soldiers of paul's day they were the toughest most disciplined the world ever known they were the most efficient soldiers and paul had known many of them and the example was in his mind when he reminded timothy that he was a soldier of jesus christ he had been chosen picked out by god to endure hardness a good soldier does not quit because he faces difficult tasks or dangerous situations he knows that his life is expendable when i was in the army was known as a band of brothers we left no brother wounded on the battlefield if a brother was wounded on the battlefield we get them off the battlefield because they belong to us you may get wounded you may get hurt i may get wounded i may get hurt i may get knocked down but it doesn't change who i am i'm still a soldier something built into us a purpose something in us to fight and we'll rise up and we'll try again let me tell you god don't see how many times you get knocked down god don't see how many times you fail god don't see how many times you mess up all god sees is how many times you get up and knock the dust off and go again and i say if you've been knocked down don't quit don't turn back don't give up let's get up amen get up and fight the good fight of faith let's go we're going forward stay on the firing line keep on the fiery line if i can't shoot no more god give me grace to pass the ammunition hallelujah paul tell timothy don't act like a civilian you're a soldier don't get caught up in the affairs of the world you have a mission you're here for a purpose don't get caught up in secondary things our mission is not to get caught up in the world don't look like the world dressed like the world act like the world we carry scars from our past life sure things we've done things we're still ashamed of but that don't define who i am i remember i remember jessica my daughter had to put a feeding tube in her because she was her brain was so damaged she couldn't swallow she lost her ability to swallow so they had to feed her through her stomach and after the lord jesus raised her up and she got better you've all seen the video that they made i trust you having but she came through the house one day and she pulled up her little shirt and she always told her she was special because right above her navel is where they put the feeding tube and so i always told her i said jessica you're special you got two belly buttons she come to the house one day and she pulled her shirt up she said daddy when's that scar going to go away i said honey that's going to be there for a while but it's okay it's all right well that was good enough for her she just went on through the house playing and i'll never forget i was sitting at the table i was studying genesis 24. eliezer fetching the bride for isaac i was looking at that and i was sitting there and i began to pray and i said god i said you could take that scar from her and you've done so much for her it would be a sin for me to doubt that you could do that i know you can take that scar from her and while i was there all of a sudden i felt this warm feeling come over me it wasn't an olive voice but it was a voice just as clear as i've ever heard a voice and this voice said i could take that scar from her and i just laid my head down i never moved i just laid down on the table and i just laid there and it seemed like forever brother david but it must have been like two or three minutes or something and i just laid there never moved and i felt it come on me again just this warm feeling anybody ever know what i'm talking about just a warm feeling and this voice spoke to me and said i could take that from her but i left it so that every time you see it it'll remind you of where i brought her from i wonder sometimes brother david if the scars in my life from my past life i wonder sometimes if god am i forgiven yes god don't even remember that i ever done it it's dropped in his bleach never to be remembered against me no more but the scars and i wonder sometimes if god don't leave those scars so that you can look at those things and remember this is where he brought you from lord oh god what an awesome god we're chosen by god to be soldiers sometimes we get so busy living we forget what we're really living for listen to me church should not be a part of your life church should not be a part of your life it should be your life it should be our lives for this is not the church this is just the building where the church gathers you're the church don't entangle yourself in the cares of the world paul knew what it meant to endure hardships paul said i fought a good fight i kept the faith i was in prison i was cold i was hungry but i kept the faith i was beaten but i kept the faith i was rejected but i kept the faith i was persecuted but i kept the faith let us be like paul let us be like paul i was laughed at but i kept the faith i lost my job because of what i believed but i kept the faith i had great sorrow but i kept the faith my wife got sick but i kept the faith the trials were great the grief was hard but i did not turn back i did not quit i kept the faith stay focused keep your eyes on the goal know what we're marching to don't get entangled in the fires of the world that you may focus on pleasing him who have chosen you to be a soldier as a soldier of the cross our motives our objectives our aim is to please him can i have just a few more minutes like enoch look enoch walked with god and he was not because god took him because before enoch's translation he had this testimony that he pleased god our main objective in life is not to come on is to please our god come on let it be sad to be let it be said of you daryl was not being was not david was not joe was not because they had this testimony in the midst of hardships in the midst of great battlefront in the midst of the war raging they kept the faith they pleased me how do we please god we please god by keeping his word i have chosen you to be a soldier you see my brother my sister i am what god says i am i am what god says i am i was chosen by god to be a soldier i am

identified with what i'm saying if it don't apply to you no hard feelings you just sit still don't stand because your friend stands or your girlfriend stands or your boyfriend stands but if it applies

us i am a soldier chosen by god i will not lay my weapon down i will fight the good fight of faith i will overcome amen that is who i am that is who i am do you love you listen to me i joined the army when i was young like i told you because i wanted to get an education and i wanted to see the world and i joined this army i was with the 18th airborne corps fort bragg north carolina i was with the first and 73rd field artillery we could be anywhere in the world in 24 hours ready to fight our life expectancy was in battle was like 90 seconds or something like that i was on an advanced party that we moved into an area and we drove the enemy out of the area so we could bring our guns in and set our guns down so we come in on helicopters and we jumped out of helicopters and engaged the enemy never had to do it in person but i did do it a lot playing army and i enjoyed it with those blanks so it was so much fun when they were blanks but that was what my job was and i wanted to see the world when i graduated from basic training you know where they sent me fort bragg north carolina one state over from where i live six hours from home i spent all four years in north carolina how could that be i put him for korea i put it for germany i put in for any place i could put in for but nope you're needful essential personnel you're needful so i got out of the army that was 21 year old on december the 21st 1981 it was that day on a sunday afternoon that i found out for four years i had been in the wrong army i was actually chosen by god for his army and since i have been in god's army god by his grace and i say it humbly but god has allowed me to be in over 32 countries i'm not saying that bragging brother david but i'm saying it because i'm i'm trying to get you to understand he will give you the desires of your heart are you a soldier tonight is this is where you stand we're not on a picnic we're in a battlefront and the battle's raging like never before but we are victorious my mama she died of cancer in 2005 brother sister's coming she died in 2005 with cancer but i'll never forget what my mama told me it stayed with me for years she told me one day she was down to 84 pounds and she said daryl i may have cancer but cancer does not have me i may endure hardships and battles and trials but they do not define who i am a soldier in the army of my lord and i'll hope for that hour little brothers well i can stand before him and lay my weapon down and study war no more but until then if god give me grace if the devil knocks every tooth i have out god give me the grace to get up and gum him to death because we are soldiers of the living god never forget who you are never where you're at right now never let it define who you are your struggles and your weaknesses and your battle don't let it define who you are remember no matter how hard the battle you're a soldier remember who you are amen do you love him let's battle her let's bow our hands heavenly father lord i want to thank you god i want to thank you for loving me lord i want to thank you for choosing me lord lord i didn't choose this i didn't volunteer for this but before the foundation of the world you chose me wrote my name in your book for such an hour as this lord i could have been in wesley's day i could have been to luther's day when he battled the catholic church for the movement of reformation i could have been in jesus day and stood there and ate the meal that we spoke about this morning but oh god you and your wisdom placed me in this hour of lai honestly you placed me here lord and you never put me here to lose you never put me here to to be defeated you never put me here just to survive i don't have the t-shirt that says i survive layout see you

bed lord laying on their bed at night maybe when they're out in the field sometime and they look up in the stars seem like they speak to him lord may they realize it's you calling them them to come lord into the rightful position and lord if they be one here today may they hear the recruitment lord may they hear the voice of the commander-in-chief saying i have chosen you for my army and may they surrender to that call lord i pray father there be some here sick i pray in the name of jesus by the same anointing that raised my lord from the grave may that same anointing move upon them lord

thank you lord thank you lord you enjoy brother daryl today amen let's give him a hand let him know we appreciated it amen hey man he's a soldier a good soldier a good soldier doesn't entangle himself with the affairs of this life he man we endure his hardness and brother daryl's been an example of that in his life and so we appreciate him and we'll continue to pray for him and with him and that god will continue to use him and i think he was better this time than last time so a few months off he may feel the effects of it after after leaving but let's pray for him that god will just give him strength and he'll be able to to go out and preach you know the devil wants to stop preachers the devil wants to stop preachers but god hath still has men amen that can preach the truth stand in the gospel and preach the truth and has been given that not only the ability but to live the life and and to be the kind of the kind of christian that god would call us to be but brandon said if you're not a preacher don't try to preach he said live your sermon but if you are a preacher he said preach your sermon and live it too amen that's what we've seen with our brother amen let's bow our heads together uh if we could play i'm amazed that you love me if you know that i'm amazed that you care and let's just bow our heads together and just thank the lord for what he's done for us today you know god's able to meet and i believe he has met your needs today and mine as well and we know that he's a real god these are the times that really matter in our lives the times that we spend in his presence so we thank god for that everything else we do like brother daryl said church is not a part of our life church is our life because we are the church of the living god it's so wonderful that he loves us let's just talk to him for a moment heavenly father we thank you for what you've done for us today thank you for your blessings lord thank you for your mercy thank you for our brother for bringing him by our way lord brother daryl lord give him strength and lord and just peace in his mind his heart and help his family lord financially and spiritually in every other way father i pray that you just cause us to come lord closer to you every day help us to be real soldiers lord to stand up lord as we all stood together and said declared that we would not quit we would not give up lord i pray that it would be so and lord that we would never give up that we'll still be there the greatest things in my life is to go somewhere lord and see someone serving the lord maybe years later go back and they're still serving god it means so much to us and i pray god that it would be so with us that if brother darrell will come back by if the lord tarries in 10 years or 20 years we'd still
