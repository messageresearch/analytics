Sing it. I love [music] Jesus. Sing [music and singing] it. How I love Jesus [singing] [music] because [singing] he first love to me he is so wonderful. all to me.

Uh you can be seated for just a moment. That's all the music we'll [music] have at this time. Amen. Did you enjoy the worship this morning? &gt;&gt; I trust that you did. Uh just a couple of announcements before we go on into the service. Um, we've uh, you may have noticed we're doing some construction around the uh, the churchyard and we're adding a fence, actually two fences, one around the playground and one around this area out back and to protect our children from the highway mostly. And uh, so I'm thankful for the brothers had the vision to do that. That should be done this week. They'll be completed with that. But there's a couple of holes out there in the ground on the playground. So, they may have covered those up with plywood, but just kind of watch your kids until they get that done. And um if you want to help us with that, I haven't really opened that up to the church. I've never had to ask. We've never had to ask for money. You all are wonderful in your giving and your tithing and things like that, but if you do have some extra that you wanted to help out with something specific, u we we are paying for that out of the church. And so, you'd sure be welcome to help. Just see Brother David or one of the trustees. we'd be glad to glad to have you assist with that. And and I'm I'm thankful we're adding a a basketball goal and volleyball. I know a lot of people say, "What do we need that for?" Well, it's because we got about 50 kids running around. And we'd much rather have them out here than down at the gym or somewhere else, you know, and and so we sure uh we we love to see them fellowship. We want to see them grow to love one another and just be a real body. And we're here a lot of times on Sunday afternoons all day some of us. And so we sure we sure want to see that fellowship grow and that love for one another. So we're doing everything we can for our young people and to do that. And so uh that'll be a part of that. It's not real expensive, but it's just something that we're doing to try to help out. Uh they got put new windows in the sides of the church. So you may not notice that, but it it'll be a help, I'm sure, uh with uh upgraded windows. And thank you to all those who helped. you know who you are who assisted in uh getting those for us and installing those. Thank you for doing that. It it matters. Every little thing matters. I think we ought to keep up the house of God. We got a Christmas program for the kids on uh December uh 21st at evening. If you want to come for that, I'm sure they'd appreciate that. Keep that in mind. On New Year's Eve, we're going to do [snorts] a very special service that night. It's a Wednesday night, so it'll be a regular service. We're not going to have a a 4-hour service on that Wednesday night, but maybe you don't normally come on Wednesday night, and you'd be able to that Wednesday because the next day is New Year's. We're off of work and school. So, if you're able to come to that service, we're going to have a joint service that night with Christian Tabernacle. They're letting out their service and brother Jason Jackson is going to be preaching for us that night. So, I thank God for fellowship and we wanted to reach out and and do everything we can to promote that. So, they're going to be here with us on December 31st and I know a lot of people are gone and and and whatever on the first of the year, but if you're here or can come to that service, we'd sure appreciate it in the interest of fellowship. And we may, depends on how it works out, we may serve communion that night. If we don't, then we'll serve it the next Sunday instead of doing it tonight so we can have communion to begin the year. Do you love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Is he wonderful to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Let's stand and bow our heads together. It's good to have all of our visitors with us this morning. God bless you, each one of you. Pray the service will be a blessing to you. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful to be in your house again today. Lord, you're wonderful to us. Lord, what could we say? As David said, what could I return unto the Lord for all that he has done for me, Lord? And he said, I'll pay my vows in the congregation. I will take the cup of salvation. Help us to drink from it this morning. May your word open up to us, oh God. May we may we recognize who you are and what you've done for us, Lord, and what what your name means to us. We thank you for it this morning, Lord. I pray you'd heal every sick person. I I pray under the sound of my voice that there's a backslider here, a sick person, whatever it is, Lord, you'd meet that need today. I pray you would do it. We thank you for your spirit we feel here in the building. I pray it would continue to be here, Lord, throughout the day. We thank you for it in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you. Matthew chapter 1 verse 21 and also Matthew 12 21. Matthew 1:21 and Matthew 12 21. I want to speak to you this morning on his name. In his name. Matthew 1 21. [snorts] Turning there. Just give you a little bit of time to do that. Matthew chapter 1 verse 21. and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. What was his name? &gt;&gt; Jesus. For he shall save his people from their sins. And then Matthew 12 and verse 21. Matthew 12 [snorts] 21. and in his name. Someone say it with me. His name &gt;&gt; shall all the Gentiles trust. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this morning. We talked Wednesday night about the Nyian council of 325 AD and the significance of that. If you didn't weren't able to be here for that service, I uh you probably should go back and watch it. just some things that have happened recently uh that uh they're bringing about another Nika and another ecumenical council and we know the impact of that the main uh impact of the nyian council was to change the baptism formula from the name of the lord Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ to the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. Now, some would say, "Well, that's what the Bible says in Matthew 28:19. It says, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and and of the Holy Ghost." But we know that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not names, but they're titles. &gt;&gt; They're titles. So, he said, "Baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost." So, there many titles for God in the scripture. Moses said uh when he come to God, you know, he he they knew God by titles, but they didn't know his name. And in Egypt, where Moses was taught, there were about 1,500 deities. And those deities would uh each one have a name based on what they did. So, Osiris was the god of the underworld, and Raw was the god of of uh forget what Raw was the god of, but he was the god of something else. And they had a god of for each specific thing. Everything had a god, deities for different cities and and so they would want to know what the name is because they would want to know what that god did. Right? &gt;&gt; So, but what God told him, it's interesting. Instead of saying, "Here's my name. By my name, you'll know what I do." He said, "I am that I am." So, in other words, what I do is who I am. &gt;&gt; Right? You'll know be know me by my works. So, he said, "I am that I am." And we know in the Old Testament, he was Elohim. He was Jehovah. And all the different uh redemptive names of God and Jehovah, the almighty God, the El Shadai. We know that he went by very many uh different things when he came to earth as the son of God. He he was called many things but his name was Jesus. Luke 2:21 says when 8 days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child it said his name was called Jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. And since that time, everything. Someone say it with me. Everything that is done is done in that name. &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because the name was more than just a it was more than just a a title. It was more than just a uh just an idea. But the name was actually a person. It had attributes. It had uh it had abilities. It had it was God in flesh. He didn't tell us about an abstract idea. It wasn't what somebody said about God, but all that God was, he poured into Christ. And so that name tells us exactly who God was and how he would interact. Aren't you glad? Because when that name come to the earth, he he he didn't just go to the good people. He he went to the sinners like you and I. And he he sat with sinners and he he fellowship with people and he and he poured out his life for us. He healed the sick. We know who God is because of Jesus Christ. Aren't you glad for that today? &gt;&gt; So we we the Old Testament was a figure, a type of him. It showed shadows of him. But in the New Testament, he come down with his name. He was called Jesus. And he was named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. So there's life in his name. In John chapter 20 and verse 31, it it talks about how there were many things that could been written, could have been written. But it said, "But these are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God." THAT'S STILL THE gospel message. By the way, we want you to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing you might have life through his name. &gt;&gt; So believing in him, you have life through his name. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We are to perform the great commission in his name. In Mark 16 and verse 17, these signs shall follow them that believe in my name. Shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it in my name? They shall cast out devils. What are we doing? We're performing the great commission not on OUR OWN MERITS, NOT WITH OUR OWN ABILITIES, not with our own attributes, but in the name and the attributes of Jesus Christ. Whatever his name is is who he is. Whatever he is is able to heal, is able to He proved that when he was here, able to save, able to deliver. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still able today. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still Jesus. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he is? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Getting a little bit of ringing in my ear. I don't think you can hear it out there, but [snorts] maybe turn me down just a little. I'm hollering at people. I think in Acts chapter 2 and verse 38, are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Repent, be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ." So Peter tells us, he opens the door for the Gentiles to tell us what the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost is. And that name is Jesus Christ. And you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that's the promise of the Holy Ghost. It's tied to being baptized in his name. This was the only way people were baptized in scripture. Yeah. How many knows that they were never baptized in the titles of father, son, and holy ghost. In the Bible in Acts 8:1 16, it says they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. In Acts 19 and five, it says when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Peter raised the lame man at the gate. Beautiful in his name. &gt;&gt; In his name. It said Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have I give I thee." So he's saying, "I do have something. I'm going to give it to thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Rise up and walk." I believe there's still power in his name. [laughter] If there's a lame man HERE THIS MORNING, GOD'S ABLE TO RAISE THEM UP. IF THERE'S A SICK PERSON HERE THIS MORNING, GOD'S ABLE TO HEAL in the name of Jesus Christ. Uh, don't you realize what an important thing it was in our day that that name come back to us that we were able now to understand the the mystery of the name of Jesus Christ that had been hid. It was one of those loose ends that had been uh that needed to be tied up that had been hid from by denominational CREED SINCE NIKA. BUT NOW IT'S BEEN REVEALED. WHY? BECAUSE AT the end time there had to BE A BRIDE WHO WOULD PERFORM THOSE MIRACLES IN HIS NAME who would DO WHAT HE CALLED THEM TO DO. THERE'S GOT TO BE A PEOPLE ON THE EARTH AT THE END TIME WHO WILL NOT JUST CALL THEMSELVES BY THE NAME OF JESUS, BUT WHO WILL OPERATE IN THAT NAME, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO, WE'RE CALLED TO SOMETHING HIGHER THAN JUST GOING TO CHURCH. LET ME PREACH HERE FOR JUST A MINUTE. WE'RE CALLED FOR SOMETHING HIGHER THAN JUST WARM A CHURCH FEW. WE'RE CALLED FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST TO BE ANOTHER ANOTHER CHURCH, ANOTHER BUNCH OF PEOPLE. WE'RE CALLED TO PERFORM THE WILL OF GOD AS HIS BODY ON THE EARTH IN HIS NAME TO CAST OUT DEVILS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't mean it'll be something flashy. I don't mean we'll run around emptying hospitals, but we'll do the will of the father in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Acts 4 and:e 10 it says, "Be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel." Well, this is Peter explaining how this lame man was healed that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucify, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. Everything in the book of Acts was done in his name. &gt;&gt; In Colossians 3:17, Paul tells us as Gentiles, he says, "Whatsoever," someone say, "whatsoever." whatsoever you do. Now, think about this for a minute and I want us to think more deeply about it than just maybe the words of it, but think about what this means and how to apply this in our own lives. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you do in word or deed, &gt;&gt; do how much? &gt;&gt; All. &gt;&gt; See, you can't hate your neighbor &gt;&gt; in the name. &gt;&gt; That's right. You can't commit sin in the name. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You can't live like the devil in the name. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You can you can talk about the message. You can you you can say, "I'm a believer." You can claim to believe in a pillar of fire and a prophet, BUT IF YOU CAN'T DO WHAT you do in the name. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Just saying I'm a Christian is not enough. Saying I'm a message believer is not enough. But can you does YOUR LIFE BEAR OUT that everything you do is in the name of the Lord Jesus? Giving thanks to God and the father BY HIM. HE SAID DO EVERYTHING IN THE NAME. GO to work IN THE NAME. &gt;&gt; GO TO CHURCH IN THE NAME. I started to say spank your kids in the name. But love your children in the name. [laughter] Take care OF THE CHURCH IN THE NAME. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH me now? UH WHATEVER YOU DO, WHAT WHATEVER whatever you you have in YOUR LIFE, DO IT IN THE NAME. HOW CAN YOU DO IT IN THE NAME IF it's contrary to the word, you can't do it. But but you've got to be in the name of the Lord Jesus. Do it in the name of the Lord Jesus. Speak it in the name of the Lord Jesus. We know that everything IN HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL BOW TO THAT NAME. YOU'LL FIND THAT in Philippians chapter 2:10. HE SAID, "EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW AND EVERY TONGUE confess &gt;&gt; what to the in the name of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 2 and2 tells us that the Ephesian church age knew that name. They knew that name. And in verse two, it said, "I know thy works and thy labor and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil. And thou HAS TRIED THEM WHICH SAY THEY are apostles and are not, has found them liars, &gt;&gt; AND HAST BORNE AND HAST PATIENCE, AND for my name's sake hast labored, and hast not fainted." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, he repeats that. He said, "These believers weren't laboring for Paul or for AN ORGANIZATION." COME ON. I know there's a lot of work that's done around the church, and I I know sometimes we get weary and welloing and and it seems like it falls on a few PEOPLE THAT DO A LOT OF the work. BUT I'LL SAY THIS, YOU'RE NOT DOING IT FOR PAUL. YOU'RE NOT DOING IT FOR AN ORGANIZATION. YOU'RE NOT DOING IT FOR BROTHER BRANDHAM. You're not DOING IT FOR THIS CHURCH. YOU'RE DOING IT FOR JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE DOING IT IN THE NAME. WHATEVER YOU DO, IF YOU'RE A DEACON, be a deacon in the name. IF YOU'RE A TRUSTEE, BE A TRUSTEE IN THE NAME. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW? DO IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR, DO IT IN THE name of JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR CHILDREN, DO IT IN THE name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So now, these believers weren't laboring for Paul. THEY WEREN'T COMMITTED TO PROGRAMS and institutions whereby they built up holdings of value. They worked for the Lord. And and that's WHY WE CAN PROMOTE OTHER CHURCHES, NOT JUST OUR OWN. THAT'S WHY WE CAN FELLOWSHIP WITH OTHER PEOPLE, NOT JUST THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE, RIGHT? WE'RE IT'S NOT JUST US. LISTEN, IF WE'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE IT IN, AND I'M THE ONLY PREACHER THAT'S RIGHT, SOMETHING'S WRONG. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE A FAILURE BECAUSE HE SAID THERE WILL BE THERE WILL BE TWO IN ONE BED. ONE WILL BE TAKEN TO THE OTHER LEFT. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD, THERE WILL BE SOMEBODY WHO'LL BE LIVING AT THAT SAME TIME THAT'LL BE TAKEN UP. THERE'S GOD'S PEOPLE ARE EVERYWHERE, CHURCH. HE'S GOT A BRIDE. IT MAY NOT BE HUGE. IT MAY BE A SMALL NUMBER, BUT HE'S GOT A BRIDE EVERYWHERE. LET ME BE PART OF THAT BRIDE. LET ME PUT MY SHOULDER TO THE WILL AND DO EVERYTHING THAT I DO IN THE NAME OF THE LORD Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you do IT IN THE NAME? SO, AND THAT THAT CHALLENGES US IN EVERY AREA OF OUR LIFE. CAN I CAN I WORK THIS JOB IN THE name of the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; CAN I RAISE MY CHILDREN THIS WAY IN THE NAME of the Lord Jesus? CAN I WEAR THESE CLOTHES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; CAN I LIVE THIS WAY IN the name of the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us today. &gt;&gt; They work for the Lord. They were his servants, not the pawns of organization. I like that. They didn't go to church ON SUNDAY AND TALK ABOUT THAT NAME AND THEN forget it the rest of the week. &gt;&gt; They didn't give lip service to that name. NO, SIR. IT WAS THEIR LIVES THAT WERE GIVEN. THEIR LIVES. OH, FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE A LARGE NUMBER, BUT FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD GIVE THEIR LIVES TO HIM, THAT WOULD SAY, "I'M WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS IN THE NAME." WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE GOING TO CHURCH, BUT IN THE NAME. WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE DOING WHAT'S RIGHT, BUT IN THE NAME. WE MAY FEEL LIKE HOLDING A GRUDGE OR A ROOE OF BITTERNESS, BUT IN THE NAME, WE FORGIVE OTHERS IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE DID WHEN HE CAME. &gt;&gt; In the name. Good. &gt;&gt; In that name they acted. All they did they did in that name, in that name they acted. But if they could not act in that name and they refrained from acting. [snorts] These were heavenly placed Christians whose behavior was in the Lord. Listen church. We're not trying to make you conform to church behavior. That's why we're not legalistic. &gt;&gt; Listen, I I know people think, "Well, if I don't do certain things, the pastor will treat me bad." That's not going to happen here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't do things that way. I don't mistreat you because you did something I don't approve of. &gt;&gt; God help me today. I know sometimes you like, "Well, the pastor doesn't love me. Just you you have to believe me on this. If I miss you in some way or didn't do something I should have done, it was an oversight. It's not in my heart to do that. I I want to serve God in his name." And that means serving his people. It doesn't matter if you're the weakest Christian in the church or the most advanced in the church or or it doesn't matter to me how you live. It didn't matter to Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'll still LOVE YOU. BUT I GOT TO PREACH THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; I got to preach THE WORD. AND WHAT I WANT IS NOT FOR YOU TO TO LISTEN AND OBEY BECAUSE I SAID IT. I DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST DRESS RIGHT BECAUSE THE PASTOR'S going to get on to you if YOU DON'T. I WANT YOU TO DRESS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE IN HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A HEAVENLY PLACE CHRISTIAN. IF YOU CAN'T DO IT IN THE NAME, then you refrain from acting. Good. Very good. &gt;&gt; Think about it, CHURCH. IF YOU CAN'T DO IT IN HIS NAME, JUST DON'T DO IT. &gt;&gt; YOU can't drink alcohol in his name. You can't Come on, church. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN'T GET DRUNK IN HIS NAME. YOU CAN'T BE HIGH ON DRUGS IN HIS NAME. THERE'S CERTAIN CLOTHES YOU CAN'T WEAR IN HIS NAME. WHY? BECAUSE HIS WORD IS HIS NAME. I'M GONNA SHOW IT TO YOU AFTER A WHILE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE THE WORD SAYS NOT TO DO IT. I JUST I WOULD I WOULD TELL YOU GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE WORD AND GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE SPIRIT AND LET THAT RULE YOUR LIFE AND LET THIS BE A PLACE OF BIRTHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE BORN BY THE WORD INTO FULL MATURE CHILDREN of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; THAT COULD STAND IN THE name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not where some man stands up here with a with a shovel, like whack-a-mole ready to beat you down every time you come up. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WE CAN'T DO THAT IN HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THE BIBLE TELLS US PASTORS NOT TO BE LORDS over God's heritage. &gt;&gt; We don't do THAT IN HIS NAME. BUT IN HIS NAME, I PREACH THE GOSPEL. IN HIS NAME, WHEN THESE OTHER BROTHERS STAND UP HERE, THEY PREACH THE GOSPEL. PREACH THE WORD IN HIS NAME. SING THE SONGS IN HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; SO, let me I can't preach my own opinion in his name. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Could only preach the word in his name. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I have opinions. have many opinions, &gt;&gt; but that don't mean that I I can stand on those opinions. I got to stand on the word because I stand in his name. &gt;&gt; That false vine group, he said, that wanted to defile that name. Hung like skullking wolves in the dark, waiting to get in and tear down, but the saints stood the test. Kept the word and the name. I went here with Homer Longoria last night and it really blessed me because he was talking about how that he brought them out of the wilderness, the children of Israel out of the wilderness and God told him, he said, "I did that to prove you and to see what was in your heart." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's kind of what I'm saying this morning is you got to stand the test and keep the word in his name. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And many times we go through the things that we're going through because he's going to prove us. He wants to see what's in our heart, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Is is the love for his name IN OUR HEART? YEAH. &gt;&gt; SEE, the Ephesians church age has lost that. Revelation 2:4. It said, "Nevertheless, I HAVE SOMEWHAT AGAINST THEE BECAUSE THOU HAST LEFT THY first love." Oh, oh, God. We see it. It's so evident so many times in church. And I don't mean, again, I'M NOT SCOLDING YOU, BUT you can see when people begin to to back up from from THE WORD. AND I don't mean back up from church as much as back up from the word, THEY BEGIN TO QUESTION. They begin to wonder, "Is it really for me?" And and as they do, they they begin to that that fervent desire to please God, IT BEGINS TO DIE DOWN. AND AND that cry in THE SPIRIT AND HOW THEY USED TO GET INTO THE SERVICES. DO YOU REMEMBER A TIME WHEN THE LORD USED TO BLESS YOU AND THINGS USED TO MATTER TO YOU AND THE MESSAGE WAS REAL TO YOU AND YOU LOVE FEEDING ON IT AND YOU JUST KIND OF BACKED UP AND GOT OUT OF IT. LISTEN TO ME. YOU THERE THERE'S A WAY BACK. WHAT IS IT? IN HIS NAME. CAN YOU DO IT IN HIS NAME? &gt;&gt; DON'T LOSE YOUR FIRST LOVE FOR HIS NAME. DON'T LOSE YOUR FIRST LOVE FOR HIS WORD. THE EPHESIAN church lost THEIR LOVE AND THAT'S HOW IT ENDED UP AT the Nian council. Yes. &gt;&gt; The fervent DESIRE TO PLEASE GOD, THE PASSION TO KNOW HIS WORD, THE CRY FOR REACHING OUT IN THE SPIRIT, ALL BEGIN TO FADE. AND INSTEAD OF THAT CHURCH BEING ON FIRE WITH THE FIRE OF GOD, IT COOLED OFF AND BECOME A BIT FORMAL. LISTEN, WE'LL FIGHT AGAINST THAT SPIRIT. EVERY TIME WE COME TO THE PULPIT, WE DON'T WANT A FORMAL CHURCH. WE DON'T WANT JUST ANOTHER ANOTHER DEAD RELIGION. WE WE SERVE GOD IN HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; You can't listen. If you want TO SIT LIKE A BUMP ON A PICKLE, THAT'S FINE. BUT I IN HIS NAME, I WORSHIP GOD. I WORSHIP HIM BECAUSE HE'S HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I believe he's here. A prophet come to tell us that we don't want to get a bit formal. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We want to worship God in his name. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's easy to get a bit formal, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, why? How do you know that? Because I can do it. I've done it. &gt;&gt; It's easy to get a bit formal, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you just lose that fire. I'm not talking about running around the building. &gt;&gt; Talking about that just desire to please God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The desire we see in some of these kids, they just want to please the Lord. &gt;&gt; Their consciences are tender. Some of us adults get to the place where we our conscience aren't tender anymore. &gt;&gt; God help us today. &gt;&gt; We We want to please him, don't we? &gt;&gt; We don't want to just know the name. We want to love that name. &gt;&gt; Oh, as we saying, oh, how I love Jesus. &gt;&gt; THAT OUGHT TO MEAN SOMETHING TO US. We sing Jesus is the sweetest NAME I KNOW. THAT OUGHT TO MEAN SOMETHING TO US. WE SING THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT NAME. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT NAME. IT OUGHT TO MEAN SOMETHING TO US. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. We don't want to just know it. We want to love it. When the name of Jesus is mentioned, SOMETHING BEGINS TO HAPPEN. IT DON'T HAPPEN OUT HERE IN THE WORLD. THEY CUSS in his name and everything else. But when we mention his name, it brings something to us cuz IT'S A HEART CONDITION. IT'S NOT JUST A NAME WE SPEAK FROM THE LIPS, BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE IN OUR HEART. &gt;&gt; In his name, devils are cast out. &gt;&gt; And to cast out devils in his name is not just to use his name like a magic word, &gt;&gt; right? Because today, you know, everybody's got t-shirts and mugs and &gt;&gt; got the name of Jesus on it, &gt;&gt; but his name is precious to me. &gt;&gt; It's not just a t-shirt or a mug. And I'm not condemning you for that, but that's that's commercialism. They're making money off of that. &gt;&gt; Oh, but his name is precious. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to speak IT IN A IN A WAY THAT MY CHILDREN KNOW THAT THERE'S a reverence for it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's a reverence for that name. It's not a magic word. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE JUST USE TO GET OUT OF TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; It's not a GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A REALITY OF THE NAME OF Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Acts chapter 19:1, the Bible tells us that God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul. &gt;&gt; SO THAT FROM HIS BODY WERE BROUGHT INTO THE SICK HANDKERCHIEF OR aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them. Then certain of the vagabond Jews exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus. So a bunch of flim flam artists, bunch of uh conmen, right? we would say today &gt;&gt; much of modern charismatics &gt;&gt; I don't mean to be hard but that's you know that's what it become and I'm sure many of them people are sincere in the charismatic church but a lot of the leaders &gt;&gt; right and they took it upon themselves to CALL OVER THEM WHICH HAD EVIL SPIRITS saying we adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth &gt;&gt; now this IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CAST OUT A DEVIL BY THE JESUS THAT YOUR PASTOR PREACHES. &gt;&gt; That's true, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? YOU CAN'T CAST OUT A DEVIL BY THE JESUS THAT BECAUSE YOU KNEW SOME GREAT MAN OR YOU KNEW A PROPHET OR YOU KNEW THE SON OF A PROPHET OR YOU KNEW YOU KNEW A CHURCH, YOU KNEW WORD OF LIFE TABERNACLE OR YOU KNEW DANNY WARD OR YOU KNEW HARVEY SAVAGE OR YOU KNEW SOME GREAT MAN SOMEWHERE. YOU CAN'T CALL OUT, LISTEN, YOU CAN'T CAST OUT A DEVIL BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY AND YOU KNOW THEY TRUST IN THE NAME OF JESUS. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE a life that matches up to that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because they said, "WE ADJURE YOU BY JESUS WHOM PAUL PREACHETH." AND THERE WERE SEVEN sons of onekeva, a Jew and chief of the priest which did so. And the evil spirit answered, and now watch, these were seven denominational sons all out trying to cast out devils. And the evil spirit answered and said, "Jesus I know and Paul I know, &gt;&gt; but who are you?" &gt;&gt; You talk about embarrassing, &gt;&gt; right? These seven guys, you know, they got all their their their church service going, got the organ going, got the music going, and got to dancing and worshiping in the spirit. if it was today, you know, and they got the anointing oil. They got buckets of it, you know, and and they walk down there and they're going to cast out this devil and and they get that devil together and they just pour the baptize them in the anointing oil and and speak in tongues over and everything else and and come out and say, "We adjure you in the name that Paul preaches." &gt;&gt; You realize what how Satan would LIKE TO BRING THAT RIGHT DOWN INTO THE MESSAGE AND SAY, "WE ADJURE YOU BY THE GOD THAT WILLIAM BRANDOM HAD." BUT THAT CAN'T BE THE GOD THAT THAT'S THE SAME GOD WE HAVE. BUT WILLIAM BRANDHAM DID HIS JOB. BROTHER BRANDHAM DID HIS JOB. WE'VE GOT TO DO OUR JOB. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T ADJURE SATAN BY THE NAME OF WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAD. AND SAY, "WELL, I'M FAITHFUL TO THE TEACHINGS OF SOME MAN." NO, IT'S GOT TO BE THE WORD IN YOU RECREATING ITSELF, BIRTHING ITSELF, A LIVING THING. &gt;&gt; YES, [applause] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; SEE, THEY THEY KNEW THAT THEY KNEW WHAT PAUL TAUGHT ABOUT, but they didn't know him. They didn't know Christ. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Who are you?" And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them. They went out to help somebody. There's a good lesson in this, by the way. &gt;&gt; You better make sure before you go dealing with evil spirits that you're strong enough. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go be a witness in in the bar. Well, you better make sure &gt;&gt; that you're strong enough to overcome that &gt;&gt; that evil spirit will come off on you. &gt;&gt; Prevailed against them. So they fled out of the house naked and wounded. Talk about embarrassing. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Their fall you'll be made known. The Bible says &gt;&gt; Janice and Jambers the imitators. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus. And fear fell on them all. And the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. YOU SAY, "BROTHER BEN, WHAT ABOUT THE IMITATORS? WHAT ABOUT THE COPYCATS? WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE OUT AND AND CAUSED PEOPLE TO BLASPHEME? IN IT ALL, THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS IS MAGNIFIED BECAUSE THE FACT THAT THERE'S A FALSE JUST HIGHLIGHTS THAT THERE IS A REAL." &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; The demon said, "Who are you, brother?" That's what's the matter today. You can't get up at the altar and say, "Well, hallelujah. Hallelujah, Lord. I want the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah." No. Brother, sister, when the Holy Ghost has inspired the word to you, &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. There's got to be an inspiration. When you HEAR ACTS 2:38 AND IT SAID, "REPENT and be baptized in the name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST." YOU'RE NOT JUST DOING IT FOR YOURSELF. You're doing it because THE HOLY GHOST INSPIRED THE WORD TO YOU. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Not doing IT JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY I KNOW THERE'S FOLKS HERE MAYBE THAT HAVEN'T been baptized correctly yet. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS, WHEN THAT WORD IS INSPIRED TO YOU, THERE WON'T BE NOBODY BE ABLE TO KEEP YOU OUT OF THE BAPTISMAL POOL. &gt;&gt; YOU'LL BE LIKE THE MAN SAID, "WHAT DOES HINDER ME FROM BEING BAPTIZED?" &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BAPTIZED BY THE SIDE. OH, SISTER STEPHANIE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I PREACHED ON BAPTISM ONE SUNDAY AND THE NEXT SUNDAY, BROTHER TRIP AND SISTER STEPHANIE WERE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS. AND BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING INSPIRED THEIR HEART, &gt;&gt; IT WAS that Sunday, actually, WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T EVEN PLAN TO BAPTIZE THEM, BUT SOMETHING GOT IN THEIR HEART, THEY WANTED TO BE BAPTIZED. OH, THAT GOD WOULD DROP IN THE HEARTS OF OUR CHILDREN. DROP IN THE HEARTS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. DROP IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE THE STRANGERS AMONG US. OH LORD, I WANT TO BE RIGHT. I WANT TO BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST BECAUSE I WANT THE LIFE OF THAT NAME. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND THAT HOLY GHOST WILL KEEP YOU. IT'LL HELP YOU. IT'LL BE A COMFORT TO YOU. YOU MIGHT GO THROUGH SOME TRIALS, BUT IT'LL BE THERE FOR YOU EVERY MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he said, "Brother, sister, when the Holy Ghost has inspired that word to you, listen to the power of the name. When the HOLY GHOST HAS INSPIRED THAT WORD TO YOU, YOU'LL GET IT BEFORE YOU LEAVE your seat." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard him tell A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE, HE SAID, "YOU YOUNG PEOPLE COME UP." HE SAID, "I SEEN YOU COMING TO PRAY AT THE ALTAR." HE SAID, "YOU JUST COME REJOICING AND COME AND THANK GOD FOR WHAT HE DID FOR YOU." HE SAID, "HE SAVED YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN LEFT YOUR SEAT." HE SAID, "WHEN YOU DECIDED TO COME." &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. YES. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING IN YOU. HE SAID, "BURN UP." &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THE PREACHER WON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU TO DO THIS AND do that. &gt;&gt; The old LEAVES WILL JUST DROP OFF AND NEW LEAVES WILL COME ON. IT'S INSPIRED TO YOU. YOU WON'T GET ANGRY WITH THE PREACHER WHEN HE PREACHES TRUTH FROM THE BIBLE. YOU'LL LOVE IT AND REACH FOR IT. IT'S FOOD TO YOUR SOUL." &gt;&gt; Even Jesus himself, HE SAID, "I DO NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO WITHIN MYSELF." HE SAID, "THE SON COULD DO NOTHING BUT WHAT HE SEES THE FATHER DOING." HE WAS EMMANUEL HIMSELF. GLORY. HE WAS GOD ON EARTH. JESUS WAS, HE WAS THE FLESH THAT GOD DWELT IN. HE WAS THE TENT THAT GOD LIVED UNDER. &gt;&gt; BUT IN ALL OF THAT, THE VIRGIN BORN SON OF GOD, EMMANUEL IN THE FULLNESS OF THE SPIRIT. HE HAD THAT SPIRIT WITHOUT MEASURE. AND YET IN HIS OWN FLESH, HE SAID, "I DO NOTHING UNTIL THE FATHER SHOWS me first." Inspired to him to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You remember when he was tempted, the devil said, "If you're the if you're who you say you are," he said, "turn these stones into bread." And brother Brandham uses that example and said he did he wouldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; But when one day there were 5,000 that needed to be fed. &gt;&gt; And he proved he COULD DO IT. &gt;&gt; BUT HE WOULDN'T DO NOTHING UNLESS GOD TOLD HIM TO. &gt;&gt; Let's the father OH, COME ON, CHURCH. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO BE. GOT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE WHERE WE HAVE THE THE WILL OF GOD. WE HAVE THUS SAYETH THE LORD OR WE KEEP STILL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; You know they say music I don't know a lot about music but I've been told that that the difference in a good musician and a great musician is not not how they play but knowing when not to play. &gt;&gt; And we love our musicians but but you know knowing when not to play is a great thing. That pause. &gt;&gt; Some of the old comedians were great. They say because of the pause. that they knew how to pause. Paul Harvey on the radio, he knew how to pause, &gt;&gt; right? Know when not to talk. &gt;&gt; Oh, God help me. I want to have thus SAYETH THE LORD OR don't say anything at all. &gt;&gt; Huh? Preachers are known by when they if they know how to quit. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Y'all going to turn that on me before we get done. He said, "Don't try to impersonate." That's what's the matter with Pentecost today. That's what's the matter with the church today. There's too many trying to impersonate. They got the Holy Ghost. Too many trying to impersonate divine healing. You can't do that. That thing's come by election. God calling. You're dropped from the mother's womb with that. Gifts and callings are without repentance. But if God calls YOU, BE THE MOST THANKFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD BECAUSE HE'S CALLED YOU. THEN IT BECOMES REAL TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HE TALKED ABOUT HATTIE RIGHT. HOW HAD HE RIGHT THERE was just it WAS IN HER TO DO WHAT SHE DID. HE SAID SHE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. HE SAID, "UNLESS IT WAS INSPIRED TO HER TO DO IT, &gt;&gt; IT HAD TO BE." OH, COME ON, CHURCH. WE'RE NOT OUT HERE JUST UH WE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD. BUT WE'RE NOT OUT HERE JUST SPEAKING THINGS WILLY-NILLY. WHY ARE WE NOT DOING THAT? YOU SAY, "WELL, IF YOU HAVE THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD, speak that hospital empty and speak your children all THIS AND ALL THAT." NO, WE CAN ONLY SPEAK BY THE INSPIRATION OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU NEED IT AND when the inspiration comes, he'll it'll BE THERE AND HE'LL BACK UP HIS WORD. It happened to the right woman at the right time and she was inspired. Brother Brandon said, "HOW COULD THAT EVER HAPPEN? It couldn't have done it, but it was inspired quickened. The word was spoken. It was made so." &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. I BELIEVE THAT'S THE TIME WE'RE LIVING IN. DON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THE RAPTURE. HE SAID, "I'M WORRIED I MIGHT MISS THE RAPTURE." DON'T BE WORRIED, LITTLE BRIDE. REMEMBER, HE SAID HE SPOKE IT AND IT WAS SO. GLORY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO TO THE RAPTURE SERMON, BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "IT'S BEEN SPOKEN. SO SHALL IT BE DONE." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I know men want to Do you KNOW WHY PEOPLE PREACH FEAR AND CONDEMNATION all the time? Well, you might miss it. You might if you go against my word if you leave my church. You might miss THE RAPTURE. YOU KNOW WHY THEY PREACH LIKE THAT? Because they want to be the one that holds the KEY OVER WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAVED. BUT LISTEN, YOU WERE IN THE MIND OF GOD BEFORE YOU EVER MET ME. BEFORE YOU EVER HEARD ME PREACH, BEFORE YOU EVER COME TO THIS CHURCH, YOU WERE IN THE MIND OF GOD. YOU DON'T BELONG TO A PREACHER. YOU BELONG TO GOD. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I DON'T HOLD THE KEY OVER YOU OR WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING IN THE RAPTURE, BUT THAT'S THAT SECRET HID IN YOUR OWN HEART. AND IF IT WAS SPOKEN, IT'LL BE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THE WORD WAS SPOKEN. IT WAS MADE SO. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. WE'RE GOING TO SEE OUR LOVED ONES ONE DAY. I FEEL LIKE PREACHING THIS MORNING. WE'RE GOING TO SEE THEM ONE OF THESE DAYS. THEY'RE GOING TO APPEAR BEFORE US. WHY? NOT BECAUSE WE WERE GOOD PEOPLE. NOT BECAUSE WE WERE THE BEST SINGERS OR THE BEST PREACHERS, BUT BECAUSE THE WORD WAS SPOKEN. AND IT'LL BE SO. A PROPHET OF GOD STOOD ON THE EARTH SAID THERE'LL BE A SWEEP COME OVER US. PAUL STOOD THERE AND SAID, "AND WE SHALL NOT ALL SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL ALL BE CHANGED IN A MOMENT, IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE, AND WE HALLELUJAH. We'll be gathered together with them to meet our Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got to &gt;&gt; I got to move on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we ought TO REST ON THAT, CHURCH. THE WORD, IT WAS SPOKEN. IT WAS MADE. SO &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; you become a Christian BECAUSE GOD SPOKE HIS word and he made it come to pass. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Good sir. &gt;&gt; He talked about how Paul just didn't go when he come in the ship. He said, "Be of good courage." He said, "Not one of you is going to die." He didn't just do that because he felt sorry for him. &gt;&gt; He didn't do that because that he saw a vision. &gt;&gt; Right? God spoke to him. It was inspired to him. But I want to say to you today, the word has been inspired. I've told you before, GOD INSPIRED SOMETHING TO MY HEART. BROTHER DAVID, YOU HAVE THAT TESTIMONY. NONE OF MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE LOST. GOD INSPIRED SOMETHING TO MY HEART. NONE OF MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE LOST. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT I KNOW IT'S AN INSPIRATION. IT'S MORE THAN JUST A WORD ON THE ON THE PAGE, BUT IT'S AN INSPIRATION. I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother Brandham talked about he said, "Your faith is all right, brother. Your faith is wonderful, but until the thing is inspired to you, talked about stopping at a red light." He said, "You sitting there and your your car is revving." I'm not reading all these quotes just to save time, but he said, "Your car is revving at the you got the your foot on the brake and the gas, you know, your car is you're getting ready to go, but he said until the green light comes, &gt;&gt; you don't go. Just because you have the power to do it and the gas to do it, &gt;&gt; right? And the car is firing doesn't mean you go. You go when the green light comes. &gt;&gt; One of these days, OH MY, WE'RE SITTING ON GO. WE'RE WAITING ON THE RAPTURE. SITTING ON GO. ONE OF THESE DAYS IT'S GOING TO GO. IT'S GOING TO BE TIME. &gt;&gt; It'll be inspired to us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But if it's going to be inspired, it's got to be in you already. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham continues on in that. He said, "The sons of went out and said, we adjure you in the name of Jesus who Paul preached, come out." He said, "Paul, I know. And Jesus, I know, but who are you?" See, it's got to be inspired to you. &gt;&gt; And and and if it's going to be inspired to you, the time to get that inspiration or to get in the word for that inspiration is not when you need to cast out a devil, &gt;&gt; but get right with God first, &gt;&gt; then go and speak as you're inspired to speak. &gt;&gt; I know we talk about demons and things, and they weren't just a thing in the Bible, but we fight spiritual wickedness in heavenly places. I'm going somewhere this morning. So, you just hang with me. &gt;&gt; You said, "I thought you going to preach about the name." That's what we're preaching about. &gt;&gt; And we're going to get to where I'm going after a little while, but I'm almost out of time. Revelation chapter 9 and verse 16 talks about 200 million demons were bound in the river Euphrates that have been released. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about how they were released in the natural realm. We talked about some about it. So, I won't go over all of it. We talked some about it Wednesday night. They were released in the natural realm. Those spiritual horses, he said, were released. That Roman spirit, persecution of the Jews and Hitler and Ikeman, he said, but the bride won't go through the tribulation. They're perfected by his blood. And yet those spirits have been released. He said in in an ecclesiastical way, &gt;&gt; right? An ecclesiastical spirit. He said, and made the statement. He said, "Now 20 years later after that war, the Second World War, and now we're some 60 years beyond that or more." He said 2020 years later after that war we see the loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit. He talked about how the moon darkened when the pope visited Jerusalem. He talked about how that they were loosed in flatteries and and cunningness and church right now. We're seeing that COME BACK AROUND AND we're seeing THINGS HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED. A POPE FROM AMERICA GOING OVER AND SPEAKING AT THE VERY SPOT WHERE THE NIAN COUNCIL WAS held and and having COMMUNION WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT THAT THEY'VE DONE IT IN THAT WAY IN HISTORY. THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR A REASON. THE WORLD COUNCIL MEETING AGAIN, THAT'S ALL HAPPENED this year. &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE AT, CHURCH? &gt;&gt; Those demons are real. They've been loose. They were loosed back then, &gt;&gt; right? And they've been here, &gt;&gt; and so we TALKED ABOUT HOW SOMETIMES WE FIGHT NATURAL battles or spiritual battles and we try to fight them in a natural way, &gt;&gt; right? We get mad at one another, we get upset about the church or something like that. And in reality, that's not what we should do. We should recognize there's there's a spiritual warfare going on, &gt;&gt; right? So, it's not your brother or your sister, but there's something going on. There's something in the air, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. You ever heard that? &gt;&gt; Bunch of people start having kids in a city. They say, "There's something in the water." &gt;&gt; Right? Well, there's something in the water. &gt;&gt; There's something in the air. Bunch of people start acting up. &gt;&gt; There's something in the air. people acting like demons and devils and then dressing like cats and dogs AND AND DOING ALL THAT THEY DO. THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE AIR. &gt;&gt; OH, BUT I'M SO GLAD THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE IN THE AIR OF PEOPLE SEATED IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WHO ARE WARING AGAINST THAT THING. &gt;&gt; There's something in the air. It's not the people that are inspired by devils. &gt;&gt; Huh? [snorts] &gt;&gt; So, and brother Brandon said she's loosed. She's loosed to call all these little loose ends. Right. Revelation 10:7, he would tie up all the loose ends. The the the the the [snorts] uh mystery of God should be finished. That word finished is to tie up the loose ends. He said all these loose ends. Oh well, don't make any difference anyhow. &gt;&gt; Right? So that's the time we're living in. Those demons have been loosed among us. &gt;&gt; Right? But the Holy Spirit is also here &gt;&gt; now. Now in the garden, see the woman in the garden. I want you to understand this because I heard this so much as a young Christian because in Genesis 3:4, you'll find it. I won't read it at the same time. But but here Eve is is talking to the serpent. And we heard a lot about that. Brother Brandham talks a lot about it. We heard a lot about that stressed on that how the woman fell and how we don't need to be like that woman. But brother Brandon makes a statement. There will be a bride who will not be like that. And &gt;&gt; it won't be because they're smarter than Eve &gt;&gt; or go to a better church than Eve did. It'd be hard to beat Eve's pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just saying. &gt;&gt; Cuz God come down in the &gt;&gt; cool of the evening, had church with them. &gt;&gt; It'd be hard to beat him, &gt;&gt; right? So they had a good pastor. &gt;&gt; Everything was perfect. No trials, no trouble. &gt;&gt; No tribulation of any kind. [laughter] And yet she listened to the Satan's LIE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT BEEN SEALED. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand makes the statement the serpent got to her first. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Her womb had not been sealed. &gt;&gt; Our womb, our spiritual womb is our mind and our heart. It's got TO BE SEALED. THERE'S GOT TO BE IT DROPS FROM HER MIND, GOES INTO OUR HEART. BUT THERE'S A PEOPLE WHOSE HEART WHO'S BEEN SEALED BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, BY THE TOKEN IN THIS DAY. AND THEY CANNOT BE DECEIVED OR YOU WILL NOT BE LIKE EVE. YOU WILL NOT FALL LIKE YOU BECAUSE THERE'S A PEOPLE WHO have that. So you say, "Well, I don't want to be deceived." GET THE HOLY GHOST. Let him let him fill your life. Let him refill you over and over again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you're only sealed once, but he'll refill you if you ask him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; But but it was a deceiving spirit that come to her and said, "God don't mean what he says. These little loose ends don't matter." the deceiving leot in spirit rich and increased with goods lukewarm halfway Christians deceived by Satan's lie. &gt;&gt; Oh church, it's a great thing in this hour. How will we resist this devil and cast him out &gt;&gt; in his name? &gt;&gt; James 4:7 says, "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he'll flee from you." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to look at this now as we kind of change course and we we get to the end here in just a moment. He only accepts worship in the place where he put his name. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the place where he put his name. &gt;&gt; What was the place that he put his name? Brother Brandham explains that in God's only provided place of worship. He explains that and he goes to Deuteronomy 12:5. Unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there. Even unto his habitation shall you seek and thither thou shalt come. He what is the father's name? Think about it. Jesus said I come in the father's name. What is the father's name? That's the place where he wants us to worship is where his name is. Right? Matthew 1:23 is where brother Brandham takes us. Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel. Oh my. which being interpreted is God with us. God with us. Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; He said Emmanuel. His name was Jesus. God with us with his father's name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where's the place WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO PUT HIS NAME? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You're going TO PUT IT IN CHRIST. He puts his his name in Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; God with us. There's where God placed his name in his son. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT YOU CAN WORSHIP HIM. I KNOW PEOPLE TEACH YOU HAVE TO WORSHIP AT THIS CHURCH OR THAT church or the bride's revival's OVER HERE OR THE BRIDE'S REVIVAL'S DOWN THERE. YOU GOT TO MOVE THIS PLACE OR THAT PLACE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT TRUE. COME ON. &gt;&gt; MAYBE GOOD PEOPLE IN GOOD CHURCHES, BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. HE SAID, "LO, WHEN THEY SHALL SAY UNTO YOU, HE'S IN A SECRET CORNER. He's in THE DESERT." HE SAID, "DON'T BELIEVE IT." HE SAID, "BUT BUT BUT THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN YOU GOT TO WORSHIP GOD IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH." WHERE IS HE? HE'S RIGHT HERE WITH YOU. YOU WANT THE REVIVAL, THEN PARTICIPATE IN IT. YOU WANT TO BE IN A CHURCH ON FIRE, BE A CHURCH ON FIRE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; The only PLACE WHERE THAT GOD WILL EVER MEET YOU IS NOT THESE FOUR WALLS. &gt;&gt; That's right. CUZ SOMEDAY WE MAY HAVE TO TEAR THIS DOWN AND BUILD ANOTHER ONE &gt;&gt; OR IT MIGHT BLOW AWAY IN A TORNADO. GOD FORBID, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT BUT THE IT MIGHT SHAKE DOWN IN AN EARTHQUAKE. EVERYTHING THAT MAN MADE IS GOING TO FAIL. &gt;&gt; GOD DID NOT PLACE HIS NAME IN THESE FOUR WALLS, BUT HE PUT HIS NAME IN EMMANUEL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He said the only place, that's the only place you're going to worship him. The only place God will ever meet you is in that sun, which was typed by the sacrificial lamb. So he meets you at his house. Hallelujah. His house was Christ. The Lord JESUS CHRIST WAS HIS HOUSE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE BODY HE MADE. That's the Lord Jesus is his house. His son ALL DOWN THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT. ALL BROUGHT TYPES OF THAT ONE THING THAT THAT PLACE ALONE. WELL, GOD ALONE MET UNDER THE SACRIFICIAL BLOOD. It's the ONLY PLACE HE MET. THE ONLY PLACES HE MEETS TODAY IS NOT IN THE name of a CREED OR IN A NAME OF A DENOMINATION, A NAME OF A CHURCH OR A NAME OF A GROUP OR A NAME OF A SOCIETY, BUT IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT TODAY THAT IF WE'RE MEETING TOGETHER, HE SAID WHERE TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER IN MY NAME. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, I WILL BE THERE WITH THEM. EMMANUEL, GOD WITH US. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Can we go just a little bit further? &gt;&gt; In my name, they shall cast out devils. He said that's the name of the father. He put his name in Jesus Christ and in him he meets to worship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In him he MEETS TO CAST OUT DEVILS. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE DEVILS YOU MEET MAY NOT BE HERE AT THE CHURCH. THEY MAY BE AT HOME. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NEED TO CAST OUT A DEVIL OUT OF YOUR OWN HOME. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NEED TO CAST OUT A DEVIL GOING ON DOWN THE STREET OR WHATEVER IT IS, BUT YOU HE DIDN'T JUST SAY YOU CAN CAST OUT DEVILS IN THE CHURCH. BUT IN MY NAME, THEY SHALL CAST OUT DEVILS. &gt;&gt; And he never said that ONLY A PREACHER CAN CAST OUT DEVILS. HE NEVER SAID ONLY A PREACHER COULD PRAY FOR THE SICK. BUT HE SAID IN MY NAME, THE BELIEVERS, &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL CAST OUT DEVILS. THEY'LL PRAY FOR THE SICK IF THEY DRINK ANY DEADLY thing that won't harm them. Oh, listen. You're bulletproof, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU with me now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. In him. In what? The name. You young people understand that. In the name. &gt;&gt; In him. He said he meets to save and filled with the HOLY GHOST. THAT'S GOD'S ONLY PLACE TO meet people for worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's so many infallible proofs that Jesus is the place. HE'S THE GATE. HE'S THE NAME AND THE ONLY PROVIDED WAY THAT GOD HAS FOR man to meet and worship. He is the way, the truth, the life, the gate, the door. Are you beginning TO GET THE PICTURE? THE ALPHA, THE OMEGA, THE BEGINNING AND ENDING, ROSE OF SHARON, LILY OF THE VALLEY, THE MORNING STAR, THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA. HE IS ALL THE WHOLE THING PUT TOGETHER. HE SAID, "HE IS BOTH ROOT AND OFFSPRING OF DAVID, THE BRIDE AND MORNING STAR, AND HIM DWELLS THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY. WHERE WE IN THERE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO GOD &gt;&gt; in God's Godhead." &gt;&gt; I hope you hear me. I know some of y'all are hurting this morning and you're maybe you're sick and body. Some of y'all going through some serious TRIALS IN YOUR LIFE. BUT IF YOU JUST LISTEN FOR JUST A MOMENT, LISTEN, THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. THAT'S OUR POSITION. DON'T LET THE DEVIL BEAT YOU OUT OF THAT AND SAY, "CUZ YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING." NO, YOU'RE IN HIS NAME. YOU'RE YOU BELONG TO HIM. IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN SAVED, IF YOU'VE EVER RECEIVED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, YOU BELONG TO HIM. &gt;&gt; AND THAT LUKEWARM, COLD, FORMAL SPIRIT TRYING TO MAKE YOU DISINTERESTED IN CHURCH, TRYING TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE OF GOD WHEN YOU NEED TO REBUKE THAT IN HIS NAME. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He said, "Yes, as sons and daughters, we're in the family." If you're in there and you get in the family 1 Corinthians 12:13, for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, the bride not only speaks in his name. We don't always only talk about Jesus, but we live in his name. &gt;&gt; In him we live and move and have our being. &gt;&gt; We were inspired to live in heavenly places. Even though the age is lukewarm and backslid, DECEIVED BY SATAN'S LIE. THAT'S NOT MY STORY. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. Some of you COME FROM ROUGH BACKGROUNDS. I KNOW SOME OF Y'ALL'S BACKGROUNDS. I KNOW MY BACKGROUND. I KNOW SOME OF Y'ALL COME THROUGH SOME THINGS. I'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME THINGS. WE'VE ALL GOT A STORY. BUT THAT'S NOT THE END OF OUR STORY. YOU MIGHT HAVE COME THROUGH SOME THINGS, BUT GOD WASN'T DONE WITH YOU YET. YOU MIGHT HAVE FACED SOME TRIALS, BUT GOD WASN'T DONE WITH YOU. ARE YOU HEARING ME THIS MORNING? HE HE WANTS TO BRING YOU INTO HIS BODY, INTO HIS NAME. BY ONE SPIRIT, WE'RE BAPTIZED INTO THAT BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT BE TIRED THIS MORNING, BUT YOU'RE IN HIS NAME. YOU MIGHT OH MY YOU YOU MIGHT BE WEARY BUT YOU'RE YOU MIGHT BE SICK BUT YOU'RE IN HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; You belong to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said now we've already resurrected the dynamics and the mechanics has gone to work quickened us and we're quickened up into the presence of God where his spirit is. WE'RE A PART OF IT. IF YOU'RE PART OF THE BRIDE, YOU ARE BECAUSE THE BRIDE IS PART OF THE GROOM, YOU KNOW. SO WE FIND OUT IT'S THE SAME THING AND SHE'LL DO JUST EXACTLY WHAT'S PREDICTED FOR HER TO DO IN THIS DAY. SHE WON'T BE A LEOA. NOT BY NO MEANS A LUKEWARM, BUT SHE'LL BE ON FIRE FOR GOD. SHE'LL BE MOVING ON IN THE spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John 5:43, I am come in my father's name. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "You receive me not. If another shall come in his own name, him you'll receive." &gt;&gt; But the ram said, "The father put his own name, which is Jesus, in the Son, [snorts] and he's the way. He's the door. He's the house. &gt;&gt; He's where God chose to put his name. &gt;&gt; He said God never put his name in me. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; God never put his name in me. &gt;&gt; He never PUT IT IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER PUT IT IN THE METHODIST, BAPTIST, CATHOLIC. &gt;&gt; HE PUT IT IN CHRIST, THE ANOINTED EMMANUEL. &gt;&gt; And the name is IN THE WORD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE IS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. What is he then? The word interpreted. This is powerful. Is the manifestation of the name of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God. THEN WHAT WAS THE OPENING OF THE WORD IN OUR DAY? IT'S THE MANIFESTATION. WHAT WAS THE OPENING OF THE SEALS? WHAT WAS GOD DOING IN OUR DAY? IT WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE NAME OF GOD SHOWING US HIS ATTRIBUTES. SHOWING US HIS PRESENCE. SHOWING US THAT. OH, COME ON, CHURCH. HE'S ALREADY HERE WITH US. SHOWING US THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. SHOWING US HE'S STILL A HEALER, SHOWING US HE'S STILL A SAVIOR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHEN THE WORLD'S GONE CRAZY AND 200 MILLION DEMONS HAVE BEEN RELEASED EVEN ON THE BRIDE, BUT WE KNOW, HALLELUJAH, WE KNOW HIS NAME. AND THE NAME IS IN THE WORD, and the word IS INTERPRETED AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE name of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "No wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who I am. AND UPON THIS ROCK, I'LL BUILD MY PLACE OF WORSHIP, AND THE GATES OF HELL CAN'T SHAKE IT DOWN." LISTEN, THINGS COULD HAPPEN TO THIS CHURCH, BUT THERE WILL BE NOTHING SHAKE DOWN THE NAME OF GOD AND THE CHURCH OF GOD WHICH IS BUILT BY REVELATION OF HIS NAME. THERE'LL BE NOTHING SHAKE THAT CHURCH. THIS PLACE MIGHT BE SHAKEN. EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE SHAKEN WILL BE SHAKEN. BUT THAT CHURCH OF GOD will never &gt;&gt; shake down. I want to be part of it. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Oh, he said he said, "Amen. Oh living church of God, stand in firm foundation on Jesus Christ alone." Oh, &gt;&gt; we we don't owe allegiance to any other name &gt;&gt; but the name of Jesus. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The message reveals that to us. That's why I believe the message. &gt;&gt; The prophet stood there and said, "Behold the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He revealed Jesus to me. God in a prophet revealed Jesus to me. How do you fight one of them 200 million demons that comes down that spirit of depression? In his name. How do you get rid of a demon of cancer? In his name. [snorts] H how do you raise your family? In his name. &gt;&gt; How do I bring my loved ones in? You're gonna get it after a while. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, if I repeat it, he's going to preach longer." But [snorts] Listen, it's time to pick up our shield of faith. I'm I'm nearly done. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Pick up our shield of faith. What we left off with on Wednesday night, you'll find that in Ephesians 6. If you go to Ephesians 6 and look at the the action words in that verse, it's take and stand. &gt;&gt; Take &gt;&gt; the shield of faith &gt;&gt; and stand. &gt;&gt; Take the sword of the spirit, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And stand. Right? &gt;&gt; What are you standing in? &gt;&gt; Who are you standing on? &gt;&gt; On stand firm on Jesus Christ alone. &gt;&gt; Stand in his name. Paul tells us to stand and and and take. You remember in the book of Revelation, Revelation 10:8, John is told to take the little book, &gt;&gt; right? Go and take the little book &gt;&gt; from the hand of him that sits on the throne. Stand in his name and you'll win every battle. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT STANDING ON OUR OWN. WE'RE NOT EVEN STANDING JUST WITH OUR CHURCH OR THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE. WE'RE STANDING in his name. &gt;&gt; IN HIS NAME, YOU CAN STAND AGAINST THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE ENEMY. LISTEN TO ME. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SCHOOL, STAND IN HIS NAME. YOU THAT ARE HOMESCHOOLED, STAND IN HIS NAME. OH, COME ON. I KNOW THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS IN CHURCH. THERE'LL BE PROBLEMS IN THE YOUTH GROUP. THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS ALL AROUND. WE'RE A REGULAR CHURCH. IT'S NOT A UTOPIA. WE'RE A BUNCH OF BELIEVERS, BUT WE'RE ALL WE'VE ALL GOT FLESH. WE'VE ALL GOT A STICKY NATURE, BUT IN HIS NAME, WE STAND. WE GOT SOMETHING BIGGER GOING ON. IN HIS NAME, come on, CHURCH. IN HIS NAME, WE FIGHT OUR BATTLES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'm closing with this. Musicians, go ahead and come there. I was reading recently about the Second World War, and I love history. I was reading about the Second World War and and [snorts] I was reading about a man named Teddy Roosevelt Jr. Now the famous Teddy Roosevelt was his father and you [snorts] know they say like father like son his his son was quite a character as well. He fought in the First World War and was injured. And then he [snorts] he had a he had a desire to make sure that the Normandy landings at D-Day happened correctly and that everything was done right and that they had good maps of the area, things like that. And so what he did is he actually he asked him, he petitioned him, he said, "Let me go in with the first wave on Utah Beach." Now, by this time he was 56 years old and he used a cane cuz he had arthritis, crippling arthritis. He was a one-star general. Generals didn't go into battle like that. I'm so glad ours did. But he was a one-star general and and he was 56 years old. USED A CANE TO walk and he had severe heart disease. In fact, he died about a month later, I believe it was, after he made the landing. with heart disease. He was the only general to land in the first wave. When they landed, they landed about a mile from their objective cuz they didn't have all the GPS and things that we do now. So, they kind of went in blindly and they didn't have any scope what was going on. So, that landing might have failed if he hadn't have been there because the general needed to see where to place the troops and things. So he was one of the first two men that hit the beach at Normandy at Utah Beach. And when he did that, everybody, you know, when they hit the beach, they fell to the ground. But not Teddy Roosevelt Jr. He just stood up. He had a cane, but he stood. He was limping. He was hurting. HE WAS SICK, BUT HE STOOD. Some of Y'ALL ARE HERE THIS MORNING. BROTHER MILL, YOU COME TO CHURCH THIS MORNING, YOU'RE STANDING. YOU MAY BE SEATED IN YOUR SEAT RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU'RE STANDING STANDING THERE ON THE BEACH. AND THEM YOUNG MEN LOOKED AT HIM. AND SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN LATER TESTIFIED. WE THOUGHT, "WELL, IF HE'S standing up, IT MUST NOT BE THAT BAD." Listen to me, church. There's other PEOPLE WATCHING YOUR LIFE. YOUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING YOUR LIFE. YOUR GRANDCHILDREN ARE WATCHING. THERE'S PEOPLE ALL AROUND YOU. WE'RE FIGHTING A BATTLE. THERE'S BULLETS FLYING EVERYWHERE. LET ME BE SOMEBODY WHO STANDS UP REGARDLESS OF MY CONDITION, REGARDLESS OF MY WEAKNESS. LET ME BE SOMEBODY THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE A CANE. I MIGHT WALK WITH A LIMB. BUT LET ME BE SOMEONE WHO will stand in the battle. STAND AND FACE THE BULLETS. STAND AGAINST the heat of the sun. Say I I believe. I'm not standing alone. Why was Teddy Roosevelt standing there? He [music] believed in the United States. He believed IN OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT. HE BELIEVED IN DEMOCRACY. HE BELIEVED HE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS GREATER THAN EVERY EVIL THING THAT THE NAZIS COULD PUT OUT. HE BELIEVED IN WHAT HE BELIEVED IN. He believed in the US. HE BELIEVED THEY WERE STANDING BEHIND HIM AND HE WASN'T STANDING ALONE. BUT ALL THE MIGHT OF THAT GREAT COUNTRY WAS STANDING WITH HIM. OH CHURCH, IF WE CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE NOT STANDING ALONE TODAY. LISTEN YOUNG PERSON, YOU'RE NOT STANDING ALONE IN THE BATTLE. YOU'RE NOT STANDING ALONE AT SCHOOL. YOU'RE NOT STANDING ALONE AT WORK. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU MAKE THAT STAND, WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO LIVE A HOLY AND PURE LIFE, WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO LIVE FOR GOD, WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO BE BAPTIZED IN HIS NAME, YOU ARE NOT STANDING ALONE. HE IS THERE WITH YOU. YOU are standing in his name. He said, "Stand alone with Jesus on that firm foundation. In his name, I'll cast out devils. In his name, they'll stand. Let me be one who stands." Would you stand with me today? Hallelujah. Oh, let me be one that stands. In the hour of temptation, which is the hour we're living in, the hour when THOSE DEMONS ARE TRYING TO TELL YOU the message doesn't matter. Doesn't matter how you do this or that OR THE OTHER. STAND THEREFORE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Your loins g WITH TRUTH AND THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE SHIELD OF FAITH. TAKE IT. STAND. Take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God. Stand against him. Be a hero and the strife. As long said, don't be like dumb driven cattle just doing what the world does going with every whim of culture. Let's stand church. LET'S NOT BE JUST ANOTHER CHURCH, another place where people gather. Let's stand. &gt;&gt; OTHER PEOPLE CAN DO THAT. YOU SAY, "WELL, EVERYBODY ELSE DOES THIS AND MAKES THESE DECISIONS." You stand. &gt;&gt; If you don't WANT YOUR KIDS COWERING DOWN IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION, STAND TODAY. &gt;&gt; If you DON'T WANT YOUR GRANDKIDS COWERING DOWN IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION, IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM LIVING A HALF COLD BACKSEAT LIFE, THEN STAND TODAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I don't know who I'm talking to today. Maybe it's just me. But I need to be Lord. I have that commitment in my heart. Let me stand &gt;&gt; in the hour of adversity. Let me stand cuz I know I'm standing in your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [singing] &gt;&gt; I am bow down. &gt;&gt; Just sing it to me before we pray. &gt;&gt; If you need prayer, the altar's open this morning.
