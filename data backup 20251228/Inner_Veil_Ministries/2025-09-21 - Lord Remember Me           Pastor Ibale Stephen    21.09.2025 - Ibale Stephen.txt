He wrote and said, "If Christ be not risen then my faith I don't know it would have been on veil." &gt;&gt; Yes. So we are happy because he rose. [Music] &gt;&gt; I am so happy for the resurrection.

[Music] Precious heavenly father, we give thanks and honor to you Lord for the grace that you have given to us to come before your presence. We just want to commit this day into your presence Lord that you may walk with us in the thought that you have given to us today. Be a blessing to us to the glory of your holy name in Jesus name. Amen. So I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh I trust by the grace of God that God will speak to us today. Amen. Amen. So I'll invite a song from the young people &gt;&gt; before we go into the reading of the word. You receive what you expect when you come to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You you expect a blessing. You always get a blessing. Amen. Amen. Now, &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Life can have so many crossroads. I find myself sometimes that I'm standing at the Red Sea and Pharaoh's bearing down. I have no board to flee across. So I raise this stuff for faith and I cry out, "Oh Lord, remember me." When I'm down in the valley, Lord, when I'm losing my way. When I'm down on my knees, Lord. Oh Lord, remember me when I'm down in the valley. Lord, when I'm losing my way, when I'm down on my knees, Lord, oh Lord, remember me. Sometimes I take the wrong road and I let the devil know that when you cut my prayer, I'm as powerless as any man. But like Samson in the dungeon, I'm blinded and scared. And I still cry out, "Lord, remember me, when I'm down in the valley, Lord, when I'm losing my way. When I'm down on my knees, Lord. Oh Lord, remember me. Like Hana in the temple, like Jabus, will you bless me? Like Joseph in a foreign land. Oh Lord, remember me [Music] like the three children, Lord. Like Daniel in the den of lions, I'm praying in Gethsemane. Lord, [Music] remember me when I'm down in the valley. Lord, when I'm losing my way, when I'm down on my knees, Lord, oh Lord, remember me. Like the thief on the cross, I'm at the end of my rope. But I know within my heart that my soul is a part of you. I know that I was there when the stars of the morning sun when you come into your kingom. Remember me. Oh, when I'm down in the valley, Lord, &gt;&gt; when I'm losing my way, remember when I'm down on my knees, Lord. Oh Lord, remember me like the thief from the cross. I'm at the end of my rope, but I know within my heart that my soul is a part of you. I know that I was there when the stars of the morning sun. So when you come into your kingdom, remember me. Oh, when I'm down in the valley, Lord, when I'm losing my way, when I'm down on my knees, Lord, oh Lord, remember me when I'm down in the valley, Lord, when I'm losing my way. when I'm down on my knees, Lord. Oh Lord, remember me. So when you come into your kingdom, remember me. [Music] [Applause] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord remember. Amen. Amen. How many of you say Lord remember? &gt;&gt; You never remember what you never heard. Amen. Amen. So the thief at the cross said, "Lord, remember he got a revelation that was part of the economy of God." Amen. Amen. So you are welcome to the house of the Lord and I trust that the Lord has been so good to you through the week since you are in the house of the Lord and I trust that you are looking forward for his grace and mercy. Sometimes God does things when you least expect them. Amen. Amen. when you least expect that God is going to do something for you. And that's today. God is going to do something for you. Amen. Amen. Just be expectant and be in the mood and say, "Lord, I am here." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just like the thief at the cross, just remember me. You don't bring any plea to him. You know, just say, "Lord, remember me." Each time people were at the last string of life, that's when they called for the Lord. Sometimes in our Christian walk, we get a little bit tired. And at that time, when you are tired and there is a he to say, Lord, remember amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are happy to be here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. and u uh sister provi family &gt;&gt; sister uh she has lost uh a sister &gt;&gt; and so they are not here with us today and the family of GJ also they are not here with us today but still we trust that the Lord will be gracious and reach reach them. Amen. Amen. They are not feeling well today. But God is gracious. &gt;&gt; Do you have anything you have need of from the Lord this morning? Just keep your hands open to receive from the Lord. Let us stand up and get into St. Luke chapter 23. And before we read the word, Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father, we pray today that you may accept us in your presence. And we pray that your grace may help our hearts to keep open that we may receive your word and have the liberty to store it anywhere in our souls because we need it. along this prim journey. Bless your children, the need ones that have come to feed. Feed them, Lord. Sick that you may heal them. And those who are thirsty. We pray that you may baptize them with the bosom of the Holy Ghost. We need you today Lord more than ever before in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. So St. Luke 23:42 Jesus is at the cross and on his left and on his right there are thieves &gt;&gt; that are hanging right there. So he's dying between male factors and that's now one of them was criticizing him. But one of them rebuked his friend and says we are here for a right cause. The wages of sin is death. But this man has done nothing. And this man turned to Jesus and he said unto Jesus, &gt;&gt; "Lord, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom." So this man is putting his hope far away. But Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily I say unto thee, today thou shalt be with me in paradise." Not when the kingdom comes. But that's how powerful the blood is. Right today, you'll be with me in paradise. May the Lord had bless in the reading of his word. So I today I have come to talk to the thief on the cross. The man who sometimes seems like he has come to the end of himself. Amen. So I want to talk to those who have thought like this could be their last church service unless God came out for them. I mean I'm talking to desperate souls. I'm talking about those who have been fighting to remain up. The devil wants to push them down. I want us to talk together. I mean, walk together. Amen. &gt;&gt; All the way from Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To our victory in Christ. Amen. Amen. So where the lamb you know was hanging out there and the whole world was in a state of gloom. But somehow somewhere, there was one man of all the entire world that had been able to gain the grace of God at the last minute of his life. Amen. And this man here is granted the grace literally when the blood was flowing. The blood of atonement to atone for the condition that had bothered all his life. Amen. So I'm going to take time And I want to go with you all the way from the cross to fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. All the way from the habits that bind us to the moment when we can say yes, we have fellowship with him. Moses in Leviticus 17:11, he spoke a New Testament scripture. And he says, "For the life of the flesh, is in the blood. And I have given you that life upon the altar." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The life is in the blood. But for you to have access to that life, you have to get the lamb and get it slain at the altar. Amen. So as long as you have got the lamb and the lamb has never been slain in your life, you don't have life. Amen. &gt;&gt; The life behind the perfect sacrifice was in the in the blood. And when released on the out of sacrifice, that life in the blood would flow into the soul of a man and bring a new birth unto him. by that new I mean by that life. So it's by the DNA in the blood that we can have a genetic inheritance. [Music] Amen. The character of the parent is in the blood. And at the cross, Christ released the image and likeness that man had lost at the fall. So that life was the image and likeness of God which Adam lost in the form. So God took the body of a man. Amen. And because of the blood which was not the blood of a man but the blood of God, he went to the cross release that life back to man again. So Christ at the cross is releasing the light behind the blood. He was our sin offering and besides him there were two men. Amen. On the left and on the right one mocked the sacrifice at the cross. mocked. Amen. Like they mock the preaching of the cross and they call it foolishness. But unto us which are saved, that foolishness of preaching of the cross is the power of God unto us to salvation. Look at that par. Now at the cross there was a man who was criticizing Christ. But on the other side, there is a man that had been able to recognize that much as he's dying a malf, he has got the ability to remember me when he comes in. Amen. Amen. So it always depends on what attitude you have towards the word. If you have got a negative attitude, the word will not benefit you. If you've got a positive attitude, there is enough power to redeem the thief at the cross this morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. So in the blood is instant power that recreates a repentant sin. into sons and daughters of God. God &gt;&gt; gave that fish the right words to say, &gt;&gt; "Lord, remember me." Lord, remember me. And we know very well that there is, you know, the lamb's book of life. And the names were put there before the foundation of the world. And you know when you are a child of God from before the foundation of the world, there will always be a still small voice that speaks behind. Each time you did wrong or you do wrong. Amen. There is a voice that reminds you you are supposed to be a son of God. Other than that, Amen. But that voice never die and that voice never gives up on that voice never gave up on the thing. Amen. Whenever I did anything wrong, there was a whisper that you are supposed to be a son of God. And you are not supposed to do what you are doing. Amen. And so this man here, he knew somehow somewhere I must be belonging to an economy. Amen. I must be somewhere in the lamb's book of life. And God inspired him to say the right word. Lord remember me. And that's our title this morning. Lord remember me. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that's nothing other than the revelation to know that he was a part of God's divine economy. He knew his name must be somewhere on the last book of life. There was a seed gene of life in him which was totally soiled with evil and wickedness. And when that seed came next to Christ, the darkness began to wash away. Are you together with me? The darkness began to wash away. And then this man here came out with the right thing. &gt;&gt; Lord, remember me. He felt like he was acting to him. Amen. He started feeling such a closeness. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the liberty &gt;&gt; to pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was something telling him, "You are supposed to be a son of God." He felt that liberty and he said, "Let me pray for eternal life. Let me ask you for eternal life. It's never too late." Amen. Because that voice lives with a thief. Amen. If he lives in the life of a drug addict is only crowded by a darkness. But there is a seed of life in him. Hallelujah. And once you keep coming closer to Christ, you are going to discover who you are. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The negative life you have lived so long may sometimes give you a wrong impression, that you cannot meet your atonement, that you cannot be saved, that you cannot be forgiven. words and whispers of the devil. But God holds your victory in his own heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even this morning, &gt;&gt; even this morning is waiting for the thief to say, "Lord, remember me." to come to a point where you feel like you've tried the best you can but you have come to the end of yourself and whenever you feel you come to the end of yourself then you need to call to the supernatural because you have to overcome the enemy to begin with he's a liar Amen. Because when Jesus says come unto me, all the mess of your past will tell you. That's a call to another man. It's not you. You are too dirty to go to him. He says come unto me. You look at yourself. You can never wash yourself. When he says come unto me is because he wants to wash you. Amen. So don't look at yourself. When he says come unto me, take a step and go to him. Amen. The man said, "Lord, remember me, when you come in your kingdom." And Christ responded to him the with the power &gt;&gt; that works in the blood. And that power is instant. Hallelujah. It doesn't wait for tomorrow. That power is instant. with the except that even now somebody's life can be transformed. Yeah. Because there is enough power in that blood to give a new birth. When he stands before you, he introduces himself and he says, "I am the resurrection and the life. He doesn't say I will be. He says I am. He holds the power on his presence. Not tomorrow. I will be. Not yesterday. I was but today. Amen. I am the resurrection and the life. It was so instant for the thief on the cross. Remember friends, it was so instant for Saul when he was going to Damascus breathing with anger to go and kill. That power is so instant that on one instant he was a murderer and then the next second he was an apostle. That's how the power of God works. Amen. Don't look at yourself. Look at the one who is calling you this morning. It was instant for Cornelius when the Holy Ghost baptized this church even before the water baptism. That's what God does. That power so instant. Amen. When the sons of hatrite, Amen were out there playing and mocking. But that power in the blood on an instant brought them under conviction and they were born again. Amen. Christ says today shalt thou be with me in paradise. The atonement is instant in its effect. Amen. That's what it is. So we shall take the subject of the feast and walk with him from from remember me to remembering the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here he says Lord remember me. But we want to go with him until we come to remembering the Lord &gt;&gt; that he remembered you. You must remember him. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So revelation was released with thief on the cross that he was not a son of pition though he had robbed all his life. He was not a son of pition. I want to go into the message of grace and in between there you'll just be able to pick what I want. I've pulled off a little bit from up and down. He says, "How could that thief help himself?" Did you hear brother's question? &gt;&gt; How could that thief help himself? If you are failing, how can you help yourself? You are like a thief that was at the cross. That's what the young people have been singing. Like a thief at the cross. You need revelation to release you from that condition. Amen. No more than Adam could help himself. No more than Eve could help us. No more than you can help yourself. No more than I can help myself. The sovereignity of the grace of God come to the dying thief today shalt thou be with me in paradise. The prophet says, "Think of it, &gt;&gt; you who was robbed all the years, you are so evil, but grace say today, you'll be with me." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Is sovereign grace from a sovereign one. You cannot question grace. If it chooses to save you, it has chosen to save you. Whether you are a thief on the cross today, you can be with me in paradise. So at the end of the road, he realized he had lived his life wrong. And if we have also lived our lives wrong, this is the chance for the open door. It's the chance for the open door. Amen. Deep down in your heart, There is a living cautious. There is a rebuke to the sinful life. And he say we are worth the death because the wages of sin is death. But what has this man done? The weight of sin was weighing on this man. to the extent that he had accepted the wages of sin. Amen. So don't take the rebuke that always talks to your heart lightly. You must respond to the rebuke with only three words. Lord, remember me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord remember me. &gt;&gt; When it comes from the bottom of your heart, &gt;&gt; you are testifying that I believe I have been part of the lamb's book of life. Amen. So the thief was a seed with the name on the lamb's book of life. And when the lamb met him, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; he was able to recognize him. &gt;&gt; There is a way God worked. &gt;&gt; Amen. That when Jesus met this man knew who he was and when this man here met Christ, there was something in him. that was saying this is a holy man. This is a perfect man. I wish I was like him. He did not have an understanding of who exactly was but he was saying this man is different from who I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is something when you come to church &gt;&gt; and you come to the presence of the word, you feel like you are a king to the word. When the word talks to you, but the problem is the voice of the thief which says that no, you cannot be set free. The power in the blood I want tell you it is instant. It dissolves the sinner's nature instantly and identifies him with eternal life. Are you together with me? This man here did not have to go through a training to discover he was a son of God. He was not taken through a catechism class. When revelation strikes, strikes immediately. It is so instant that you don't have to argue with anybody. Understand who you are. You understand what I mean? Because God deals with the seed of life. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Now this takes us to our scripture in John 5:24. He says, "Verily, verily I say unto you, He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me &gt;&gt; is because he has everlasting life. You hear, you believe because new there is everlasting life. There is a dramatized seed. Amen. Just like a grain of corn, if it's not dramatized, it will never rise, no matter how much fertilizer you put on it. But if it's if it has got a life in it, The moment it drops into the ground, it begins the process of germination. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this is what I believe. You as a son and daughter of God the moment you come into the presence in the atmosphere of the world. There is something in you that begins to pop up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. When the thief believed, he was justified like he never did it to me. And he became a candidate for the rapture immediately. Are you together with me? Immediately he became a candidate for the rapture. Amen. And even told him take you to the waiting lodge. Amen. Into the paradise. Because when the rapture comes, simply because you have received what instantly you become a candidate for the rapture. When we open for Christ, we are justified by faith on the instant. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, justification does not have a process or a period. Are you together with me? Justification is so instant. That's the power in the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And this is not by our faith. Amen. Because our faith fails is the faith of Jesus Christ. Therefore, your justification is an supernatural act like it was a supernatural act. For the life of the thief on the cross, he had robbed all the earth. How can he just tilt like that from death? It is instant. It cannot be done by anybody. It cannot be done by studying the Bible. You must have been in the economy of God. Amen. And then because you were there then God makes sure that brings you into the environment where the word is spoken and that's why you are here this morning. He brings you to the environment. He brings you to the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. which is good enough for the resurrection of the s. Amen. The faith of Jesus Christ checks out &gt;&gt; checks out in the lamb's book of life and on seeing your name Christ himself apply the life under the blood upon your soul. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when that life that's in the the word, you know, strikes your soul, what it does, it gives you a genetic inheritance. You understand these things. When we deal with blood, there is life in there. Are you together with me? So when this blood comes and connects itself to the seed on the inside here, &gt;&gt; then what we are talking about is a conception. Amen. And then a life begins to grow that you can no longer be known as a thief. You are now a son of God. You have been born again. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So atonement is a supernatural effect and it justified the thief so instantly. Listen now. and imputed unto him the righteousness of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because there was a genetic sentence here that the life that was controlling this man was not from the gene. It was from the human spirit. That's where the fall was and controlled him. So when this life come, it goes direct to the seed and there and then another life which is not connected to thievery to the begins to grow. Hallelujah. And once this life begins to grow, this other life that always bothered you begins to wither. That's what God does. That's the new bar. When God is forgiving you, he doesn't look back at the several hours behind the moment. He looks at the sincerity of the moment. Are you together with me? That's what God looks at. Because as long as when the lamb's book of life in the days of ignorance, whenever you did what you did, the Bible says, he we never saw you. That's the word. Thus the privilege of the sons and daughters of God also in the lamb's book of life. Immediately praise God immediately the economy of this man here. the nature his ways completely was transformed and became a candidate for the rapture. Amen. Amen. It's you who suffers with your human spirit. Because in the human spirit there is something we call memory. And you suffer with your memory. But in God's sight like you never did it. That's justification. Amen. So our prophet says human faith wasn't enough then it's not enough now. It takes the very faith of the son of God to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord of glory into the temple not made with heart. Amen. So your atonement is a supernatural act. &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural act and it releases the atonement instantly. Praise the Lord. We are justified by the faith of Jesus Christ. and therefore rendered righteous. It is imputed the moment you come to the altar and you say Lord forgive me. You walk away not with your righteousness, but you walk away with the righteousness of Jesus Christ, which is imputed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham says in the message speak to this rock. He says righteousness is the attribute of salvation. Amen. But people can quit smoking, drinking and everything and still not be saved. He says righteousness is an attribute of salvation. So when you come to confess the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior, what you are receiving is the righteousness of Jesus Christ is an attribute. Okay. When you say believe, righteousness is imputed on the internet because it's an inseparable property to salvation. It's the same. But if a man at the cross that was saved by grace lived beyond the cross. Amen. Then you would have been sustained by the blood and that is sanctification. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says we are saved by grace. &gt;&gt; But we are sustained by the blood. That's what it is. Grace saves you but the blood sustains and that is sanctification. So sanctification literally is hearing the word and believing by I mean living by its instruction that is righteousness. When the scripture says we are sanctified by the blood, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; what it means that it doesn't mean that there are basins of the blood where you are going to get and begin to wash yourself. What it means is that the life that was in the blood came back as the word to us. &gt;&gt; So the word which sanctifies us today is the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That's what Ephesians says. Amen. We are made clean by the washing waters of the word. Jesus said, "Now are you clean by the words I've spoken to you." So the word is the area of sanctification and we are not sanctified just for one day. the continuing process that the word keeps doing in our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the instruction of the word keeps separating you from the life that previously imprisoned you. Amen. for the purpose that God may bring you a holy service. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; So you sacrifice the things that bound you and that way you are being released for service. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now &gt;&gt; the word &gt;&gt; is our cleanser. &gt;&gt; Okay. When you study the word and you seen something there and you bow down to it and you say, "Lord, help me that this works in me." Then that's your sanctification. Will you be sanctified? Why? Because you in the word. The word sanctifies us. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; When Jesus came &gt;&gt; to do the work of redemption, &gt;&gt; he was instructed by the word, that which was written on him by the prophets. And when he obeyed and followed the instructions of the word, That word could not allow him to go on the left or the right. It led him straight to the cross. And by obeying the word, he was sanctifying himself. Hallelujah. For the call. Praise God. Just like the truth that was written about Christ sanctified him for our sake, we also was written about us. What sanctifies sanctification is not something that theoretical. Sanctification is you obeying the instructions of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 17 19. He says, "For their sakes I sanctify myself that they also &gt;&gt; might be sanctified through the truth. So when we study the word and we walk by the word, we are possessing our vessels unto sanctification. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's Thessalonians 4:4. Amen. possessing our vessels &gt;&gt; by obedience. &gt;&gt; And when you possess your vessel in obedience, that's sanctification. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let us look at ourselves at the cross. So I said I was going to deal with the fuse today of the cross saying Lord remember we just want to walk through the journey of our redemption. [Music] It's not something strange. is just eviding yourself so that God can work with you by you in you to bring you to what you are supposed to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus finds you at the cross dying because of your sin just like he met the thief. Amen. &gt;&gt; A real conviction where you come and say, "Lord, forgive is not just a m of a child who has been raised in a believer's family to say now that I have come to the age of responsibility, let me also go. There is a conviction that brings you into the house of God. There is a conviction that makes you cry out and say, "Lord, remember me." You see, we must come to such a conviction. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't try to run away from the conviction when the Holy Spirit brings it to you because that's the way God works. Maybe you came down here because of a, you know, a connection. Maybe because of my husband or because of my dad, but you need to allow God to meet you at the cross personally. Don't run away from the conviction because God is dealing with you at the cross and on the instant. Amen. When you are there and you come to that point, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, that's when Christ takes over your judgment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But the thief doesn't die as a sinner. Jesus takes his position as a sinner that he may be free. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes There is a way we fight the conviction. A man who is not a child of God does not suffer conviction like the thief other thief on the cross. He was not suffering his conviction. That was his nature. If you suffer conviction, you are a child of God. You see the thief, the wrong thief, &gt;&gt; the unrepentant thief, &gt;&gt; he kept mocking, there is no conviction. But when you are a child of God, take your conviction seriously because sanctification is a continuous process. If you are convicted of anything, it doesn't mean you are bad. It only means you need more of the blood. You just go and say Lord wash me even here now. So you and I are living on the other side of the cross and we are fully justified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are putting ourselves now in the position which that thief would have lived in if he had lived beyond the cross. Praise the Lord. Therefore is the cross where a Christian begins to battle with what Paul cause the works of the flesh. That man, if he had lived beyond the the cross, his human mind would still say, he has the ability to steal. But because he was dead, he didn't live into that battle. But you Christ met you on the cross and he redeemed. The redemption came to the soul. But your human spirit still has the memory of the wrong path you took from the cross. will declare a war. &gt;&gt; So when you believe, &gt;&gt; you come into regions of battle and then you enter the greatest battle for fall because the enemy Satan will keep whispering to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the past At this time beyond the cross becomes the shame and there is no way you can be exercised in your past. Amen without a painful soul. So Paul calls your past the works of the flesh. And he mentions some of them. He says adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, [Music] wrath, strife, Seditions, &gt;&gt; heresies, heresies, enviness, rein, so many things. So now those &gt;&gt; become your battlefront and you live &gt;&gt; in the battle zone. &gt;&gt; But what happens is that you step into Ephesians 6. Hallelujah. so that he can dress you with his armor. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that you can have the sword of the spirit. You have the helmet of salvation. You have the belt of faith. You have the sword of the word. You are armed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have now come from the negative. Now we have come to the positive army. That's now what we come to when the Lord allows us to live after the cross battle. Are you together with me? you come into battle time. So your heart's desire is now to step into the newness of life where you really feel like it's a responsibility on your side to live a life of appreciating what God has done. Nobody is going to push you. These are not works. It's the grace of God that comes and reminds you. Do you remember how far I brought you and it's a personal responsibility that what God did, I would have died as a thief. But now that I'm set free, God, I desire to live a life that pleases you. To live your life with a commitment, to the righteousness of God, which you receive when you are justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So is now beyond the cross. You now have a new identity with the father. Now you are not a thief. You are not a prostitute. You are not a witch. You have come beyond the cross. Hallelujah. Not a dying thief anymore. But today now you are sons and daughters of God. We are what the scripture calls my little children. What the Bible says, my brethren, now you are a new creation. Now the Bible calls you a saint. Now you are hes with God. Now you are the body of Christ. Now you are the church of the living God. Amen. Accept your identity in Christ. and walk in that particular identity. &gt;&gt; This is the challenge we have beyond the cross. Amen. Let's go to first John chapter 2 here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are God's little children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to realize this. Especially you parents, how you adore your children. You like them. You don't want them to get into dangerous places. And if they do wrong, you don't bring them home and slaughter them. You instruct them how to walk in the state of sanctification. That's what John &gt;&gt; is dealing with with the believers that now you have accepted Christ and you are righteous. But remember you have entered into the region of daily sacrifice sanctification. So he says in first John 2 And verse one, my little children, these things write I unto you that you see not. Don't choose to see. But if any of you sin, we have an advocate with the father, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the righteous. And he is the propriator, is the propation of our sins and not for ours only, but also for the son. I mean for the sins of the world. I write to you that we are void the habit of willful sinning. Are you seeing where is taking us? But if it ever happens, we have got the path. Amen. of sanctification. We still have the father's son. The Lord Jesus Christ on the throne. He's still the propri in the prepation of our sin. Go to him and say, "Lord, I'm not okay. I have a conviction. I've done wrong. Friends, God has kept the door open after the cross. The door is open to your forgiveness. Are you together with me? So it's your responsibility to live a life of appreciation. &gt;&gt; And then you got him say, "Lord, give me grace. &gt;&gt; Forgive me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's just go the journey here into the baptism. I mean the journey of the Holy Spirit. Let me call it that. The journey of the Holy Spirit commences at Calvary where that man said, "Lord, remember me." Right at that spot, that man wouldn't have felt right except by the Holy Ghost. Are you together with me? This is where the Holy Spirit begins with you. Because there is no way you can justify and sanctify yourself. It's the work of the Holy Spirit right from the spot where we begin from as a thief at the cross. Listen to what brother Brham says here. The message is so by himself of Jeffersonville. He says, "Now then there was justification, sanctification, the bapt of the Holy Ghost, not three different dispensations, not three works of grace, but one work in different manifestations. Same Holy Spirit was with Luther and justification was under Wesley with sanctification in the church now in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Not to Holy Spirit, the same. Holy Spirit was with Luther at justification, was with the thief at the cross because that was his justification. So if you never felt the conviction of a supernatural power, then you begin to question your experience. [Music] If you just walk to the altar because you wanted to please your father, you begin to question. Holy Ghost must be involved. is your justification. You cannot walk yourself from the cross to Pentecost. &gt;&gt; After the cross, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost. He justifies you first by his own faith and declares you right here like you never did it to begin with. And then he becomes the inside teacher of the word to start a continuing work of sanctification. You cannot be sanctified just by what you hear in church. Now the same Holy Spirit that justifies you becomes resident as an inside teacher that you begin to meditate on the word. Because if you hear and leave it here, it's not effective. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He wants you to be taught. &gt;&gt; And he says they'll be taught of the Lord. The inside teacher. That's why when you come to church, you must surrender your soul that the Holy Spirit may teach it. &gt;&gt; When you start fighting with what you hear, you can never be sanctified. So justification is believing the law. You are justified by faith. And Romans 5:1 says for being justified by faith, then we are peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. You must come to a point where you have to convince yourself with what you believe. It's nice to be taught by your teacher. that when you hear, you have to take the word and feed back on it and convince yourself by revelation. That's the only way you can be able to stand permanent as a Christian. Justification, as I always say, is an everlasting effect, being justified, a continuing effect. It's a work of the Holy Ghost. It's a turn around from a life of deliberate sin. Amen. In justification, one's heart is turned around in repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. So justification is the heart's desire to pursue holiness. That's the desire. I know all of you who come here, you don't desire to be bad. And God says you don't desire to be bad. That's why he says if you sin, we have the propagation for sin. Take it to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must convince yourself. Talk to yourself. Question yourself about your commitment to the new birth. Amen. Amen. The prophet says part of the Holy Spirit is justification. That's questions and answers of 1961. He is saying part of the Holy Spirit is justification. God has to call you or you'll never be called. So the Holy Ghost has to get involved. in your justification. He got involved in the fifth to realize that this is the Lord and even to realize that he needed his intervention. So the prophet says here see there is nothing you can do in yourself. No man can come to me except my father's draw him first. Is that right? So part of justification is the Holy Ghost. That's a quote. But then sometimes you are put in a straight So that you may think you justify yourself and then you sanctify yourself. The prophet says no. The Holy Ghost right from justification. So in justification, the Holy Ghost turns you away from all the field and negativity and opens you up into the revealed word of your season. You see, and this now is what we call sanctification. You have been opened in a channel where you desire to live a life of holiness. Amen. So with sanctification, the word dictates your work. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you begin to desire that Lord I want to do your will. &gt;&gt; And each time you discover the will of God by studying the work and you do that will you are being sanctified. Are you together with me? You study several things about the life of a housewife. You read about holy women. Amen. You read about Esther. You read about Ruth. You read about Hannah. You read about all these women. And they dictate your life as a housewife. Sarah. is deciding about what a wife must be. And as a sister studies and obeys and practices, that is your sanctification. [Music] &gt;&gt; It works for you because that's you in the word. Amen. But if I come to you, And they say women should not do this. There is a human spirit. It will tell you men are like that. You think also the pastor is not a man. But if you get in the word, whatever you see, you see yourself in it. with sanctification. The word dictates your work, cleanses you from error. Amen. and causes you to develop such a sweet conscience which is a desire and you'll even get this Bible and you'll go and talk to your sister that says I found first Peter 3 teaches about and the womenh I'll have to dress appropriately. It's your discovery. I was telling my daughter today these things of here. These are not Christian fashions. They are fashions but they are not yours. You buy them &gt;&gt; and you suffer with them. Again you put something inside now. God have mercy. Sanctification is the process of Christ the high priest washing his house with a purpose to occupy it in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That's sanctification. Justification had a purpose to declare you righteous and open you up to the leadership of the world. And now sanctification which is the leadership of the word had a purpose to clean you so that you can become the habitation of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let us talk about the baptism here. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost is Christ the high priest entering into the holy of holies. Like if we can talk about the tent of Moses, the tabernacle in the wilderness, it had three, &gt;&gt; but there was only one man who could go through the first court. Amen. And also the second court and they entered the holy of holies who is the high priest. The high priest, was an image was a type of Christ, the high priest of our high priest. He entered into the holy of holies where the elements of life were. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Spirit there is not you entering into the holy of holies. Why? Because you are the temple. You cannot enter your own temple. The Holy Spirit enters now into the temple. He enters past the justification. He enters past sanctification. And then enters directly into the holy of holies, which is the soul. And once he's entered there, we mean that you are being baptized with the Holy Ghost. And at that time, your seed gene which dwells in the soul is quickened because the light has come to the center. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let there be light and after that let every seed bring forth of it. Hallelujah. So now the seeds began to come through because the light came and shine upon the sea. So also the person of the Holy Spirit when he gets it there is the light that shines upon your CD. And once it shines there, then your CG begins to grow into plant. And what happens later, it begins to bring the fruit. But that fruit is not your fruit. is the fruit of the Holy Spirit who has come in and quickened your seed Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The husband has come together with the wife. Hallelujah. the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride which is your seed have come together to bring forth life. That's the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Praise the Lord. Yes sir. So at that time as I said is quicker to life because the light of life has come. Then the revealed word which you have received in faith becomes permanently and eternally quickened in your soul. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. With everlasting freshness. Freshness. Amen. Like the man was put in the hall of holy. So when I come to preach, I'm not coming to preach to your your mind. No. When you receive with your mind, Open that the word goes to the soul and hide it there. When the anointing comes, he'll find mana that must be quickened. Praise the Lord. So you get a divine vindication at the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. and you find your position in the body. Even if you were as dry as the road of Aaron, you begin to b and the people will say, "There is something going on in the life of Moses. There is something going on in the life of David. It cannot be a dry rot anymore. life has entered. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your ministry begins to bear fruit in his season, he told Moses. When Moses finished building and laying the things in there and he put the ark of the covenant and upon the ark of the covenant he put the uh uh he put the master seat and then God told him from there I'll talk to you and God when he gets you I mean When he baptizes you, it is him walking to the throne of your soul. &gt;&gt; That's when he is talking to you from the master seat. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? He sits on the master seat. And he says, "I am here as your eternal grace. I am here &gt;&gt; as the power of your sanctification. I am here as the power of the life of the word inside here. All the elements of life in they get quickened. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? He's now at the throne. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He told Moses from there I'll speak to you. He's now able to communicate to you is like what brother Brandham say we have heard from Matthew. Are you together with me? This is what we are thief who has gone beyond the cross. He's standing before the presence of he that sits between the two cherub. Amen. Not stand but sits. He sits between the two cherub. Why? Because the sacrifice is there. Hebrews 1. It says after he did the work, he sat down. That means he has come to seal you. You are secure. me and when he comes in I told you you have no power to the latch. You can't even chase him to get out. He has entered the is the res. Let us let him rain. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us let him do what? But that doesn't mean that the devil is seated. Doesn't rest. He starts tell me I'm telling that they telling what they are saying fellowship the table of the lord don't go don't go he still fights. How many years will you pray? For us all the years we have been in that church, we have learned enough. The devil is a liar. He stands before the Lord to lie to people. He stands before the Lord to struggle for the life of Job. He says, "You give him to me. &gt;&gt; You give him to me." &gt;&gt; That's the devil. &gt;&gt; Why should we obey him? &gt;&gt; Tell your brother. &gt;&gt; No longer obeying the devil. You just choose to fight. This is battle time. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as you stand before him, you are standing before a finished work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He has come. He has taken his throne. You stand before him. You are standing before a finished work because the master seat has been already sprinkled and the life that [Music] That's what we are. &gt;&gt; Don't take the devil's lie. So, let's get into the last junction here. &gt;&gt; At this point, it changes when he has come. It changes from Lord remember me to remembering the Lord. It's now communion time. He's there with you. You are standing in his presence. It's now communion time. How many of you love communion? Amen. Yeah. Just have communion with him. The prophet says in message Christ of Phoenix. &gt;&gt; And we pray father that you bring every person now that believes the word into this deep fellowship within that they might have faith to carry them through the love of God. wrapped them up. Hallelujah. Wrapped into the love of God. Amen. For by one time, one sacrifice he has perfected forever. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It is the finished work. So what he's trying to say, why do you stay outside? Don't stay out of the reach. Come at the center. Amen. Because it's fellowship time. Hallelujah. It's now time you remember the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is remember me that I remember you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. that they might have faith to carry through and the love of God to wrap them up. For by this I mean for by one time one sacrifice he has perfected forever. Amen. Not coming year after year or meeting after meeting, revival after revival, but one time perfected. &gt;&gt; The worshiper has no more conscious or desire for sin. He has passed from death life then into fellowship with the Lord. After the cross, the thief has lived past the cross through justification, sanctification, go of the Holy Ghost to fellowship. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the master has come &gt;&gt; and is now the lord of your heart &gt;&gt; and he controls the door is now an everlasting time of fellowship. A little bit of singing, a little bit of meditation, a little bit on talking about his goodness. That's now where we are. It's a fellowship time. It's communion. He says in message fellowship, I love this. But one day, 1900 years ago, God made a complete fellowship to restore not into a tabernacle as he said, made with heart, but on this day, Jesus once for all and eternal fellowship for us, not every year to make a commemoration I have sinned. I have done this. I went and done this. Oh, of another lamp, another thing. Jesus once for all one time. He has perfected forever. Those that come into fellowship with an eternal blessing, eternal fellowship. with an eternal presence of God, with the power of the Holy Ghost, not in simple out or in some word or in some theology, the Holy Ghost in you. That is fellowship with God. Amen. The power of God that raised Christ from the grave alive in you and you are a new creature. You are a son and a daughter of God, a brother. That is it. He came and he says a little bit of fellowship and you opened up your heart. He talks. You must talk back just tell him that father these days I've got pressure on this pressure on this wickedness on this failure on that talk. It's fellowship time. You are not in a robber camp. [Music] He has brought you to fellowship with him. Talk to him about the things that you feel are not right. You talk to him. He's a friend. Amen. Can you imagine that the head of state, &gt;&gt; he controls uh you know a budget of trillions of shieldings and he gives brown envelopes wherever he goes. This time knock on the door. When you open the kid and says, you say, "Are you crazy or what?" You run to the door and it's he says, I've come to visit just to talk with you to understand the challenges of my people. What's your problems? You get dumbfounded. You begin from the children school. We want good schools. Look at the house where you live. You vomit everything. because he has the ability. &gt;&gt; Are you together with that's how we should act towards the Christ on thy side? [Applause] Why are you keeping quiet? &gt;&gt; He knows what you go through, but he only wants to know whether you care. You see, and then you begin pouring out. That's why I like children. My kids, my grandchildren, you know, she says, "Oh, you were in a plane the other day. Will you buy a plane and bring here? We also go into a plane. They don't care whether you afford or you don't afford. should be children of our God and going to fellowship with him. Amen. He says here in message fundamental foundation for faith. Now when a man fell he lost this he lost the fellowship with God. Now God has restored it. You are no longer thief at the cross. You are a son of God. You are here with the father. You were everything. [Applause] And now what he lost in the fall, Christ come to redeem. Did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for? He gave us everlasting life. He brought us back to the eternal fellowship and relationship to God to his sons and daughters again back all that Adam lost. This is where we are. Amen. It's a communion time now. Lord, remember me that I always remember. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; And he has done his part. &gt;&gt; He has remembered you. He has died on your behalf. He has nothing against you anymore to give you appreciation to have fellowship with you. [Music] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us deal a little bit with remembering the Lord here. The bas of the Holy Ghost, the individual has found the door to eternal fellowship. He has been restored to his position in the body by a new birth. So it's a body identity now. Amen. Because the Holy Ghost does not anoint A selfserving gift. The gift is for the body. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? You cannot be made a prophet to prophesy it yourself. You cannot be given the gift pastor to pastor yourself. Whatever gift you have, you have to say like the prophet said is not mine. So beyond the cross, God has anointed several men here in the body. You and I are a part of a body. So he cannot give a gift and anoint it when it's not going to serve the body. Therefore, as individuals, we must be inducted into body fellowship for our gifts to be relevant because when he comes and he takes residence, he has given you a portion. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. of the Holy Spirit and the portion of pillar of fire that's in you by the basel of the Holy Ghost got different attributes than the pillar of fire in me. So now everybody when we come together we are bringing the uniqueness of God into greater measure. It's fellowship time now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are being justified and we made a public testimony by a water baptism. We are constantly being sanctified by the teaching of the word by the five ministry and by the constant interaction with the inside teacher. We therefore now step into the life after Pentecost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you together with me? The thief at the cross redeemed. &gt;&gt; Now what happens now is that God must take that thief beyond Pentecost to see where we are. He brings us into a state where we must learn to appreciate our redemption. [Music] &gt;&gt; I feel good. &gt;&gt; I'll take you to the book of Luke, chapter 22, verse 19. Now Jesus is going to the cross and is preparing a life of the people that they are going to live after the cross. And if you are a thief at the cross and Jesus died for you to bring you past the cross, he's giving you instructions here in Luke 22:9 and he took bread and gave thanks and break it and gave unto them saying, This is my body which is given for you. This do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you. So he prepared them for the life beyond the cross. When the Holy Spirit came down to upon the 120 in their room and the 3,000 that were outside, they entered into a season of remembering the Lord. And this is where we live. They continued in breaking bread. They kept in memory elements of the New Testament the bread and the wine. Because Jesus had instructed them about the lie beyond the cross. He wanted them to come together as a body and continue remembering the Lord by the two elements, the bread and the wine. [Music] Praise the Lord. Bread and wine, the spirit and the word to sustain the life of the church. So these are symbols of communion. The symbols that prove we are in the continuing fellowship with Christ. &gt;&gt; He brought out the communion after the battle. You remember Genesis 14. Abraham after he had won the battle then the master [Music] came with the symbols after the battle was done. He had won the works of the flesh. He had won the kings that were trying to control the land. And when you overcome the flesh, the desires of the flesh, After you overcome all the desires of the life of the things of the world, you come to a moment when you must have communion with the Lord. You said, "Remember me." He remembered you. But now it's remembering the Lord. Now that he didn't ignore you, you don't ignore him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You cannot be in a divine communion with Christ. Amen. And then you don't care about him. Praise the Lord. Listen. When did Abraham have his communion? [Music] Do you remember? &gt;&gt; Because after he won the kings, he came to the communion. Have you won the kings that controlled your flesh? That's why you're here. because you won the kings. The works of the flesh and therefore you are here. You are not perfect yet, God is still working on you. Abraham was not Abraham yet. But because he had won the kings, God came and served him with communion. I know there is a lot that you desire the Lord to do in your life. But with what you have received so far, accept to come into communion. When Melisedc comes Thank you, brother. There was more for Abraham. Even the son had not come yet. But they kissed them, recognize that victory so far. And then he came down and he said, "Now we are going to have communion." And why do you stay away when he comes to your local church and he says this community? He was not Abraham yet. There were still certain things. But God recognize the victory he had so far. And he says, "With this, I'll serve you communion." You see, I don't know why you stay away when there's communion in it. I said we are going to walk the journey of our Christian life and now this is the far we have come a communion time to commune with him. There was more that the Lord had to deal with Abraham's life. So Abraham was not receiving this communion because he had received a complete perfection. That's why when we are going to have communion, the prophet would say put everything right in your life. So if you're waiting for perfect, when will you ever come to communion? When will you ever remember the Lord? After he had battled the kings of the land. and defeated them. He proceeded into the valley of Shave. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not up on Mount Zion. It was down in the valley and synonymous with battles trials. And that's where met him and suffered He wants to meet you. &gt;&gt; He's doing this to extend grace. The battles were fought and overcome in the valley. Always God is aware. He knows your besetting sin. He knows your depressions. He knows the hate that you fight. He knows the fear of the unknown that you suffer. Amen. But then in that condition, he says in that valley coming to you and now I won't tell you that you must eat worthlessly. Therefore, lift up your hands and wash your sin away and say, "Lord, forgive me. I'm coming to meet you at the holy time of communion with the grace of God." [Applause] You see, this is the way we are supposed to live our life. Amen. Fight the kings and overcome them. and come to the Lord's table. But many of us are in these valleys. But listen, &gt;&gt; is not far. &gt;&gt; He wants to serve you with communion. And I want to see that at the end of the month we shall have realized the God who forgives our sin by looking at everybody come down to the communion. He's able to forgive. The Lord's table is the opportunity to remember the finished work of Calvary. The opportunity to wash our feet. The opportunity to identify with the grace of God in sanctification. It's our opportunity to wash clean. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; brother Brham says &gt;&gt; in the message the contest I'm finishing. &gt;&gt; Did you not s Paul place it here? If any eat unworthily, you see by staying away from the Lord's supper, you are trying to say that the blood does not have enough power to wash my sin. That's all that you are saying. You must have the confidence of Cal. When you said around, remember me, he remembered you. And today remember the Lord. Do this in remembrance of me. Praise the Lord. Did you not sell blessed it? eat unworthily, he eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body, which means the same thing, that death, spiritual death, rest upon the person that would partake of the Lord's supper worthy, that would be out drinking, and carrying on and living in the world and come to the Lord's table. We shouldn't do that. Now let us cleanse our hearts and cleanse our hands and our minds from the evil thinking that we might come to the Lord's table reently and holy as we walk that we are connecting ourselves with the sacrifice Christ Jesus who is our salvation. So you come to the table to remember the finished work of God. You come to the Lord's table because he came in by the bapt of the Holy Spirit. You come to the Lord's table because you are having an opportunity to put certain things right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you avoid the symbols because the bread and the wine are symbols. How can you tell me that you have got the reality of the word and the spirit? If you avoid the symbols, it is a sign you are avoiding the word and the spirit. God give us mercy. Nobody misses to the Lord's table because he's busy. They miss because they are not sure of the atonement. That's true. Next time if the Lord allows we shall deal with the atonement. I want to tell you friend that there is nothing against you but you are against yourself. Communion on the inside. Communion the symbols. Communion the word and the spirit. God bless you. [Applause] Do you love him? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Lord, remember me that I may remember him. Why should he remember me and I don't remember him? Remembering the Lord? God bless you.
