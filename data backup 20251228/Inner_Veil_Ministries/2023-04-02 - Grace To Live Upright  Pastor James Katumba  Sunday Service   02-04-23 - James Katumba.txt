your Saints for sure I am so glad you know that Jesus loves me I can't imagine how I can thank him for his greatness he is activism provision and protection towards me yeah indeed one day I decided to go a three-day Journey praying and fasting and while there I requested the Lord for five things one of them was a job around my home Church which is provided and those has protected it up to today they appreciate God for that amen amen I remember brother Dan initially was also being told to work on Sunday but I told him if your heart is to come to church God will make you find favor before your

Grace do we stand and by Grace Heavenly Father we are going to overcome all our weaknesses we are going to overcome all our failures [Music] in the finished work of amen amen let us turn to John chapter one we are reading from verse 14. up to verse 17. praise the name of our Lord John chapter one from verse 14 to verse 17. the scripture says and the Word was made flesh and drilled among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth is John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spoke he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have all will received and Grace for grace for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ foreign you're welcome again to the services of the lord we have only one service today I'm depending upon the grace of God this morning now I want to preach on the subject Grace To Live upright thank you sir Grace To Live upright praise the name of Allah in other words God gives us Grace To Live upright God gives us Grace To Live righteously God gives us Grace to become perfect praise the name of our Lord in your own self you can't do it you can't make it in your own self praise the name of Allah you may try this but then we need to appreciate it the Bible says when we read in Psalms chapter 51 where someone is and then you read in verse 5. the Holy Scripture says behold I was shaped in sin in iniquity and in ascended my mother conceive me now you can imagine a man like David and yet the scripture says that David was a man after God's Own hearts that was the testimony of God that I've gotten myself a man who is after my heart that's how God was giving a testimony about David and then David we know he was anointed by a prophet called Samuel praise the name of Allah he had the anointing of God upon him [Music] and the angel came and gave the prophecy but then we see that many prophets in the Old Testament we are prophesying about the ministry of John the Baptist Isaiah prophesied about the minister of John the Baptist prophesied about the minister of John the Baptist Church he is going to be filled with the Holy when he's in his mother and then we see the ministry of John the Baptist how he comes and now when he comes and sees the Lord Jesus Christ he says but I need you I am I need of you praise the name of our Lord to baptize me but this is the man was baptized with the Holy Ghost and his mother's womb so because he came in this body he felt a lot of deficiency in this body there are a lot of weaknesses and then he introduces Christ before the Lamb of God that takes away so the world currency could not know Christ without John the Baptist praise the name the same thing we are also having now is that we are living in a time of Elijah the prophet where a God that centers [Music] is it the crime Andrew many times we get ourselves into complex conditions you get yourself in a stranger that is not pleasant you get yourself in weaknesses you get yourself in Failure you get yourself in fear you get yourself in down like Moses after seeing the power of God crossing the Red Sea and then all the Lord was doing was asking God these people want flesh and then God said I'm going to give them until to come out of their nostrils foreign can you imagine that what was that question are you going to get all the fish from the reef the lake the sea and give these people he was forgetting that God is a Creator even us in our conditions it may be certain kind of weakness it may be certain kind of failure maybe a certain kind of fear maybe a certain kind of frustration too much debt because no joy at home no peace at home no joy at the place of wine but the Lord our God is the creator of all that you have needed if this expression that is complicated our Lord knows nothing about that complication it will not no here we need to look unto him and that's what the Bible says let us go to Job chapter 14. praise the name of our Lord chapter 14. and then verse 1 Canada so the Bible says man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble he comes forth like a flower and is cut down he flees also as a shadow and continues notes who can bring a clean thing out of unclean not one verse 4. we'll see some kind of you know place which is well protected and gazetted it's a nature that we we inherit because of sin that was done in the garden now the second bus is necessary because our first box put us in expression we can't help ourselves so that's why we need the second box from the Lord Jesus Christ by our Lord Jesus Christ yes Crystal let us go to Hebrews chapter 2. he took note on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham as wherefore in all things it believed in him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people foreign [Music] foreign he is also able to suck at them he can help them those who are tempted and this is where we see the grace of God that comes down to live a righteous life it's the grace of God that comes down in our lives every day when you are in any trouble asking God for his grace to come down in your travels problem foreign [Music] let us go to Ephesians Ephesians chapter 10 we start from verse one the Bible says and you has he quickened who are dead in trespasses and sins wherein in the time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that works now in the children of disobedience so the Bible says he has quickened us we were dead in our trespasses and sins praise the name of our Lord but he has changed us he has taken the he has changed the course we are taking that you're saying we are moving into destruction he has changed our desires maybe before you met Christ on Sunday you were all the time thinking about sports from morning to evening you wake up in the morning at six and then you start doing roads praise the name of it from the road you go to a gym from a gym you meet your friends for breakfast and then you discuss then in the afternoon you go for raris to relax yourself dead in sins and trespasses and then changes that when Sunday morning I want to go into the house of God [Music] in the last of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and why by Nature the children of Wrath even as others [Music] foreign foreign this is how about your condition you mean the love of God [Music] [Music] I don't know [Music] for only when the economic conditions are good foreign [Music] yeah and then we read from verse 7. Summa Canada start from verse 9. he says and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness mostly gladly therefore I would rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that's not the time for you to say I know I've given up that's the time you say Lord you say it in your world it is the sick that needs the Physicians [Music] but if you are sick and you're at home and then there is a solution there is a bombing there is the name of Allah there is healing before God there is Deliverance before there is peace before God in America so if you are traveling come for peace foreign foreign and now they had made the great celebration today to Rejoice over they are God giving them something say something once more let me avenge my two eyes on the rooftops [Music] thousands of them rejoicing just stretched his arms on the two pillars and stretched himself [Applause] [Music] [Music] went beyond our sins [Music] [Music] praise the name of our Lord and then verse 4. but God who is reaching the mercy for his great love where we beloved us even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved our favorites praise the name of Allah by grace rexa are we saved foreign Isaiah chapter one Isaiah chapter one and then read from verse 16. Peter start from verse 17 he says learn to do well seek judgment relive the oppressed plead for the Widow come now and let us reason together says the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as you know though they be read like Crimson they shall be like cool if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land no no Morris praise the name of our Lord so the Lord calls us come now ewt we have come to it yet then he says and let us reason together says the Lord and then now what the Lord is telling us in Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 4 and 5. for the great love of God where he loved us he has saved us by his grace so then what does his grace come unto me you are heavy lighting and then I will give you rest praise the name and he says though your sins be this kind of conditions so you may be the ones to Sinners though you may be the worst person in your conditions foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you know foreign [Music] [Music] just like somebody who moves around the bar and then he's looking at every sip of beer but because it doesn't have money so he's there or somebody like some of them you get them on the road he gets the other and smoking and then he waits for him and then they give him the small thing that's how this man was and his condition was back we know but he came back to his senses praise the name of it you know like the madman of gadara the Bible says when Jesus delivered him yes when the demons left him he came back to his mind praise the name of Allah also came back to his mind when the madman came back to his mouth he was able to dress and he would not tear the clothes is you'll learn to speak the right thing you'll learn to look at the right things you will learn to think about the right things because you're right to man has been restored foreign he went yeah he's saying I will arise [Music] praise the name of our Lord let us go to Luke chapter 15. praise the name of Allah Luke chapter 15. and then verse 12. and the younger of them say that to his father father give me the portion of goods that followeth to me and they divided unto him his living and not many days after the young son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotius living um and when he had spent all their roles a mighty famine in the land and they began to be in want uh and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and sent him into his fields to feed swine and he would find out filled his bed with the husks that the swindled it and no man gave them unto him now again now it was a very bad condition that this man had come into um so much you know so much falling they know until your character is against speaks but let's work now you can afford the word is against beers but then that's the work you're doing you know Brewing shredding in those things the word is against immorality but then you find that's the work that you can do or to facilitate those who do that kind of thing working in places promoting those kind of vices you know that was how falling this man almost and many times we find ourselves also caught up in instructions compromising conditions now we see that when the Bible says not the Bible when he came to himself he remembered his father we also need to come to ourselves now that coming to himself it was the grace of God that he extended to him where he's coming from and we also need the same Grace to come to our realization that the weaknesses that we have enough the troubles that we have that is not our position we have been called to live a higher life than the weaknesses so it takes the grace to make you to realize and it is the same Grace that gives you the ability to make the decisions that gives you the strength dries up out of that um to live upright gives us the grace to exam to do what is acceptable God gives us the grace to overcome all our weaknesses and that's what you need to lose Lord give me Grace in this conditions a cup when he went to Ramos to take Ramos he went with you know Jehoshaphat and when he went with Jehoshaphat was a chicken man put on the garments of the things I have dressed like another son so they went to the battle and then when their enemies were fighting then they saw the garments [Music] what was that the grace of God praise the name of foreign [Music] don't fail to trust in the Lord when the whole environment is toxic against you may be at your place maybe at your home welcome maybe where you live if I go over all the things you follow yourself so terrible for you what does the Bible in Psalms 46 God is a very present help when we're in trouble what do you do call upon him just call upon the name of the Lord [Music] Deliver Me Lord send me this condition Lord Set Me Free praise the name came back to himself and when he came back to himself he's saying how many hired Servants of my father is [Music] maybe you are in those kind of dungeons of sins you also need to come back to yourself how many hired Servants of the Lord how many ministers as the Lord anointed and they can come down and give us spiritual food in this season and then he says they have a lot even to spare no correct but then why do you spend time on evil things why do you spend all that time you are in framing [Music] and this is what God has put in store foreign [Music] how will the devil come question how old is devil when you you finds you you are well armed you are well equipped you are well fed he will become too tiny before you die my soul go he will be tiny before you why because you are strong you are energized you are afraid where all these things so he said I will arise need to arise out of our friends and Rise of our conditions I rise out of all our problems Lord this is my condition no this is what I have needed so much and then the Bible says now but make me as one of the higher servants and the Bible says he arose yes to come to come to history we need also to arrive and get into God we need to arrive and come before God and say Lord now this young man here moving on if we couldn't afford what to eat you mean it was dressed he was in rugs maybe I'd also saw these shoes nothing he had so he came in rocks no no no money to go to the salon praise the name of Allah he said in my condition I'll go to my father don't allow the Devils you first started the church these doors are open for Sinners to come into images they are open for the Sinners to come in here and now when they come in they experience the presence of God but foreign [Music] what happened though your sins we need the grace of God to keep us upright you need the grace of God every other day you need the grace and then now we need also to know that we were born in sin because but when we received the salvation of Christ it is the soul amen that has been saved your body which you are living in now has not yet been saved has not yet the Salvation is when it is changed from this small talk from this corruption but right now you are living in a body or a movie that still has the nature of sin that came as a result of sin is the soul inside that has been redeemed so what does the Lord do when you come to him make sure that he fills you with his holness and then the Bible foreign praise the name of our Lord Ephesians chapter 4 verse 31 says it's verse 30. and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption is in Romans chapter 8 and then verse 23 he says and not only a day but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wait the Redemption of our body okay praise the name of our Lord so the Bible is telling us he sees us with the Holy Ghost and that's it until the day of redemption and now the Redemption is talking about is the Redemption of our bodies when our bodies will reach a stage that they cannot grow old when our bodies reach a condition that they can never be tempted when our bodies reach a condition that they cannot die when our bodies reach a condition that they cannot be tired but right now the devil has got access to our bodies you can come and put sickness so now you see that the devil has access only the song that has been foreign [Music] and then verse one praise the name of Allah so I beseech you there for Brethren by the masses of God that you present your body's a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be it transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that which is good and acceptable and perfect will of God yes praise the name of our Lord now so we surrendered in Job chapter 14. that you cannot get a good thing out of something the bodies were Living Praise Trump [Music] that's okay but in the course of the day you find you are tired you are disgusted you want to rest you want to refresh yourself and so God has put the provisions in our lives that can make us praise the name of us be able to get to the level of Victory praise the name of us now in the message questions and answers you could not make them they are told two different lives all together then he says the only thing you have to do is to plant them they both look alike before another I think I may have to jump we have to jump some some things there he says do you know every foot the sun rises tomorrow morning now if you're not a Christian my friend there's only one thing left for you you've got to go that way if you are on that road no and just lets you become a church and be a member of that church praise the name of Allah you say well brother Brandon my church teaches that we accept Jesus as our personal savior if we believe the Lord Jesus you haven't made it okay so now when we come to Christ we make sure that Christ changes us there has to be a transformation the life in the sacrifice has to come down and it changes and Deliver us so that if the devil gets us trapped somewhere you know where to go back like the prodigal son he knew where to go he knew where he fell from he knew where he lost his job he lost his peace let me make reconciliation now in the message acts of the Holy Ghost times may be hard God has not promised a flower bed of ease but he has promised Grace sufficient for every trial foreign grace is sufficient [Music] foreign [Music] who gave you the life you have [Music] so you tell him Lord the grace the cross looks Behavior foreign [Music] praise the name of Allah First Corinthians chapter 10 and then verse 13. the Holy Scripture tells us to cover there has no temptation taking you such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer to be tempted above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it is the name of Allah so he says any Temptation you go through he has given Grace there is Grace in your condition my brothers Grace in your condition myself Lord I need the grace I need your mercy I need your deliverance there is how the Lord Has Done in this journey is whatever thing that you meet he has already made the world so you can't be stuck it's the wisdom of God when the prodigal son was stuck you know when he went to a far country he has switched off his phone nobody knows where he lives air he says now he I can do whatever I want there's only one you know what God did he said they are framing he hasn't praise the name of it to make him remember home maybe I'd go into some of these denominations and they were calling him you're great but whatever it says what they are doing not comfortable here let me go back to myself God sent their family praise the name of our Lord to make him want to come back God made a way of Escape for him by sending now you can imagine became but we don't need to reach that secretary let sickness not become the way of escape to bring us back to God let it not be there live before him with all your life into his Services doing the will of God praise the name of Allah was so much concerned and God is so much concerned let us go to Psalms 112. a community praise the name of Allah Psalms 112. the scripture says Praise You the Lord blessed is the man that fear is the Lord that delighted greatly in his Commandments [Music] his sin shall be Mighty upon us the generation of the upright shall be blessed is wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endureth forever and then in the verse for the Bible says there arises in the darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous praise the name of us I forgot to come with the pointer today but the Bible is what was the upright doing in darkness yeah but because of the life that we live the environments that we live can bring that form of Darkness it may be Darkness at your place it may be Darkness at home it may be Darkness at your place and the Darkness may come in any form of conditions may come because maybe they don't want you may come because of your failures may come because of your weaknesses but when the upright is in darkness it doesn't end in darkness the Bible says in darkness there arises in your Darkness this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] who is this man foreign and you know the leaves could hide them but Jesus is passing by yeah I could tell you his place away may God also pass back our conditions our sins and when he passes by that's why salvation is praise the name of us let us go to the Book of Luke [Music] so when Jesus came back he said salvation is coming to this house this tax collector was living in darkness but he had the desire and when the Lord visited this house salvation came to his Deliverance the Bible says [Music] the light has come to set you free okay all your failures it's the grace that God gives us to live upright before him desire of God that we may live our practice continue doing that which is right look what Paulo Paul Paolo a Pharisee you know a person who was so zealous he was living in darkness and then when he was dwelling there you know he would maybe like say I've never done this evil I've never done this in Philippians chapter 3 and then verse foreign though I might also have confidence in the flesh If any man thinketh that he has where often my trust in the flesh I know um circumcise The Eighth Day of the stroke of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee is concerning the persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless [Music] praise the name of Allah he had his past experiences but in all his past experience waiter we are not known the Lord Of Glory yeah until he was on the road to Damascus in Acts chapter 8. praise the name Acts chapter 9. and then the Lord appeared to him and now when the Lord appeared to him he revealed himself to Paul yeah the Lord will separate him from my mother's womb when he revealed himself to me and that's what we need we need to have a personal revelation of God when you have a personal revelation foreign to of Christ himself coming to you let us go to Galatians chapter one and then verse 11. but I satisfied you Brethren and the gospel which was preached of me is not after mine for I never received it of man neither was I taught but by revelation of Jesus Christ yes and then in verse 15. but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb called me by his grace [Music] I might preach him a man I immediately Comfort not with flesh so power had to have a personal revelation that's good romance chapter eight praise the name of Allah Romans chapter 8 and verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulations as it is look [Music] Moga the grace of God is available and when you are still alive the grace of God is still available deliver me out of this I don't understand even when you don't understand the grace of God and helps you out of that stuff in Psalms 112 and then verse that's the grace of God coming down when you're in darkness coming down in your condition to deliver out of that side so don't give up and the Bible says salvation [Music] [Music] he has given us the grace he has given us the grace [Music] no don't somebody but now for me but now for you stay away there is Grace sufficient foreign [Music] praise the name of our Lord Philippians chapter 4 the Filipina and then we read in verse 4. he says rejoice in the Lord and again I say do what nothing rejoice in your trials what do you do rejoice in the Lord he has given you Grace to overcome in your failures and this is what Paul's saying let us go and get that backed up with second Corinthians chapter 12. Corinthians and verse 10. so he says there are four I take pleasure in infirmities what is he doing he says again I say rejoice so he says I take pleasure in reproaches foreign praise the name of our Lord Psalms 46 1 zabuli the Bible says God is our refuge cartoon when you need Refuge when they are strong when there is the Bible says God is not God was but present tense before the storm comes just realize that country is to understanding and it's not only the Refuge where you can run into but he says I'm also the strange [Music] so even before you became weak he says I have the strength praise the name of Allah so just come to realization and you know that God has given us the grace to overcome our weaknesses God has given us the grace God has given us the grace that is acceptable unto him

Filipina and verse 5. let your moderation be known unto all men yeah with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God praise the name of God let your requests we made no man to God the peace of God which surpasses all understood through Christ shall keep you the trials Temptation there is a presence of God that is in your life that you are not troubled like the rest of the world you know this week I was reading through many things that are happening which I know everywhere and then you see every place is upside down banks are becoming bankrupt in America even universities now the students are not enrolling as they used to do now then everything is like foreign together and it is the same condition in the whole world that our Lord Jesus Christ every country has its problems everything turning upside down so that the Earth cannot continue in its conditions then Christ comes and takes over our Christian foreign Africa Hebrews chapter 4 verse 6. he says chapter 4 verse 16 rather let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need let us get back and read verse 14. seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our professional foreign [Music] he is touched by the feeling because he knows we are still in this bodies there are weaknesses but are you concerned that Lord I need Deliverance when the prodigal son was concerned and he went to his father the Bible says when the father saw him he ran to meet him yeah he is touched by our feelings I don't want this condition anymore what the Bible says is touched by that again why because you are now concerned when you are now saying Lord I no longer want to be [Music] [Music] I know for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sins let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need is amen praise the name of our Lord he says what we should we do according to come boldly [Music] when we go before him when we go before him before the throne of grace the Bible says we obtain mercy and then we find Grace to help us so God has given us the grace God every other day gives us the grace to live to walk in this past to do what is right every other day like my sister here today foreign so the scripture says but it gives more grace wherefore he says God resisteth the proud but gives Grace unto the humble up Church [Music] are you weaker every morning so when the day arises there is more grace what do you expecting it praise the name of Allah yesterday he gave you Grace but today he has given you more grace he released this message but when he rose this morning even tomorrow and that's what we need to look to if you failed yesterday it is more grace for you to overcome your faith to overcome your weakness so then you don't give up continue on trusting continue on depending upon the Lord continue on calling upon the name of the Lord why he gives us more Grace I'm not looking for that of yesterday but I'm looking for the grace for today and then he has said in a fish in Hebrews chapter four and then verse 16. let us come to the throne of grace it is the throne of grace there is more grace for you there is more grace for your friends for all what you think is it possible he gives us more grace and so you come to him and high priest that is Lord I Need Your Grace Lord I Need Your Grace Lord I Need Your Grace which would still have foreign and then now when he was the team was going there the holy spirit let me start here and read it it's the message questions and answers but when I started over there the holy spirit said to me don't you do it oh it is so good to have the Holy Spirit I don't believe I want a bath this morning my one there is some big classrooms it is beautiful usually when they do they throw this water on these hot rocks and make you all steamy and beat you with leaves foreign foreign and then get back because I couldn't I was afraid to stop your heart to do that I wasn't used to it so I liked the real well but something told me not to take that one up there toward my brother Baxter and all of them going up there and Brethren all the rest of them you know all talking you know going up so I kind of got a little skittish and because the Holy Ghost said don't do that I went into a little room and sat down and there went all in the room to Andres they all went into the room to undress while they were there to Andres here come a lovely looking little finish foreign moral people as they can be here she comes the towers over her shoulder in the room I say hey stop hey I try to stop she looked around and laughed went on in there and give each of them and their men no clothes [Music] he knew there was something wrong in that place and this is the grace that God gives us everything maybe sometimes you don't understand people somehow you find yourself you're not in their company it's the grace of God to protect you from going further with them maybe some meeting is going to do something bad about foreign praise the name of it let us go to the Book of Genesis chapter 20. and then verse three praise the name of Allah Genesis 3 Trend Genesis chapter 20 verse 3. Genesis 20 3 it says but God came to ability in a Dream by night and said to him behold though at but a dead man for the woman which is thou has taken for she is a man's wife had not come near and he said Lord will those righteous Nation she is my sister and she even herself say he is my brother in the Integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this is and God said unto him in a dream yeah I know that though did the Integrity of thy for I also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered either not to touch her much praise the name of Allah because he want had an upright God would allow him to sin against him and we need to have hearts that are upright we need to be having sincere hearts motive they begin what is your intent in distress so you need to see that your heart is right you don't have something that is wrong in your house but your heart is after God and this is how God was able to come and helped praise the name of it this is how God does it the grace of God makes us to realize that we are in wrong like a soul the grace of God made him realize he was persecuting God so he was turned over the same grace of God protect us from going to do something wrong but you need to have a right heart what is in your heart are you upright in your heart are you Desiring the and this mother's name was johaden of Jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord but not with a perfect heart foreign [Music] it was a very dangerous condition because the Bible says it came to pass when he went into the world God gave him the victory but now when he got the victory because his heart was not perfect let us go to verse 14. and it came to pass why have you sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of thine hands he did what was right but not with a perfect heart we need to avoid that kind of conditions we need the grace of God so God gives us Grace you know whatever thing we are
