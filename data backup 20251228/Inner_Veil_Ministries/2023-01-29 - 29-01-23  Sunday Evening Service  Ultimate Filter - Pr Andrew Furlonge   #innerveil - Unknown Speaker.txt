young children a few years ago I came yeah and I had a good friend in Lyle and today she's a young lady but I still love her as much as the first time when I saw him and I pray that God will continue to bless the children amen it's good to be blessed by God sees everything that you do and God is no man's debt is whatever you do for God's kingdom he restores hundreds but God has predestinated him for what he does understand [Applause] [Music] his precious wife because I'm going to be applauded [Music] [Applause] for a group of Amazing Grace amen it's only by Grace amen I bring greetings from

mean and they have to be quiet for one like amen and I pray that the Lord granted the desires like only he can like only he comes God can discern our needs cartoon that is amen I want to take a short subject this afternoon and I'd like to entitle it the ultimate filter not just a filter but the ultimate filter is not perfect but God has given us a filter that is whatever passes through it comes out amen so we want to look at the ultimate filter maybe all stand as we take a scripture reading amen reading from The Book of Numbers Chapter 19 and verse 9. and I'll read and then my brother will read and the man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin no more to um foreign and Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 25 and verse 26. husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and give himself for it is that he might present it to himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish foreign the word is bleeding blood amen that it might wash us and sanctifiers we thank you for the bloody bleeding words that we may be cleansed that we may be holy and that we will be without blemish granted anointing this afternoon that will be edified by your word amen and that we live blessed and encourage to serve you better we thank you in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you may be seated amen Amina I hope I haven't missed any protocol but I just pray that the Lord will bless your hearts this afternoon with this word in the message are thinking a thinking man or thinking man's filter but Abraham says in paragraph 106. the word [Music] it filters all the sin of unbelief out there is no more disbelief when you come through that filter for it is that true believers amen Amina foreign because we can apply amen Amina amen Amina would you want that filter like that because it brings out a righteous man a holy man without unbelief you are cleansed you are Sanctified because you have the right filter amen Amina we we've lived in our time when there was a lot of sickness around waiting and they made us wear a filter mask but sometime it works and sometimes because with the mask some people still get sick doctors so the best man-made filter it doesn't work does not work but God's filter works all the time every time under any circumstance amen I mean I am thankful to die tonight or this evening we have God's filtered amen Amina I guess what brother says I looked at that thing and I thought I thought if a man would think at all he wouldn't smoke how could it be a thinking a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all afternoon what makes a thinking man what makes a thinking [Music] [Music] is a very intelligent person very accomplished but he smoked as long as I knew him so even though he's academically successful even though he's financially uh financially comfortable today is a dead man amen because he was not thinking if you are thinking you would not do the wrong thing you would stop and think and make the right decision if you don't have their answers there must be someone right now who can give you the right answers amen that is why you have a pastor amen that's why you have a mother or father because they can help you they are your filter that God has given you and when it gets a higher order you can go to God's word amen whatever God's word said let's come to our closet you do it foreign amen why would you want to go to hell amen if you are not thinking the thief on the cross though he was that Thief all his life amen he was that thinking man because when is comrade when is comrade's friend on the uh on the left side will be the Son of God save yourself the friend on the right the thief on the right amen he said we deserve what we're getting yeah come on I've done nothing in his life [Applause] he knew that he's getting judgment because you deserve it that's how he lived all his life but in the final moments of his life Jesus Christ he said when you get into your father's day remember me he made use thank you for remembering me amen I mean when you come in contact with God Amen you use all your faculties and you think amen you think objectively amen you put aside all your feelings all your Prejudice amen you don't come with your own ideas delivered who rescued one of our friends amen and we have him this afternoon he comes down as his Supreme judge the only one oh yeah set you free this afternoon amen Amina she walked away free and she went back to our house she took all that she had yeah and even though she was a prostitute she left that bad life she said I must do something for him and I want to say this afternoon that oh Lord Jesus Christ that's done something for my life for me he has done something for you and he deserves the best singer amen amen he deserves the best singer amen he says scarcely for a righteous man when one give their life but someone gave their life but we who are said us we who were Sinners of the economy Gentiles by birth Gentiles by boots yeah God amen God has considered us we enjoy the greatest message [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] under the same conditions at the same circumstances if he did it once if he didn't want he has to do it again because he's the same yesterday amen amen so we can look at the examples and we can come the same way and we are thinking man we can come the same way and be a thinking man dollars did what she did rehab [Music] an object now come to as filtered as a substance that is used to separate unwanted materials but imagine you have slide 10. if you pick it up on a slide 10. yeah when you have water it is sometimes impure when it's on the surface but you want it when you want to make it clean you filter it and you pass it through a series of substances and when you pass it through gravel it will take up the larger substances [Music] but when you change the filtrate I will choose it takes out more particles [Music] and then you will pass it through charcoal and it will take all the colors and when you pass it through a cheese clothes it comes out almost pure again amen so what I feel that it takes out
