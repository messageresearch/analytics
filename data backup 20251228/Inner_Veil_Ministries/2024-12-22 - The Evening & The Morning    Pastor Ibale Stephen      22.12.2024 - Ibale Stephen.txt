nice people and keep that Fellowship warm [Applause] amen so we stand up and get into the scripture reading we shall read from Genesis chapter 1 and verse four and then Matthew Chapter 2 let's pray father father we have come before your presence for one purpose to worship you to praise you to glorify your name and to hear you speak to us from your word so father we dedicate the reading of the word the hearing of it and the preaching of it father that you may anoint it tremendous to our hearts we seek to see you in your word father bless it and anoint it in Jesus name amen am amen amen genesis4 um do you love him that's where we are reading oh no this is how bring it down Genesis 1:4 and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness called he night and the evening and the morning were the first day may the Lord had blessing the reading of his word amen we can continue may be seated we can continue to Matthew chapter 25 verse one I will take about 30 minutes to build the plat to the subject that we are going to deal with and this is teaching now because with preaching you can be able to understand everything in just one go but you know when one is trying to teach you are trying to gather facts from different angles to be able to bring forth I mean a standing you know picture amen Matthew 25 verse 1 to six then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened down to 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish St their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom Ted they all slamed and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom coming go out to meet him God bless you so I have the title this morning the evening and the morning the evening and the morning so many times we talk about the wise and foolish virgins but many times we do that from a limited angle but we want to expand this thought so first of all I want to bring up the thought of dispensationalism Amen so you know a dispensation is a way of God strictly looking at you know one particular subject in a particular season of time so in this season he releases an outstanding Grace in a certain direction of emphasis and this does not mean that everything else comes to a stop but you know while he's covering thought still goes out and does everything that makes him God Amen so but in the dispensation God can stretch out his hand also in other areas so we shall use the term of God Crossing you know stretching his hand to do something different from the emphasis of the Season we shall call it God Crossing dispensational Borders amen so I dispensation really I don't know what he can call it in luganda can anybody give it a better definition a dispensation praise the Lord so one way let's now try to understand the dispensation one who of understanding dispensations you'll just understand it as I try to show different ways of how dispensations were the word to dispense itself is to Ash around amen it's like you go to a dispensary they are dispensing medicine to you so a dispensation is God working in a period or season of time to put out something special for the people of that season so one of understanding dispensation is how God would not work among the Jews and the Gentiles at the same time but yet at the same time between the six and the seventh I mean SE God is seen working with the Gentiles and even the Jews at the same time is bringing Israel back to their Homeland as is bringing the church back into the homeland of the world so he has been restoring the Gentiles amen at the same time he's also bringing the Gentiles back into their Church land that's God still taking his hand across the borders of a dispensation we've always known God coming down in Three Sons Nam when he put on a body he came among us he was known as son of man when he was here on Earth as a teaching Prophet amen and then we also know that after Calvary to the coming of the Lord again we' got him seen I mean we've got him as the Son of God Amen somebody who Aton for the sins of the people these are titles of the same God but after he has done all that he has done then we expect him to come back and Rule a kingdom when he comes back as king now we see him as son of D hallelujah hallelujah but then sometimes we still see him Crossing those borders I want you to take in you know the understanding of a dispensation and then how God can still go and do some of works but yet holding a particular function here which is Major amen so we' had the son of man Son of God and we have been told that he would come again a son of man before he comes a son of so son of man was the dis sensation when Christ was on Earth he was a teaching Prophet amen so son of man means a prophet God would speak to Ezekiel and would tell him son of man amen son of man is a prophet title so Jesus had the title of the prophet when he was here on Earth and then after Cal we see a Son of God which is the dispensation of the Holy [Music] Ghost amen but according to St Luke which we are going to turn to chapter 17 before he comes back as son of David the king in the Millennium he falls back again in the office of the son of man amen are you together with me he was son of man when he was a prophet in the body of Flesh and then when he went away the Holy Spirit came back as Son of God in the church but before he comes as a king he gos back again into the first office of son of man let us look at St Luke chapter 17 and verse he says likewise also as it was in the days of Lord they did it they drank they B they sold they planted they build hallelujah hallelujah it was a prosperous age amen there was too much money that the people were living in Lu they were eating drinking they were buying homes and cars they were selling they planted it was an age of great Farmers like today they are talking about coffee and it's even bringing battles in Parliament amen because it's much money in coffee people are talking about things like uh Coco people are talking about vanilla they making money that was what it was the days of Sodom and then he says in verse 29 but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them all even thus shall it be the day when the son of man is revealed hallelujah hallelujah not when the son of man comes but when the son of man is revealed so there will be the revealing of the son of man and then the reve I mean the coming of the Son of God so we are talking about the situation as it was in Sodom when the son of man appeared briefly before the burning of Sodom amen he appeared to Abraham in the flesh of a man hallelujah hallelujah he came to him praise the Lord and the son of man was dressed in a body of Flesh he didn't go to everybody he went to the elect and that's Abraham hallelujah hallelujah and he came with two messages the first message was that in the time of life your wife Sarah is going to have a son and the second message was the destruction of Sodom so God came down at that time as a prophet in the season of prosperity in the cular world in Sodom Andor are you together with me and L the nominal Christian had become so powerful in Sodom he was directing the politics of the world Amen he had gone out amen from where God brought him out and living with his uncle Abraham and he had now gone and settled in Sodom and he became a very prosperous man now we are living in the last days but we should be careful that we should stay with the word because that's where God comes to God comes to his own one but in the last there will be a lot of prosperity a lot of making money these things should not take us away from God we must always stay by the word that's where we can have fellowship with amen but you find some people they meet a weekend of they miss a weekend of services because there is a deal of good money somewhere to make it's okay to make money but if it crosses the path of the world you should choose the better option amen always choose the better option because that's where God comes to because the word was with Abraham God came to Abraham it's Abraham who received the promise of life but the Lord who walked away from the world he received the promise of death s shall burn amen and we know how the age of prosperity burst in after the second world war amen at the time when God was meeting his prophet and commissioning him for the age amen 1945 but at the same time God keeps crossing his dispensations you know my wife always engages people and so she was talking to some people in Canada just 45 in 1945 after the wall how it was there and they were still carrying water on the head you see they were still doing that but all of a sudden Bo a lot of prosperity they've gone so far to the moon to the Mars you know theyve done so many things it's unbelievable how science has taken a giant liap but is god making it possible or making it discernable for us amen but this is another age of Sodom it's another age of prosperity but while they prosper be an Abraham in the PLS of mam maintaining the alt of prayer maintaining the O of sacrifice looking for the promise of the coming son hallelujah hallelujah praise God do you love him friends amen so we understand here that God does not cross I mean but normally in a dispensation he does one thing at a time but once again we are coming at a space of time amen where he is crossing the dispensation because since pent we have had the dispensation of the Gentiles and the Jews rejected Christ they have nothing to do with him so it is a gentile [Music] dispensation but then the scripture says there will be again the revealing of the son of man like he appeared for a short space of time before Sodom B and he came with a message hallelujah hallelujah so also in this time amen God has come down among the Gentiles with the revealing of the son of man and the revealing of the son of man will be the ministry of Christ in a body of Flesh because that's how God came to Abraham he came in a body of Flesh and then he spoke to Abraham he gave him a promise sah shall have a son but Sodom shall be destroyed are you together with me so in this Gentile dispensation God has come down among the Gentiles amen praise the Lord and at the same time Crossing his boundaries what is he doing he's getting the Jews taking them back to the Homeland is getting the Gentiles revealing the son of man today and we thank God we have seen the revealing of the son of man God has come down with a prophetic Ministry in our day praise the Lord and he has given us a promise that there will be born the St of a perfect man amen like Abraham had to receive Isaac you have to receive the son in another form Christ the statue of the perfect that in you can be faith and knowledge and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness so that you can be by charity himself this is the season where we are living amen while he's working among us he has crossed again he has going to bring back the Jews back into their Homeland why because the time is come the Messiah is soon coming we must meet them in the land to bring them back again into the gospel praise the Lord so I still want to show you something on dispensations here using the three phases the three phases of the work of Grace when we you know we've had the work of Grace manifesting in three phases there is justification now listen justification here is God finding you in the gut amen you are drunk you are nothing you have been a killer youve been to doctors and then you say Lord me he forgives you instant instantly the moment you mention there is nothing against you anymore amen that is justification you stand like you never did it amen and then after that because you are continuing here on us he takes you to the next pH which we call sanctification this phase here is God putting in the word that whatever he teaches and you receive it it makes you a better you amen then you learn to know why you should dress different because you represent the Bride of Jesus Christ are you together with me totally different you learn how to live as a man responsible to keep your family you are no longer spending nights in the bar what's making you that it's the word it is putting in a phase of sanctification amen and when you are sanctified then down comes the Holy Ghost he comes to dwell in his house which he has washed with his own blood now he says yeah this house here is worthy for the priest to C amen so first phase in Grace is your justification that doesn't have a stopping point it keeps running and runs into sanctification which also has no stopping and it keeps running and runs into the BM of the Holy Ghost are you together with me so God somehow as we have always said he will always cross his boundaries amen you are Justified it's all right praise God you are a Justified Son of God Amen but then as you walk you've come into sanctification then you find you have made a mistake and immediately you say father was me you get washed and as you are washed even justification like you've not done it that's the way God works he keeps crossing his borders so by looking at God busting these borders here we should not also maintain ourselves into ideological [Music] boxes and you are stuck there now I said God forgive me and he ji me now I have done this and I've left justification behind God moves with all this dispensation with hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen you've got a right to take yourself before God in the blood of Jesus and leave us clean that's the first day you mention your Sal that's the way God works and that's the only reason why you shall be without spot or so I want us to keep that aside now and go back to Genesis 1 verse 5 in genesis5 and God called the day I mean the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day now according to you your day started in the morning isn't it so that's the way you think but the Hebrew day begins with evening are you together with me like you went to bed on Sunday it doesn't begin at midnight it begin 6:00 yesterday among the Hebrew m is beginning 6:00 today in the evening that's the Bible counting of days so the Hebrew day begins with the evening and then runs into the breaking of dawn am and then it goes through the daylight and then end in the evening and the evening and the morning was the first day so this is the way God works in creation Now I want you to notice one thing here that the day of God begins with darkness and then it breaks into life amen that's the way he worked with creation he began in darkness to bring it into light amen God wouldn't begin in light and then end up no that would be God begins with you in the evening and the morning is the first day are you together with me so God begins with his creation like he says in Genesis chapter 1 he says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form amen and void and darkness was upon the first of the deep and the spirit of God was moving upon the face of the waters are you together with me is beginning in the creation he begins with Darkness some of you condemn yourselves because you come with a lot of your past it is so heav on you but I want you to know that God in creation is started with a void with the darkness but the spirit of God was moving upon the face of the are you together with me amen you may look what you look like today and you may be hating what you look like but I want you to realize that the spirit of God is hovering over you he's waiting for a spot where is going to say let be are you together with me yes that's the way God works Amen in the evening and the morning was the first day God is working on you praise God Amen he begins with his creation from Darkness a world without form a world void of [Music] substance and darkness was upon the face of the de amen but the spirit of God was moving upon the face of the waters you may not feel his presence but I want tell you the spirit of God is moving upon your Waters amen praise God contining the church Contin the church the stud praying it doesn't matter how you feel you are just continue and one time you are going to break into a circuit where the voice of God will say Let There Be praise God yeah that's the way God works so looking at the Earth one would not see any form of election upon it because it was void it was dark you look upon it and you said does an elect look like that hallelujah hallelujah God begins in the evening and it finishes with us in the morning amen there will be life in the evening time hallelujah hallelujah praise God God Amen there was no recognizable Beauty on the Earth but the beauty was hidden in the Gloom of Darkness it was there the seeds were predestinated and they were placed under the Earth hallelujah hallelujah waiting for the voice L there be life that's the way we all start we start from a Darkness there's no pride in your history amen you've been so wicked you've been through things you don't even want to talk about every one of us has a negative history amen it is just like a soul he was a violent persecutor he killed men and led men to prison was a but the evening and the morning was the first day we are coming let's go to Ephesians 2 verse1 he says and you Paul is talking to you has quickened who were dead in trespass and sins that was your evening where in time PSE Amen in the time pass you walked according to the course of this world now you were not this world but you walked according to the cause but you an elect under a wicked influence you had an evening you had the darkness you blind are you together with me amen according to the priest of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience we were just as evil as evil could be our past is not you know praiseworthy it's so dark and no form but Light Came our way and you can now see the beauty that you are amen you are such an admiration of Glory because you beginning the evening to break in the morning to display the beauty of your election amen and your new birth is referred to as a quickening form a quickening from Death to of Christian beauty are you together with me so there is no joy that we can point to in the beginning of our journey there's no joy but grace started the work of Separation hallelujah hallelujah in Eden praise God grace started the work of Separation there was aned there full of beauty but it was in the evening and God came out with the gospel of Separation praise the Lord amen separating this from that separating this from the state of sanctification separation of light from darkness and God say let there be a firmament in the midst of the [Music] waters and let it divide the waters from the waters it was separation upon separation the same way God is continuing to separate you from things that are ugly to reveal the beauty which God created on the ins side of Hallelujah every one of us has got a beautiful spot in there amen and God say let the waters under the heaven be gathered together un one place and let the dry land appear and it was so what was bringing the separation the word the word praise God so whenever you know that there is a service don't miss your service don't be like a Thomas when you come here the word will speak of different spirits that are trying to take an encroach on you because amen and after separations then God said let the Earth bring forth grass and have yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after SK whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so the word bringing his result so after the different separations then came the Eden of beauty real beautiful [Music] soul so is here are you together with me you the S who have been singing here how they've been embedded in the fellowship they don't want to lose it amen there is something in you which is so beautiful but sometimes you have not been before the word enough to separate the things that lie over your beauty are you together with me and the separation from the influence of this dark and wicked worldall will bring forth the spiritual fruit of your tree but how can you be separated by the word amen listen Romans chapter 6 verse 22 but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruits un Holiness and the end everlasting life free from sin separated from the darkness hallelujah hallelujah do you love him the evening and the morning so there must be some form of separation from the night clubs separation from Wicked company Hallelujah for the predestinated seeds of your election to begin growing for hallelujah hallelujah when the word says let there be a separation walk with the word separate from the world and let the beauty of Holiness be seen in you now this is how the church grows Corinth Grew From Darkness to light are you together with me that's how the church grows maybe let me go down here to the book of First Corinthians see I don't know whether you really see what I'm talking about the evening and the morning your day as a gentile would start in the morning I wouldn't like a day which ends in darkness I want a day which begins in darkness and winds up in the morning that's the creation that's the Bible day now here Paul says Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and sness our brother unto the Church of God which is at to them that are Sanctified in Christ and called to be Saint Sanctified called to be saints that I know where you are you are in the mud you are in the dirt but you are called to be Sanctified and be a saint that's the Church of Corinth it was in darkness but they were called to be you know saintes they grew from Darkness to light they separated you know the you separate themselves among men lines amen I am of I am of I am of apoll because every man is made in a certain way there are some people who love eloquence eloquence and then there are some people who like others were slow and so these people the other one like Apollos very smart man and then there are some who was systematic of so they were divided along men lives exulting human wisdom and Paul called them the Bible says they lived in ad doubt they drank they drun and they ate things sacrific to [Music] Idol but the ministry of Paul helped them into separation to grow into anen of Beauty with great Revelations given to them are you together with me yeah when brother Bram was talking about the Church of Corinth he said cor a church of Correction everything wrong was among those people but they started in the darkness ending the light with great Revelations which were given to them is the only church that could speak to about theop amen saying that there is a body waiting up they are the only church that Paul could talk to about the order of the Resurrection is the only church that Paul could and tell them how he went beyond the heavens they had mature from Darkness amen so it all begins with evening when there is some light are you together with me the evening and the morning and remember the evening has some element of light are you together with me it all begins in the evening when there is some light and then breaks into day amen just like a your evening was darkish and ugly but see where God has brought you to I can say it's the rising of the Sun hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you start saying oh it's the rising of the sun you rush out you wash your face you begin to walk in are you together with me so the coming forth of the sun announces a new day meaning the evening lights are gone past and the Seven Watchers are going past they are what they call seven watches in the Bible so we shall see what they are and the sleeping is also over and it's time to live in the light okay now pull back your understanding pull back your understanding amen about crossing the dispensational borders because we shall need them I want to take this Matthew 25 from verse one to six and I show you something here the scripture says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened 10 virgins now many times when we talk about the 10 virgins the people normally see the 10 virgins in the final age but I want tell you that every age has had its 10 V okay which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wives and five were foolish and they that were fool took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wi hallelujah hallelujah they take the oil where do they get the oil from Hallelujah from the word right now you are taking the oil amen be wise and take the oil don't come to church and walk back empty don't listen to a tape and walk back empty each time you come to the presence of the Lord some oil you need it for the journey amen but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lands while the bridegroom T they all SL stumbled and slept and at midnight there was a cry made the bridegroom comes going out to Mee him now prophetically speaking brother Bram speaks about the seven Watchers amen as the seven Church ages where the Saints kept sleeping waiting for the coming of the Lord because we live in the de today that ises the resurrection they waited in Ephesus they all slept they waited in Saina they all slept they waited in they all slept they waited in they all slept they waited in s they all slept they waited in Philadelphia they all slept now we are waiting are you together with me all those that slept through the edges the wise ones slept with their oil hallelujah hallelujah they slept with their oil so when they wake up in the resurrection to Tri their LS they will be together with us as we also trim our LS hallelujah hallelujah we shall see them and we shall have our fellowship of 30 40 days as I've always preached here amen so they wake up to trim their LS and we also that will have our wisdom who have been taking the oil we shall be triming our L amen much as we shall at that time teach them nothing they too they teach us nothing they all went with enough oil to bring forth their Resurrection as we too have been building enough oil to see our Rapture hallelujah hallelujah they needed the oil of Moses amen the resurrection of the Dead we needed the oil of elishah those who are changed while we still live now listen to what brother Bram says he says here in the message who do you say this is but you see the bride is not going to be made up of just what little group is here on Earth now when the seventh watch when he come all those virgins raised to trim their L hallelujah hallelujah when he comes all those of Ephesus P the wise ones will wake up with their they went with them hallelujah hallelujah and wise virgins on this hour oh praise the Lord they also pumping enough oil praise the Lord that's why if you are going to sleep without seeing the Lord you need to have enough oil amen so he says when the seventh watch when he came all those virgins raised and trimmed their Liv all the way back everyone that believed the anointed word down through the edge come forth like a pyamid and comeon but the headstone had to come to pick the whole thing up to make a pyramid now the bride will be made up of all those Through the Ages that's believe and has accepted Christ as their savior are you together with me so all the way back everyone that believed the anointed work of their days Through the Ages they come forth so what we call the sleeping virgins is not those of this age only MTH 25 is playing out again in this age it has been alive in every age and every age had a qualified group that had their oil and they waiting they are not dead they are waiting hallelujah hallelujah so according to the pr of the church going through the seven watches Pentecost P hallelujah hallelujah I mean the Pentecost was not the full light I want you to know that because the church had to degenerate into watches amen praise the Lord of Darkness Pentecost was a Twilight the day of pentec was Twilight amen enough light to S the seed but along the way the darkness of the night the church slept again praise the Lord so let me show you something here that the Feast of Pentecost was not perfect because when you go to the feast is only the Feast of Pentecost that had loes loes that had in them are you together with me yeah it had Liv and that bread was not holy until it was wed together with the sacrifice so the coming down of the Holy Ghost was not coming upon a perfect Church hallelujah hallelujah the Holiness of those people on the day of Pentecost was the blood of the sacrifice it was not a perfect light it was the evening and the morning was one day so the church goes through the night and the night has seven watches amen praise the Lord because this watches is it's like those Watchmen amen they would watch up to this distance of time and then those ones go then another Bunch comes then watches they also finish and go so the night would have seven watches so those are seven watches those are what we are calling [Music] watches so I think you understand what I mean so Ephesus was a amen and that one goes becomes a watch are you understanding you don't understand come back so the Feast of pente was the Holy Ghost coming Upon A people that had Liv so it was not perfect light it was Twilight of the evening time because Pentecost without Paul was not complete amen Paul is the one who had the perfect Revelation he was not there in the upper room Amen to introduce the message of Grace Amen to draw in the Gentiles to bring back the tabac of David that not dividing segments to let the foundation of the Everlasting gospel so let me tell you this Pentecost was an evening it was the beginning of the day the day that begins in the evening the beginning of another day better to go through seven watches and we thank God we are in the morning of that day amen so listen now so the same anointing that g the church and that gave birth to the church at Pentecost came back again among us by the ministry of Malachi 4 to bring you to go and stud it over again I want you to so I want you to hear Brother Bram here calling his message another Ephesian [Music] and now much more in Paradox of Phoenix Pho and now much more has he promised now because let me say this God give me Grace Pentecost P was a morning I me was evening with Twilight and then it has gone through the seven watches of the night and then it breaks into light in our day that's why Mal comes up and says it is the rising of the Sun it's the morning we are going it another day and this day here is the eth day so we are stepping into eternity that's where the next fruit is going to be but yet at the same time when we go back to the principal of Matthew chapter 25 every Church age has had its own time to acquire the oil every age the word came to them they received it they took the oil that was the Ephesus when the the Holy Spirit came now God Crossing his own borders even to this age he has brought another Ephesian the same power the same Grace that came is back here with us that's why brother Bram says how much more has he promised how much more is it living in the Bible to this very age that we are living the Ephesians [Music] again of the church ages we got seven Church ages and we promise at L Church 8 there would be another hallelujah hallelujah again so we have an evening and a morning in the evening time are you together with me like it was started in the evening on the Pentacles it comes the opening which is the rising of the Sun but God has given the chur play back of the same thing again that he has given us space to plant seeds of restoration of the Gospel amen amen he says we got seven Church ages and we have promised that at the Lan Church age there would be another that's right and we are here I believe with all my heart that Jesus Christ who has made the promise so his message the message of Malachi 4 was evening light meaning that it was the beginning of a new day evening evening and the morning was a day so the replanting of the seeds that had been lost in the church ages the Min of are you together with me there is something I want to break and I want you to catch it in the end time evangelism the prophet says the end time evangelist [Music] message is from Malachi 4 it is a restoring of of all the seeds that had been lost through the edges the message and messenger we both have to be a restoration of the faith amen Jude said just about 30 years after the crucifixion Breen I give all diligence right unto you of the common salvation that should honestly content for the faith that was delivered to the Saints back there Malachi said for the last days the last prophet of the Old Testament that before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come I send you a the and he will restore the Fai of the children back all the faith of the children back to the fathers just before the destruction another first in the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came gave seeds and the seeds were lost through the dark watches of the night but through those ages the Saints have been sleeping sleeping sleeping the wise ones going with their oil now the challenge is what they lost malach is bringing back are you together with me so we have to receive the entire world the fullness of the world as it has been given to us and it's from that message of Mal that the wise virgin shall be found we don't expect a wise virgin going along with the message of Luther Wesley amen Pentecost it come out of all my people and come to the last day of the feast so the message of Malachi 4 given to us is another evening which is opening up to morning another day this is another Covenant all together amen and this message has come through [Music] Frost and frog and kinds of interpretations the message which has been sown but we thank God that there will be people that are going to hold this message t they're going to hold to it because it's life listen in modern events made clear by prophecy listen he says they had six miles miles it seemed a very short time I suppose and they had 6 hoursmon on Vindicated prophecy it was now getting kind of late in the evening time the evening lights had come it's the same time now the evening lights has come are you together with me Mal message is calling it evening lights as it's given to us restor to us the evening and the morning another day so Mal for is another evening life so he brings us a message which finds US void and dark and Confused calls us out of Pentecost blesses us into the message it's by this message that we can be able to talk about the oil amen amen is the same yesterday today and forever oh events made clear by prophecy evening light has promised by the prophet of God inarah 147 May a gate open the true believer's eyes to the lights that's taking place today he said the evening light has come Pentecost P was the [Music] evening and the morning is the end of the ages but here in the loud church he brings another Ephesian to bring all the seeds that had been lost Through the Ages gives them to Mal to plant them to us those are the things that are giving the wise virgin oil praise the Lord but to the to understand the evening lights we must remember genesis5 and the evening and the morning were new day let's go to Zechariah chter 14 verse amen I want you to go back and listen through this message it's very very important amen amen Zechariah 147 he says but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light this is the day of the message not day not night so always the evening has some little bit of light in it and so the day of the coming forth of the message of Mal 4en is that kind of day with enough light to bring back all the L seed of the world you hear what he says in the message trying to do God a service the evening time he promised he would reveal open these Seven Seals and show what them churches had missed back there at the evening time you see in the evening time in thean church age it will be both the evening and the morning that's the way God is working so there is to be an evening time message and receive the same thing that they did at the beginning that's brother Bram saying the evening time message is rest back again to bring back that same thing so the evening time was when this message came to us in the opening of The Seven SE that's the evening we are wai for the morning I meet you in the morning How can there be a morning before there was an evening how can we the rising of the sun there has not be night so the receiving of this message is your evening but you go through your watches through your watches and this time here all the virgins will be in time you can look at them through the edges as they slept the wise and but at this age they rise up to meet you and the foolish Virgin of this age will be the one crying give us some of your of of but the others will be out streaming the lamps with us amen so it shall be light about the evening time the path to Glory you shall surely find if you are elected amen and then we have had the repeat as I said ofth 25 starts again to catch the bride at the end time at the opening of the seventh seal amen so I want to say something here that it releases only not knowledge only but it reles oil this Revelation as you receive the understanding it keeps opening the top of the oil for your l so let's talk about the seven watches a bit let me say this there cannot be an evening with without seven watches that happened through a night okay prophetically every Church age in itself was a watch amen but still these seven watches repeat the seventh Church age of L so day again has to begin as I've already told you in this age of with Twilight in the evening time releasing the message of the hour to you restoring the baptism in Jesus name restoring the godhead restoring the understanding of the sereny restoring the understanding of the Bride tree so many things are going to be BR the position of the woman in the church praise the Lord so this day of the seventh Church AG amen has also to go through seven watches but in the seventh watch The Virgins are called into the bridge so they could shine as morning Stars that's when the Ed is closing there will be people that have got their oil they'll be given an opportunity to shine as morning Stars that's what we are talking about cing our lamps that our lamps may be made bright and you shine in the place of work wherever we go God looking for those lamps that to fill with oil listen what brother Bram say coming down through the watches there would be seven watches and in the seventh watch The Midnight Hour we are striking now now in this midnight watch these virgins walk and trimmed their LS and went it's your time the church is not raptured in the evening it's raptured in the morning are you together with me the message is given in the evening the Rapture comes in your morning when the message comes in the evening in the Twilight in the evening it shall be light it go through the frost of the night this interpretation these ones which just want to jump around and run those ones which want they go through all those but finally there will be a morning St that will sh that is you praise the Lord so the day must break from evening lights to morning lights for the morning stars to shine that evening lights were teaching lights but the morning lights manifestation Lights of the Life of Christ himself in his people so let me talk about the morning Stars before I close you know the only chance that a star get to shine is if there's Darkness the stars are there in the sky now but who can see them nobody but when the darkness comes and covers the earth then the Stars will have the opportunity are you together with me you are going to have your opportunity to shine hallelujah hallelujah when the women are putting on short time you get your opportunity to sh when they are trying to breach their you are going to get your opportunity to shine so the world must become so dark with all form of Darkness with all form of evil so that you with the little light you still be able to sh amen you are morning Stars oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God how could we get the opportunity to shine Our Stars if God didn't allow the darkness now because the message is given in the evening light when there are some Twilight but then it gets dark across to the midnight and after midnight when we are broken door that's when the bright sty begin to come forth new day amen amen hallelujah hallelujah brother let your light shine in the dark places where it's really needed that's brother Bram saying out in the hedges and in the highways in the barrooms out down on the street everywhere you are at let your light shine witness your light is going to be the manifestation amen because the evening light was the teaching but the evening life is the manifestation of the word which you have believed Through the Ages be proud of who you are amen around the street saying who you are praise God yes sir a Muslim is not scared of saying amen you see a brother across the street God bless you brother you return God bless you be proud you are shining stars God has given you the opportunity amen you may think you don't have enough life but you have enough life that's why you come here every Wednesday every night that's why you kneel down and you pray for AE or two praise the Lord amen that to testify is not in church is out in the Dark Places let your light shine where it's dark got to the road houses and different places and where SE and things is hipping then you let your light shine there is the place to do it those are words so brother BR praise God be proud of that little light little light of mine I'm going to let it hallelujah hallelujah praise God we are not in the evening time we are in the morning time now the evening time was the teaching time for bring the message but it's breaking morning to the manifestation of the message we have received allow your light to shine in the restaurant let your family be light house in the house in the area where you live amen don't play put nice music so that the people passing the house may see some light there praise God listen brother Bram says now the world in Sodom condition meaning so oh his iget I got here where I preached on the same time amen the morning lights the Morning Star the same message then the prophet says it has been evening a very long time hallelujah hallelujah he says it has been evening a long time now a long time the message has been planted it has been a long time tell your brother it has been a long time amen tell your brother that it has been a long time Hallelujah it is time for that light to shine he says we've been in the evening for a long time now it's a disal time a dangerous time remember Twilight is the most dangerous time of world amen amen he says that you see where the light is minimal is very dangerous and he says we have been in that time for a long time amen he says and this is the most dangerous day the Bible said in MTH 24 it would come to pass in the last days would deceive the very elect he says that is the time which has been Twilight dangerous scary this doctrine that this teaching teaching now after you have drunk enough lights hallelujah hallelujah it's your time to shine the bride must use this message to walk herself through the seven watches amen use the evening light to walk out from the dangerous hours amen pass here pass there pass here pass there until you get to the morning amen we shall see that you are now under the Morning Light when see we see the manifestation of this message amen you have been Justified and you have been Sanctified show us the simple things like the places you go to the way you dress the friends you hang around with show us your family life and we shall say there goes the morning St [Music] listen brother Bram says I'm finishing I think you have been able to understand the evening and the morning he begins in darkness he winds up in light the seed is sewn in the Twilight it comes to the Harvest in the bright morning I meet you in in the morning are you together with me listen brother Bram says the spirit in the church is becoming so close like Jesus till the church and the spirit will unite together and the resurrection Will Come Morning Light you of the morning put your alarm clock on Rise and wash your face get the night out of your eyes and Shine for the approaching of the Son of God hallelujah hallelu we need to wake up wash the night away hallelujah hallelujah and begin to trim our lungs because we are meeting the Son of God one of these days God bless you amen it's morning and we must sh praise God as we stand up let's go to Romans chapter 13 and verse 11 he says and that knowing the time that now it's right time to wake out of sleep chapter 13 ver 11 no for now is our Salvation near than when we believe the night is first spent the day is at hand let us cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the arm of life let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkness and chambering and wanness not in strife and ening but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and put on no provision for the flesh to fulfill the last there it's time to shine the light that you have been receiving do you understand that now and the evening and the morning and the evening was darkness and the morning WS up with light and the evening was void and the morning the beauty of Eden in the evening the message was sown in your dark in the morning shine
