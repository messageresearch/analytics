today let's go to the reading of the word gambo our scripture on the bridge Revelation chapter 4 verse 1. after this I looked and behold the door was opened in heaven [Music] and the first voice which I heard was as it were of the trumpet talking with me neither was in Ahsoka leader which side come up here and I'll show the things which must be Hereafter nange and immediately I was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and the one sat on the throne we thank you for this opportunity again to come before you as a teacher I pray father that you may take your word and teach it to our hearts and story to the bottom of our hearts because in Jesus name amen amen so today I'm going to do a small job and I trust that the Lord will be gracious to us as we do what we are going to do today amen amen I'm going to speak on the simple subject [Music] Christ in the bridge christendo the conditions before the bridge because we are going on with the Bridge series but today we deal with the conditions that really led to the bridge so the conditions before the bridge now verse 2 of I mean verse 1 of the scripture we read it says after this I looked where is the statement after this then you should always go back and see what the scripture would have been referring to get without which you cannot comprehend what's going to be said so since Revelation chapter four and five is the bridge then Revelation three should be the conditions that led to the bridge the condition that led to the bridge that's what causes that statement that those two chapters you know uh causes us to understand exactly what Christ was about in the bridge we know that the bridge opens up as the revelation of Christ to the Overcomers of the origin churches they overcame Lord this year which was Lord this year is Babylon Babylon amen religious confusion are you together with me now amen so now would you have to call them with those who withstood the whales of the enemies now listen here was overcome by the wires [Music] is counting craftiness [Music] when the serpent first Eve in the garden he used wires which Moses called subatility amen Amina now the serpent was more subtle everybody you know he was rude to mean that he was life but then Eve said the serpent beguiled me into um amen Amina so the devil uses the same method says in the Harvest as he did in the seeding in the Genesis you see we are now in the Harvest time but Genesis was the city amen and we see that in Genesis the enemy used while he used craftiness the Bible says he was rude he was [Music] so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ amen foreign [Music] are you together with me what is it so it involved a female Spirit In The Genesis and I want to tell you that even in the Harvest the same two Spirits operates it is still this happened amen amen and also a female spirit that was in the sitting and it has to be in the Harvest Church when you saw corn you Repcon [Music] meaning that the wives of the enemy have never taken so I want to introduce you to the age of Lord this year because the age of Lord this year is the last Church [Music] and I mean so it's the edge of the Harvest as I've always said so all the good on the back comes to the Harvest during this age amen and you know that in the city and there was also details I know this comes up into the Harvest here so that the which can be taken to the guns gather together for burning amen so Lord this year is predominantly overwhelmed by a female spirit this is the woman's world as we wind up with the time everybody believes this is a woman's world [Music] [Music] as president of the United States are you together with it what is it so in the salutation God is addressing himself to the Church of Lord this year to a female dominated [Music] that's in Revelation chapter 3 verse he says and unto the angel of the Church of the Lord whatever [Music] [Music] you understand language not enter the church in Lord this is but the Church of the Lord this year now in the end times and this church here is not under the country of Christ they just have the convention of some kind and now there is decide to say now we can legalize the homosexual marriages it's the people the people put out crying it's a church of the Lord this year amen so in dealing with this age we are dealing with the power of the female amen my sisters I'm not talking about you who has got the Holy Ghost amen because you don't fit in the picture of the woman Indian time you are Justified you are Sanctified you are filled with the Holy Ghost and your life for bless the instructions of the world so I'm not talking about the sisters I'm talking about the woman but not the sister a sister mother she's female she's completely under different domain I'm talking about women I'm talking about the spirit of a woman a spirit of a woman who does not care how she appears amen one of these days it's going to be a fashion for them to walk out of the house decades if there was no law against indecence saying that you have a day foreign because you must know why that's the problem of the law when the law comes to promote you turn you tell everybody you don't open this room you try everything possible to happen and I'm telling you this you can go and practice just tell a child or anybody but never look under this mattress and then you make your dream I mean your your your bed in a certain way when you come back you will find out that that bed has been tampered it's just projected without the Lord there was nothing when you tell the person don't do this he will do it to see what you are going to do this is the nature of a man so he says I'm a human that's yeah and she was shopping how many years ago are those yeah if there is no law they will come first how many of you ever heard of the hippies hippies there was a time in our our second year I don't know I think sister Beatrice was not very curious those years you know a hip is a person who is just there to do wrong yeah they started and it flourished in the universities they would just go somewhere in a public place and then they run around the city this is the age that we are living so the woman this age reflects is not Sarah my wife she has Faithfully lived the life of the 50 gospel so this Lord this is not speak about a woman like her no you don't speak about a woman like you that comes to a message amen amen that advocated for the rights of the people and this gave this city and another definition other than being a female dominated City [Music] [Music] because his life foreign [Music] and so those men took Jesus are you together with me I went from the land of Israel praise God everybody amen amen so they completely took him out like when Jesus came out of the grace the Jews totally rejected and he went out among the Gentiles that's why you have the gospel today [Music] so now that's prophecy might believe the life might be the voice of the Prophet that says the Lord unto us the sun is born like I said we've go to the church the church Begins the Holy Spirit comes down Hallelujah and now as we have the uh Church beginning languages the church was supposed to move all the way back to the coming of Christ second coming of Christ the lord wanted to tell the story of the church are you together with me the way he did it was by choosing seven specific churches of course there were more churches but it's just seven specifications they have their lifestyle come here the lifestyle and this lifestyle here changes praise the Lord you understand what I'm saying go on Amen I mean yeah it's got to change and so as I said amen Amina it came to the servants and the seventh Rome was the reflection amen amen of the conditions of the church foreign Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] seven homes Friday [Music] right [Music] if you are picking one verse here [Music] is the Church of the Lord this year [Music] then I because Thou Art was a man and never had no call I'll spew you out of my mind some of them cannot come again because thou says I am rich the Lord is going to give them a new car even whenever they don't have the home to live here everyone is going to give me a new car award how many times we must be realistic that in the kingdom of God they are those who have and they are those who don't have yeah they are all children of God children of God are not determined by what we have everybody now oh we don't have foreign because looks like this one doesn't know how to pray that one knows how to pray because I'm rich and increased with Goods Thou Art wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked the message he was talking about this verse I cast out there to buy of me God tried in the fire yeah and thou mayest because describing the spiritual condition of this age as men as I love I rebuke and Justin Bieber so you locked me out of there that's the oldest man hear my voice [Music] foreign [Music] that ever doesn't just like like you work out it's the door I that you are determined to come into life change different from this church different from the conditions of the child that we are living in today amen amen the Church of Lord this year with me in my throne even as I also overcome and I'm sat down with my father in his throne let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches amen so the churches we rejected it is [Music] when he says after the fall Memorial after the fall of the church amen so now Lord this year you know was a city and you know even the conditions of the city the women were the prime factor of that place and the second was human rights the rights of the people how many see we are living in that age it's the age of the woman it's again the age of human rights [Music] which means people's rights was very common and was given to several cities foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] to you who go to universities they are given a privilege we see what is happening here naturally I know that you cannot have a speaker that's a man named and you have a deputy speaker is it has to be either the speaker is a man and then the deputy must be a woman because if the top is then the deputy should I mean he is a woman should be a man and it's the same in the church you know you need to have a spiritual and look at things by the spirit amen in all these churches the woman is The Interpreter we we just look at things and we don't bring them back into preface amen amen but then Isaiah says in chapter 3 verse 12. and for many people children are there oppressors and the women rule over there you see when we say children we are talking in our spiritually here no visas men who have not dug deep into the world you know the oppressors of the people you see in scripture age is not chronological [Music] [Music] that's the age I want to hear a very good amen is it all which has grown on the fertile ground [Music] which has life amen praise the Lord you see we need to look at these things spiritually they do things which have nothing to do with the Bible every time amen where the Bible says that you lay hands on the the sick and they recover Bible they put their hearts in the pockets and tell people we are going to pray that you may possess money in your pocket children oppress the people and the other day in Kenya Kenya this man here was holding his foreign [Music] [Music] and women [Music] foreign [Music] foreign when she prays for them for healing will they not get healed they will get their healing is a very simple answer if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you are not a Believer you cannot take it because you are blessing yourself in Lord this year where they put out the answers of the world answers to everything are you together so the question was is answered was first formed then is what does that mean when Eve came foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] are you together with me listen now Adam was not deceased but the woman being deceased [Music] so now when Ephesians teach us about marriage at the end of it from verse and you love your wife and I see whether you love them I'm not seeing those who are changing places amen I mean you see men love your words this means they were far away from Eve I need to give the serpent to the opportunity [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] are you together with me that's why the Bible says let your women keep silence is not permitted that to them to speak but they are commanded to be and obedient as also says and the Bible says if they don't understand anything [Applause] who want to be pastors your first church is your wife if you cannot be able to teach your wife the work of Christ you have no business it has to be the husband then the wife praise the Lord this is a very interesting thing that let them keep silence in the church but they are commanded to be under obedience about what they say as also says the law Grace and the law it is to this best thing on the happening in the garden and the chronological order of creation [Music] what is that position in the church there are many things that she can do but I will not take that subject to do today but she can be a political activist if she was out there in the world she can even be a prophetess like Deborah is foreign and some of them say a pastor or something but that contradicts the world cannot say they should not preach to the Corinthians and then it goes to the Romans and he says I've sent freebie to Quarry that conventional just look at what the scripture says Paul introduces himself differently he never first verse he never called himself a servant of the church a man who wonders the gospel mustard is not a servant of the church he's a servant of Jesus Christ that's the difference now Paul knew what he was saying he says she's coming to visit in that area she's a very commendable woman [Music] because she is the servant of the church I would become a servant of the church how to become a servant of the church today when he was sending them out he was sending men not because he didn't have women but he understood the order of the world the women were there some people say you know Jesus situations and therefore he did not have women there amen amen oh praise the Lord hear those women [Music] but he never said to them but they ministered to his Jesus the servant of the church look at how the church behind that is foreign it never meant a preacher in Romans chapter 1 for the servant of Jesus Christ amen Amina when you go to Galatians I mean First Corinthians it says of Jesus Christ when you go to First Corinthians chapter I mean second Corinthians chapter one verses of Jesus Christ when you go to Galatians chapter one he says by Jesus Christ amen amen you go to Ephesians of Jesus Christ he knew how to use his words so Romans 16 1. is not a preacher feedback is not a preacher amen foreign [Music] [Music] uh-huh now honey we are going to church let's go towards brother Branham says it's most worthy of not you got the very names dominating females foreign [Music] I've been in some of those churches and the majority of them in a church small small churches where I go out there you'll find about 40 women and 15 minutes it is most worthy of note that the very names attire means dominating female [Music] just this age is characterized by a dominant Force a force that ruthlessly inverts amen and the plastically controls now we're dominating females is the worst cast in the world I'm not speaking about my sisters Revelation 3 14. foreign [Music] amen comes at the end of the problem [Music] [Music] I've been revealing portions of myself foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] one time and you are here yes or no is the Angelica the word Angels means a messenger and this messenger could be asleep the Heavenly Messengers they are spirits and they have wings put it this man here let him sit here you can now the angel is going to come to you and it's going to give you a message and then Putin just right here okay this one on you now just right here but you also know I know who is coming is referred to uh as the the engine the Malaika to the church so now he goes with that message foreign [Music] are you together with it then although after that another messenger had to come yeah and now they would say unto the angels of the church now Stephen here is coming here at the end of the church he gets a message which is the Lord has given to Joshua with John Muslims and then he gives you to this engine this Angel here the word angel means The Messengers who has been given a message [Music] to this position [Music] foreign and that's why today God has sent us a message we thank God for brother brothers [Music] we know where we come from we know where we are going we thank God that's the message when this messenger wins you know he started yeah now let us just start with the freezers Ephesians 2 1 oh no uh Revelation 2 1. because this is the church so I thought it was so in verse one to the angel of the church and right to then write to them these things says he that holds the Seven Stars in his right hand who walks in the midst of the seven God in Kansas [Music] he's introducing himself first introduces himself [Music] the message is going to overcome are you together God will never send a message if God sends you someone will make you relevant to this amen he picked a certain uh you know anointing or uh praise the Lord okay let's use the word a special anointing was sent out backing this message this thing says he that holds the Seven Stars in his right time so when Joshua goes out and it's the messenger to the church you know he goes there and he says these things that I'm telling you are not my words amen amen these are words that comes from God himself the one words the Seven Stars in his right time [Music] he walks in the midst of the seven God and candlesticks hallelujah praise God so he is now revealing himself to the first church I am going to use Messengers I have them in my right hands are there and you know what is if it goes up in the time of Darkness it eliminates the place we thank God [Music] and that's why we are what we are amen you see he sends a message foreign [Music] [Music] and now after that churches and now more is added to them because he reintroduces himself [Music] the first and the last which was dead that is alive are you together [Music] to this next day that I am the power of the Resurrection are you together so he keeps introducing him in verse [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] many times foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] revelation of me is amen [Music] [Music] to come and speak to the church but the organizations [Music] concerning the titles back to use this to describe himself to love this year [Music] Jesus yes is giving us this description of himself in relation to the last age the days of grace are winding up everything he has looked from the first century through the 20th century concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age he gives us one final look at his own glorious and supreme deities this is the Capstone Revelation Capstone Revelations [Music] [Music] of the grace of God [Music] [Music] it stands for prevailing he stands for unchanging promise [Music] Hallelujah I am to this last age as the beginning [Music] they just said Solomon yes so he told them he was the faithful and true with it he doesn't only tell them he's telling them what goes with him being the amen foreign Jesus spoke to us yesterday by the prophets but today I didn't he has spoken to us it was Shadows but now empty it's not Shadow it's not Christ in the shadow of the Lamb okay bye today later Christ did it once and forever is that true witness yeah it's not Christ in the feasts that was always done the Passover we already had the Passover himself Christ was our Passover this is no longer known in those feasts is not Christine are you together like we used to see him in holy men after the ministry of Malachi 4. it's not Christ in a manner is Christ revealing the son of man in the body of Believers amen it is Christ in the present tense because it's the same yesterday and forever now [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] to kill you and you see what the Bible says in Revelation chapter 10. amen amen verse 8. I'm the voice which I heard from Heaven's back unto me again go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angels which is the message which stands on the sea and on the earth when John did it and I went unto the angels and said unto him give me the little book we used to give me the little book yes sir because you must become the richest you must become a living word or you know forget you can make it up this one here you know I know is written word but when you started the world influences your life you become it will focus as long as the word is here [Music] but once it picks the body you become a living word amen and I took the little book out of the angels and editor and it was in my mouth sweet amen Amina Hallelujah and as soon as it is extracting foreign but it was extracting the nutrients amen and this go in this and then this then the spiritual body was becoming empowered amen I mean when you read the book amen Amina so now this year he wants to come forward in the influence messages the prophet identified amen amen so uh he would preach and after he preaches he says uh as you know he came to Abram's house and you know he had his back to the tent and he gave the promise and then he says she did not laugh by the mouth but she loved by the heart are you together she loved by the heart yes does not hear you by the mouth you're in a gray suit you know you came from as a a city which is far from here actually you've driven hundreds of miles you come from Michigan from Michigan the city is so and so you've got such and such a problem you saw five doctors before you came here he says you are here when you eat the word it gives you that anointing you may not be able to say that says the Lord but your life will be so full of that word and the healing comes are together a brother may tell you a problem but because you have become that word when you say let's pray things begin to change yeah if we feed the world it will do something amen amen he also introduces himself as the beginning of the creation of God so in this last stage he calls himself the author of the creation of God yes so as the Church of the firstborn we are actually another curious this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church so as the spirit of God and created in the Virgin Mary the sales from which his body was born but it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to that human opium supplied by Mary would a sinful mankind producing your body foreign [Music] [Music] he was the son of God and joined he was the first of this new race ahead of the new rest and there's no creation is not the old creation made of it was another it is another this thing from the audio no longer is it dealing by ways of the flesh that was now how he dealt with Israel [Music] and they promise this through The Godly Isaac alive [Music] he's the first of the new creation foreign [Music] into [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] they were wretched they were miserable they were poor they were blind they were naked praise the Lord You're this year now is the spirit Mario don't look at it by looking at the people who are not here I want you to look up Lord this year as a spirit that is lukewarm which was that's wretchedu that's miserable that's blind and that's naked that's why we start dealing with the garments in law in the bridge choose the kind that don't see you know the kind that you don't see coming in and yet they don't go out those that look what was the man they are here at the door we are going they don't come in they don't go out there foreign [Music] they don't go in they don't come out it's describing the Hebrews chapter six amen Amina which says for it is impossible for those who were worse enlightened and I've tested of the Heavenly gifts of the Holy ghosts [Music] have they been baptized is described in that verse the Bible says the enlightened that they tested and so when they fall away it is impossible to restore them because they were never really part of it as they could have been around amen Amina enlightened because they were in cubanda sometimes by doctrines because they understood but they never touched the very Life of Christ they were just at the door and they could have tested because they experienced The Works of the Holy Spirit foreign [Music] [Music] you need to be part of it you need to get into the language and possess your inheritance hallelujah amen brother Branham says here now let us just give it a proverb a parabolic so that you will see and won't miss it now what is the explaining he's explained borderline belief awake is writing to this Jewish some of them are borderline beliefs now we are going to live this world of course we are talking we are talking about baptisms resurrection of the day [Music] [Music] [Music] I didn't know [Music] and you've seen those things they stay within the church they appreciate the holy ghosts they will come around and maybe the Holy Ghost do something and man they will get up and shouted up and down but they never want to receive it themselves that's good oh I don't know about that now borderline believes but they don't received they hang around like that was so long till after a while they drift completely away and the prophet says I can name names to renew themselves there's no repentance for them they grieve the holy spirit away from them if you were here hey man I mean become part of it Hebrews six verse 5. have tested of the good word of God and the powers of the world to renew them again sing the crucified to themselves the Son of God are fresh and put him to an upanishad they are the kind that cannot submit the truth and yet they cannot oppose it at the same time I know it but they don't submit they don't reject attitude I hope I don't have to know what those aunties but look one bottle and Believers and the Holy Spirit I don't believe in that stuff yeah foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] nuclear [Music] [Music] [Music] embrace it [Music] look at how they react towards John and Christ that is actually lukewarms for John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and they say he has a devil the son of man has come eating and drinking and he is standing between two opinions like they did in the days of their life you see there are certain things like when you are born in a clan foreign now in First Kings 18 21. [Music] between two opinions but if bow then follow him foreign [Music] [Music] coming as a borderline belief s and went over and he married this little princess yeah which was an idol later and brought her in and brought idolatary into Israel yeah and then it caused them to fall out foreign [Music] provided I please the church that's good and now brother Branham says you Pentecostals has God saw lukewarm in this law decent Church [Music] dear God is spewing you out of his mouth amen meaning he cannot talk to you no more amen Amina you find something to testify sometimes you don't even speak everything for this praise God he says here brother brothers first thing you know they organize down so tights till they have begin to deny all the powers of God God just set them right over on the Shelf amen [Music] which are just while the music is playing anybody kill up hands and hold a little bit and the Music Stops does not allow a lasting experience [Music] when the Music Stops [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] you take your miracle they were told every body should pray for anything and then Sister Sister Pastor balita's daughter he's a very faithful Pentecostal system at three o'clock she was thanking God for her airplane yeah foreign foreign under the church in that condition hates correction and that's why Christ taught us this year in chapter 3 verse 19. as men as I love I rebuke and Justin um anything who comes with Corruptions but yet this is a critical age the age of Human Rights the people don't like it to be told what's right it's people's rights the churches into the age of the season after the death of Samson you see the younger men their parents are here because they tie it here and it's not foreign that is his spirit I don't want you that keeps their functions the conditions that were there before the bridge they grow the hair very hop up much on the head and then they make sure that they make it open antibody like they use that right and then starts they want a certain lifestyle they bring it from out there certainly had taken our things [Music] he was in the church has locked out Christ now we listen to the castle if you are under the control of the Lord this is I won't tell you one thing you can never have an everlasting you know feeling so is amen I mean listen now do something versus the age of some soul um that you may be rich and white rain man that you may be closed and that the shame of your decadeness do not appeared and that's what we are going to deal with next week [Music] that the nakedness does not appeared and he says [Music] who was uh the judge of the seventh cycle Amen in the judges because the judges were 13. but the Cycles were seven so now one some of this I mean cycles that loses its eyesight like Simon I mean like Samsung locks of the Covenant with God that's why the Lord is telling Lord this is the Bible says that after the time of Samson songs sisters we don't want to get there Sisters You must have the eyes to know what you are supposed to appear before the people amen but some of the people don't care anymore the element that
