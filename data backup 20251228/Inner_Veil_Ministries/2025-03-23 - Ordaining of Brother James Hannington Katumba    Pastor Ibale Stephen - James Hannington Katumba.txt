into the scripture reading second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 6 before we read let us pray precious Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence with us today your grace your love and your mercy has never departed where two or three are gathered in your name and father we are more than two or three we want father to recognize your mighty PR among us we have seen you in the worship and songs we

in the presence of the Lord in Jesus name amen so second Timothy 1:6 wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands [Music] you know to St to make it burn greater and greater the gift was in Timothy and Paul was saying that he would want to put Timothy in remembrance to start that gift amen which is in him amen by the putting on of his hands may the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so I'll take [Music] time to give you you a little bit of History uh on the 1 of December I mean 1 January [Music] 1975 I give myself to the Lord as I knew salvation to be then and I did the best can to walk the walk and 1976 I started as a young man to be a witness to the word of Truth which I knew and then in [Music] 1978 I took a trip into tororo so that I could testify of Christ to the people there and as I was going around there was a team of about 10 people and they were in a house and when I tried to get in they told me you are welcome I was holding my b and little did I know that they were in fellowship and as they entered they asked me to speak to them and so I opened my Bible and I began on the subject of the priest Eli who at the deing eyesight and I started talking about the deing condition of time and at that time when I finished I had done I think the best I could and then a young man stood up and asked me after what were you baptized and then I started wondering what he was asking me about and so when we come to understand the question I tried the best I could to defend the Trinity because that's what I need to be Tru but you see all my arguments were beaten and so I had heard about the people who believe like that and so when I asked them whether they believed in brother Bram they told me no they believe in the word but they also believe that brother Bram was God's Prophet oh it [Music] was and I wanted to know further on what they were talking about and so we come to a point where I started asking them about what do they say about the prophecy of 1977 because they claimed brother Branham said the people used to say that brother Bram said that Jesus was coming back in 1977 but they told me with that we are not going to explain anything but we want you to take this book and read for yourself so I took the seven Church age book and I read it and I came to the time where brother Bram spoke about 1977 and he says I do not prophesy but I predict that by 1977 you know the you know uh the conditions will uh Usher in the coming of the Lord but you know the aser has to walk from the door to where they are going to sit so the Ash has some kind of a time in between them so we saw the falling World conditions how it started going and slanting down from 1977 and then I just kind of wondered about how he was so precise in the prediction of the decay in of wild conditions from that time so when I took it back I had known much because all the arguments I had were documented by scripture in that book so when I went back they gave me the seven seal book and all this is happening in a period of one and a half [Music] months amen they gave me the seven seal book my I read the world book in just about one week and I went back and I told them I'm ready to take the baptism amen so I was baptized in October 1978 octob praise the Lord so from there my form of witnessing [Music] changed from Pentecostal Doctrine to the testimony of the message of the hour and that young man who had told me what were you baptized is brother Charles odipo who led me to this message and also baptized me and discipled me so I thank God that from that time we pned up with him and we went so many different places in this country trying to open up churches and working with the existing ones amen so in [Music] 1985 at the beginning of the year he told me the Lord had showed him that my work station amen is in ginger and I just couldn't believe it because I was literally nobody my Ministry was in villages and now they telling me I'm going to preach in the town so when I came down here amen I mean things became totally different I started looking for places to purchase in The Villages because I was trying to avoid the town I told you that we looked for places to buy and we couldn't find them we even ask these brothers that in isn't there land that we could purchase there was nothing so I heard uh the Auntie to my wife she used to stay up in and we were staying on school L and we were hiring uh some kind of a servant quarter from the main house and so the husband to my wife's Auntie came to visitors and you were in a 10 by 10 that's how small those places were and that's why I was living with my family and I want tell you that's where this church started from in 1986 and the one of the very first Believers is my wife and brother Emanuel where is brother Emanuel here and maybe my wife both of you can come up they were the first church that I started with and brother Emanuel is a brother to my wife you can turn the camera and show them praise the Lord you just come those were the first church [Applause] they are 39 years in the church [Applause] now Sarah you can go back with your brother no problem praise the Lord that's a brother and a sister so we [Music] had a very difficult time in that room and then when the husband to my you know to the A of my wife he went and says why do you stay in such a squeezed place and up here in there are so many plots that are being sold but he was looking at me from the face of the family where I came from with quite big abilities but I had nothing because this message had separated me from my family which has a very strong Pentecostal background [Music] and those who have been to our place you see such a very big house in our compound Back Where I Come From and to tell you the truth I'm the one who started the work there so I was walking away from something that I had helped to start and the one who registered that work it was me so I was walking out it was a very difficult time when I believed this message I knew nobody that was able to support a Ministry for about 10 years so I committed myself to something that I fully believed from the bottom of my heart and I've walked with it up to this [Applause] hour so when he said I said go and look for a plot so that I can be able to buy it but I didn't have money let me tell you this is the way I was brother Emmanuel was going to G at that time and we used to have this uh uh Hot Plate cookers and so there was porridge boiling on the port because he had to take some and go to school and then patience my daughter sister G where are you you can oh okay you know she was just about one year and she was walking stuggling and she was trying to m a song Love Lifted [Music] Me and she fell in that pot F down and when we pulled her out she was steaming in the face brother Emmanuel is here you remember that we watched the first we prayed I didn't have a coin to take her to hospital so I prayed I walked away from the house I didn't want to see the consequences when I came back around 7 in the evening she was still singing the same song Love Lifted Me and she was as normal as normal can [Applause] be I trust that was God Amen so you know then this gentleman found a plot and he says come and see we found a plot you must buy I went and looked at the plot but I didn't have a coin and I said yes I'm going to come back we shall buy and then eventually what happened there is a brother in German brother God rodal he wrote a letter and he says I have heard of you and I've heard of your ministry and I'm giving you an offering and the offering was $100 and I want tell you that at the exchange before the exchange of the money that was a lot of money I exchanged it and we got about [Music] 1.75 million and it was enough to pay for the plot that's the god of Miracles it was a very wonderful thing and so the same year 1996 86 for the first time brother Harold came to Uganda and when he came praise the Lord I was interpreting for him in campala and he was going toal so in between the brothers asked me to continue with him because I had nothing to do with him I was not the host and then I said I've not carried anything from home and now they told me we shall stop by and pick whatever you pick so we came and parked by the roadside and brother Harold insisted he wanted to go to my house and I told him brother you stay here and he says no I must go with you I said no it's okay it's just so we entered with him and he says where is the house and I said it's here he said there isn't a house here so you know but it's God working in miraculous ways he says don't we have a way we can help you to have a home I said I don't know so he came with a brother brother Barnabas kuk from Nairobi I'm trying to give you a best amen and see where we have come from so you know I told him that in wuba uh they are municipal houses Municipal you can buy the tenant and then the person goes out and you pay I don't remember 700s a month so when they gave me this money in my hand $800 it was too much for me I said how can I give away that money I'm going to build on my plot so I went I had the room this way and the room this way and in between was a sitting area so I built up to the top when it came to truin the money was gone and then I said Lord be gracious so after brother Harold preaches in B you know he asked us what he can do for us at that time you know we were so spiritual mind that we are going into the rupture because when I believed the message I did not believe I had time to marrow I thought time was over but then all of a sudden I was advised that for you to be a minister you need to have a wife so I took Sister Sarah she was young then I was not any older amen I had dropped school because I knew the Rapture was coming I should continue testifying about the coming of the Lord and that was what founded the churches the soon coming of Christ and so you know I told him what we need is Bibles I was the first one to answer he says what Bibles do you have we have just basic Bibles and then he says let me look at your Bible I gave it to him I had read my Bible from Genesis to Revelation there was no concerence and it's me who arranged my own concerence that this scripture here you find it in Ezekiel here you can find a related one in Jeremiah so one place was blue one place was red one place was green and all the you know uh highlighting with yellow he told me how on Earth would you read a Bible like that I said that's what we have he sent me a Bible a scoffield Bible my that was important it was so special for me and 1987 he was going to be in Tanzania and he told me brother Steven come to Tanzania I didn't know that I was on a test when I was in Tanzania he asked me to take one of the services he went then the next time [Music] 1988 he sent a telegram be prepared you are coming into Canada to our meetings brother SE where are you right there brother SE lent me the coat the jacket that I went with to Canada and my best trouser while I was ironing I burnt it and I put a Kaka here and I went on the plane that's how I was are you together with me and then while I was there received from the airport direct into places they bought me suits I came back back from Canada when I was totally new [Music] [Applause] man and then I preached out there and they said this young man has a gift that was when the gift open to the [Applause] world I came back 1991 they invited me back but then when I came back I was given a little offering of $500 and I came back and drove my little house and that was our first home we went into there and we didn't have even money to put locks so our brother William O how many of you know brother William O from London yeah he transferred with us when we entering the house for the first time and so we put a bed for him in the cting room so when he was sleeping he said ah somebody is trying to open the door because the people I think who kept staying in the house bad people for I think when they opened they found now people in there so I you know that humility this was a banker but he loved me so much in my Simplicity he would always come and stay in my one room you know this message started with humility it's not this days where people are competing it started with humility brother Baraza knows that brother Bita knows that it was total simplicity and love it was total love you hear of a brother you can go very many miles in 1987 I went to the banks of uh Lake Albert because I heard there were Believers there and I tell you it was a very terrible place when I came back I had contracted Ty which tortured me for several years but the Lord was gracious so here I come I have uh now you know we started having the church devor I think it was in the year 1989 no 1988 the church had moved from the little house and it had come to brother O's sitting room and that's where I met Brother David he came to the meeting in there because they had known brother th and then he had a scripture he had misunderstood I don't remember what scripture it was but it was saying go back where you came from and then he was asking me do I have to go back to the Anglican Church I said no you have come to the right place praise the Lord so we've been around with Brother David for quite a long time but then the one who has been that's also the same year I think brother Alex come together with us amen they are 88 I think and then just as we came and we established a church some brothers that meeting out of town amen they heard of us they closed their group and they came brother M you are saluted so many US 39 thus he came when he heard of us so I certainly thank God who has led us to this it has been a long journey and so today we just want to help the church move on which is very necessary [Music] sometimes we walk and even when we feel like the Lord is telling us that now turn into this particular angle of ministry sometimes we are stuck but over a number of years I always felt that we should ordain brother James katumba to [Applause] ordain to take the administration and the pastoring of this church you understand what I mean so the people were asking me what will you be now according to the message the fivefold ministry is ordained of God it's not something you take and then you put off are you together with me when God calls you and he says I've made you a pastor it's not at the time when you realize but it's God who ordained you to be a pastor much as I'm a pastor by God ordaining me something which canot put off of myself I will remain in the office but work in the body from here when brother James is doing the administrative work of a pastor in this church [Applause] because it's very necessary to obey the voice of the spirit so 39 years ago we started the work here which the Lord has sustained without a split we have sent out several ministers Amen in the 39 years that we have sent out I can just remember some of them how many of you remember brother Amen brother C in we've got brother Manuel we've got brother in K we've got brother kabasi we got brother Doo we got brother Jeremiah we have our brother n who is doing a very commendable work among the refug in Western Uganda and so many other groups that we have started out with our Outreach Ministry so these are many years of service and among us we have brother James katumba who has been doing the work of the ministry in our midst consistently for 10 solid years consistently but before that he would come and Minister and go back to his work base but now he 10 solid years so I want brother to walk up here and take that seat [Applause] 10 Sol years so you know he did Civil Engineering at the University and he graduated for four solid years without a job but after restructuring this building in the Year 2005 I told him that the Lord will reward him with a good job and at the age of 28 he became a municipal [Music] engineer for 10 solid years he held that job in that job he contributed a lot to the present image of the Toro [Music] municipality he has Faithfully worked as an associate pastor here for the last 10 years he has extensively been involved in mission one he has extensively worked among the young people he has worked with other ministers in the country and out of the country he has canell couples he has baptized people and wed couples and not say he has preached funerals he has done everything that a pastor would do [Applause] he has lived among us as a stud [Music] Christian we with the wealth of Revelation and understanding to this message he was he has been a good example to the young people but we all know we all know that a man must be voted in office to be a [Music] pastor amen but yet at the same time amen we also know that a vote does not make a [Music] pastor a man must first of all have a gift amen and that's what Paul was telling Timothy that I put in thee in remembrance that thou stop the gift of God which was in the by the putting on of hands amen so in the message it is I Be not Afraid brother Bram says I think of laying on of hands and giving gifts see gifts and callings are without repentance they are ordained before the foundation of the world that's the fivefold ministry so we might recognize them and lay our hands on them amen so we lay hands on a gift not laying hands to put a gift but we lay the hands on him because he has a gift and then brother Bram says as Paul did Timothy there to sanction the gift and knowing that the gift was was in him that they had seen it work and they just give him the right hand of Fellowship to bring him into the service of God that's the only thing we do amen so it's not the vote but rather recognizing the gift first and then we vote on the gift amen so I would want to present this gift before you and seeing the maturity he has exhibited Among Us for the last 10 years as steast to give it a vote of confidence and Mission it officially as the pastor to this [Applause] church I'm taking this order because brother Bram presented brother n to the church to vote on him in the message taking s with Jesus he says I would suggest if you be the pastor of the church as long as the church suggest him being a pastor that's the vote of the church as long as he holds the post of Duty and stays with faith want to come the leading of the Lord leing of the Lord for him to stay congregation vot the same so brother Bram recognized the gift and then recomended the gift to the church I recognize the gift and I recomend the gift to [Applause] you know brother Bram actually brought brother Neville when the message was just developing amen he said a statement here I brought him here by the vot of the church to be Pastor here when even he didn't understand these things as he does now but we thank God we've got a man who understands what this message is amen he fully understands this message and has preached it in its eny amen so uh I would want James to go in that office and we are going to do the vote on him when brother NE was brought they brought a gift before the people to accept it or to reject it you've got the right amen so I want to make it easy in such a way that we hold the word of prayer first over this precious heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ here we are at a junction of time we thank you for the 39 solid years as it were Heavenly Father sounds like the time when Moses was giving over the leadership to Joshua and the Holy Spirit told them you been around this mountain long enough but now turn turn north as local church Heavenly Father we want to appreciate you for the years of stability given to us and I pray Lord as we take this decision I pray that it may come from the hearts of the people in Jesus name amen amen so our vote is going to be on this wise I brother maybe brother to come over amen Senor Among Us sinere honest man just stand up here and those people so let us have our heads bowed down so that we do not point at anybody and I ask this one question which must be answered in sincerity if you feel that brother James would not qualify to take the office as a pastor here with our heads bowed down you just put your hand up and you say I have an [Music] objection nobody so we thank God we all accept that brother James can be a pastor among us so I want brother L go and bring him back amen he in the office praise the Lord do you love him our God is a good God our God is a good god and we thank God for the way he has led this little group here comes your pastor [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the [Music] [Applause] Lord wonderful thank you brother L you can go back and sit yeah amen you can tell us whether you accept to take this challenge [Music] we can be seated God bless you Brethren I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm much humbled praise the name of and and I appreciate my pastor for this occasion I don't know what read to say but I want to appreciate your confidence that you can accept him to be your [Music] [Applause] pastor and accept to be your pastor [Applause] [Music] [Applause] by the grace of God I want to appreciate Pastor I know the has not been sh I remember when I was still in t you would always call me my pastor he would always call me my pastor and I remember sometime he told me that he had a dream and he told me that the Nile was flooded the bridge was flooded and then he was asking me how did you reach here CU he saw that I was able to drive through the N which was flooded you know many other dreams and many things he has been telling me about and I believe it has been the grace of God so I want to appreciate you so much for raising me [Music] [Applause] up I want also to appreciate the ministers who have come here today and I would also say brother hington the one bapti in the name of Jesus Christ is the first message church I attended and I appreciate God for that [Applause] I want also to appreciate my wife who has told to help [Applause] [Music] [Applause] me about I believe it's about now when I finished univ when I finished my first degree in 19 in 2001 I believe where Pastor got missions in C we went with brother and then I think we had spent a night at Brother's home that time that was I think in July or AUST 2001 and then I had a dream it was actually kind of like two dreams at night and then first dream my belief I dreamed when I was driving a a pickup you know those days we used have pickups which were using as taxes 8s and there were too many people in it and then in that same night I dreamed when like I was holding many people on my shoulders when I told then they told me that you have a burden before you now and what came to pass that was the family I had and my wife has been so gracious to be a mother to many of my young brothers and [Applause] sisters and then about I think I don't remember but about 3 years ago I had almost the same dream so when I woke up I was wondering but then I said but my family most of them are better now most of them are [Music] better so then but what came to my mind this was a spiritual application so I just pray for your grace I just pray that you keep on praying for me and certainly if we can be one with the love of God we shall be able to fulfill the purpose of God in our lives praise the name so God bless you so much than [Applause] [Music] praise the lord we serve a good God is it amen so you know this ministry is a body Ministry it's not something like you say I'm no longer not a DC to be a pastor is anination it's a call and I'll be ministering from out of this church to the body of Christ I want to do Mission work to go when I know that back home there is the owner of the best and that's our brother and also you know there is this thing which we call uh succession I'm a fir that it's very important to nurture people and when youur people exercise them in the responsibility you want them to handle being through and through like in the year 2006 that's 19 years ago and I've been going through um attacks of pressure and sugar diabetes for 25 years now but 2006 Christmas Christmas was a Monday but then on the 24th which was a December I mean which was a Sunday I woke up in the morning to go and clean up so that I can come to church I'm going to say a few things before we orain our brother but while I was standing in the mirror and I was cleaning my teeth I had a very strong Jack pass through my body when I lifted up my myself to look into the mirror I was flowing blood from the nose I used the towel I had it could not finish the blood it was all socked in blood blood I opened up and I called my wife when she came in she was so scared she started saying let me drive let's go to to to the hospital I said no I'll be able to drive and then peace my daughter was there so it was an argument between her peace to drive good enough as I give this testimony brother is here where are you brother God bless you all of a sudden I don't know whether I they called him he was already there and he drove the car they got into the car but the towel was so red we went to a hospital facility which is where there is that petrol station they call it what at amot am stex they used to be a hospital facility there so so when I was coming out of the card They said what's his problem then I said I've got pressure they said come when I was stepping out of the car the blood started again when I pulled out my towel they said no no no no we can't have you let him be taken to the main hospital main hospital it was 24th December you can imagine the count of Christmas there would be no person in hospital so we tried and they told us the doctors are not here and then I was driven and was taken to Ron when I goton this is very interesting and it's a true story [Music] they wanted blood from me to rule out certain things so when they took the blood H they tried to put it in the machine and then the power went off then they ran to the generator they pulled the string once and it also broke and was going going going so they rushed from the doctor's Place WR a generator they started it checked on the blood and now they recomended certain medicine very fast so when they went to the phaces 24th December all of them were Clos but as I was sliding my mind was saying what about the church what about the church and it has always been on my heart so finally they drove went to a man's place drove him very first to his Pharmacy and they gave me the medicine they started me on the treatment by God's grace I came back I was very young then I was only 4 years and then after that on two occasions I was D you know situations would happen that a situation my tongue would swell and it would want to CH me so I was Rush hospital I told the doctor I found there I'm Ching I'm ching he says no that's just your psychological failure and then I was completely going and WR I'm dying I WR I am dying I could speak so he hired very fast put me on a medication sorted me out and then it happened a second time and I've Got a Friend of M brother R eron is also a retired Minister back there but he's still in the church he ministering in there he's over 80 years he told me brother St check on the medication you are using if it has a particular ingredient called this that's the one which is killing you and when I checked it was exact I gave up that thing and I was okay on several times you know I've struggled with low pressure and I would spend about a week or two which you don't know and it was even very difficult to lift my hand off of the bed always on my mind what about the church one time there is a brother who just passed off boom and he was gone and then I told my wife let us go brother so and so as pastor and I used to tell him brother you've got blood pressure why don't you try medicine and then finally he was gone just just so when we got there the family was in a financial crisis the body was on a mess it was in the evening because it died in the night and we went there at around 6 the following day and covered with a sheet so after being around for about an hour or two I told my wife let us go we shall come back here tomorrow and as I walked out my wife said I cannot leave my sister alone I said are you going to stay here overnight she said yes and as I step out they called me back and the brother St the funeral is on you I said what do you me I said you are the one responsible I said you have a cofin no do you have food for the people we are looking at you and outside there were ministers in and they were they just me because they don't know much English but I can manage that church they were deating who was going to become the next Pastor the body was inside the house and they were not finding out how they were going to dispose of their pastor so sometimes when I think about what happens to the church when you are gone if you love the church find a faithful find a faithful man brother James has worked with me 10 solid years on a daily basis find a faithful man amen so when I'm gone the question of pastorship has been [Applause] settled but as I said I remain here minister in the church but the entire Administration has passed over to our brother now I do most of my work in the mission field to be able to support the new work and I have done this looking at the principle of adoption we've T here about David and Solomon David was sick and he didn't have enough strength to administer the kingdom he asked the the the uh he asked the priest that go and get Solomon put him on my and let him be driven around the kingdom and the people crying out God Save the King God save the kingon was a king when was king that's the principle of adoption that we are dealing with here and when Solomon came in he lived under the path which was ordered by David including the building of the I mean of the Tabernacle all the measurements he stepped into what he had been said and then he walked with it until his father David was gone and I have the confidence brother will keep this message alive before us [Applause] amen amen so I want to bring in a few things here that I want you to understand about the ministry of a pastor okay before we ordain him like we have heard all seven virtues in every Church age there were seven in every age but yet at the same time there was a predominant virtue in a particular age amen like we findes the predominant V was Faith the predominant was I mean was and as we keep going on there was a virtue which God held high above the others in every church and also we have had fivefold officers working in every Church in every Church age but yet at the same time you know you find out that these different fivefold Ministries at one time a particular virtue a particular Ministry was more predominant in that particular season of the church than the others like we find that in the early age the major Ministry that was high above there was the apostles amen are you together with me so in the early church I said the predominant Ministry was the apostles and all men who came into the ministry they always want to claim to be apostles they didn't say we are pastors they didn't say we are evangelists they wanted to be uh Apostles but then when they had to be checked they had to be checked against the ministry of Paul because he was chosen among the rest of the Apostles to be the foundation of the New Testament Church so apostleship was the desired office but after that the next predominant Ministry in the seasons of the church was the ministry of the teacher so in second Peter 2 verse one the scripture says but there were false prophets also among the people meaning that before you know in Old Testament even as there shall be F teachers among you who privately shall bring in Domin heresies even the Lord that brought them and bring upon themselves sft destruction so the apostles were looking at a raise of a teaching anointing which would at the time be desired to be able to cement the apostolic doctrine that had been brought into the church but then among these teacher amen we had those who sought individual Excellency Amen to be above the others and they went beyond the balance you see you can have the truth and you can teach it out of balance so the teacher that that time came and this one would teach it this way another would teach it the other way you know like you know Calin and you know went told Grace absolute Grace and another works and they pulled those things out of context [Music] and teachers are sometimes guil of over stretching truth beyond the boundaries and sometimes they Ma on the minor so they were warn that teachers would [Music] come and now look at what it calls in the church brother Bram says through poor judgment Amen inight to battle and thereby cause the death of multitudes but zuted prison amen The Godly though it did not this brother Calvin's dism he was burned at the STI so he was being they were being warned that after the apostles because the apostles you never B at that time came wanted to be an apostle but they always told you don't speak like Paul amen and today everybody wants to be a pastor but we shall tell them don't speak like the prophet of Mal are you together with me yeah we check them against the prophet of Malachi amen so in this a true Ministry should seek to lift Christ above ideology or self you don't just on one thing but out of everything that's given in the Bible lift out Christ for the people that they may see Christ in every theme of the Bible it should be the Principal theme of our Liv if is the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible is in us then it should be the Principal of everything we do say should be Christ amen so then after the teachers came the season of the Evangelist everybody now desired amen you know this Evangel so and so Evel Su Evangel and when God called an anointed brother Bram I think this should be put of us and when God called and anointed brother Bram into the office of Mal 4 then everybody wanted the prophetic anointing we are seeing Apostles teachers evangelist now God has anointed Malachi wants to be Mal but the difference here is that brother Bram was not just prophesying but he had the voice behind the side he had a message for us but during that time everybody wanted to be an Elijah amen listen to this here all there is been this message Messiah of sh Messiah the message Messiah of Mah you know he says all there has been 100 elij has come up in the last days Alexander and so many in the world today saying they are Elijah the Elijah of the day Elijah will go back to the original Pentecost epes church and bring that same message to the people with signs of the Messiah Hallelujah that was the difference but then the last major anointing the Maj last anointing amen that we have is the ministry of the shepher and that's what we are dealing with now whever we are now talk about among the organizations talk about the message everybody wants to be a pastor it's the last anointing amen now every Minister that comes up wants to be a pastor because it's the last major anointing we have that will keep the lamps together in this message before the coming of the Lord so you've got a very big responsibility that God has given you a call that teaches their pastors I mean the the apostles because your ministry brings them up the Evangelist the ministry of the pastor brings them up the teachers the ministry of a pastor brings them so it is a very big responsibility a pastor is a messenger to the local church amen so in the message Revelation book of symbols brother Bram says your pastor when he stands here on the the platform ministering the word of God is God's angel to the church Messenger to the church therefore Pastor should never leave this word but stay straight with the word because he's feeding the shepherd's place the word pastor means the shepher shepher and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer over a certain flock to feed them with what the word of God Amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah and the pastor is abandon Bearer you know when we are children of God when you are a father there are some little things in the family there is a friend of mine who told me that he broke his foot I said why he said my two sons for they are his children so when we are together you are the father to the congregation some of these people here they are little children and you are going to carry their burden if you don't greet them [Music] today it causes a problem if you go to this one's function and you don't go to the other one it is a problem I want tell you you are not working with mature people you are dealing with children children they complain over very little things they are children so you are a burden Bearer you are going to bear with these people When anybody commits a mistake some of them but when he commits a problem he doesn't want anybody to say anything they are children and you are going to carry those brother Bram says in the message God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him he say but you see in the church there is the pastor and the pastor is a special man he's built to where he can put up to the forces of the people his bur bear is the of the team he the man that can sit down when somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them both families andon it out and bring it right back into sweetness he's a pastor he knows how to take care of those [Music] thingss in the church message says church and the pastor should never take sides in a meeting by saying there is one group this way and when that the pastor should stand between both of them get them completely reconciled that's a p see next weekend I as the pastor to let me speak about the shepher you know a pastor should have humility humility the pastor in The Message Church order the prophet says the pastor must be a man that has got a very humble about not to Humble but what he could be like the Lord Jesus Christ when he was wrong going on in the church when he SE wrong going on in the church he planted drops and them out of the church and now the Church of God is the highest of judgment and the pastor is the highest order in the church the Elder is the highest thing in the apostolic church outside of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit brings his message straight to the Elder and the the Elder gives it to the people sometimes he comes to encourage sometimes he's so humble that he gets a whep to drive certain things out of the church when the brother acts like that he only being a pastor amen so I just turn a little bit to my family amen my wife sir just walk back up here she has been my wife for the last 45 [Applause] years just stand there and F the congregation right the platform and she has been a pastor's wife for 39 [Applause] years and I want to say she has lived among you as a pastor's wife you have not pointed against the way she dresses you have not pointed against the way she related with the sisters in church sometimes they've told things that have not known that she has not shared with me she has been a real pastor's wife I just want to appreciate her for what she has been for the last 39 years and I want to invite my daughters here also just come over here sister peace is not here but those of you who are come here you've lived through public [Music] scrutiny for the last9 years as past children you did just live like everybody else [Music] I thank [Music] God that you have born this criticism and that criticism has been good for you to sh you into what you [Music] just wave to the [Music] people that have helped to make you what you are that's the family that has lived with me brother Bram says that when God calls a man because his wife God bless [Applause] you so I just want a song as we get into the dedication we said it's a special service amen can you come over amen Amina [Music] amen before we get

from the public so but the Wasing today is by the word Jesus told his disciples now I through the word which I have spoken unto you and Paul taugh the Ephesians that the church is Sanctified and [Music] cleansed with Wasing of Water by the word and our brother Bram he Tau us exactly the washing Waters of so brother here brother come through Redemption by Blood Unfaithful subjected washing
