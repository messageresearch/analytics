thank God she's a daughter of Pastor samel and she's employed in G with a certain love f amen so I want to take maybe a bit like an hour and talk about the anchor of marriage the anchor of marriage now in the message the absolute brother Bram says and the real again people of this age that is filled with the Holy Ghost is the tpost of this scripture that's going to be fulfilled in the last days they are the ultimate it is God's ultimate because it is his word and the word is Christ and the there is no way to get away from it something that holds you as I said it makes you do things that you would not do it made do things do it made do things he wouldn't do madees do things he wouldn't do it makes every man and woman do things they wouldn't do something that you are centered to it is something it is it's your stabilizer it is the anchor to the ship the ship is tied to the Anchor in the time of a storm and if Christ is your absolute you are tied to him in the time of trouble the ship if it if you Let It Rock it will break against The Rock but what they do they drop the an the anchor drags until it snugs into the Rock foundation and the Sheep is tied to the Anchor is the absolute for the ship and a born again Christian is tied to Christ and the Bible is the anchor it is the thing we ATT let the organizations let the different things let the science let the Educators say anything they want as long as that word says it and Promises it we are tied to that there is something won't let us move from it that's right a real born a real born Christian they stay with that word if he says a certain thing to do and the way to do it that's the way we must do it no matter what anybody else says that's what God say we are tied to that a Christian centered life praise the name of so brother Bram is describing what an anchor is and an anchor is something that holds like for example for a ship it holds the ship in one kind of position even when the storms come it its position is definite and then he says now even us as Christians praise the name of our Lord our anchor is the word of God and of course the word of God is God himself so even our marriage there is an anchor something that holds us back praise the name of our something that grounds you regardless of DS that we go through in life regardless of the challenges that we Face through in marriages and so we see that God started marriage and when God started marriage he gave us the guide on marriage and that is the word of God so when you are in marriage and God is away from you you will not be able to overcome troubles that come when you are in marriage and you're not following the word of God then you know that TRS will come and your marriage can be shattered praise the name of our Lord so then we need to see that in our marriage is Guided by the word of God the anchor the word of God is the anch of our soul and the word of God is the anchor of our marriage praise the name of our Lord like sometimes maybe your husband or your wife may not be doing to your expectation but then how about you what is your responsibility are you doing your role are you doing your part your your your contribution is subject to what he does she doesn't love you you don't care about if she's not submissive to you you also don't love her but that should not be so we are required before God that we fulfill our responsibilities praise the name of the Lord like the other time when we talking about stewardship and then brother Bram was saying that stewardship as long as you have a responsibility you are a steward praise the name of our Lord as a husband being a husband is a stewardship and when you become a husband that means you have a wife you are responsible for and now when you are married as a husband then you become a father again you get another stewardship of being a father the same thing with a wife you have a stewardship of being a wife to somebody to your husband so you have a responsibility to your husband but then again when you have become responsible to your husband then you get a stewardship of being a mother and you know it keeps on increasing praise the name of our Lord and each of these roads that we get the word of God clearly tells us how to handle everything as a wife what am I meant to do as a husband what am I meant to do as a father what am I meant to do as a you know a mother what am I meant to do some people can be good husbands some people can be good wives how about when you get children are you a good father are you a good mother all these are responsibilities praise the name of our Lord and you see that each of them requires your commitment it requires you to involve yourself fully into it and then you can't Del get that function praise the name of Lord you can't be a husband get another person to be a husband for your wife praise the name of our Lord or you can't be a wife and get another person to help you to be a wife that should also be the same thing with our children as parents we need to be fully concerned about our children praise the name of our Lord knowing how your child is that is your responsibility you know showing and guiding your child when you read in the scriptures you'll find that God will reveal the the the future of the child to the parents praise the name of our Lord God would show the parents what will be the future of the children God showed Rebecca the future of es and Isaac and Jacob God show Zaria the future of John the Baptist God keeps on revealing the future of your children God showed the future of the 12 Patriarchs to to Jacob and then he was able to positionally place them with what God had ordained for them praise the name of our so now we need to see that take our responsibili seriously we that we take our Ro seriously see that we do the things that are right and pleasing to God what the Lord has called us to do praise the name of our Lord you know when Jesus Christ was saying in marthew chapter 19 and then verse 10 he said you know he was talking about the issue of marriage now in MTH chapter 19 and then verse 9 let us start from verse S they said unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and put her away he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so praise the name of our Lord he was addressing a condition that was in the Old Testament before the full atonment could be done they had the condition of having picking one kind of like you know chusing each other you know all kind of trying to find each other's mistake if you are in a marriage and all the time you're busy picking your husband's or your wife's mistakes that is Hardness of Heart praise the name of our Lord all the time you're picking this Mist all the time you're picking this mist and you see what the devil does he will always show you those mistakes he will always show you those weaknesses and that's a condition of the hardness of the heart and when you have the hardness of heart the next thing the devil will tell you why don't you put our or even shows you alternatives to people you think ah the other one is better then you may think ah this one I've got praise the name of the Lord there's a time I think some years ago i' had gone to a washing B of the car and then there is a man who came and then he was asking one of the people were washing the cars and asking him about his former his former wife and then he was telling he was telling this man in other the one who married the wife who left his home if he's still having that wife he a strong man you know there are some people where mind is if I can offload this or if I can get somebody to offload this one here or if somebody comes and takes them away but you see to us that should not be so praise the name of the Lord looking for a separation Point looking for something that puts you away and so now Jesus says it was because of the hardness of heart that Moses could write a letter of divorcement but now we have the solution of the hardness of the heart and the hardness of heart can best be dealt by the blood of Jesus Christ if you can have your heart in the blood of Jesus Christ do not look at the mistakes of your husband or wife but you learn to appreciate the things that she she is good and what the Bible tells us we need to bear with one another another we need to have compassion for one another praise the name of our Lord so then Jesus tells them and I say unto you verse andever shall put away his wife except before fornication and shall marry another commit adultery and soever Mar that which is put away does commit adultery his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry now they are saying ah if if I get into it and I can't get out I don't want to be locked inside but you know knowingly you went into the marriage voice till death you know everything was good there then along the road you may even forget that you said it trying to kind of look for Corners I wish I could go back to my parents I wish I could get a job far away from here you know some people have troubles in marriage they will always have enough excuses to stay away from their husband so their somebody may desire to be with a job away but for you you think he looking for money but he's avoiding a certain problema and then another start to say maybe let me go for a c far away the problem is at home at home and you see these things keep on happening and then you see that the there is a separation there is no kind of affection for one another and then some people are in marriage just because of the children not because of the husband or the wife they are not they're not there because of the principal person they so now the Lord Jesus told them when they told them that if be so it's not good to marry then Jesus tell them in verse 11 he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying but who can receive it it is only them it is given praise the name of our Lord so then we should take this as our own that this saying is given to us not all can receive it not all can keep their marriage voice all can love their wives not all can be submissive to their husbands particular people who it is given who are obedient to the word of God so if you can have the anchor of our marriage as the word of God then we are the people this scripture is given to and then you'll be in your marriage without any regret I wish I I wish I known this now that okay you have known it ask for God for Mercy praise the name of our Lord ask God to give you Grace and then go over it praise the name of our Lord but then you don't start asking ways of exit all ways of putting away you don't start doing that praise the name of they will not be having a right attitude and instead that you will be falling into another scripture of being treacherous 2 and then verse 14 say yet you say wherefore because the Lord has been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou Hast dealt treacherously yet she is thy companion and the wife of thy Covenant praise the name of Lord he said why have you dealt with her treacherously but when the the heart is covered by the blood of Jesus Christ do not deal treacherously praise the name of our Lord you not kind of like Revenge she has done this to me let me do this he has done this to me let me do this we are the children of God and as children of God we do things according to the word of God praise the name of our Lord having compassion one for another even in the midst of her weaknesses even in the midst of his weaknesses but you know you have that mind of Christ you have the Forgiveness of Jesus Christ you have the compassion of Jesus Christ towards your husband or towards your wife even your children some are not forgiving they can't forgive their parents they can't forgive their children they can't forgive their their wife they can't forgive their husband you need the blood of Jesus Christ come down into that spot praise the name of the Lord now in First Peter chapter 3 and then verse 8 he says finally be ye all of One mind having compassion one over another love as Brethren be pitiful be cous praise the name of Lord says be having compassion one for another love as Breen praise the name of if you said this one is my brother you will not hate your brother said this one is my sister you not hate your sister and then also to know that your husband is the son of the king your wife is the daughter of the king so then you have that love praise the name of our Lord like if you know that maybe you have married one of the daughters of the president or you've married you know the son of the president how the president he that you're punishing their son or their daughter you know you will be afraid how about God praise the name of our Lord that this one is a child of so I must have reverence praise the name of our Lord I must have compassion praise the name of our Lord and then being pitiful praise the name of our Lord and to be pitiful let us read it you read it again verse 8 praise the name of the Lord okay kind of showing mercy and you show Mercy where you find somebody's inadequate you know he's is kind of like lacking then you so Mercy praise the name of our Lord you show Mercy to your husband mer to your wife because of their weakness but you don't use their weakness to push them away from Yourself Praise the name of our Lord you don't do that but you need to stand there and help them if it is their weakness they need your shoulder to help them in that weakness in that point of need so then he says Be pitiful be cous not rendering evil for evil for but contr wise blessing knowing that you are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing praise the name of the Lord if the is abusive you don't abuse back if the husband is abusive don't abuse back praise the name of our Lord but it says showing good you know you is curing you bless praise the name of our Lord now we can get to another scripture here inth 22: 11 praise the name of our Lord the scripture says and when the king came in to see the guest he saw there a man which had not a wedding garet and he said unto him friend how came thou in hither not having a wedding garit and he was speechless the name of the Lord now this was a marriage and people were invited praise the name of our Lord and in a marriage like a marriage we are talking about here nobody is forced into it praise the name of our Lord and so here a person will enter but the way he entered when he was inside the hall he never had the wedding G and now in the marriage to happen there is a need for a wedding garment praise the name of our Lord the G here we can look at is character praise the name of the Lord so you need to see that you keep your wedding garment your character in marriage is very important but then how do you enter into a marriage and then you don't have a wedding G and then you don't have a character so we are meant to have the character praise the name of our Lord a character in our marriage and our character is after Christ praise the name of our Lord in your marriage see that you have your wedding garment your true Christian character in your marriage praise the name of the Lord your character to your husband your character to your wife your to your children in your marriage because it is very important if your character is not good then you are giving a bad example to your children so what you are demonstrating to them is not the best and then at the end of the day there are challenges that are going to come in future praise the name of our Lord I was reading a scripture in the book of I'm forgetting the place I think it is Psalms and then it was saying that their young men were killed in battles and then they were not they didn't have people to marry them and this is what's happening now the young men killed in battle funny things they get involved in drugs smoking evil character wrong influences like there is a village I think is I I'm forgetting the district in the county in Kenya it central part of Kya I'm just forgetting the name of the county before last year those women were demonstrating and then they were calling on the government to help them because they don't have husbands the husbands they marry they all the time drinking the young men alling terrible condition and now that comes back to us as parents how are we raising our children praise the name of our Lord how are we raising them it is our responsibility to raise them in the way of the Lord to give them a true character of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so then we need to see that they are given the truth and then even we live the truth the life of the word giving them a good example praise the name of the Lord the scripture says if you raise up your child correcting your child you'll have peace later on but then if you have failing to raise your children you'll have troubles ahead so you'll find that the decision making also bad you'll find the friends of your child and not the best friends they are because he has no value of character he doesn't see something which is meant to be right he always take things lightly like the Bible says took it as made it as a light thing so he was hipping one scene on another one on another one SC on another and he took it as a light how are we raising our children how are we making our families for you complaining is not Is Not a Bad Thing abusing is not a bad thing you taking it lightly but it's a spirit taking charge of until the children will learn how to do it how they can abuse either learned it from the father learned it from the mother and now it goes on and on even when they marry continue with the same because they don't see any difference so we need to see that we live a true Christian character marriage Guided by the word of God praise the name of our Lord let us also go to another scripture here in 25: he says and while they went by the bridegroom came and they that were already went in with him to marriage and the door was shut and afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord open for us praise the name of our Lord now this was a marriage supper praise the name of the Lord the five virgins were ready but the five foolish were not ready and then the Bible says when the bridegroom came he only took with him those that were ready to go into the marriage and then those who were already went in the door was shut and then the others came later on praise the name of the Lord so now each of us who is married you desire to get into that marriage you desired to get into that Mar praise the name of our Lord you even made Readiness for it everything praise the name of how about now what is going on praise the name of our Lord and yet we need to see that we make our marriages pleasant we need to see the B told us in 2 verse4 that I was a witness when you are having the wife of your youth how about now 2 years now years now 10 years now 20 years now and you see the very unfortunate thing here some people marry and within one year they are not longer living together then you start asking what happened praise the name of Lord you start wondering what happened within one year you can't live together as husband and wife where was the problem praise the name of our Lord now in the message the Third Exodus he says a woman marry a man and disagreeing with him it would be some kind of first continually but when a man and his and his wife his girlfriend is spouse when they are in Perfect Harmony like one soul and one mind because they are going to be one flesh praise the name of the Lord so in marriage you get your kind you get your likeness like Adam praise the name of the Lord you know when you look in the scriptures the first marriage was between Adam and Eve and the last marriage the last [Music] marriage is between Christ and the bride and now we can draw examples from the first marriage and even in the last marriage and how our marriages the first marriage Adam got a wife was from his his body Christ in the last marriage a wife who has his Spirit praise the name of our Lord so it's the same thing now for our brothers and sisters who want to marry praise the name of where is your likeness where is that which is part of you in that person because if somebody has got a part of you regardless of the disagreement that part of of you in them we always keep you together praise the name of our Lord so then how can it come that within one year everything is upside down that means there was something wrong somewh praise the name of our Lord so you need to get somebody who has the word of God brother Bram tells us that if somebody is not born again is not filled with the spirit of God you know they as good as animals how would you marry an animal praise the name you know there are some people who marry headless men and your husband is headless because the Bible says the head of a man is Christ but now the other one marries a man headless when Friday comes disc head like today going out headless praise the name of the Lord so you don't marry headless man and people who do PCM always get those people for are headless just brings a headless man and Mar a headless now when the headless man start seeing other girls but the man is headless prise the name the guy is headless so what do you do for him to get a head praise the name of that's when you'll be able to know that he's my husband but when they not they headless a you can't describe him praise the name of like there was a scenario the brother went and picked a sister of course they were married and then the sister for her she just wanted to be in in show in shows trans night and then he was telling the Sister Sister Believers don't don't behave like that she was not a Believer I wish you first preach the gospel ofers before preaching marriage you first preach out to get converted before preaching out to marry you but now you get in the house you pre toed this is Believers don't behave like that didn't care that's her nature so then we need to see that we follow the way God did in the first marriage because God said it's not good for a man to be alone but even not good to be alone he had to be that that Gap had to be fed by a certain character and the Bible says God brought all animals before Adam the was not now God make Adam fall into a deep sleep and then he created a woman Adam and then brought her to Adam Adam realized she's born of my B Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman praise the name of our he got his own likeness and so in marriage you get your own likeness and brother Bram says if you want to know the character of a man look at the wife praise the name of look at the wife if the wife complains a lot maybe the husband does the same in his heart much as may not speak because that's what pleased him you marry your likeness but now in all these things the word of God should direct us the word of God should guide us in our marriage praise the name of our Lord now if you in a marriage make your marriage work out if your wife is doing things which are not right if your husband doing things are not praise the name of our Lord call upon the name of the Lord pray for them and it becomes your burden now praise the name of so you carry your burden you pray for her you pray for him praise the name of our Lord because they are part of you and say Lord give me Grace in the challenges that I'm facing praise the name of the Lord there is a long think I don't know if I can go through it maybe we'll just read the section because I want to finish soon you know brother Bram was having at his home and then just come all the time to be prayed for there was actually an atmosphere which was not the best people crying and then some people coming to a brother home this that now the wife all the time from morning cooking for the visitors until she said I'm losing my mind these children have not had a bite to eat all the day long then he says had some nervous people there mental [Music] cases some of them walking up and down the floor telling me that the Lord is going to strike me dead if I didn't go to a certain town town because they said so and that's the kind you have to put it all together and another one in another room saying oh you don't know what he's talking about I got th says the Lord if the Lord wanted me to know anything would tell me he's not afraid to talk to me and then but you have to put up with those with that some sometimes she said I don't know what to do well look they set Sarah and Bing the floor passing over some little blocks little bit building blocks screaming to the top of her voice Daddy Sarah be got my blocks daddy she took my pocket book Away everybody is revenging Joseph sitting there in the floor beating on something as hard as he could little boy screaming on the top of his voice now you talk about a home sweet home then he says well I looked around I thought now there is just one thing to do we got to change this situation now those people they are through the day so many and all through the night does disturb the children I want to be with them a little while so I thought Lord now you help me in my heart praise the name of situation just coming to make a confusion at home how are you going to handle it but you see how brother Bram handled it in love he prayed about it Lord help then he had to go and ser we can help the wife P her down and kept on praying until the children are able to agree with one another you know not to fight one another and then the whole stuation came to C praise the name of sometimes our homes can be in such a kind of but then the approach to the challenge it matters a lot praise the name of our that's why it is important for us to take time to read the word hear the word upon it and let the word of God be our praise the name of our let the wordu over your life the word of God rule over your family let the word of God guide you in decision making praise the name of our Lord sing how the Lord can take over all the stuation that you have at home praise the name of our Lord that you can have peace at home because how are you going to live in house which doesn't have peace praise the name of our Lord see that the word of God governs waiting on the Lord seeing that you're doing the best you can as a husband and as a wife if there is failure at home let it not be you who is responsible for praise the name of our Lord if there is trouble at home be the one not be responsible for but see the best how you can avoid trouble how you can solve it praise the name of our Lord you know you take it upon yourself I want to have the best family and then you work it out praise the name of you work it out what am I meant to do in this kind of condition get back to the word of God and then you see how the Lord will direct you and then you find favor before God because you're obedient to the word of praise the name of our and when you have troubles or challenges praise the know now young couples now they go to their friends who are not married and then they consult but they don't know anything and then you go to your best friend you know what my husband did last night you do know what my wife did last night and then you get wrong advice at the end of day you find that you've destroyed your marriage you've destroyed your relationship you can't even be patient with one another find out what it is exactly pray about what it is exactly pra the name of and not being reactionary this you just had you've not established the facts you already are choosing and then there are some don't forgive praise the name of Lord said deceived me that you are this age but this is after 20 years you're telling just choosing the husband on the age not forgiving how are you going to be in that kind of marriage but now for you you deceived me this but now you read in that marriage okay I forgive you because you deceived me praise the name of our Lord not again digging back because there's a scripture which says that a person who repeats a matter separates very friends you repeat that matter you repeat that matter then you know your friendship is going Proverbs 17 ver9 praise the name of our Lord proverb 17 ver9 the scripture says he that cover transgression seek love but he that repeat a matter separateth very friends you want to dig that issue let us do some investigation he says you separate friends now imagine living in a house with that kind of person he's like an FBI FBI there is one who told me went and got all the phone prints of the wife and started finding out when he was this was calling to find out the details suspicion no trust and you can't build trust in those kind of circumstances when you are suspecting this when is away you thinking of this when she's you're thinking of this you can't build your phone your home on those kind of condition all the time you want to check each other's phone who you call this one here who this on your profile why is it not me on the profile you want to pick issues praise the name of the Lord so we need to see that God gives us Grace in our marriages let us hold to the word of God have compassion for one another see that you love one another greatly even in their weaknesses even in their failures love one another that's what the Bible has told us show compassion for one another let God be the center of our marriage we everything according to the word of God and then you keep on waiting on the Lord the name of the Lord where you have any problem present it to the Lord praise the name of our Lord and you know the Bible says when two or three agree on an issue on Earth it will be done and two as husband and wife you can say what us about this kind of issue Lord come and this kind of condition and then you see how the Lord can come and intervene praise the name of our Lord in the challenges that we have let our homes be full of love you know the love of God the peace of God and that would be a good atmosphere to raise the children to be a very good example for the family praise the name of our Lord let us finish with proverb 11 and then verse 29 the Bible says he that travels his own house shall inher wind and the fo shall be servant to the wise of heart praise the name of the Lord says if you travel your house you inherit wind as we in the marriage let us not trouble our house choosing your wife choosing your husband no respect your wife no respect to your husband no love for one another dist each other you are traveling your house and when you travel your house at the end of the day you inherit wind so instead of traveling our homes prise the name of our Lord let us do the best to put it together praise the name of our Lord not to destroy it but build it to be a better home let our homes be better and you know as you keep on living together you keep on learning each other so in other words you are able to bear with one another much more than praise the name of our Lord and as we live together some things keep on changing in our Liv because you're growing older challenges keep on coming different stations keep on coming so the things that we go through as a husband and a wife should make us one praise the name of our Lord you should be binding each other praise the name of our Lord that the love of God may continue in our lives praise the name of our Lord may God bless you amen let us sing that song I found a friend in Jesus the song leader can come praise the name of our Lord next Su we shall have only one service since we are going to have Fridays an introduction then Saturday there will be a wedding here so suay we shall have only one service we should have had a l supper in the afternoon because it will be the first stand of the month but then instead of having it the
