precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ and congratulate you this morning to be in church under this type of weather amen it's a great blessing to really choose even to be in the house of God in the midst of such a weather I'm not talking to the people who come by C amen yeah but people can walk into the rain I pray that the Lord May bless you amen you know church is our life where could we be on a Sunday morning and what would we be doing if we don't come to church amen so so I just need to appreciate all of you amen I don't know where to start from but let's stand up we shall go to Genesis chapter 49 and verse 5 before we read let's pray Father in heaven we thank you for this morning we prayed for this service and what we have is your perfect will I pray father that you may bless your people just take my instrumentality and find the areas of need father that you may communicate your children we pray that the scripture May mean something special and after this service heavenly father will your children check back and forth and really appreciate being in the word committed this service into your hands in Jesus name amen amen so Genesis chter 49 verse five it's a strange scripture he say s Andi areen that's a very powerful statement but even Judah and then nation and they were all their brothers but actually Jacob is saying these two have something in common Simeon and Levi are Brethren instruments of grity are in their habitations amen may the Lord that bless in the reading of his word you may be seated this morning I want to speak on what we call anger anger you see Jacob here he says that they've got instruments of grity in their habitation and looking at this word simply we could be looking at maybe knives or sticks or something like that but it could be tools that hurt maybe uh sh piercing words amen totally unable to handle temper we call it anger verse six oh my soul come not thou into their secretto their assembly mine honor be not thou United in their anger they slew a man and in their self will they dig down a wall C be their now Jacob is not curing Simeon and Levi he's saying that cast be their anger they are nice people but they anger them so he says cast be their anger for it was Fierce and their WRA for it was cruel I will divide them in Jacob I cannot let them stay together like that you see when you go Temple today you'll be United but tomorrow you might be separated and your confuse one against another he says I'll separate them in and scatter them in Israel so today I want to speak about anger in our circles as Christians we become so angry sometimes and sometimes we even get angry on behalf of God so we are people that can become angry at bad things and also at good things and you know because you know somebody can be angry that you we got all this problems because our pastors don't prefer us then another because the pastor is praying for them now why is he praying he says anger cast be their anger so I want over body who really is honest to himself this morning if you are subject to anger just say cast be my anger see so before Jacob changed the dimension amen from M morality he called his sons to a discernment line looking at their past in order to determine their future sometimes our past we always speak great volumes amen about what our future would be except by the blood of Jesus Christ so look back and anything that is negative you just keep picking every negative thing about yourself and keep dropping them in the fountain of blood and you say Lord I even remember this about 20 years ago even that one I drop it in the I remember this about 5 years ago this I drop it in the blood this that happened to me last also want to drop amen so he picked out two of them and he says Levi andon and then he Associated them with anger and he says that instruments of grity were in their habitation and yet this anger was ignited by a noble cause so Simeon and Levi are getting anoyed on behalf of God and there are many of us sometimes who get annoyed on behalf of God how can this brother be like this how can that sister do like this and you really find that we go out of range because we really feel God to is annoyed with them but Jacob says cast be their anger These are nice people they are my children Simon and Levi a part of my [Music] DNA be their you see he looking at a condition and separating it from a Brotherhood amen so The Story Goes that when Jacob dwelt in second you know din his daughter went into company with the daughters of the land you know and the sons of Jacob were not at home at that time you see which gives them a very good quality of Personality that these sons of Jacob were very protective of their sister amen so some of you young men you watch your sisters go with the daughters of the land but we need to be the sons of Jacob so that we can care for our sisters so and when you know when sh the the son of H Prince of the country when he saw dinner he took her and lay with her and defiled her and not only that but when he did it his soul locked on her he didn't want to let her goed her in the house so speaks to H which was his father to arrange a marriage for him with dinner and all this happens when the sons of Jacob were not at home now let me tell you sons all children forever amen you really need to be so to a level where your father can depend on you that your father can consult you have matured to a level where you can become a coun to your father we cannot do that when we are still living the life that the world lives but the sons of Jacob had matured amen praise the Lord so when they came back Jacob Brees his sons and they were so griev because in Israel in line with their sister which things should not have been done so son his they came to discuss the issues of because the sons have come back and the sons of Jacob [Music] answer and he said because he had failed because he had defiled din their sister then they said well we shall demand one thing go back and circumcise you your son and all your people then you come back we shall talk about Mar and it came to pass on the third day when they were really s that the two sons Simon and Levi took each man his SW and came upon the city board and they slew all the men and no CA are you together with me yeah they shouldn't have done this to their sister and then they annoyed they developed anger they pulled tools out of their habitation and they went and slew the men and they took back their sister and then the rest of their Brethren came and they just ped the city am they took their sheep they took their Ox they took their asses took all their wealth and they even took their little ones and took their wies and Jacob say to Simeon and Levi you have troubled me to make me stink among these inhabitants and answer say should he deal with our sister if they are dealing with a prostitute a no cause are you together with me so the other 10 just joined in the slaughter but the blame goes to Li and Simon which were the ring leaders so I would advise you friends that if there is anything negative be found not to be a ring leader okay so Jacob said I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in isra cannot allow these two red hes together amen so every assembly has this kind of hot tempered Saints not that they are bad people but cast be their and they use extra Force to deal with situations in church then they start saying the pastor is doing nothing they are extra red hot they want to ear everything by law before Grace can come then brother Bram talks about you know an eating place that dou a that he went to are you together with me I'm dealing with the issue of temper over some kind of a noble cause and they were right should we deal with our sister as one that deals with a prostitute so they kind of pulled out the weapons from their habitation and they went into attack they said Jacob the P of the house stay you are just a useless man we shall handle this situation now let us get brother Bram here he says I hate to say this it just has [Music] me when I walked in the place the first thing was a policeman standing with his arm around a woman in the wrong place playing a SL machine and a man My AG perhaps had children at home standing there with an around the woman I looked and I thought oh man let's follow the mind of the Prophet I heard somebody laugh I heard I looked back towards the back and a bunch of these boys what is what you call them bits all you know that they flat looking hair cut on top and dark sitting like a duck sitting you know with their neck back with overall jackets and their pants P wet down like this bance not start yesterday you see what I mean so boys brother Bram says boys be a man and I'm going to come back with the subject of a man I preached it about 15 years ago here you got better making than that so they are they back there and the young not 17 years or 18 years and that young lady the way they were doing and pulling around her it was a shame and I thought well what about that and they said a woman that could have been my grandma and the lady had real short cut hair and painted blue we are describing a situation now that lady's got a right to anything she wants that's nothing to me but I don't believe the Lord ever made anybody with blue hair brother Bram is trying to tell us that whatsoever sister wants to do with her hair it must still look like hair are you together with me not green not blonde it must must be your black hair it took it looked real strange and the poor old thing the meat on her arm was flanging and so I looked at her I'm painting a picture and there was an old man I'm afraid it was summertime late spring around May or June and the old fellow sitting there and a big SC around his they were sitting there drinking they excused themselves and went out and left her alone I stood there I said almighty God creator of heavens and earth I come from a mountain top to a rat den and I said how can you being holy as I know you are ever look upon such a sin as that and let it exist why don't you just send an earthquake and S the world to mean that my little Sarah and re we have to be raised up under such stuff as that to have to like that young woman back there then he comes down here and he says I wanted God to strike her dead strike the whole thing out and I felt a real fun feeling I stepped back behind the door and I said something was going on he got into that atmosphere where he knows the presence of God has come down around him and I looked and it was a vision moving and I saw the Earth and there was like a circle or a mist of the Earth and I looked like that my eyes focused upon myself on the earth doing sinful things that I not do did you hear that he gets into a vision and in this Vision God shows him the Earth but there was a circle of a red M around the earth and then while he was in the spirit real he began to see himself in the Natural Earth reality and he was are you together with me oh praise the Lord and every time I started to do something wrong I know stre would go up before God and if it wasn't for that missing blood I thought somebody would have said amen he says I was looking at myself I was nasty I was doing something wrong and immediately the report would go back to God but before it gets there Mr Blood come and block it and if it you know it says but the blood of Jesus acted like a bum on and every time my sin would hit God before God's Throne looks like it would strike Jesus before it would strike the throne and he would shake his head and the tears would roll down his cheeks and he would say father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing that was Jesus constantly interceding for him amen then I do something else wrong then looked like he was just acting like a bumper between me and death because God had already pronounced my death the day I sin that was the day I died then I could not understand why that Miss around the earth and I looked up there my book was open and I not that there was my name on the book and all kinds of sin was was wrot against me on that book God was helping him to understand who he is I pray that God would help us to understand who we are help us stand out in that spiritual room and then look back down on we shall learn to thank God for the blood [Music] amen Lord did my sin make you suffer like that and he was crying the tears on his face and he looked so we po poor bro down eyes and I my sins and caused him to suffer I said Lord Jesus I'm sorry I'm sorry that my sins caused you to suffer for me will you forgive me I promise that I'll be G and I do everything I can if you just forgive me did we talk about the fountain this morning how many of you have come to the Fountain ofda amen allow him to was you he says do you want to be well the answer is [Music] yes and he touched his side with his hand and wrote across that book pardon push it over back in the sea of forgetful to remember it no more against and I fell on my knees and I said oh Lord I can never live long enough express to you my gratefulness for you forgiving my sin he said now I freely forgive you of everything you done and you want to destroy her L and Sim with a holy indignation so we need to deal our righteous indignation with wisdom you don't like what you see many times and it hurts you many times when you see how those young people live their Liv then we need to deal with the whole indignation with that are committed in the city and put a seal upon them that's what God wants you to do that you begin to s for the sin that you see around the church amen so you are too quick sometimes because of your ho indignation you are too quick to judge everything which happens around church he should be excommunicated a righteous indignation we have C this woman the very act and mes says we indignation sometimes goes with quotes the quotes were right but Jesus understood the condition of that woman better than them you know brother Bram prise the [Music] indignation the judge brother I mean the man called sha you know who was a judge in Israel how he went in with holy indignation and destroyed that guy who was bothering Israel but we look at the righteous men like Levi and Simon whose righteous indignation exceeded the measure every Christian needs a level of temperance in our lives because our God is a longsuffering god what is temperance Temperance is a holy ghost managing your temper are you together with me somebody brother that when someone gets on me all steps on my toes amen as the old saying is my temp arises how can I overcome this I know the Lord will have to do it but what can I do in my heart I don't want this thing he's confessing I've got a temper if anybody says anything my temper flar maybe my husband says something maybe my wife says something my temp FL and those who are used in Temper they don't like it I know today they want to be Overcomers brother and he said sweeten your temper with prayer then when temp comes that Holy indignation comes it's time for you to go down to the knees when holy indignation attacked the prophet the Holy Spirit took him behind the door went down to the knees for the people let us learn how to deal with the ho indignation and the temple there are two things here that you want to develop an anger on behalf of God that's indignation but at the same time you've got the temple somebody stepped on my these are two different areas we are dealing with them today many times many people people can be moved by Temper and temper can cause you to produce you know undesirable words and they can go into temper TS and hit tables and do anything and I want to tell you today that kind of temper affects holy men also it affected Levi it affected Sim are you together with me and then the father looks at his boys as very nice boys he told them cast be their anger are we cting our anger today saying Lord I need to be better than this unless I'm better than this Moses and I told you the other day that Miracles what we call Miracles is not you it's just obedience to Holy instruction That's What miracles are when Gideon wanted them he was taken into a divine leadership to produce the miracle you know that signs and wonders Divine leadership to produce a desired result you should not kill yourself trying to cause something to happen just stay under the holy spirit let himself take over for and you will find out that certain things haveed happen without you struggling amen so he telling him go to and stand on the Rock and th sh The Rock and there shall come out what of it then the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel you know children of Israel were Ching because there was no water in the wilderness and God told Moses just Smite The Rock and he may bring his water smiting The Rock PS of Jesus Christ on Calvary that's what smiting The Rock Me because Christ was the rock that followed them when they were coming out of into the land of promise and God allowed that this rock would be smitten once and then it would produce his water are you together with me Jesus was Mitten once and he brought forth his water the baptism of the ho to wash and cleanse the church amen so the children did not again get satisfied they ched again for water so in numbers and verse he tells Moses take the word and gather thou the assembly together num 20se and gather thou the assembly and Aon thy brother and speak the rock before their eyes and he shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their be to drink my my my my are you there this morning say strike the Rock and he will produce his water so this rock here represented Christ so the rock is Mitten once there after you speak to the rock hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord he was Mitten once and today we speak to him Lord I don't want to be What I Am Lord I need you to give me some water give me the washing Waters of I am you want to drink you don't strike the rock again so we are now supposed to speak to the Rock and the next thing is prayer but in Anger listen in Anger the prophet of God advocated for a second crucifixion are you together with me when he had by himself pged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majest of to receive our petitions because he had pged our why him being crucified once again message indictment brother Bram says I indite this generation crucifixion of Christ submitted once to be spoken to in prayer will you be praying today you see you don't need another Cal to come out of the condition where you are what you need speak to the Rock learn to pray don't get upset when the pastor is praying for you learn to speak to the Rock are you together with me so when he had by himself pged our SE the Bible says he sat down he doesn't need to go back again into sacrifice numbers 20 verse 10 and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together The Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels must we fet water out of the rock for you and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he SM The Rock twice and the water came [Music] out the congregation drank and their B also he smites The Rock second time why does the water come because the people needed it are you together with me God says I forbid a woman to preach but when they preach people said don't people get saved they get sa but that's not because of them it's because of the condition of the people and the Redemption that they were seeking Moses he was charged with anger and before the people he was involved in a second crucifixion to say that there is enough Power in the Blood amen was to for him that is there enough power under the blood to deliver these Rick and R and feel like you need another no sir we had one Calvary he was Mitten for our SE we just need to Lear speak to the [Music] Rock praise the Lord the prophet says but Moses in his anger he was high tempered and then the person who asked the question he says when somebody steps on my toe my temper flares I don't like it I know when you have temper you know you have temper your problem is how to control it sweeten your temper with prayer are you together with me so he says Moses in Anger he went down there instead of speaking to the Rock SM The Rock and SM it twice that broke the whole picture of God's program the work was Christ you believe that don't you amen was only smitten once and we speak to him now Moses spoke I mean smoke the the Christ the second time and it broke the world pi God's Great program here pieces right there was being smitten twice when only Smitt once God was obligation to give that Prophet the power to do so but God dealt with Moses later are we together this morning temper enough power under the blood to deal with your fornication to deal with h and Mal the blood shall never lose its power until the last elected Rick and rors no yes sir so the Lord spoke to Moses and because you have believed me not to sanctify me the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them minister should hold that anointing God gives us with of Grace and theater they should not provoke the Lord's anointed anger it has to be both Moses you've got the power you can use it it has been given to you but you need wisdom to operate the gift one time brother BR was having a a meeting and up in the balcon was these young kids the girl and the boy were kissing as the meeting goes on and it bothered the prophet but this is a man who God gave Grace to deal with anger and temper God told him anything and it will happen then he says I forgive [Applause] them I forgive them amen so on record record mes took the position of Christ standing between God's judgment and the children of Israel in the wilderness he put himself there on record back again the scripture says Moses was the meest man on Earth but look at how people amen who were Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ caused him to anger and he did not complete his mission so there should be a flow of Grace and respect from both sides they later give respect to their Ministry the ministry giving respect to the people we can be a successful Church in Galatians 6 and verse he says let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teaches in all good things says let there be a Harmony between the L and the ministry let flow of respect from both sides that's why the angel told the prophet if you can get the people to believe you nothing shall stand before you not even cancer are you together with me there is no way you can be blessed by a man whom you have no respect you see you know believing itself accs respect if you can get the people to believe you to believe you would also involve according respect and the prophet says as you respect that servant you respect God so when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we are respecting God Amen so in the church if the church for example let us keep our ministers in prayer because they are the devil's t i strike the shepherd and Scatter the ship are you together with yeah sometimes we really need to know how to deal with things that make us unhappy I'll give you another example of the man of God his name is when Elijah was heading out in his Rapture God gave him instructions to anoint three men to to be king ofri to be king over Israel and elishah to be a prophet in the place of el so if we can say he had the anointing of Elijah upon his head and it shall come to pass that's what now the Holy Spirit was saying by Elijah after anointing these three men he wanted them to work in and he say shall come to pass but you know he that escapes the sword of AEL shall slay and that escap the sword of el slay they had an [Music] agreement because they were supposed to minister in the same cere and that this man here should not raise a sword against another he says stay together as ministers in and I thank God for the Harmon of spirit behind the ministers God bless them so je he had the permission to use this SW that's what Elijah told him but in Second Kings 10 verse 18 and who gathered all the people together andto them Serv a little and Shall Serve him much he was raised he was anointed to destroy the family of Ahab because they led the people into the bar now this man here being a man anointed by Elijah he telling the people that Ahab did not was enough going to more then he says now therefore call unto me all the prophets of B all hiss and all his priests let be waiting for I have a great sacrifice to do to bowever shall be wa wed he shall not leave but did it [Music] in to the int that he might destroy the worshipers of b a holy indignation are you together with me and gave them special uniforms so that none could Escape so in verse 23 of Second Kings 10 and went and the son of into the house of and say to the worshipers of B look that they are be here with you none of the Servants of the Lord but the only so the people went around to see that there are no worshipers of the Lord that had come up and now after finding out there was none then je released Israel to go and slay he [Music] had who anointed who was commissioned to slay all the Servants of B and B all his servants were destroyed but the scripture say je himself did not depart from the golds which were in and are you together with we are dealing with the temple sometimes in the ppet and the Lord said unto je that's because thou done [Music] well in executing that which is right in my eye the house of according to all that was in my heart children of the fourth generation shall SE on the throne of Israel come on now so God is appreciating you know je for destroying the house of Ahab because that's what he was called to do and God was rewarding that then your son will also sit on the throne and then your grand son will also SE the four generations he allowed his seed the seed of of je to sit on the throne of Israel for destroying the house of Ahab but for the righteous indin against the bers Hallelujah Hallelujah it was a holy indignation but did God appoint you to do that it was an overstatement for which God rewarded him negatively let me tell you about the ministry it can be powerful but in the power there must be wisdom we need to handle the call tole the call with wisdom look when you go to 1 verse chapter 1 verse4 and the Lord lord said unto him call his name jezel for yet a little while and I'll Avenge the blood of jezel upon the house of jeu and will cause to seize the kingdom of the House of Israel he says for this I have given you four generations of the K but for this all indignation the authority of the ministry without wisdom I'm turning out your family so ministers can be pushed into holy r but we need to exercise the same measure of Grace which God has accorded for us also when he called them Rick and RI God told Brother BR I have my people in there we thank God for today look at theost of love in a holy R do you love him let's go to Luke Chapter John is the Apostle of chapter 9 verse 49 and and John answered and said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forid him because he follow not with us this man here is using the same anointing which we also use but this man here is not part of this church CL he does not belong to our camp generally he doesn't come to our meetings his spiritual ancestry is different John was not happy and verse 50 Jesus said unto him forid him not for that not against us is with us and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem you see discipling job he now sets his face to go to Jerusalem to be offered verse 52 and sent Messengers before his face and they went and entered into Village of the Samaritans to make ready for him prepare yourself the master will be coming through here there will be signs wonders and miracles and you are going to see the real power not like that man there and now when they went there the people did not receive Christ because his face was set like he would go to [Music] Jalem so verse 54 his disciples James which is Hope and John which was they saw this that man there he has a greater meeting than ours the people getting healed the master is here has nobody then they said Lord will thou command fire to come down from heaven and consume them as theas did so that was a righteous indignation from those disciples that represented hope and charity why do such denominations have more people success was being measured in numbers but success is faithfulness to the amount of talent that God has committed to you do your best if the talents were two don't stri for five two because at the end of the day it's only faithfulness which is [Applause] rewarded to remind ourselves the cream of the local church that Paul had was Ephesus it had 12 disciples 12 believers they could not even make a church board no deacons and then trustees and then this they were not even enough why and Paul spent with them three years and it looked like it was AED Church 12 people today 12 people tomorrow but brother Bram says that's the Church of adoption hallelujah hallelujah you want to talk about an ad people you look at the Ephesian church only 12 people and looked like it was not growing God does not reward numbers God rewards faithfulness in the amen that's the lesson you John and James were being T Jesus just turned rebed them you don't know what man of spirit you have anger they were victims with a righteous indignation as Christians we must exercise [Music] temp and temperance we can be able to forgive we can also be able to repent Temperance takes away your right Temperance is being toen down even when you are right that's why we need to sweeten our temper with prayer all the time whatever the people say they tread on your toes your temper with pray right or wrong be careful not to react with anger Jacob says Sim and they've got the same quality of Personality they are instruments of city in their habitation form of bitterness in the human Spirit they are Breen because they share the same emotion of anger and Jacob says in their anger they slew a man and in their self will they dig down a wall self will a no cause but handling it with excess God says no if I let these people stay together they'll either hurt everybody or they'll hurt themselves praise the Lord so they did not have time to think over their actions and Jacob says we will divide them in ja and scatter them in Israel because we are Temple all of a sudden God have mercy that we may train on how to handle temper their father says it's danger as keeping them together they very nice boys they like everything right on the dot that's why made L to take the priesthood he the man who could handle the law he was straight on the trigger praise the Lord amen you see anger splits churches anger splits families anger splits Business Partnership no like a boiling volano worse still if there is a holier than thou attitude involved you say I will do this God doesn't like this praise the Lord Solomon said he that slaugh anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit greater than he that taketh the city he say again wrath is cruel Ander is outrageous there's no benefit in Hing anger learn to forgive like a forgive the church how many forgive that's Temperance it takes away your right you just need to do the will of God I forgive you amen God listen commandeth his love towards in that while were yet Sinn Christ died for us that's what you need to tell your brother you need to tell your husband you need to tell your wife that even for this I forgive you and when somebody comes to repent and say brother I'm sorry don't start pinning him down tell me why did you start it no the Bible doesn't say if I Repent I mean the Bible puts it to everyone to do it I forgive you if you don't repent mine is to forgive you understand what I mean would be sweet homes when you say cast be their anger you tell your wife I love you and you mean it it brings love in the home but each time you are not feeling good about you woman no let her be temper and then he say hone I love you isn't that beautiful let us talk about Elish now in second Kings chapter 2 Elisha had just cross back from the Jordan freshly anointed in the man of el the first miracle he did amen he parted the waters when he says where is the Lord God of Elijah meaning that I don't take a man without power you don't take the Holy Spirit without the life behind are you together with me so he says where is the Lord God of elij through I'm baptized with the Holy Ghost the life that the Holy Ghost gives that should always be your question before you deal with the situation the second miracle he healed the waters but the third Miracle it was now the anger of the Prophet just coming over back like this he was in a new mantle he was trying to swell because that man was too big for him and so when he came back the children instead of saying look at the anointed of the Lord they were saying B head head head head they were not raised well child delcy I mean parental delen are you together with them you see sometimes this is caused by the families they sit down and they discuss a minister negatively in the presence of their children you are destroying them and that's what the parents were doing and when they came before Elisha they were negative they were just ridiculing him and they were following B head b bhe b how can such a minister bless you say Amen somehow that's good amen let's go to verse 23 of 2 Kings 2 and he went up from then unto bethl and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou B head go up thou B head you see they are talking to their pastor you see I have a boardhead go up boardhead go little children the next verse and he turned back and looked on them and cast them in the name of the Lord and they come forth two bears out of the wood and tear 42 children of them as ministers are endowed with a lot of divine Authority and they may sometimes mix it with their own Humanity and they do wrong judgment je mixed it with human Zeal but elishah mixed it with human anger don't this kids know that I am the Lord's anointed do they know that this is El's garment is now right upon me and don't they know I got even a double anointing they don't know that b head B head Bo head Bo head go up go up follow your master we don't need you go up go up we ministers should handle this authority of the Ministry with caution and the later also also give the ministry some space say Amen somebody anger andly indignation both of them is not God it's your human nature in Joshua chapter 3 and verse three I like the way the scripture here is written he says the people say they are now crossing the Jordan into the promise of the Covenant of the Lord your God then you shall remove from your place I like that scripture the scripture is not making the minister the subject but he speaking about the follow it is the AR of the Lord and not the priests yet there shall be a space between you and it not them by me that he may know Way by which you must go for you have not passed this way before not between you and them it is between you and the so that children that the bear at were not Tau how important it was to give the ministry some respect and they became victims of the prophets we need the balance right there listen to the words of the Prophet here he says you remember Elisha went baldheaded when he was young man some little children begin to sa bhead bhead why didn't you go up [Music] with that angered the prophet now turned around and he cast those children in the name of the Lord and two sheep Bears ran out of the woods and killed 4 to little innocent children that's not the nature of the Holy Spirit you know that but that was that Prophet that but that Prophet was angry that's why when I stand out here I always preach in love to you I allow the word to transform your lives not the force of my Ministry praise God so let us get to the families now anger you know families should create a Bible atmosphere in their homes B on hband love we should not live in a right or WR when you do that you lose it I broke toy me when you are trying to live the right or wrong situation you won't have a home perfect love covers a lot of Mystery in your fames let me tell you something when your wife cooks food and it's bur if you've never said thank you that's the day for you to it was good food but when you start saying you you are killing your own home wish should allow charity to govern our homes it covers Romans chapter 5 and verse 5 because the love of God is shed Brad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us yeah it's it's that I started it somewhere the mdle when we receive the BM of the Holy Ghost it's the love of God which flows and that love takes us into First Corinthians 13 and that charity that we speak about is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ if you speak with tongues of angels doesn't have the companion charity the Lord Jesus Christ you are not going to make it when the Holy Ghost comes down into our lives the person of the Lord Jesus Christ that charity amen he shars the love of God abroad our hearts so the love of God we FL from God to each other in our families and Will C Foundation of love where we may not provoke our children to anger praise the Lord so do things that c love and not anger in our families and together we should not provoke one another anger and our children if there is a habit your husband does or your wife doesn't like don't insist in it let charity govern our hopes Colossians chapter 3 verse 19 sometimes it's nice to preach as a pastor isn't it husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them Colossians 3 verse 19 [Music] do not communicate in Anger are you together with me love has no bitterness in it and it does not brew anger amen then verse children obey your parents in all things is well pleasing unto the Lord then he says not your children anger un they be discouraged they say I'm just waiting until I go to the university when they get to the university says hey when I finish my degree they were provoked to anger so he says fathers he doesn't say mothers he says fathers don't provoke your children to anger why because the fathers they are the ministerial Authority in house at this you know family let charity Prevail don't pledge over your children project the fatherhood of God towards the children for God so loved the world that he gave a positive remedy and not judgment so as a father bless God's wrapped gift before your children love them let Divine love FL from the father down to the the family the way you live in your house you are teaching your children how to live in the house there is no way you can exult your wife in the presence of your children and then raise a son who will have respect for wife anger is not good just turn around and tell your neighbor anger is not good confess and let that demon leave [Applause] you brother I wish your wife was brother rers your wife everybody you see I want husband and wife together so that when they are preaching both of you are saying [Laughter] amen praise the Lord that's love look at your children with the eye of God Live the Life of Christ for them bring them to church pray for them and with them let your love be real amen work for your family and guarantee them an inheritance even if your job brings 1,000s at home let your wife know and that where she's going to respect she will not ask for what is is not there let that Bond of love and once it comes in it pushes out the spirit of anger God give us men who will love their families and not men who will provoke their families with that God bless you Jacob said cast be their anger not the people wonderful men they've given their lives to Christ but that's just a thing that holding them God bless you cast be your anger so that you cannot be separated in Jacob that we may stay together as a sweet family God bless you so much Amen brother josua do you love him
