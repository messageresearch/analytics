foreign and make everyone complete law we commit the center service into your hands For Your Glory and for your honors in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen well we are still standing I request we turn to our Bibles we got the book of Psalm chapter 17. we're reading from verse 13 to verse 15. a Canadian community Psalms chapter 17 from verse 13 to verse 15. the scripture says arise O Lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy sword from men which are thy hand O Lord from Men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose bury though fillest with thy High treasure they are full of children and live the rest of their substance to their babies or um as for me I will Behold thy face in righteousness I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness beholding the face of God beholding the face of God so now here David gives a testimony and says ants for me yeah I will behold your face in righteousness and then I shall be satisfied and when I awake with thy likeness praise the name of our Lord we also want to behold the face of God this morning we need to see the face of God praise the name of our Lord we need to meet God face to face of my son praise the name of our Lord we need to interact with God we need to have a personal relationship with God so that it's not about the God you hear but the god that you know personally praise the name of Allah the God told us that you can talk to somebody about the God that you have a personal witness that I have met him I have heard him speak to him I have seen him this is what he is like you know initially this is who he is you know when we go to John chapter one praise the name of Allah let us go to John chapter 1. and then we read from verse John chapter 1. and then we read in verse 44. let us start from verse 43 that will come up the following day Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Philip and says unto him follow me yes now Philip was of betheda the seat of Andrew and Peter Phillip Phillip findeth Nathaniel and says unto him we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph yes praise the name of Allah so here we see that Philip when he finds you know nothing he tells nothing of God in righteousness it changes your thinking it changes your imagination it changes your desires praise the name of our Lord when you behold the face of God it will change you completely from who you are to become who God is the name of our Lord when you interact with God when you come into His presence when you behold the face of God you don't remain the same praise the name of Allah Isaiah praise the name of Allah in Isaiah chapter six the Bible says in the end that King uziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and this trained filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with trying he covered his face with trying to cover this feet and with trying he did fly verse and one Cried unto another and said holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory um and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke [Music] then said I what is me for I have undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of the people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts praise the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so Isaiah had the vision and when Isaiah had the vision he saw the ground and when he saw the presence of God and then his son seraphim we are crying one to another I'm saying God is Holy Spirit and the whole earth is full of his grace and then he saw the post move from one to another [Music] does it bring conviction to yourself does it bring you into a state of saying here Isaiah a man was looking at us praise the name of the Lord and his eyes were not going Beyond praise the name of Allah but when he saw the presence of God all the friends of God he realized his conditions [Music] do you find yourself insufficient do you find yourself that you're not bothered about anything praise the name of Allah let us go to the Book of James chapter one foreign [Music] of the word and not hear us only deceiving your own selves [Music] for If any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass um for he beholdeth himself and goes his way and straight away forgeteth what manner of man he was so ever looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continues therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his dead and then it shows you that you need to correct this you need to make this place better maybe the hair is not welcome maybe there is some kind of dirt here so now if you look at the mirror then you realize how come where is my condition so now the more you look into the word of God then the word of God should be able to cause attraction in your house to be like Jesus praise the name of Allah you look into the word of God you are beholding the face of God praise the name of Allah you are seeing God as he is praise the name of our Lord so it should cause a desire in you Lord change me Lord transformation when Isaiah praise the name of Allah in the presence of God he was able to cease as [Music] somebody who needs to be here how about us when we see the word of God before us when we hear the word of God are we contented by what we yeah oh we are not concerned of what the word is telling us when Isaiah into the presence of God he cried what is me I'm only worthy Lord I need your deliverance and that's what God also requires of us when I see in the word of God my limitations where are my failures what is my stand before God praise the name of Allah we need to call on the name of the Lord now in the message first I want to read there the prophet says and Isaiah that great thought that he had they don't tell you anything he perhaps was schooled he probably had a good education he had a marvelous conception of what God ought to be yeah he had had the priests he had been in the temple he had been raised to be a believer but you see he had never come face to face with it before yeah maybe some of us are in that same condition I've had the priest told me about God I've had my parents talk to me about God I've had my teachers tell me about it you know you are just hearing somebody else's testing you are just reading somebody else's story but then where do you put yourself in it praise the name of Allah Isaiah had the same thing maybe the mother had told him maybe the teachers like the region he had been taught well from his childhood what shall I do to have eternal life and then the Lord took him on the law of Moses [Music] [Music] come on and follow me and [Music] come and follow me and also we have the same opportunity when we come in contact with the world when we come in contact with the presence of God how do we respond to the word of God praise the name of Allah hear Isaiah before the presence of God he had been taught well he had been raised and then here he comes in the presence of God praise the name of Allah and then if the prophet says he had a desire to do right yeah he wanted to be right but he just had the educational side he had the theological side of it but when he got there in the temples These Wings back and forth and realize that these angels means that in the face of God and them Angels didn't know even sin foreign they covered their holy faces in to stand in the presence of God then that I have learned then that the prophet cried out what is me for I am a man of unclean life all of my theology all of my mother's conceptions [Music] I am friends to face with it now I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell with people that's unclean lips I will never reach the place to where he come into the presence of God understand god with his own eyes when he was sitting up on her in the heavens and there he was face to face with reality I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell among unclean people then it was the cherubim the unclean lips and he turned him from a coward from uneducated man [Music] [Music] [Music] and shout as long as you want to you may run up and down the floor and you might speak in tongues as much as you want and Them Things Are Holy and good I don't say nothing against it but until you meet that person that satisfying position that's something that takes every fiber in your body not by emotions but by a satisfactions and that's what we also need today praise the name of our Lord that's why it said Lord I want to meet you in face to face Lord I want to see you in person until a person has a back side of the desert experience like Moses you can't be changed praise the name of our Lord we also need that personal experience that I have met him like Philip the Philippines I read about it but now I have met him whom the Lord talks about we also need to meet him name I need to be
