First Corinthians 11 3. which says but I would have you know that the head of whether a man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God that's a very very profound scripture but I would have you know that the head of the womb of whether a man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God my interpreter is late I don't like you know waiting for people foreign moments of humility in marriage if your way towards it moments of humility in marriage abuse so I've told you for tutored in the Garden of Eden and the purpose was to build God's kingdom here on Earth a spiritual Kingdom amen Amina it was given with a strong blessing multiply and replies and so brother Branham tells us that the multiplication was a spiritual multiplication because this promise here this blessing was given before Adam who was in flesh so he said Adam before sex was ever introduced before sex was ever introduced before sex he was ever introduced sex y amen Amina multiply and replace the earth when it was yet in the beginning when he was yet both male and female in himself that's when he was taught you know multiply and replenish before even they come in flesh before even Eve had come out of the rib of others so it was a spiritual multiplication then the prophet says they assures that the bride has got to come from the World by spiritual multiplication Amen to replenish the Earth so that promise was the promise to build the kingdom and we see that before they could reproduce by the spoken word we see that Adam and Eve [Music] and so that promise had to be suspended until the second Adam would come back by the spoken word so we are born in the family of God by the spoken word [Music] and that's how the spiritual multiplication was supposed to be okay amen Amina then we see that Adam and Eve became separate bodies holding that promise they needed to maintain a particular quality in order to bring to pass that spiritual promise are you together with me and so Adam then gets into his marriage after God had approved his maturity foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] when you have been baptized he becomes the spiritual security of his house and is the foundation of the spiritual growth of that family spiritual security and spiritual Foundation that upon his understanding of the word there's family here is going to be founded in a strong situation amen amen at home the man assumes the son of pastors to continue watering the seeds which are planted during the services of the church that's what a man is there foreign [Music] she encountered a teacher and yet we know that in scripture the Bible says whatsoever you've not understood husband at home but eve took a decision before she could ask the husband if he bypass her spiritual security yes and she built on a false Foundation yes praise the Lord I appreciate God for the audience at least of the married people of church thank you clap for yourselves you see at home the man becomes the pastor of the family um how does he become part of the family by watering the sea Rocky Williams that have been planted during the services that's why you husbands must be very good students of the world it will be very dangerous if the wife at home understands the world better than you Stephen you have heard that praise the Lord to become very good students of the world that's why Paul says of the sisters in First Corinthians chapter 14. and if they will learn anything meaning the sisters [Music] [Music] he says that because he knows that a man who gets married must first of all have a spiritual maturity amen so if you lack into your spiritual maturity it's very necessary from this meeting you go start burying yourself in the tapes you go and listen to what the message says because you are the spiritual security and you are the spiritual Foundation of your family so under this knot the husband is the pastor of the house when and to learn properly a good atmosphere must be maintained at home [Music] and the husband must be a good student and maintain a very good found I mean atmosphere amen Amina that the reason atmosphere of worship there is an atmosphere praise amen there is an atmosphere which is holy at home while you were made [Music] amen amen remember now in the family of Abraham Ibrahim there was an atmosphere and worship is not only the songs we sing but worship [Music] we don't have shouting matches [Music] [Music] no you maintain an atmosphere worship you see many times when you've been talking maybe sexual things how we visited so and soon then they say okay let us pray before we pass there is a moment of silence you are changing dimensions you see what I mean you are changing Dimensions you are trying to make yourself to enter into state that can pray and I desire that we stay that that kind of state most of the time [Music] the house of lot in reality a dent of the atmosphere of worship and brother Branham says that they were always having those hooky bookies and so no angel would visit them but the atmosphere in the house of Abrams Elohim and fellowship with I mean Abraham yes that's what God did so under this must keep a clean atmosphere at home you must have enough words [Music] to negotiate the storms in marriage because holy marriages foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] are you together with me that's what I'm calling humility in marriage moments of humility in humility I mean in the marriage like there was a man in the land of rules [Music] and that man was perfect that money was Uprising that man feared to God there was nothing you could Point against that situation [Music] you see you cannot keep away trials in your marriage but these trials require moments of surgery [Music] simply because he was perfect before God you must learn some of these trials because the devil is not happy with the perfect condition of the home then he is going to blow a storm and if we don't put in the chair of humility then we are headed to a separate all right amen Amina you're not trials have nothing to do with the sin no judgment it says it's not that because you've done this then destroy your cows foreign [Music] but the challenge is how do we react to these challenges [Music] and some of them are like the curse of jobs sometimes whatever just comes in obviously understand and destroys the wealth yes yes [Music] your business begins to crumble yeah you start wondering what am I going to do sometimes celebrity the devil just come and touch your health and then the peace is gone sometimes celebrity the job is lost and it becomes a challenge and sometimes they are situations [Music] we have been married five years we don't have the child a child doesn't come by one person you'll find a situation where you're gonna name better pastor we have the problem somebody will obviously we don't have the son he said and that also begins to become uh uh a storm in the marriage we don't have the daughter and then because they are looking for adults two children three children one of us are four children five children but I know eventually seven children probably Muslim then they get a gown but after some time I remember Etc then the means to keep the family together you are looking for a girl but you did not know you were multiplying that demands that will come with the seven of your daughter you see what I mean we should come to a form of humility sometimes everything we know quite ourselves and accept what God has allowed to be in our life brother Branham says then the God is obligated to a man who will stand like that he let him go right down to the last person even to his wife come out right away why don't you cast God and die right we're gonna turn our far just to think his own wife turned against him and because someone will turn against us and think that we are from your heart hello funny oh oh yeah amen amen all God's people but are funny amen you are the peculiar people offering sacrifices to God the fruits of your lips giving praise to his name now what we're not that even job's wife [Music] why don't you cast God and that right we're gonna foreign foreign are you together with him situations come everybody that is sickness comes anyway they don't tends to become permanent yes you've got this pastor and prayed with him you've made calls two different pastors to pray over the situation and then job's wife just stands out how long shall I keep with a husband like this just as good and that moments of humility in marriage those things come especially when we begin to Edge brother Stephen I don't know whether he's here organized okay praise the Lord you know things begin to come because it is my argument things begin to come [Music] they never tend to leave you wake up in the morning and then sometimes maybe the sister is still in a better form everybody foreign this is something you can't come it just requires moments of humility that we hold oh we carry one another's body amen Amina yeah it's during this difficult times that we need him amen amen this kind of situation should help us to cling together do you know so that our prayers [Music] because the more we pass in the times [Music] each time we keep separating ourselves we are actually blocking channels of praise when the job condition enters the door of your house [Music] amen because if you scatter while the Singham songs you can't overcome the situation foreign [Music] [Music] and this one thinks Ronaldo the other one is better the other one this one is better so now the man says [Music] [Music] nobody is ready to understand the other yes moments of humility towards it in our marriages are necessary this kind of situation should help us to killing together First Peter chapter three but it is Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters as long as you do well um [Music] [Music] the victory in this family because they didn't have the child one of the big problems that separate people but still Sarah was so humble that she kept calling Abraham Lord yes [Music] you know one year welcome 10 years you said God said we are going to have a child no no no no no no no baby that was not Sarah she maintained her submission yes she could not say to Abraham after all next soccer you are the one who speaks to God always and you keep telling me no no no no no no she maintained that calmness amen amen verse 7. likewise ye husband amen amen the sister keeps saying Lord sisters [Music] [Music] [Music] pray with them according to knowledge not that you didn't marry a fellow man my name is [Music] [Music] you know we got Seeker to be weaker like easily [Music] like she fears and the God desires that we maintain what form of relations to pull us out of that condition may not be hindered foreign [Music] foreign amen Amina so let's um times when those things come okay to one another spirit amen may be an inspirational song comes [Music] yeah you know then the husband let him go free you know all of a sudden you've entered into moments of worship then the sister comes down you know waiting these things like let me show him hey you will show forever because the situation will never leave you are going to suffer [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] amen Amina jobs friends who do not understand the situation and the wife who understood did not understand the power of prayer and the patience sometimes and it stays longer than it should stay away what job's wife needs is to understand the power problems [Music] we need to keep our families together and when you have those kind of problems those are your best times [Music] [Music] it glued us together I was out there amen Amina during those days where it was I mean the worshiping in there and when my daughter would go into crisis and then I was going to be teaching on CEOs I was carrying a series she was crying so that you preach the following day today difficult time she said I'm disabled but you can't take them away I wonder why families over things that they have no control over because the job is lost whoanga um he didn't want to lose the job we need moments of humility in our marriage we went also through 12 years of rough times when we could not know whether I would have a meal yeah we were never certain of the following day starting at three days never did my wife ever pressurized me to provide for what I was not able to provide I celebrate her foreign I don't know we were talking over it last week and I was saying that I even don't know how we came through those years there was no fights praise the Lord amen Amina so you know when situations like that come over now what you need is humidity to pull through the situation amen amen just say to your family like the family of job put it under the world put it under the blood put it under the fear of God and then watch God [Music] that's what you need to do okay got it so he kept his family under the blood I'm taking another language I do not know how many people keep their families under the blood little children to pray with them and teach them to speak like a Christian you are sowing seeds of eternal life amen so when you look at these kids here together you need to deal with them dealing with the spirit of election that grows in them that's what you keep speaking and you say that you are a wonderful founder I mean you are a wonderful child of God God loves you God will make you his servant one day those words will always come back as these children are growing teach them that if they are girls what is the expected of a God don't allow children to discover things amen Amina when they discovered they will discover the wrong thing so teach them limits that a girl goes to um the limits a boy tell them you are children of God according to the Bible amen put them under the world amen amen teach them about the trousers is smart for you you're the best for you because [Music] the importance of cutting their hair and said that that one there is giving us the glory to these your sisters but when you let them grows and now they are moving over like that you are not putting your family under the blood by putting the family the security of God let's go to Job chapter one soccer verse 2. and there were born and to draw seven Psalms and three daughters his substance also was seven thousand sheep it is [Music] so back this man was the greatest of all the men of the East [Music] and these Sons went and visited in their houses [Music] children and Saint and God for their three sisters to eat and drink with them and it was so when the days of their fishing were gone Sanctified them and Rose up early in the mornings according to the number of them all now everywhere it may be that my sons have sinned because God in their hearts did the job continually he never forgot protein children when they come back from school foreign [Music] [Music]
