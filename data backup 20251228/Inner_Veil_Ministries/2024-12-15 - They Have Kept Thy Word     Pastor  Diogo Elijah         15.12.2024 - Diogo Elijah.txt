praying for him he has been a real pillar in the word he has been a real sign post and we take it as a greater privilege I want to thank God for the opportunity given to be here this morning and Pastor James Kumba invited me here to share with you the word my brother Paul my interpreter at home brother James told me that the brother The Interpreter is sick so we must remember him in prayers so we won't stand up and we go the word we are not we are not coming with a new thing praise the Lord but as the prophet said when we come in the house of the Lord we should come with the welcoming Spirit welcoming the word of God already have sung the song it had a very powerful message about the revelation of the hour that we are living in because the revelation of the hour that we are living in is the one which brings the power of transformation to change our lives that we can be different from the people of the world let us pray precious Lord in the name of Jesus we want thank for this greater day you have made us be Witnesses Lord we love you and we bless you we have come in your house as unsufficient people we cannot fight our battles but you have specialized in Crossing valleys and Mountain Mountain may you help us this morning some have come when they desperate father may you speak to them Lord some they need Deliverance Lord may you deliver them Lord some need the power of healing may you heal them Lord Jesus because you said in your word your healed father may you unveil yourselfto us so that we can know you Lord father one word from your mouth Lord it means a lot my savior we remember Pastor Lord in Tania ministering may you father use him in the special way in the special way Lord and I pray Lord God let the people be blessed my savior even where Pastor kba is Lord may you bless him this morning with the entire congregation may you bless us all together as we Fellowship on your word touch our lips my savior you have the ability Lord to close our lips my savior that only your word can come up father as we dedicate ourselves My Savior into your hands My Savior may you touch The Interpreter let us be one in Jesus name we pray amen and amen so we want to go in the Book of John chapter 17 always is a blessing to come home blessed me of the Lord John 1 we want to look at verse six I have manifested thy name and the men which thou has given me out of the world they are were and they are given them me they have kept word so I want to talk about the word bless word you may be SE so I want to welcome you I know yesterday we tired because of the function but the prophet said in the message tusting for life if you are a Christian you long to go where other Christians are and fellowship with other Christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life so just coming to church it changed your life because we among the people who are prated who has the hand of the Lord who knows the will of God so that's why I want to thank you for putting the sacrifice this morning to be in the house of the Lord so the prophet says the prophet says you stay right on the word the word is life every time you receive the word you receive life stay with the word stay right with the word that word is life every time you receive the word you receive life take it in your heart not only receiving it take it in your heart and when you take it in your heart believe it as you your own possession so the word must become part of you that's why Christianity is more than coming to church Christianity is to have a personal experience with the Lord Jesus Christ the life of Christianity when you receive the word it gives you the direction in your life you don't do what you want because the word becomes part of you it becomes the center of your decision like in this hour that we are living in when there a lot of spirits going on the enticing Spirits the only thing that can control us and protect us it must be the word so the word should to take the preeminence in everything that we do we must allow the word to become our guide and our in everything that we do he says the word should become your possession every promise is yours God gives you a checkbook when you receive the Holy Ghost blessed name of the Lord whoever you receive the Holy G God gives you a CH you can use that check to receive anything that you want praise the Lord you need a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ because every time we gather here we are gathering in this building but there's another church again in this building which is the of Jesus Christ but the only way you can enter in by seeing your name when you see your name you can have person relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ the while you look at things it changed even the friends you walk with they change bless name of the Lord so we need to we need to keep the word like the apostles kept the word the word should become part of us because the thing we desire when we pray we receive it in the name of Jesus he says ask anything in my name God will give it unto you blessed name of the Lord you just need to stand in the presence of the Lord and you say Lord give me Grace that I can receive your word that the word can become part of me blessed the Lord because the word has everything the word has Redemption bless name of the Lord once you reject the word praise the Lord in Redemption because only the word that can prepare you for change of your body the Bible says walked with the until the Lord took him home it was not just one day took it took 500 years walking with we should never get tired of walking with the word because the word is life blessed name of the Lord we must receive the word with the spirit of Joy blessed name of the Lord and this word here can only be seen when it's manifested in in the life of a body praise the Lord this word can be manifested you can go in the place and you don't preach a message but if you are there the way you live that you Christian because our Christianity is not just talking but Christianity is the life we live blessed name of the Lord so it's our responsibility to keep the word in this age that we are living in that in all circumstances we become more than conquerors bless the name of the Lord we can see all the prophets they ested the word and once everybody who accepted the word that God gave the prophet they Reed their Redemption and those who rejected the word they receed their Cur so we are blessed people because we have received the message of the bless the Lord a prophet a prophet is God's reflection what a prophet is God's reflection how many who knows that is the prophet he reflected the word of God and we believe that we are here because God has sent us a and if God has sent us a prophet we have to reflect the same word that the prophet reflected the prophet become the word he had to feed on the W he had to eat the scoll until that word put on body so even today the word must embold in your life desire blessed the Lord because this word here once you take it it has the ability to defeat Satan any place anywhere any time in the days of Jesus praise the Lord inth 4 Jesus used the word defeat the Devil he quoted Moses man shall not live by bread alone but every word that comes from the m so you must stand on God's word you have the ability to defeat the Devil in every circumstance that we are going through the word should become Royal your tempations the word should become Royal trials the word should become Royal you are suffering in everything that you do put the word first that will bring victory in your life bless name of the Lord now God God wants us to deal with us on the basis of the word praise the Lord not our ideas praise the lord we are living in a very terrible hour that sometimes when the word is being preached the people goes back and they make a research praise the Lord you cannot make a research on the word we are called to believe because the Bible says all things are possible to that believe not all things are possible go researching begin researching you become an intellectual praise the Lord and once you become intellectual the word cannot bring a change bless the name of the Lord when the angel Gabriel came to Mary praise the Lord and the angel told Mary you are blessed among all women praise the Lord you are going to receive a SE Mary say how shall it be I don't name praise the Lord and the angel say the power from the most high shall come upon you and Mary said Let It Be according to your word so every bride Let It Be according to your word bless the Lord the prophet says that the greatest mistake that Kan made was to walk away from the presence of the Lord and the greatest mistake that you can do today is to walk away from the present blessed name of the Lord in a message praise the Lord the power of transformation he says the first thing he did Kan walked out from the presence of the Lord there he made his first mistake and there is where we make our mistakes when you walk away from the presence of the Lord that's the first m you make so if you're going to live as a Christian you never walk away from the word even if you are so weak even if you are so tired it's the word that has to give you strength because the Bible says that Waits upon the Lord shall renew their strength blessed the Lord we are living in a very terrible hour when a lot of En Spirit going go in this hour that we are living so if you don't stay with the word you'll find yourself are defeated but if you stay with the world you'll be an overcomer because in Christ Jesus we are more than Overcomers bless the we are walking on the Journey of Grace we are we are standing on the finished work where God has done everything we just come to believe then things can change our lives bless name of the lord it's very very important God has given us an inheritance God can never call anybody and just leave him and just leave him hanging not having a position when God calls you he gives you a position he gives you an inheritance and you know what we are holding on bless name of the Lord Joshua and Cal when they were fighting enter the promis land C was holding on something and after the battle was over he tells Joshua give me my Mountain so you cannot become you cannot be an overcomer without holding on the promise that God has given you in this day bless name of the Lord may God help us and give us we can never be like Kan Kan never kept his position God was a merciful god when Kan killed his brother immediately was worried that killed AB but also they are going to kill when Wasing God came down and to put a mark on him bless the Lord so it's always God's grace that we can stand to keep the word bless the Lord we must allow the Lord to deal with our lives so that we can reflect the message of the hour bless the Lord so the word operates in the body and when it's operating in the body it can be seen everywhere blessed name of the Lord God spoke the word and gave it the Lites to take care of [Music] it the way we live what we think about the people we stay with matters a lot to determine our our destination because we find out this day that we are living the prophet said in the SE that like the God gave Egypt time to repent but they fa to repent and all died and he says even today he pente time to rep but they dead but you find a Believer today enjoying to feed on the people who are dead spiritually yet there is a spiritual food in season when you listen to organizations your life will never change because the prophet say they have a spirit behind them so if you listen to them the blindness that they have it comes to you that's why the prophet say that's why you must know which voice are we listen because God has sent a message God has given us food there is spiritual food in you season these people are living in Egypt in Egypt it's just darkness it's just crying it's just alarming there is no hope there is no chance they are God is material things and the prophet said in the end time material things will take the place of the Holy Ghost and he says the hearts of the people will become called bless the name of the Lord that's why people can come in the presence of the Lord and they bothering about the dicks they having why it's because they are not realizing the position God has given them we must rest in this message because this message is rest bless the name of the Lord this message is rest we cannot struggle anymore when we enter in this message once you receive the message you have entered in rest you need to keep the word praise the Lord it is God's word when it's G when it's given to the ordained men there is no way you could be part of the work while you rejecting the CH of administration somebody can come to church I say this this I believe what I but this one I don't believe and enticing Spirits are destroing our churches when somebody is in church and having marriage problems he wants other people he the same problems these aning spirits but the purpose of our gathering is to unite with the word to wait for the change of our body because the greatest purpose of this message is to wait for the change of our bodies first seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness then other things shall be added done it's very dangerous to be in church and lack the revelation of whom you are because the victory of a Believer is to recognize your position Christ Jesus I'm called of God I'm elected of God I came from eternity and I'm going back to praise the Lord but every time we gather together we are fellowshipping about football about Arenal but Christ cannot come among us when we are felling about the things of the world we always come among us when we are talking about [Music] every time we meet together must see the word those who are coming from they were talking about and United with them and began talking with them blessed of the Lord but every time the service is over my brother I have too many dates I don't know what to do but you have been the presence of the Lord you have not told him the Lord my trouble I'm having Lord I'm having problems in my home come down lord and bring peace in my home but every time we are just conversing about our problems then they become songs they become songs many times I wonder you you tell somebody a problem and just says sorry my brother oh sorry my sister he has not carried the burden but if you enter in prayer and you present it before the Lord all things are possible to them that believe we can change circumstances by bringing all our worries and our ab and the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ bless the name of the Lord we need to realize that we are living in a very terrible hour where as if the word is losing his power but the word never lose his power but the how you behave your conduct praise the Lord the way you behave matters a lot towards the word you must have a right attitude praise the Lord one thing that I realized that those days when we are growing here when the pastor was preaching here we are looking at him as God and anything that came from his as God has spoken and that's why you have stood up to today but these days somebody will separate this is the word of the pastor this one of God we are coming to church when they are preaching to receive the word they give it to us where there is a re we take it with happiness but these days somebody look for a court supp his weakness you are totally out of the way because once you come in the presence of the Lord you must have the spirit like of David when Prophet came to him when the word came to him he said there is a man here in your country he got a Visa and when received the V he decided to go certain man took the ship of that man and David is say is that man here if he here will be killed right now and the prop say you are the one you have been having 500 wies but you took wife and fell down he never told the prophet you don't know that I'm a king I can do what I want we must have a welcoming Spirit when the message is coming to us that's the way we can bring we can receive the change of life but we don't come with welcoming Spirit if we don't come with the welcoming Spirit to receive the message our lives canot be changed blessed name of the Lord you must know where you are standing before the Lord deals with you you must know where you are standing either you outside or you are inside blessed the Lord you must know where you are standing we must stand with the word we must allow the Lord to deal with us that God has given us Administration that gives us the message we must feed on the message but you find out these days people want to and these foreign men because the prophesying you are going to take a blessing the fire is coming your way the life is remain the same but you must understand that if you are not going through trials you have never met God the prophet said if you have ever if you have met God you have met God through the tri you go through in the message ofb more before the Lord more you go [Music] through more before the Lord you go through because you become the reflection of the Living God bless the name of the lord it's very very important we can see that when in when Brothers of Joseph rejected him you can see what happened they end up in in in in slavery if they stayed with the word praise the Lord they were secure praise the Lord but when they rejected him when they rejected the wife of their day they they end up in slavery praise the Lord when they rejected Moses see what happened they moved in the wilderness for 40 years so the only way you can enter in the prise is by keeping the word and being part of the word praise the Lord the Bible says great is he that's in you than this body which is in the world praise the lord we must keep ourselves in the word we must walk in the word the word should become part of us when they rejected Elijah judgment stri them praise the Lord when rejected Christ he missed eternal life you reject the word you miss eternal life once you receive once you receive the word you receive eternal life bless name the Lord and the prophet says etal life is living for others you cannot live for others have etal praise the Lord since God has opened up doors of witnessing we should become part of this work praying for this work supporting it because eternal life is living for others friends our problems they will not be over until we go eternity God is telling us what you have in your hands you are crying for a blessing but what have you done for me every time you are crying for the blessing but what have you done for me bless the Lord had something to show the Lord when he said prepare your you're going to die he said see the been walking I've kept your word I've done this I've done this you must do something for the Lord praise the Lord in order the lord to bless you it's very very important you can look at several people in the Bible who accepted Elijah they were blessed even the widow woman do something the Lord blesses her the word came to the Widow in the time of starving had taken over but immediately when Elijah came he said give me a dream praise the Lord after asking for the dream the wiow womaning for me to bring for me something to eat theow say I one I was going to eat it with my son and we die and Elijah say bring seek the kingdom of God [Music] his praise the Lord support the work of God in all circumstances the Lord will take care over you don't look at your problems because the problem will never be over blessed name of the Lord we must take up our position to support the work of praise because the prophet told us God is not having hands but your hands God not having eyes eyes let the word embold in you and once it comes in you life can never remain the same praise the Lord the widow woman he brought food he never looked at the circumstances but the woman could say even if Elijah eats right now even if the prophet eats right now and from I die he has a greater work to do even if I die I'm going in the presence of the Lord I'm blessed have a prophet in my house let me take food we should take it as a blessing that we have received this message so that we can support it to move in every corner the job God has given to you is for one purpose support his work because God is a business man he does not invest where he not going toest and the Bible says the faithful in the small and the faithful in the big if you cannot be faithful ,000 once you get a million you'll never be faithful the prophet talks about sister sister was so poor WID woman but they were preparing to work on the church and and sister pledged to bring money but the amount was big and the prophet felt so sorry for sister but but immediately there was a brother who talked to the prophet and said leave sister is the of the Lord paid all his bills before they reach before so when the prophet went in hunting and spoke SPS into existence the Holy Spirit led the prophet in the house of sister when the prophet was giving a testimony in church about the squ he says the Deacon of the church doubted what the prophet was saying because sister was part of the word when the prophet came in and began speaking saying is the truth the man of God it has happened and God told the prophet sister United with the word let something that she wants right now it shall be done it was the first time because the Bible says you believe the all of your heart and you confess with their lips but sister he said I want the salvation of my two boys immediately the prophet say they in your hands and the boy came and fell the feet of the prophet and receive the Holy Ghost without saying we want to receive the Lord Jesus Christ and the prophet says that was the third pool the opening of the word so we already in the opening of the word in our hearts how can we go back to the Pentecostal looking for prophecy and T yet we have the opening of the word because once the word is inside of you you receive anything that you want but simply because you have not United with the world you are still struggling and they are telling you there is somebody this way who can prophesy about you and pray for you and your problems will vanish those are the lies of the devil those are enticing Spirit we must Unite with the word once you Unite with the word you have everything life changes Life Changes once you Unite with the word the Bible does not say that you go to the prophet and pray for you or the pastor but it says whatever thing you desire When you pray you shall receive it you must know your position in the world support the word be part of the work and the Lord will bless you bless the name of the Lord we must receive the word with the welcoming Spirit like elishah elishah was a man when he was plowing the garden immediately Elijah came and looked at him and when was when was digging his lines were straight and Elijah said see a man who does his work perfect if he comes in the word will be a perfect man and he smashed on him and immediately elishah said because of the anointing which was in Elijah he said let me go and I tell my parents then I come I follow Elijah say what have I done unto you do your work but when United with the word the life of elishah never remain the same and once you Unite with the word your life can never remain the same and immediately for the sake of the word elishah destroyed all the animals and the people ate so that can fall bless the name of the Lord he destroyed everything he was not like a Peter when Peter Jesus told him come and become fishes of me he deci tode that when this business fails I'll go back where I've come from and there are very many people in church that's their condition they are living in they are here but every time they enter in trials they are looking at theirin where they came from it's very very important once we come from those religions we must bu them we must kill them so that we can Unite with the word Peter said when the business of Jesus fails I will go back to my business blessed name of the Lord and when the time came Peter entered in a tri immediately Jesus said you are going to deny and said I cannot deny but when time came the people began pointing at have you not been with Jesus and began walking out he went back to his business but we thank God that still Grace when he was going Grace went with him and brought him back even this morning there is still Grace in the presence of the Lord in the presence of the Lord there is still Grace that can help you to unite with the word blessed name of the lord it's very very important to understand that we are living in a different Covenant and this Covenant is the Covenant of Grace he has done everything praise the lord we need to unite with the word so elishah follow Elijah praise the Lord until the life which was in Elijah came in Elisha and that's how this morning that the life which was in the prophet is the same life that should be in us not just speaking about the word or hearers of the word should be doers of the may God give us Grace this morning kindness to the ministry can give you eternal life you cannot be part of the church when you only speak evil things about the church about brothers and about sisters and the prophet says you kill the influence of the church we must learn to speak good things about our [Music] church because when if you talk about your home you are not shifting you're not shifting from it you are part of that family even if your father is a drunker talking about him does not change anything he remains your father we must learn respect our mother our mother which is dischar and respect our father who is the pastor that's the principle friends if we are going to leave as Overcomers we must keep the word bless name the Lord we want to go in Marth chapter 13 verse 23 kindness to the ministry it gives you eternal life the Bible says Marth 13:23 but he that receives the seed in the good ground is he that hears the word and understand seed which also bears fruit brings forth much 100 fold Psalm 60 Psalm 30 and Psalm 100 no [Music] [Music] and this is where the battle is when we come to church the devil will allow you to leave your home and you come to church but as you are sitting there the word is going on it begins it begins telling you on Monday the guys of black are coming for because he knows once you miss to see your portion in the word you are defeated sometimes even the prophet says that once you receive the word when you go back in your home the devil is waiting for you on the way to challenge you on what you have received bless the name of the Lord so you must have the ability of receiving the seed in the good ground not the ston ground not the side way praise the Lord and he says You must have an understanding of what the word has said you hear it and understand it it brings fruits it changes your life it Chang the while you look at things praise the Lord so the while you receive the word you remember in The Message Church the prophet says Satan comes as a robbing Spirit hold fast what you have in your hand that no man should take away what you have he comes as a robbing Spirit everywhere we go we can feel this robbing spirits who has thr the word from us the enticing Spirits there are many praise the Lord may God help us that we can take up a position of allowing the Lord take the first PR in our lives we should allow God to our lives in the message the end time sign he says then you say well Jesus healed the sick and the prophet says he is the word he is the word when you receive the word you receive Jesus Christ for he is the word once you receive the word you receive Jesus Christ because Jesus is the word the word was made flesh and DW among us and we believe that praise the lord we believe every bit of it we believe that Christ is is God's word made manifest and we believe that his bride must be the same thing the Bride of God must be the same like the Jesus was the same thing was the same praise the Lord and we believe that his bride must be the same thing and we believe that she must she must believe every bit of the word not a half of the word bless name of the Lord every bit of the word not a half of the word you need to take the entire word God has given itto blessed name of the Lord and once you take him that way change comes in your life you have that word in her because she is part of the she is part of the body she is the body where he is the head you become the body and Christ becomes the head we must allow the word to deal with our lives in every Circumstance the word should take the first praise the Lord we thank God for the message of the hour that God has called us in this day that we are living in that we no longer desire to be to desire for the people goes on mixing because it's the age of mixing praise the Lord but we must only stay with the word Jesus had a perfect faith and he had it it it come because he was the word they had the perfect Faith he had it it come because he he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word you become the word as you receive the word so that's why many times we have to come prepared the service begins in our homes the service does not begin from here it begins from our homes Lord I'm coming in your presence but may you deal with me Lord may you use the minister Lord I Sur my life bless the Lord when you receive the word you become the word praise the Lord when you receive the word you you become the word Jesus said if you AB in me and my words in you Words which is the word abids in you then ask whatsoever you will it shall be done unto you if you AB in me if you AB in the word and the word abids in you then you can ask anything in the name of Jesus it shall be done unto you praise the Lord you must keep the word because once you have the word you have everything you'll speak to Every Mountain praise the Lord that surrounds you and it's going to vanish we are living in the hour of lamenting everywhere people are lenting but your Refuge is in the word younger people marriage is just real dancing it's because they want run their marriage by using their phones when they watch the sister will expect the brother to do things that has been watching on the movie even the brother is watching the movie he expect the sister to put those things in action but when it's not in the word then trouble the phone has become hell it brings somebody who is very far so close to you and somebody who is close to you is far from you find husband and wife in the house everybody we must bring the word back in our homes where we can have Fellowship blessed name of the Lord we can have Fellowship to speak about the Lord the way we are ready for his second coming you see people are praying Lord I pray for you give me a house and I stopped renting but now data has become another rent somebody will fa to put the money in the basket of the church but we borrow that I want to see what's going on Tik Tok What I want to see what's going on Tik Tok Facebook TT whatsappapp let the word control Our Lives bless name the Lord let the word control Our Lives because once the word controls Our Lives we shall have peace in our lives if we are running our marriage basing on the word we shall have peace in in our because after all once you get a sister or you get a husband you want to reflect the image of Christ and the church bless the name of the Lord we must allow the word to take the pre AB in me if you abiding in me and in you ask whatsoever you will it shall be done unto you blessed name of the lord it's very very important he says that even if you speak the mountain that be thou moved be thou moved and be thou cast in the sea he says shall move you shall have whatsoever you have saved When you pray believe that you have received whatsoever you have been asking for blessed name of the Lord if you AB in me and my words AB in you ask whatsoever you will we know that the truth if you in him you receive what you want you receive everything that you want if you AB in him it shall be given unto you he that receives my words and beli on him that has sent me has passed from Death eternal life but can you receive the word first this is the prophet is saying you first receive the word first he that that has sent me has passed from Death un life and shall not come into condemnation but can you receive the word first can you receive the word all all of Christ Christ is the anointed word is the word anointed Christ means the anointed word the anointed word for the day praise the Lord made manifest praise the Lord he becomes your savior and your Redeemer that is when was to come praise the Lord he was that anointed person to take the place blessed name of the Lord put your foundation on the word I want even if the guy is working in the factory which makes so and is's putting on that oval and passes that factory where the soap is the will never be clean until he gets the soap and begins washing then the becomes CLE you can come in this church for very many years but if you have not put yourself inside the blood inside the word is your responsibility as a person putting yourself under the blood Here I Am Lord Just As I Am Lord I come in your presence praise Lord just as I am bless name the Lord this is the hour where we find people they are Desiring for the things which are not real once you receive the Lord Jesus Christ who is the word all your sins all your sins is thrown in the S forgetfulness but people are Desiring for self-righteousness in our church there is no Revival because people not crying but some people are crying because because their sin are still there the are stilling every time they [Music] come we must settle in the word you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you listen the lord it's very very important to know that God has given us a good church and a good Ministry appreciate God for it praying for it and knowing that the responsibility is upon us to continue taking up this light in different places at the place of work in your home praise the lord it's very very important to allow the Lord to deal with our lives the prophet says now it is the holy spirit in the last day to shine forth the evening light restoring back the faith that's what he's doing bring back the oral Faith the oral Bible Faith the original Bible believing every word of it praise the Lord taking it back that's what the Lord is doing we must always stay in the presence of the Lord by saying Lord give me Grace to stand Before You When I'm Not Afraid once you have the word you have everything the enticing Spirits are robbing our joy in our homes because we want to compare ourselves but we are not being called to compare ourselves we have to compare ourselves with the word blessed of the lord it's very very important to keep ourselves in such position in such position I want to wind up bless name of the Lord so God is calling us for one purpose to unite with the word so that we can be we we can be ready for the change of our bodies he calls us he calls us to give us a position and God wants you to identify himself he wants you to identify yourself with him he says you shall dwell in this land I'll that I give gave unto your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God but when God is dealing with you toite with the word he wants you to separate yourself when the word is going toite with you looks at your attitude people wants the Holy Spirit but they don't want to be changed the attitud change thinking when he was in the religion the want to think in the message bless the name of the Lord and you see you have to understand many times people thinks that repentance just coming to say oh forgive me please repentance is change of attitude like thetical son he changed the attitude the Bible says when was there suffering eating the food of the pigs he came to himself he came to himself and said how long I be in this condition when the Servants of my father are eating well he said no I not remain in this condition I must return back and I go to my father change of attitude brought him back home change of attitude made father be ready to receive him change of your atude makes God be ready to receive you any time any hour if you have changed your bless the name of the Lord so sometimes we fail because of lack of change of so repentance is changing you have been taken this way and the Lord says turn please bless name the Lord and that's what Jesus said If any man comes after me let him take up the cross and follow me you take up the cross and the prophet says Christianity is a self-denial if you say you want to unite with the wife you first deny your life blessed the Lord so change of attitude brings change of character bless the name of the Lord change of attitude brings change of character it brings the faith that makes us separate ourselves from the people who can hinder us from uniting with the word in the Old Testament Israel separated from the natural land they are to separate from the natural land praise the Lord but today we separate ourselves praise the Lord in a spiritual way bless the name of the lord it's very very important so that we can Unite with the word the prophet says now all those types of of the old they were just Shadows of the things to come I believe that I believe that I believe that was the church in in natural the Jewish church was brought out of Egypt blessed the Lord who had the natural law that church natural law but today God's spiritual church with a spiritual law written on the tables of their hearts LED in the spiritual form what is laid on the spiritual for now it looked up to see where the pillar of fire was the angel of the Lord but we do not look today there is something happening that we know that is there so those on are dealing with things which are natural spiritual way there is something that the Lord is doing right now bless name of the Lord so you must be spiritual enough in order to see what the Lord is doing enticing Spirits are going on everywhere but we must keep the word that's the way we going to defeat them Joseph in circumstances of being in Egypt he defeated every by keeping the word bless name of the Lord but these days the Youth of these days once he get such an opportunity he says I'm resting but was not Joseph Joseph kept the word because he knew was climbing the mountain at the end of the road he knew there was joy for him blessed name of the Lord there has to be a life of a sacrifice praise the Lord because there's something that's happening right now he says there were the people of God Israel down in Egypt they were the people of God till they came out of Egypt they were the people of God when they were still in Egypt and started towards the promised land then they became the Church of God the word church means called out I love that we are called out praise the Lord from Babylon to enter in the promised line toite with the word I love that separated ones God said God said separate separate me and to do the work that I've called them to do so he has called you to unite with the word so that you can do his work if you cannot Unite with the word you cannot do his work blessing name of the Lord there is a level of Separation God separated Israel and made them a holy nation so what Israel was in the Old Testament God is what is what God is doing in the New Testament Church what he did in the Old Testament is what he's doing right now separating us so that we can Unite with the word blessed the Lord this is what the prophet says in the message Jehovah now you see where the Pentecostal church is today he says the weakness weakness that's right he says that once you look at them they are full of weaknesses just dropping along like flies praise the Lord falling off themselves the younger people are running for they are running for such people ministers who can speak things in existence who are intellectual but the prophet is saying they are falling like flies you must have spiritual eyes the prophet says you cannot go in the restaurant and they bring for you fish or food when the coach is there and you eat oh obviously you know that once you eat the food which is having Co you are going to get sick but spiritually the Believers are not afraid they eat everything that anything that comes too much fire is going on but they don't stand and they say where is this fire coming who has begun it the sons of Aaron they brought Strange Fire and that Strange Fire brought death in the camp we die spiritually because we look for the Str fire and that Str fire kills you Spirit that's why we must have a standard we must have a standard of what we listen to and what we feed on bless the name of the lord it's very very important because the hour we are living in is a very terrible hour praise the lord we bless the Lord for his goodness that he has called us for a purpose when he called Abraham praise the Lord Abraham knew the voice of God and when he fell from the promised land he understood that I'm in the wrong place we must have a standard of the word when you see that something is influencing you you say uhuh let me stop here football is taking me Beyond where I have to stop blessed and the prophet says that many times people do not enter in the spirit the spirit of Christ that's why they cannot be connected with Christ because even the things of the world you enter in their Spirits when you see the PO bicycles you find bigger men closing up their shops and they watching the bicycles they have enter in the spirit people of football they enter in the spirit he leaves his home at night and goes in the film he wants to watch man recently a man died in may he has been a manager in a pet station but he loved so much baiting so that time went in the film and they had put those things of baiting 1 million when he had put in that money he Lo he lost he claps from there bless the so the people of the world enters in the spirit when they are doing those things look at when they enter that spirit even if you're not part of them and you are cooking at home but when they begin also you live there the [Music] food you reach I've let me go back we must have such an anointing that even at the place of work the people who surrounds us we can influence them and they believe what we believe [Applause] we must enter in the spirit of the word blessed name of the Lord so that the word can become Royal that our sons and daughters can become part of the word it's very dangerous to talk about the word but when you're not doing the word we need to talk what we do it brings an impact upon our families L the Lord so you find out people they watching football on television but the body is here but the spirit is where is so we are sitting here but our Spirits be in the presence of the because somebody just watching watching a television and says you find out that people have never gone to school they can count all the lineups of those [Music] players and the coach and the money and the money they have entered in the spirit but we Christians the prophet says many times we fail to enter in the spirit of Christ but once we enter in the spirit of Christ the life can never remain the same you can know your position where you are standing you become an overcomer you can imagine once somebody enters in the spirit he does not think about his titles when he's watching football oh Ron Ron he has entered in the SP once you enter in the spirit of Christ you not think about your titles you are failur your worries they they rolled away we must enter in the spirit of CHR in order by uniting with the word bless the Lord and when when did Abraham's seed lose this greater Fellowship when it went down in Egypt he never lost his Covenant but he lost his Blessing that is what I'm trying to get to you people tonight the Pentecostal church has lost its form of blessing there is something wrong there is something wrong and we know that everybody that ever read the history of the church knows that there is something there there is something wrong within the church now you have now you have lost your now you now now you have not lost your Covenant but you have lost your blessings once you fail to unite with the word you are losing your blessings because the promise of God is I'll bless you and I'll make you a blessing you yourself you become a blessing among the people where you stay to your neighbors not only being blessed become a bless when you Unite with the word blessed name of the Lord we must allow God to deal with our lives because has called us for a purpose staying in the word is our separation when you stay in the word that's your separation blessed the Lord we must allow God to deal with our lives there is a purpose for your calling God has not called you when he's not having a purpose in your life when he calls you he has a purpose for you and it's your responsibility to go in the presence of the Lord and you tell him Lord what is your purpose for my life talk to him you cannot wake up in the morning and you going somebody's garden and You Begin digging and you tell the person you pay me bless name of the Lord so you need to enter in the presence of the Lord and you talk to him bless the it's very very important so we want to go in look chapter 8 and verse 15 the Bible says but that on the good ground are they which in unhonest good heart having heard the word keep it brings forth fruit with patience praise the Lord he says those the seeds which are in the good ground they are which are with unhonest with a good heart having heard the word after they have heard the word they keep it they bring forth fruits with patience once you Unite with a word with the honest he says and you keep it you bring forth fruits with patience blessed name of the Lord patience is needed in this hour that we are living in people are losing the battle because of lack of patience blessing of the Lord but once you walking with the word you need say Lord give me the spirit of patience praise the Lord give me the spirit of patience that I can overcome the circumstances that are surrounding me Lord I know your grace will do it for me blessed name of the Lord we should keep ourselves close to the word because time is no more one of these days we are going back in eternity I want to when God called Joshua the high priest in the book of Zar 3 he came with with but recognize that God has called him he was not afraid of what will come his way since is God has called him and when was standing there the devil began rebuking him because of the but God himself said is me who has chosen and God commanded take gments from josua give him new clothes when God calls you he takes out the that Gars and gives you the new clothes we should have confidence in our calling God is responsible for your Purity BL name of the Lord he has given us the blood that shall never lose his power praise alone to take away all our sins because in Ephesians 5 verse 26 he says that he may sanctify us to clean us to clean to clean eat with the washing Waters of the world that he may present it himself as a glorious Church it is God who makes it possible for me to obey the word praise the Lord to unite with the wife who have faith in God's word prise the Lord because the Bible says the just shall live by fa so everything is happening it's the Lord who is doing it we must rest in the hands of the Lord praise the Lord in the message Abram's we must remember always that salvation is of the Lord young people the parents have done their work to show you the way but he must take the responsibility of saying Lord open up my eyes you must have a personal experience Jesus defeated the devil on the word if thou be the Son of God command those stones to be turned to bread said it's written Jesus said it's written man shall not live by bread alone so he defeated Satan praise the Lord he defeated him with the word of God yourself you defe sat when you stand on God word you must learn the to use the word bless name of the Lord because the word is spirit and life learn the world to use it the word is not a Doctrine the word is not a do but the word is spirit and life Jesus Jesus told the disciples the words that I speak unto you in spirit and life so God is word is spirit and life so Jesus defeated the Devil by using God's word that is how we can defeat him is by the word of God that says the Lord praise the Lord and once you stand on that you overcome the enemy Satan stand on the word God is faithful to keep his word bless the name of the lord it's a matter of believing it asite with it a man who was on the pool for 38 years not throw himself in when Jesus came he used the word C up your bed and go the man believed it and he carried the bed and he walked away the Lord there's no there's no need of lamenting praise the Lord and crying just use the word you are going to defeat when they came on the Red Sea they were crying and God told Moses why Christ speak SE the word that the can be created in the Red Sea you have to keep the word that's the way you're going to overcome the devil bless the Lord in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ you have to remember anything thing God making you an overcomer he relases the revelation of knowledge and revelation of the knowledge of Christ it is our salvation and our Victory once brings that Revelation he says now you now you can know why it says that everyone who reads or hears it is blessed anybody who hears the word and reads it he says is blessed it is the revelation of God that will give you the authority over the devil the word once you get the revelation of the word will give you the authority over the devil because you know where you are standing you can see why who would add or take away from it would be cast it would have to be so for who can add or take away from from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy so you cannot take away the perfect revelation of God and you expect to overcome the eny overcome the enemy when you take the entire Revelation blessed name of the Lord so Revelation is the greatest tool against Satan he told Peter upon where I build my church and the g of Hell shall not Prevail against it's God himself who will make the bride tree fruitful that's why we are living in the hour of uniting with the word praise the Lord to be in Psalms 1:1 planted by the rivers of water even if it's raining is still drinking even if it's shining is still drinking we must be a tree planted by the rivers of the river of Jesus Christ let us stand up and we [Applause] pray Pass Me Gently oh theor my Jesus here my Hallelujah why my Jesus do not pass

chistian stay somewhere people you have not preached they have seen something amen amen sometimes I go somewhere ask me are you a teacher then I wonder what have they seen maybe the life of a teacher do they see chisan in us our brothers also told us put everything we do in the word he yes said do not research on the word but believe the word amen our education no research which we get in here believing amen we must allow the Lord to live in our lives we must allow the Lord to live in our lives then he asked us a very important question which voice are you listening to I'm also asking also which songs do you listen to which terms do you use in your daily language I I don't fear l i don't hurry Uncle s you know which which terms do you use in your language what confessions do we do what do are we there so the brothers asked us what do you listen to I wanted to expand it a bit songs we listen TOS we use the names we give ourselves maybe the groups we move with young people which group do you move with but even us which group do you sit with in the evening okay then he says attitude is important towards the word when we start saying that word they preach and say that one is from God that word is from God that one is from the pastor's then we are finished let us believe every word having a welcoming spirit and becoming a reflection of God of Jesus Christ himself amen becoming being blessed and becoming a blessing coming without hiding the Nets when things I go back to my fishing those Nets amen amen if this church fails I will go back to my previous Church even call it my prchs are we there amen amen we must he has also told us we must learn to respect our mother father the amen is not saying God is Not is God is the p is replacing to be your father uh-uh the preacher is not saying that the pastor has taken the place of God saying that the person leading us that's why he's calling him our father leading us in our mother mother called the church amen in summary our brothers told us that staying in the word means believing the whole word and allowing the word lead Our Lives that's very critical believing the one is one thing then allowing it to to lead Our Lives it's very very critical so we must have we must have a standard we must enter into the spirit and I've remembered the in some countries they have a go rest dresses it they give it they give them a number number one number two the owners sit like this and they start cheering [Music] they enter the spirit of the go what will he get if that go wins what is the what is the in all in all we must enter the spirit of the word amen amen we are living in this in a season of L we are living in a season of lamenting so it is our but so it is our responsibility to put everything to put look to put our lives or refuge in the Lord is our responsibility not the pastor's responsibility not the deon's responsib not our not the father not the mother not the husband not the wife but you me it is my responsibility put myself under the blood may God bless you amen amen so that is the Spirit uh that's what it means to stay in the word amen do you love him this morning amen we thank God for that Ministry should he take our greetings back home amen amen do you want him back do you want amen we shall put in a request another request that he comes back and maybe expounds more amen we have two
