I pray amen amen God bless you all I want to welcome you once again to to the evening service and appreciate the pastor for according us opportunities to always come and share of this word amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen it's such a privilege for us to be in the house of the Lord and I I believe it shall be a blessing to each of us amen we shall take a few scriptures as we open the Service amen so let's read about the parable of the in St Matthew 13 1 and we shall take our seats then after turn to the Book of Mark CH 16:14 so let's start with Matthew 13: 1 to9 amen the same day went Jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into the ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he SP many things unto them in Parables saying Behold a so went forth to s and when he SED some seeds fell by the way site and the fs came and divide them up and some fell upon Stone places where they had not much Earth and forth with they sprung up because they had no deepness of of of Earth and when the sun was up they were scored and because they had no root they withered away and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up and and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some 100 fold some 60 fold some 30 fold who has ears let him hear may the Lord bless his word we may get seated amen amen once again we appreciate God for this opportunity amen let's stand to Mark 16 verse 14 afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at me and upgraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was Reon and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned amen amen so we have started with the Book of Matthew when Jesus was teaching a parable about the soul praise the Lord and this parable about the soul shows us that the soul had seeds and he was desirous of getting his seeds into the ground that the seeds may get into the ground grow up and bring him more fruits praise the Lord and Jesus teaches of the different grounds the different environments in which this seat was planted some in on ground so they could not grow deep into the Earth praise the Lord and now we see that some fell by the way side and they were eaten by the birs and some fell among thorns and as they were growing up the thones choked them up and they couldn't grow but then he says some fell into good ground and brought forth good fruit praise the Lord and that's where our emphasis is going to be praise the Lord because we believe that we are the seed that were planted on good ground praise the lord we are the seed that was planted on good ground that bringeth forth good fruit praise the Lord and now here in Mark 16 says after he had appeared to the 11 he sat at meet with them and upred them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart why because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and then he went ahead and commanded them that they go out into the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature so he gave them the word he gave them the to take out there and go and start scattering praise the Lord now he said he that believes praise the Lord the one that has the good ground and believes this seed and is baptized shall be saved praise the Lord but he that believeth not shall be damed so now the identification of those that are saved is their belief in the word which they have received praise the Lord to them that believe on the gospel the word that you preach and their baptized shall be saved praise them Living God and now it takes us to the book of M of Romans chapter 10 verse 13 saying whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved 10 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed remember when Jesus was asking the disciples to go out in the world he gave them the word and says take this word to every creature in the world you go and start sewing and now whoever Shall Believe on this word that you have taken the same shall be saved praise the Lord and now the Bible here says that the same whosoever shall call the name of the Lord shall be saved but then how shall they call on wh on him in whom they have not believed so we see that the first identification that we see here is the faith is the belief in the word of God praise the Lord and how they how shall they believe in whom of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear except there is a preacher and how shall they preach now the Bible here is is giving questions and every question given has an answer it says whoever shall call on name of the Lord shall be saved but then it asks those that call on name of the Lord who are they it should be those that have believed on the word of God and then he says but how shall they believe if they have not heard and then says there must be a preacher to preach and then he again asks then how shall the preacher preach except they be sent praise the Lord so now we see that the entire thing is not about the preacher the thing is not about the S but it's about the seed it's about the life in the seity because how will you believe if you have not heard and how will I preach except I've been sa so the Genesis of everything here is Jesus Christ himself who is the seed praise the Lord Jesus Christ himself the Genesis of our Fai and says it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring good Glad Tidings of good things 15 verse 1 so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God praise the Lord so now for tonight we are trying to look at the called out Church a church that has been called out separated and set aside praise the Lord but when before this church is called out there is a complete process we have seen that the first thing is that the individual must hear when they hear they believe but then they cannot hear except someone has spoken to them and we have also seen that the person not speak to them except God has sent them to preach the good words to the people to bring the message to the people praise the Lord and now the Bible also says that now this faith that enables us to believe on the word which we have heard comes after hearing it comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God praise the Lord you hear every one of us can hear so many people in the world there have heard they have heard the spoken words but because there is nothing to help them believe because they must be the word of God to help them believe the same which we are hearing the same word that helps us to believe it praise the Lord says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God and now what is the word of God Jesus Christ is the word of God in the beginning was the word and the same word was with God and the same Word was God that is that is John 1 verse one when you slop down there you see that the word of God is Jesus Christ himself so now if we hear and and Believe by the help of the word of God that it is Christ himself who helps us to believe on his words praise the Lord faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God so now you receive this face after expressing your obedience towards the word which you have heard praise the Lord the gospel of peace which is given to us by hearing this spoken word now let's see what Timothy says second Timothy 3: 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine all scripture is given by inspiration of God and now the same scripture which is given after it's been inspired by God helps us to believe on the word of God and is profitable for doctr for reproof for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect th fished and all good works so now our faith in the word of God is a Divine response is a Divine response to the word of God and this response comes from within us it comes from your soul praise the Lord I want us to take a little bit of uh let us stud the chemistry of growth so we started when Jesus was giving a parable of a s who got his seeds and he went and planted them so now when they saw planted the seeds he was expecting the seeds to grow he expect that these seeds would grow and give him fruits and so he could get more seeds in the end praise the Lord and now a seed will not show its abilities to grow and sprung up unless it's been placed in a very suitable conditions praise the Lord yet the seed has the ability to grow and bear more fruits praise the Lord when you get a seed a live seed inside that seed is the ability for to grow and bear more fruits but as long as the seed is there and does not have the suitable conditions for it to grow it shall not grow and you will not see it AB to grow but the moment the so gets this seat and places it in the good ground praise the Lord the seed will now begin manifesting its abilities praise the Lord the seed will now start portraying the chemistry on theide of it to begin growing so in the first place we need to know any seed that is liable to germination has all the elements it requires to grow praise the Lord so when you get this seat inside that seat we have the carbohydrates required to give energy to this seed as long as it has been placed in the good ground ins that seed we have all the proteins the Lord and all the nutrients and all the minerals the potassium magnesium theum all the minerals required to give this this seed energy for it to grow praise the Lord but now this seed as long as does not land on the good ground praise the Lord it shall not show forth its abilities praise the Lord so in the like manner when we are still out there before you receive the word of you have the ability to receive this word and believe it why because on the inside of us is the seed which Bears the life of God praise the Lord so as long as you are still scattered out there you are not in position to manif your abilities to believe on the word of God until you come in contact with the word of God praise them Living God so when this seed is placed there now the chemistry begins and now it requires moisture from the soils around it requires water it requires oxygen to help in the synthesis synthesizing to to help in breaking down the nutrients on the inside of this SE to help break down the carbohydrates requires the oxygen to give it energy it requires this water to break the shei to now allow the nutrients ground from the soil to come and Mi the nutrients inside this SE at the end of the day you are able to see the seed growing up so now when you receive this word of God praise the Lord says the faith that you have the faith that you receive to believe the word of God given to you by the help of the word of God praise the Lord so we now we notice that our election we notice that our faith in the word of God is by God himself but in the first place it must be a seed it must be a live seat that's why the Bible says whoever Shall Believe whoever believeth and is baptized and now how do you believe you believe because of the word that is being spoken the word that is being spoken there the same life sits on the inside of your soul so now when this word is being spoken you respond by believing it why because you already have that life that was given to us the foundation of the world so now how do we believe how do we receive this salvation Salvation is given to us by God himself praise the Lord when the soul went out so he so the seats and those that fell in the ther ground could not grow up because the environment was not condusive those that fell on their on Rocket grounds did not have enough energy why because as they were trying to grow their Roots reached somewhere and could not continue because the ground was not sufficient the ground was not healthy enough for the seed to root down and grow but yet there is a seed that fell on good ground there is a seed that fell on the side of your soul that fell on the side of my soul and when fell there it found an abort it found a condition the environment had been prepared praise the Lord and as long as that seed remains in the good ground it shall grow and it shall bear fruits praise the Living God now God is very faithful he's a very faithful God by for knowledge he planted his seed he planted his SE each of us Soul before the foundation of the world and by predestination he makes us to come into contact with the word each of us has it own season which now this contact is the environment that evokes is the environment that invokes resurrection of all the sleep elements of the life of God in us and this environment is the gospel of peace this environment is the spoken word this environment is the presence of God so now when you hear the word of God you need to be kept in the presence of God and when you keep yourself in the presence of God now continues to provide all the nutrients provide all the conditions that are necessary to resect all the Sleeping elements praise the Lord and now he then makes he continues praise the Lord grow you into the sture of a perfect man now because after you have had the word of God and you have believed he now brings you in his presence he brings you under his tutorship because the Bible said how then shall they preach except they be S praise the Lord and also says all scriptures come by inspiration of God himself so now after we have believed he now calls us out he brings us out he brings us out and he places us before his presence he preses us before his presence where he begins now to teach us to teach us his ways in so doing he's watering us to grow every other time we come in his presence to hear the word of God your faith continues to grow your faith continues to grow in other words your seed is growing into a perfect nature praise the Lord continues to water you to give you a desire desire more of him more of his environment more of his presence to hear more of his words and the more we keep in his presence praise the Lord the more this seed structure gets clearer to the identity of Jesus Christ praise the Lord the chemistry of grow begins when you receive the word of God praise the Lord it begins when you come the word of God and after all coming the word of God accepted it then he keeps you in his presence praise the Lord and now the life on the inside of you praise the Lord which was given of you begins the chem chemical reactions the process begins the water because the says whoever believes and is baptized so now he gives you Grace enough to believe his word and to be baptized and when you are baptized by water he cleanses you he justifies you and then after he has Justified he brings you before his presence and now he begins to teach and he teaches us and the more the word is being spoken begins to sanctify us because when the seed comes out of the ground it is not enough for it to bear fruit it must go through a process and this process requires pruning praise the Lord as the seed is growing into a plant it has to be pruned because when the farmer leaves it there and he leaves it under Wheats it shall wither the whe shall out compete and take out all its nutrients it shall not grow but the seed must be water the seed must be pruned and as it's being pruned it takes on now the form of the real plant until it Bears the fruits so when calls us in his presence he begins to teach us and he begins to prune us all the habits that inherited from the world when we come we come before his presence and the word of God is being preached continues to speak to our hearts and as the preacher is preaching the scripture that is by inspiration of God teaches to your heart condition speaks to your heart and then you come to acknowledge that God has spoken to you that this is not required of you then you quit it and as you keep yourself in his presence again he speaks your heart that as a Son of God you are not supposed to take this direction then you change and you obey his word and you continue obeying his word and continue obeying his word in his presence he continues to do his works praise the Lord and now no man comes to the father except the father calls him to himself praise the Lord let's take that scripture praise the name Living God no man comes to the father except the father has called to himself so it begins with the father it begins with God himself nobody comes to the son except the father has praise the Lord so now we see that it's a very simple thing for us to receive salvation is that when we believe the word when we hear the word and we have believed it it is now it becomes the responsibility of God to start nurturing us to the St of a perfect man praise the Lord it now seem us to be our responsibility our first responsibility is to believe welcome the word of God believe it and believe that it is the truth even though it's our respons still we don't do it by our own but he helps us to believe his word so the entire salvation is of the Lord praise the Lord the entire work of Salvation is of the Lord so he begins the work to call us outes us into his presence and then he begins to nurture us to work upon praise the name of living God so now let's see what the prophet says in the message five definite identifications of the True Church of the Living God the prophet speaks about Israel speaks about the children of Israel when they were still in Egypt praise the Lord they were called the children of Israel praise the Lord and they were under their own care they had work day and night to receive something to eat they had to labor to have a clothing on their bodies praise the Lord but the moment he called them out praise the Lord and he accepted him and pulled them out of Egypt ceased to be their responsibility it was now the responsibility of God and they ceased to be called the children of Israel but now they were the children of God praise the Lord so that the prophet says now Israel was the people of God until that then they were called The Church of God because they were called by God out ofy out of the world out away from other churches out away from other religions to walk with God alone and now the Church of God today is the same thing called out of everything of The World God himself calling our out of every religious C of every religious denomination of every religious organization to walk with God praise the Lord he calls us out to walk with him and now when he calls us out to walk with him we now become his complete responsibility and the Bible says in John 16 ver3 how about when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatever he shall hear that he shall speak and he will show you all things to come still in his good will when he calls us out his responsibility to show us the truth and to guide us through all truth to help us grow into a perfect man to be like him praise the Lord it is his responsibility to take charge of us so now when we in his presence now he begins to bring all the nutrients required when we out out of the ground when we are out of the world and we have been exposed to the harsh conditions of Life takes his responsibility to begin to provide for us with all the conditions that we require grow into a perfect man how praise the Lord when in his presence he shall bring a brother he now brings the fivefold Ministries to keep you on track he shall bring a brother from somewhere to speak to your heart he shall bring the pastor he the pastor to come with the word which you directly speak to your heart in other words he's keeping on grounding you to make our roots to grow deeper such that when the storms come when begin to blow you shall go the East you got the west but still you shall remain standing why because it is his responsibility he has now provided you with environment with the words to root you down such that even when well doctrines come you you are a with understand them because you have been taught well his responsibility after he has called us out to take care of us not only in the spiritual but also in the physical needs praise the name of the Living God just like we saw last Wednesday but when he calls us as children praise the Lord it is still his responsibility in his good will you provide for whatever we have need of why because it is a promise that when we obey and seek first his kingdom and his righteousness we don't get heard of any other thing wild doctrines yes the Bible says they will come by the time they come you have been taught well and you can withstand that pressure praise the Lord the hard time will come yes it will come but the time it comes your faith has been grounded in the word and it cannot be moved it is in his own will and responsibility to us into his word Ephesians 1: 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling praise the Lord the god of our Lord Jesus Christ himself praise the Lord that he may give you wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him that your eyes may be enlightened with understanding that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of his glory of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints that the eyes of your understanding that the eyes that your face praise the Lord because it says that the father of Glory may give us the spirit of wisdom after he has separated us and made us a separated church and made us his people that he may give us the wisdom the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him so if we need know more of him it is still by him that he gives us the spirit of wisdom and knowledge to know more of him praise the Lord if we need know more of the scriptures is still by his help that he gives us the understanding to understand the ration of his word so now we see that the entire work of Salvation is of God and by God himself praise the Lord because he does not end on calling you but he calls you and he brings you in his presence then he starts to teach you and as he's teaching you the Bible says he also gives you the spirit of wisdom praise the Lord to know what to know more of his words so you are able to discern when the world doctrines come into place you have the wisdom and the Revelation to know that it is not the truth and that is only by God himself and say such that your eyes the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened and you know what is the hope of his calling and know the hope of his calling praise the Lord he not to call us and leave us here but is to help us to grow in his world to help us to grow into a St of a perfect man say that out of us makes a church that has no spot out of us makes the perfect church that has no wrinkle the B says that now when we come to that point and when he appears we shall be like him praise the Lord because in his presence he has worked on us he has worked on you praise the Lord so now we come to realize that the Journey of our face the Journey of the Lord himself because at the end of the day his goal is to have a bride that can identify with him that Bri must be he that has the seed of Christ himself and this seed there is no seed will grow unless it's been placed in the ground when it comes out of the ground it will die if it is not nured and it is God himself who shall water this seed so the seed that we have we don't need to get worried of it it is God himself who has planted in us and is God himself who shall water it it comes to maturity because we have a promise that out of us must be a church out of us must be a church that has no spot that has no wrinkles but how will the wrinkles go away they shall go by the purification of the word they shall get away by the sanctification by The Living Waters of the world the ring shall go away by the preaching of the spoken word and as the word is being preached we see ourselves growing every other day that St of a perf man when we get there he shall now come to harvest when the farmer plants the seeds waiting for the SE praise the Lord tomorrow he shall see the C he shall see them springing up and then his patient he will go and water it he will go and start weeding tomorrow he goes back and then he sees it is coming up then he begins weeding again anding and he's not celebrating because he has not yet seen the fruits and the seeds thereof so he continues through the work of a farmer and our chief farmer is the Lord himself the farmer of the seed that lives on the inside of us is the Lord Jesus himself praise the Lord so every day he comes around to see how the plant is doing because what his desire is to see a seed out of this plant a seed that has his own likess a seed that is in that perfect St praise the Lord and the Bible says in Revelations 21 now let's start with first John chapter 3 it says beloved now we are the sons of God 3 we are the sons of God who are the sons of God them that have the seed of God because there is no we can be identifi as Sons if we are not bearing of his life praise the Lord a son is identified by his father because they share an identity what makes us Sons is because we have the seed of him the father and says beloved now that we have received the word of God now that we have believed this words we are the sons of God and it does not end there and says it does not yet appear what we shall be because we are still we are still plants the seeds have been planted and out of the SE are now the sons and now we are simply sons that are still growing and right now it is not certain of what we shall be but we know by faith we know that when he shall appear when the father shall appear we shall be like him why because we have his life we bear his seed and we are carrying his SE so even if we don't know what we shall be but because we are certain that we have see we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is praise the Lord this is a process and we are growing there by day into that and Revelation says God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes because of the TRS of the journey we shall be scorched and we shall weep sometimes but we are still Sons we have his life and he is not going to leave us on the way he shall continue to send the r he shall continue to send his words he shall to send the gopel PE to give us energy sufficient energy to grow so when you come in his presence and the word is spoken it reaches down to your heart and then you get the energy to continue pushing through praise the Lord because on the inside of the seat all the necessary to help it grow we have all the spiritual elements what what we require is the watering so every time he Waters every time he sends the rain and the rain Waters receive the energy so it may find us in the L St in a state of discomfort praise the Lord in a state of complaints but when it reaches to the soul praise the Lord it energizes you throw away all the worries moving forward nether no crying neither shall there be any more pain for all the former things passed away and he that sat upon the throne says behold I make all things you praise the Lord and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful say behold I make old things new all old things are passed away praise the Lord what is the purpose of God is to have a perfect church and perfect Church he's doing a great work in our M to make us look like him praise the Lord and how does he make us look like him gives us his word praise the Lord and by his word we keep growing praise the lord we keep growing we keep growing and behold the Tabernacle of God of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God the Tabernacle of God is with men is with his people and he shall be they shall be his people and he shall be their God when we receive him and receive of his life he comes down and and the Tabernacle of God begins to dwell with men so regardless of who we are that seed of God Bears the life of God and at the end of the road he must see his seed his life coming forth and when he shall appear when we look at him and you look at yourself and you look at your neighbor and you look at your brother you shall see that we shall be like him because each of us is bearing the seed of God each of us is bearing the life of God and we have if we have the life of God then at the end of the road we shall be like him it is his responsibility we just need to trust and obey his trust and obey every time trust and Obey when the word Goes Forth however even if it is very had to believe just trust and Obey praise the Lord just trust him keep obeying and as you obeying and healing yourself to him he keeps nurturing he keeps nurturing and taking you in the way of his own will because at the end of the day he's doing his work see that when you come on harvest time you are able to bear his own likeness you are able to be in his own image and in his own likeness praise the name of living God because we have faith that what was in the beginning must be at the end of days if in the beginning he created us after in his own image and after his own likeness praise the Lord along the way so much shall happen that shall cause us to cry that shall cause us to sorrow that shall cause us to stumble but as long as we keep ourselves in the presence of God it is his own will that we still get back to his own image after his own likeness that's why scripture says that it does not matter what we are and what we shall be we don't know but we are confident of one thing that which was in the beginning praise the Lord when he created man we are certain that it shall come to pass it is what shall be when he appears and we shall be like him praise the name of living God so the church a called out Church is the work of God a church that is called out is the work of God a church that is under the presence of God the work of God so what does the church have to do we need to be like Israel the moment they recognized that now God has called them out of EG whatever they required praise the Lord they knew that it was the responsibility of God to provide praise the Lord because the promise was you have a land where you are going land that is prepared for you that with milk and honey and they were not digging on the way you not planting so now they knew that the person who started this work of calling them out of Egypt had the responsibility to take care of of them even along the way so when they fell sick praise the Lord regardless of whether the sickness was because of their Disobedience they still looked up to Moses they still look up to God praise the Lord when they were hungry in the morning they were very sure that whether they had food or not that God will provide food in the morning because it was a promise that was given to them and when they were obedient to the promise they were confident that God would keep his promise to supply all their needs so in this our journey after we have believed we have one duty surrender all ourselves unto him praise the Lord surrender all our Affairs unto him the children of Israel surrendered and they were very confident that man would rain in the morning they were confident that when they needed water in the wilderness they were getting it from nowhere else any they were sure that God would provide the water praise the Lord why they were on the way they were in the journey and they were in The Promise they had kept the word they had believed the word and they had come out of Egypt praise the Lord and so they looked on him they looked up to him when the enemy
