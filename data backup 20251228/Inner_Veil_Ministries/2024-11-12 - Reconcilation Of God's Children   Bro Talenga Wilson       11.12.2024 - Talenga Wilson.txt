again I want to welcome you to the service this evening and want to appreciate God for the grace and the pastor for the opportunity once again amen and I want to appreciate you all for coming be part of this service amen amen so um let's turn our Bibles in the book of 1 Samuel chap amen amen from verse one for our title this evening we shall be speaking on the reconciliation of God's children praise the Lord in other words the return the reunion of God and his children amen amen so let's pick out uh verse one and the Lord said unto Samuel how long will thou mourn for sa seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel fill thine horn with oil and go I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have provided me a king among his sons verse four and Samuel did that which the Lord spake and came to Beth and the Elders of the Town trembled at his coming and said cometh thou peacefully I and he said peacefully I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and Sanctified Jess and his sons and called them to the sacrifice and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on and said surely the Lord is Anointed is Lord other blessing where we may be seated amen amen so um here in the scripture we know we've read about this many times that God had rejected sa and he wanted to appoint praise the Lord so God wanted to appoint a king for himself out of the son of J so God commanded Samuel's praise the Lord and out of the eight Sons you have a king anointed to lead Israel and so when he came they brought the children of of Jess praise the Lord and when he sawab in his mind he saw a man of good St and so he said surely dis anointed is before him but that was not the choice of God praise the Lord looking atab he would fit the test of man to be woring just like so was he was a strong man he was very tall and strong and a giant and vibrant so he had energy praise the Lord and now here when when when Samuel sees and he looked at the sture of of of sa he s that surely was of the same station so he was wor be the king but the choice of man is not the same as the choice of God praise the Lord verse S says but the Lord said unto Samuel look not not on his countenance or on the height of his St because I have refused him for the Lord sees not as man seeth for man look on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart then they started calling these other children one by one so now when when Samuel had got the inspiration of God praise the Lord God was not looking for St but God was looking for a heart a heart which was like his praise the Lord now they called Abad and made him pass before Samuel God has not chosen him they called sh and the rest of the seven sons and they had not found favor before God and Samuel said unto Jess here all thy children and he say there remain yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto send and F him for we will not sit down till he come here praise the Lord so now when they had called the children just said did not think about David praise the Lord because he looked at him as a young man and he was not good look at he spent his life looking after the sheep and the CLE and so when they looked at him they saw he was not fit to be a king So when they called for all his sons they never thought of him so never invited him before praise the Lord but then they realized that none of the seven God had favor upon so now he if there is any other we shall not do anything we shall not sit down until he comes here and so it says go and fetch him and he sent and brought him in and the Bible says he was rud verse 12 and with of a beautiful countenance and good let look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the mid of his and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward that God is choosing the Lord very different from the rest of man praise the Lord he does not look at who you are he does not look at how strong you are how knowledgeable you are God looked for his own heart among all the children of Jess is only David that had the heart and mind of God desire to have a man who has his own mind and his own heart to come and Lead his people this shows us the choice it shows it shows us how God chooses praise the Lord that's how God makes Choice About Us Praise the Lord his choosing is not about how good we are or how good a person we are or how good a family you've been raised in or how powerful your parents or how religious your parents have been but he makes his choice by predestination praise the Lord he chose us not because we wanted him to choose us but he chose us because we were in his mind before the before the foundation of the world no that he chose David not because David presented himself the best King but because it was him that was in it was David that was in the mind of God before the beginning of the world that would be king over Israel now listen close this choice of God can be Len the natural birth praise the Lord see when you're young man you don't know that you having children praise the Lord but you are having children but those children are not yet into manifestation so you cannot call them out you can't have fellowship with them praise the Lord but yet you are having those children because they are a part of you so as you grow up you are growing together with them praise the Lord and now it comes to a point when you feel you want to have these children manifestation but you don't have a picture of how they look like but you know you can bear these children praise the Lord so time comes that now you make a choice and you pick a woman and you Mar them to be your wife so you start a family and as God provided time comes that you begin to Bear children praise the lot but before when you are young when they tell you you have children you cannot even imagine you can't even think about it because you can't see them why because those children are still a part of you they are still in your Lo so they cannot be seen praise the Lord but then when you become a father and you produce these children then they grow up and then you begin to have fellowship with them you begin calling them out and now those children by birth they have a right to call you father praise the Lord they have a right to your possessions they have a right to have fellowship with you because they are your children praise the Lord and I also want to say this that even the children before they are born they have no choice how they should be born which family they are born praise the Lord so it's not until they are born and brought into manifestation that by they have that Authority call you father praise the Lord and now there is no choice to eat that this is the kind of child I want to produce praise the Lord you wait until the child is in manifestation that's when you know that you have a boy a boy a girl and so you give them a name and I want say this that now your children will have authority over your name given to them by Praise the Lord so my children have a right to call me papa because that's who I am to them praise the Lord I have no choice to say you cannot call me Papa because by birs they are part of me they are bearing my life praise the Lord they are bearing my my my my DNA so they are my children because they are having my life of my life was given to them so they are my children praise the Lord and now Jesus said that all that the father brings to me I will not lose praise the Lord so now Jesus praise the Lord as we shall see in the scriptures praise the Lord that when God is choosing us his choosing is not conditional praise the Lord it has no it has no attachment in other words we have no choice over God is choosing and none of us did not ask God to choose them to himself no it's not that it is God himself that chose us praise the Lord God himself that located us but how like the Bible says God CHS us because we were in him the foundation of the world so when we come into manifestation we come to manifest the life and Glory of the father so as my children are growing up when I look at him I look at them I am able to see myself in them and when they pass here you are able to say those children belong to Wilson because they are M there is something that connects me and my children so when you look at them you say those children belong to Joshua or they belong to Dan no but when you see Joshua's children you see these children belong to Joshua because there is an identification something that [Music] proves these children are bearing the life of Joshua that's why even their St their character the way they walk they walk like him because the life of Joshua is Manifest in those children praise the Lord now when we also bear these children we give them a name and when we give them a name we give them a name to identify them so when they get any difficulty when they get scared they run over the father praise the Lord when they are playing around they have the Liberty to pray but when something scares them they will run straight to their parents they won't run to anyone around they make be many people in the congregation child run straight to his parents because they know that where their protection is praise the Lord and they have that Liberty and authority to have protection from their father th why Jesus said whoever the god brings to me I will lose none praise the Lord until the last day so now when God chooses us like I said he chooses Us by predestination praise the Lord but before that in the beginning genis verse the Bible says that the heavens and the Earth were without form and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters so he began putting things into existence until day but although everything created was so beautiful there was a desire for God praise the Lord to have children to worship him to have children to take care of all his possession so now God said to the angels I think it is good can we create man in our own image praise the Lord and the Bible says in genes that God said let us create M our own image after our likeness and let them have domion over the fish of the sea and over the the fall of the air and over the C and over all the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created and in 2 verse it says and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul so it was the choice of God to make man it was the choice of God to know which kind of person this man would be and when he chose how man would look like let them be in our own image after our own likeness so it is not Adam that told God that create me and let me be in this kind of form praise the Lord it was not in the choices of Adam praise the Lord it was the choices of God that he chose what to create and what kind of man he created praise the Lord so now when God created man he saw himself in the image of in in the person that he created praise the Lord he saw man and he saw himself praise the Lord and now God rested and he gave all the possession and he gave all the Earth under the control of Adam Adam had authority over everything that was in the earth praise the Lord because he came from God is God who created him andap 2 verse the Bible said that now after God had created this Adam in his own image then God picked his life and he breathed this life into Adam so now Adam became a living soul and now he began to walk upon the face of the Earth exercise domion over the face of the Earth praise the Lord there is something we are driving on to and now suddenly we came into the world like that we came into the world like that then along the way we lost our positions because of sin and a veil came in a veil came in and separated that Fellowship that we had with our father but even when the veil came in it did not take away the life that had because the life that Adam had was given him of God and it belonged to God and it is only God that had the capacity and ability to take out that life out of Adam praise the Lord and now along the wayam was blessed and he went and he bought children he subdued the Earth but that Veil contined to be there praise the Lord until God sent Jesus that by way of the cross the way of sin would be broken and by the blood of Jesus Christ we would be reconciled back to God now we would have access to God not through your father not through the pastor not through any religious kind of leader through Jesus Christ praise the lord we therefore notice that the Journey of our reconciliation begins with God in Christ ends with God in Christ let me quote something here before I proceed in the message the invis of the bride of Christ and son is the attributes of his father and just as you were in the je of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the bed grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become in the image of your father then he come fellowship with you and so were you sons of God and Daughters of God before there was even a moonar a molecu you are Sons and Daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning remember the Bible says that in the beginning when heaven when the Earth had no form the spirit of God moved over the face of the Earth and it was moving upon the face of the Earth it was moving upon the waters and the prophet says that just the same way we are a manifestation of our natural fathers that were with our fathers when was still young boys he says the same way we were with God when he moved upon the face of the waters we were in go he was still the spiritual in the spirit form but then he wanted something to have fellowship with him so he of him to produce children that now manifest and have fellowship with him so he says you were in the you are the attributes of God that was in God at the beginning for there is only one form of eternal life that was you before the beginning of the world that means we were Eternal the Lord before the beginning of the world we are Eternal praise the Lord because we are Eternal the beginning of the world if we are children of God and if we are the manifestation of the attributes of God God is eternal and if we are the children of God that means we are also eternal Living God and says you don't know nothing about it NE did you know when you was in your father but you are manifested to In His Image in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and fellowship of God so as sure as you the as sure as your had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual had to be in God because you are an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world that's right now notice then that life being in you which is the life of God God's life being in you from the foundation of the world that makes us Eternal praise the Lord so we come into this body to manifest the attributes of the father praise the Lord spiritually we manifest the attributes of the Father the same way physically we manifest the attributes of us our natural fathers and another message I quote God is his own interpreter 64 1964 vers paragraph says now all we are today is the display of his attributes first he was not even God God we would just call him the Eternal one he wasn't God because the word English word god means object of worship so before he created us he was the Eternal one and there was nothing to worship him so he was the Eternal one the main Fountain of all intelligence and in this Fountain of all intelligence there was not an atom or nothing light nowhere light star moon nothing else so God what we know as God the great spirit that was eternal he was there and in him was the attributes it was the attributes to God then his attributes to be a father he had attributes as God then his to be a father then to be a son to be AI attrib to be a Healer all these attributes was in him these things that has unfolded since [Music] then unfolded just his attributes being made manifest what I mean attributes was his thoughts and a word is a thought expressed and then that was in his thinking and when he said let there be there let there be there was and now remember you Christians where his thoughts before there was a world praise the Lord you are hiss praise the Lord you look at yourself who you are you are the thoughts of God before the world was praise the lord we are his SS before the world war and now you are the manifestation of his thinking because when he he to have man praise the Lord he s to have someone to worship Him He s to have someone to have fellowship with him so he called the angels and he said to them let us create man so when he said to the angels let us cre man that was the Sal of God that was to be expressed in the form of a [Music] man that's why the prophet says you are the thoughts of God expressed and the thoughts of God before the world was praise the Lord and so when he thought of creating us into existence when he was moving upon the face of the waters he looked at the Earth had no had no form nor vo so he had to set things in order prise the Lord so now he began to create things into existence and now he commanded everything by his words praise the Lord so he thought of having land separated from the waters that was his thought praise the Lord then when he spoke his thought Let There Be land land came into existence so that land was the expression of the thought of God praise the Lord and said let there be animals and when the animals were created the animals became the expression the that God had in his until the six day everything was in order and everything was beautiful now God said to the angels I have a thought I want to have man praise the Lord I want to have my children to worship me because the animals the plants cannot worship me praise the Lord so now he called the Angels said it is it is good that we create man praise the Lord and he said so let us create man praise the Lord and the Bible says and now he picked out of the Dust of the earth and he created the body of man praise the Lord and everything he made about man was his thought into expression prise the Lord we Canen this an artist arti that made this to begin with he has this bottle the image of this bottle and how this bottle would look like in his now when he begins to make a picture of this bottle it is the expression of his thought made manifest praise the Lord and so he makes this B and he gives it all the time until it comes out as perfect as his thought is so when God said let us create man and he picked out of the Dust of the earth he began to form man which was his expression because he wanted cre man his own image praise the Lord and after he had created the body of man praise the Lord he said it was good it was in the image of God but then he did not have the life so now he got this body and he breathed his own life in the body and man became a living Soul so when the prophet says that we at the manifestation of the of God and that we were in the mind of God before the beginning of the world that exactly what he means praise the Lord so now when he comes back to look for his own praise the Lord God is looking for his own identity praise the Lord so now because we lost our identity at the fall of Man we are reconciled back through Jesus Christ by way of the new birth praise the Lord so now the new bir drops the old nature of man praise the Lord drops the old nature It Breaks Loose the old you and it rest praise the Lord life praise the Lord which God breathed into man it restor the life and the nature of God so it's not until man experiences a new birath by the BM of the holy spirit that we come into the nature that we come into the image and likeness of God without the Holy Spirit which is the life of God in man man is not different from a beast praise the Lord it is the Life of Christ in us that makes the difference and now this new is the thing that is beyond our control it has nothing to do with to do with our abilities your reconciliation back to God nothing to do with our capabilities it has to begin with God that begins it and God that ends it so now I want to say this that we didn't believe praise the lord we don't believe what would be calling belief is simply recognizing our position in God that we are Sons and Daughters of God he is our father so when we hear the voice of the Father by way of the word it speaks about a nature it speaks about our nature that we lost praise the Lord before the fall and in response we come into obedience and believe and follow what the voice of the father says that's when we find ourselves in Obedience of the word you have no control over that it is god making his way out from the inside so you believing praise the Lord each one of us our belief has nothing to do with who we are praise the Lord it had nothing it had nothing to do with who you were it was in the making of God that at such a time and at such a point in such a place you come to know who you are that you are not of the world but you belong to God and when you heard the voice when you heard the word there was a response to the word which was beyond your control praise the Lord because there is a nature of you that is of god and that nature responds to the word of God so God had loc us all our walks of life it didn't matter you were it didn't matter which religious organization you belong to it didn't matter praise the Lord which which which which woman you are you married or which husband you married to to whose parents you were born when the time came for God to call out your name when the time came for God to reconcile you back to himself it had to break this nature and all the powers that were ruling over you it had to break all the religious attachments that we are holding you praise the Lord because there was something on the inside of you that was responding to the nature of God when he called you out like the prophet says was the point when you are recognizing that this is not where I belong so when you heard it you walked up straight and responded to the voice not minding what your father would say minding what your wife would say minding what your husband would saying what your boss at work would say all that matter your response to what that call praise the Lord was a deep responding to the Deep so now when we are being reconciled back to God when we are being reconciled back to that which was before the beginning the life of God in us it breaks all barriers around us praise the Lord and it has nothing to do with yourself you have no control over it because that call will give you Assurance praise the Lord that where you're going is the safest ground it will give you assurance that where you're going you are going to your inheritance you are going to your Eternal possession that even if you are rejected in this body you Assurance on the inside of you praise the Lord that you have an eternal inheritance that shall not reject you praise the Lord Jesus says in John 6 verse 35 I am the bread of life he that comes to me shall never hunger praise the Lord you have no worry about what you shall feed on tomorrow even when you are kicked out praise the Lord and He that believeth on me shall never thirst and verse 37 he says now this is where the thing is all that the father give me shall come to me you like it or not you like it all not all that the father has given to Jesus and the father has given to Jesus a role of reconciling all the children of God back to himself and when Jesus came Jesus says all that the father has given to and him that cometh to me I will in no cast out not all that the father given to me shall come to me from all walks of life you shall make your way to Christ why because where you belong to Christ the name of living God if God has given me children by all means they shall come into manifestation praise the Lord I will bear them and they will come into manifestation praise the Lord if there still my Lo at the time appointed of the Lord those children shall be born and they shall come into manifestation and if you are the children of God even when we are lost in the jungles of the world but because we belong to God by all means the father shall call us out and Jesus says As long as you are children by all means we shall come to him praise the Lord so that's what I said it breaks all the barriers around us and all that matters is our reconciliation to God praise the Lord by all means when you hear the word you hear the voice God is locating you praise the Lord he is calling out your name praise the Lord it was at such a time when I heard my name I didn't know what it was praise the Lord but I heard my name because when the word was being preached there was something sweet in it that compelled me to believe that this word has something to do with my Soul you can't give an explanation about it but you respond to it anyhow because there is a nature in the word because this word himself Is God When the word is calling out when the word is being preached when you hear the words and it locates you DRS you to Christ by force and then you find yourself believing the word and when they ask you but how did you believe you can't tell a story of how you believe why because there was a nature on the inside of you that was simply responding to a nature that is of god that's why the prophet would say we come from God and we go to God praise the Lord is God that calls us out he brings us to Christ praise the Lord all that the father give me shall come to me praise the Lord no he says all that the father giveth me then he says but you you did not choose me praise the Lord you didn't choose me but I chose you and I didn't choose you because you had something pretty about you but I chose you because you had my life praise the Lord so when the word is going forward remember the message praise the Lord when Jesus was talking about the s it was being sold all over all over and the purpose was locate the good ground all these other grounds way praise the Lord the purpose was to locate a good ground ground is that soil has the nature of this seed of the seed no the seed that is falling onto it and so he shall provide all the nutrients for to grow and bring forth fruits so when this word of God Goes Forth praise the Lord Jesus said I came to seek those that were lost praise the Lord he came to seek them that were lost lost from where that means that with God we were praise the Lord and along the way we got lost at the fall of Man when Jesus comes he comes to seek only those that were lost praise the Lord and we are those that had been lost that's why when we had a voice my sheep knows my voice when you had a voice you had to respond praise the Lord because the voice was calling out your name somehow you had your name Wilson being called out and you said here I am and when you you responded that voice voice was come me over I shall give you rest the voice was calling each one of us that we with God before the foundation of the world praise the Lord so now we notice that your salvation our Salvation has completely nothing to do with the person of who you are praise the Lord some of us look at ourselves look at where which families we are born we look at our great grandparents nothing good in there praise the lord we look at the Lage we see most of them were born drinking of them may died drinking but out of such a legacy there was a seed gen of God and when the voice went F out of such a tinted [Music] lineage I heard my voice and I had respond my voice praise the Lord and here we are you are here because you had the voice you are here because you had your name praise the Lord you are not here because your parents have brought you out in the message church so many children are born in a message churches and many of them live because the father when we produce praise the lord we don't know what we are producing whether it is of god or not and the best we do is nurt them in the word the time when they come to a point of decision they and they hear the word they shall respond to the word and there shall be a cry in their hearts to come to receive salvation praise the Lord that's when the young man will say I want to be baptized praise the Lord there there is a nature on the inside of him that wants to be identified with the word of God so you are here because you heard that voice and I want to say that each one of us we are in the image of God each one of us are the expression of the thoughts of God each one of us came from God and each one of us is going back to God praise the Lord he speaks his word he sends his message praise the new living God and that's why the message of Malachi 4 the message to this age is to bring back reconcile us to restore the kingdom of the father and his people to reunite as the children back to the father to us to Usher us into ever the Everlasting Kingdom of our God and at the same time separating the wheat from the tears from the tears Revelations 11even Ang sound [Music] and the sth angel [Music] sounded and there were great voices in Heaven There were great voices saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our God of the messenger of thean church [Music] AG the message of the seventh angel when it was sounded praise the Lord there are voices saying the kingdoms of this World which theil Satan had conquered which has been ruling at the sounding of the seventh angel the Bible says now these kingdoms are being reunited back to God and they become the kingdoms of our God and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever this is a message of reconciliation that is calling out the nature of God that is calling out the life of God that is locating the children of God wherever they are be reconciled back to God praise the Lord and now this reconciliation is ushering us into the kingdom of God and his Christ and we shall rule forever so now if we are to rule forever we have eternal life praise the Lord that means the life that we receive of Christ is eternal why because it is the life that we wear before the beginning of the world so we simply lost it but as long as Adam remained the child of God the veil that came in between not take away that se gen of God in Adam praise the Lord he still remain the child of God and that that that Veil did not take away the life the of in us we still have that which is eternal and now this message simply reuniting us back to that which we before the foundation of the world and Jesus and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which sees the son and Believe on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day no man can come to me except the Father which sent me draws him and I'll raise him up at the last that's John 6 it says no man can come to me so now where is your ability where is your striving praise the Lord if you say you receive salvation because you prayed hard where is your praying there it has nothing do with you because there is no way you would come to Christ except the Father which sent Christ to come and die for you draws you to Christ the sacrifice prise none of us had the ability to come to Christ none of us was worthy to come to Christ the father loved us the father L each one of us and even those that are still in the world as long as they were of God before the foundation of the world by all means they shall come to Christ praise the Lord the preacher last Sunday was talking about theot she was aot praise the Lord lived her life as aot sh had so many men praise the Lord but by election she found herself in the King's Arms you look at that that is quite interesting a woman is part of Christ's lineage that means her life her nature had nothing to do with her election your life your nature your birth praise the Lord your natural birth right your family all these things have nothing to do with our election the Lord we are elected because we were with God before the foundation of the world praise the Lord Jesus says no man can come to me the Father which sent me has drawn him to me praise the Lord and then in verse 46 he says not that any man has seen the father he is of God praise the Lord you you have not seen the father no one can be able to see the father except he that is of God we were with God praise the lord we were with God before the foundation are able to know God and see God and accept God and believe God not because we are good people but because we were with God praise the Lord no man has seen the father except he that is of God praise the Lord our reconciliation with God is of god it starts with God and God has to finish it praise the Lord when God speaks his word praise the Lord he simply speaking to his own that's why Jesus made that statement I didn't come to save everyone and I want to say this message is not sent out everyone but it sent out to him was with God before the world was so it simply coming to reunite us because we were lost so it is opening our eyes remember when Jesus was on his way to certain of the disciples they walked with him but yet they never knew who he was and yet he had been with them but they could not look they could not recognize him until he picked up bread broke it and gave it to them and the B says when they ate bread eyes were open and they knew him praise the Lord when you received the word before you reive the word and you ate this word Jesus says I am the bread of life and if you want life eat this bread unless eat this bread you have no life and he told the disciples and the rest of the group that your fathers received bread which was Mana from Heaven that fell every morning but that bread praise the Lord could not give them life but says I am he that is sent from heaven and I am that bread of life and if any man eats of this bread he shall not die but he shall have everlasting life and how are you able to eat that bread no man comes to me except the father draws him to me no man knows the father no man has seen the father unless except those that we with the father I am the bread of life so when you ate this bread when you receive this bread Christ Jesus which is the word of God you ate this bread and then your eyes got open praise the Lord and then you began to remember all those that we forgot at our first birth praise the Lord you began now to know who you are that I am of God and I am Eternal I cannot die because he that is in me is eternal when the seventh angel sounded voes in heaven that behold the kingdoms of go of this world have been reclaimed been taken back to God and His Christ and God his Christ shall rule this world forever and ever that is the message of reconciliation that is reconciling each one of us back to God as I finish John 15 ver you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you and you should that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you I have chosen you you have not chosen me God chose you you are the manifestation of the thoughts of God we were in the mind of God the foundation of the world and we are going back to God to rule with Christ forever and ever and the Bible say Jesus said himself whoever the father draws to me I will not lose him so when you receive Christ you will never get lost when you receive the new birth you will never get lost Christ has got a grip of you until the last day we come from God we go back to go may the Lord bless you amen amen let's sing one song as we invite Pastor to to to close the service there is that song that says we are floating down the stream of time amen the life soon is coming let's get on our feet do you
