them in with the wondering to [Music] J when Jesus was here he baptized but he never baptized the child whoever he baptized were people that were [Music] mature John baptized he never baptized children because the principle is he that repent and is baptized shall be saved so a child cannot repent because the scripture says repent and be baptized every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so we are happy by the grace of God to have an opportunity to dedicate a baby this morning we do this to give this child into the hands of God until God speaks to him to repent his sins and be saved just like Samuel when he was born he was given into the hands of the ministry was dedicated to Eli and then what happens when the time came God spoke to Samuel by the word of the Lord dedicate this [Music] baby so in the hands here I have W Jonathan [Music] Jonathan's father in Heaven we thank you

him Lord into the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ as a dedication father that may Jonathan that you may protect him that your grace may follow after him and catch him at a spot to bring him to the altar like your grace followed Moses C him at SP and brought him under your care I this boy Lord that you may save him father from any form of ailments and all kinds of things that the enemy attacks children with I also pray for the parents that you may provide for them to be able to look after this little Jonathan also Heavenly Father give them the life from which this young man will be able to watch and be able to live the very Life of Christ dedicated him into your hands in Jesus name [Music] amen God bless you you see that's men they've got their own of carrying children so let's stand up

life Revival in everybody's life should be a daily cry amen so sister Faith sister Faith also thank you for being here with us amen uh she'll be at the concert I think maybe you will not to be she has love because that's the last thing for her to miss okay let's stand up and you know get into the scripture reading we turn to the Book of Matthew chapter 24 and verse 34 and um I pray that you pay quite a bit of attention to this amen and when you miss it anywhere just go back to the tape listen back to it good things is that we have recording Angels here amen so the scripture says verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled may the Lord at blessing the reading of his word you may resume your seat amen so uh the title to today preaching stability part 10 the generational revivals amen now in the beginning the generation was first given 120 [Music] years and then it came down to [Music] 1 and today it's 40 years a generation bially is 40 years so this generation May mean I mean a generation May mean the 40 uh calendar years but according to the Bible we must know that a generation is not an empty span of 40 years it involves people in the span of the 40 years so when we are talking about a generation we are talking about a period of 40 years together with the people that live in that period of 40 years so by involving the people we are really looking at their way of life because the scripture sometimes speaks about a generation in various ways it is specifically speaking about people the ways of their Liv and not just an empty span of those 40 years so this generation is referred to as an evil and wicked generation so the years alone without a people cannot really give meaning to an evil and wicked generation is the people walking away from the path of righteousness they break ranks with the word amen children are not raised under the word the parents just don't care about what they are bringing for marriages break over very simple things you know the generation goes into the worship of the Stars amen because down there in Hollywood we've got what they call the Stars amen amen so people just copy the ways they live their lives they watch the sportsmen see how they dress go after them the word has been put aside so an evil and wicked generation means the people who are wickedly soiled in a period of 40 years now we see in the scriptures that after the unbelief atesh amen God saw that the entire group that came from Egypt from the age of 20 never enter into the promise okay now I'll go down to the Book of Numbers chapter 32 and verse 11 he say surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt from the 20 years old and upward shall see the land which I saw unto Abraham is Jacob because they have not only followed me but later he called those people a generation Amen in that's verse3 he says here the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel and he made them Wonder in the wilderness 40 years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was consumed so when he says this generation shall not pass away amen until all these things be fulfilled he covers the people amen that you know would see Israel become a nation amen and therefore that generation covers up from 1948 to 1988 are you together with me till all these things be fulfilled now when we talk about a generation here we can as well include the children that have been born into the period of time and today we can say the children of that generation are only 36 years do you understand what I mean they are only 36 years so now here I mean the scriptures they speak about these things and when they speak about these things they are talking about quite a number of issues amen so let's go to m 24 verse one he says and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as it sat down upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be amen and what shall be the sign of thy coming end of the world now Jesus was coming to Jerusalem for the first time and he was coming to the closing of his Corporal Ministry and it is here where speaks about the times and the signs of the end when shall these things be one question what shall be the sign of thy coming two questions and of the end of the world three questions so we made mistake when we try to apply all these three questions to the coming of the Lord he says when shall these things be that we speaking about the time frame to the coming of the Lord to which the answer is literally no man knows the de so we just need to leave the life because it is us who must be ready before he can come are you together with me he's long suffering and the scripture says the law I mean the bride has made herself ready you know as a bridegroom you cannot just go and marry a lady who is not ready so even the master has to prepare his bride and when she is ready then he can come and pick her to the marriage so the bride has to make herself ready and you know what happens about these marriages the bridegroom can come to church at 10:00 in the morning but then the the bride is very careful about how this looks like and then she can run back to the saloon because there is a little bit of a bridge here she has to be ready before she presents her self for the marriage amen let's go to Mark chapter and verse 32 but of the day and that hour knoweth no man not the Angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father take he watch and pray so you know not when the time is we do not know the hour so we need to continue living a life of Consecration and waiting in prayer streaming our lamps amen and you know Jesus in Jerusalem was going around a magnificent Temple and that Temple was the pride of Israel because it took 47 years in building but then this Temple was brought down in7 in7 by a Roman general called Titus and then the Jews were dis passed all over the world because this man completely wrecked Jerusalem so what does this mean it means that the signs of the coming of the [Music] Lord spins a long period of time amen until the unbeliever will say since the days of our fathers the things continue the same where is he where is his coming the signs started getting fulfilled as far away as A7 so remember the three questions when shall these things be amen the coming of the Lord amen what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world so three questions were asked but the answers show us that you know it takes a long time from when the signs started being fulfilled to the coming of Messiah but I want tell you that today all the signs have been fulfilled so we are living in the periods of coming of the Lord he may come today he may come tomorrow he may come 10 years he may come 50 years he's Sovereign he's waiting for you to prepare yourself to the come amen so Matthew 24 verse4 and Jesus answered and said unto them take he that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am anointed amen I am anointed amen because to be anointed is to be a Christ not the Christ but to be a Christ to enjoy the same anointing that Christ had so many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many so the spirit of deception backed up with the anointing would be so rampant in the seasons and the times of his coming it will be so rampant everybody will claim a gift this one will claim a form of anointing another one will will claim a certain level of capacity of ministry that people would claim anointing as they take others away from the true Bible teaching because it is not the teaching that will lead the people in the end time the people will follow the anointing so this is where the danger is now any man who wants to start a good church we always talk about anointing we have got the anointing here and the anointing according to them is how they scream how they shout how they are so in service but the anointing according to the Lord isem power under control am when it's raining that's the true anointing amen I remember Christ was seated in the temple and I don't know for what reasons a priest came along gave him this the Bible and when he gave him the Bible I think let us stand together and look at that scripture that's the Book of Luke amen are you there now yes sir The Book of Luke chter 4 amen so let's read from 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was I love some customs the Lord had some customs how many of you have customs as his custom was he had to be in the house of the Lord on the Sabbath is that your custom it's a very good one he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he adoped the book he found a place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me but he was still he was not nodding his head he was not running around he was not jumping up and down he was not screaming but the spirit of the Lord is upon me amen he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that he that are bruised to preach the acceptable of the Lord 19 and he closed the book gave it back again to the minister he sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say this day this scripture is fulfilled you what was fulfilled the spirit of the Lord is upon me I am anointed did you have thr on the ground to prove that no sir the spirit of the Lord is upon me but the scripture says in the end time amen the many people come saying I am anointed amen so the nature actually what begins here let's go back to now let's get to Matthew here amen chapter 24 verse 6 we are looking at the sign and you shall hear the Ws and rumors of wars see that he be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet Nations shall rise against nations against Kingdom there shall be feminist penes earthquakes in diverse places all these the beginning of Sorrow he says those things will start systematically happen so the nature and the [Music] cosmos would begin to spiral downward whoo rumors of wars nations against Nations penes amen ask amen and he says back that will be the beginning of sorrow and this season of Sorrow comes because the people have fallen away from the leadership of the world not listen to God anymore amen so Paul tells Timothy in second Timothy chter 3 and verse one I'll give you quite a few scriptures today I want you to go back and study through them he says this know also that in the last days the realest times shall come there will be hard TI there will be a social breakdown so you keep looking at things and little you know they are signs of the coming of the Lord amen in verse three says for men shall be lovers of their own selves who cares about who any who cares what you do or you don't do they will be Busters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth thankful and holy without natural affection did you hear what I say that feeling for another will completely come to zero without natural affection they break agreements F choosers they don't care what they say about you they incontinent they Fierce despisers of those that are good Paul was describing the community as it is today and he says they are traitors they play between the people they are head high minded LS of pleasure more than the lovers of God did you hear that if there is a big thing out there brother you need to be a Christian because they want to go with something which has got some form of pleasure in it and having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof he says from such turn away why because those are signs of the coming of the Lord amen so having a form of godliness claiming the anointing but yet denying the power of transformation I want the power I want the anointing but I don't want the transformation that the word brings amen praise the Lord let's go to Matthew 24 amen verse 9 and 10 still looking at what shall this end of these things be you know then shall they deliver you to be afflicted and shall kill you and he shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another but remember El does not pers amen once you get that kind of inclination Amen to get into temptation so that you can uh prute another brother elect does not persecute it's not Christ who reported the fares to Herod but the Pharisees and the ones who reported Christ to Herod amen it's not the Pharisees that stand before PIR in trial it's Christ who stood there so we have the quot does not but you don't have the right either to prute a man who is not a Believer amen praise the Lord verse 11 says and many false prophet shall rise and shall deceive many so the rise of anointed men in the end time shall be enous but none of these men shall Point people to Christ amen are you together with me they just tell people how blessed they are they will tell people how they will rule the world they just tell the people how their families are going to be blessed I tell you family will blessed your jobs will be blessed everybody you come across will realize you are a son of God and that will be the level of their Ministry anointing will not take people into fellowship with Christ amen much as they bring the people to church but I'm talking about taking them beyond the church personal relationship with Christ amen so Israel became a nation in 1948 and we know that this generation shall not pass away until all these things be fulfilled then shall come our Christ are you together with me okay in Luke chapter 21 verse 29 and he SP to them aable hallelujah hallelujah amen and he SP to them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees now he's being very specific here but the will come time when God will deal with the Fig Tree and all the trees are you together with me and we know that the Fig Tree speaks about Israel is that amen when they now should f you see and know of your own selves that summer is now at so there comes a time when both the Fig Tree which is a unique tree specifically recognized by God and all other trees which speaks about the Gentile churches they come to a time when they begin to Bloom together are you together with me listen to what brother Bram say now they watch for it in the generation amen they [Music] what what he talking about not at all listen he said the generation that see the Fig Tree putting forth its bird amen now watch he said the f tree and all other trees now in other words there would be a universal Revival at the time amen praise the Lord sometimes we would see the Revival in Israel and then sometimes we see the Revival among the Gentiles but in the end time amen there will be a Revival both in Israel and all other Gentile churches this day this scripture is fulfilled amen he said he gave them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all other trees when they now sh forth you see and know of your own s that Su is now at and what with Summer now summer is the season for the Harvest are you together with me he says when you see them begin to buy begin to bring forth the seed in the here amen then you will know that the time of the Harvest is very close amen so the generation that sees the Fig Tree putting forth its birs and all other trees putting forth their B which means Israel in a Revival and the Gentiles amen having their Revival so this generation here shall not pass away till all these things be fulfilled amen so we say the generation is a period of years and the people they are so imagine the people were born in the generation and the age actually ends in 48 I mean 88 so if there was anybody born in 1988 is only 36 years I want to say we are close to the coming of the Lord I don't de in years but I deal in realities of issues now listen to what brother Bram says Not only was the Jews the Fig Tree to put forth his bir but other trees and every church has had a Revival amen have been for the last few years the Pentecostal you had your Revival the Baptist their Revival Presbyterians has got a Revival and the Jews are returning to Palestine the generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled praise the Lord so both categories of trees have been lamped together in the same season in the end time amen I'm trying to bring something out because we are talking about stability you see it's until you see the season that you begin to prepare yourself is that amen yeah when Daniel understood by books he moved into prayer unless we know our prophetic season we cannot know our prophetic claim and when you see anything by way of scripture then you've got a right to claim it you'll have a right to claim for a Revival knowing what season we are living amen both categories of trees were L together has been that when God is dealing with Israel he puts the Gentiles aside first but both Israel and the Gentile amen were disass they were amen the Jews and they went into all the nations around they were scattered all over the [Music] place and for us we were scattered from the word into denomination and what people call the word is just denominationalism if you make a good one if you get a philosophical one you can really get a good harest and the people will say we in the world which is very good amen but we have to be gathered into the word amen Israel needed to come back to their Homeland as we also needed to come back to the homeland of the world and all this happens in the same season are you together with me yes sir now let me tell you something God has revealed to us about what this is It's the revelation of Christ and the life of Christ in the people amen so by knowing what they are we hear the voice of the master calling us back to the Homeland so there was a season of time between the sixth and S hallelujah hallelujah amen that God began to call back Israel into their Homeland because that's their Promised Land God doesn't do anything much for Israel as a nation as long as they disass from their land when Abram was in the land he could defeat several kids when Israel went beyond the borders AB went beyond the Border he could be scared of one king amen but when they come back into their borders they are powerful no Nation can defeat them there right from the time when they became a nation they have never lost a war to anybody amen because they in their Homeland and I want tell you also that at the same season God has called us back into the homeland of the world and as long as we in the home we are not going to lose anyone amen because we've been given the weapons better than the atomic weapons we've been given the power of prayer we've been given the name of Jesus we've been given the character of desperation that we can always be able to call God to the SE amen yes sir the prophet says between the sixth and the seventh seal there was a calling out of the 144,000 amen then he said lukee 17 Hebrews 4:12 all the scriptures that were promised this is to be between the sixth and seventh SE and this is where we are [Music] now are you together with me so as Israel is standing strong in her Nation winning all the battles so shall the restored bride back into the homeland of the world win every battle amen it doesn't say you are not going to fight Wars you are going to fight but you are going to win hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't mean you are not going to be persecuted pers but you not be defeated this is the season where God promised to stand on the amen okay so now we are in the perfect Faith the faith of Jesus Christ is the believer are you together with me do you remember your faith which is your human faith cannot save you that's what Ephesians 2 says Amen Let Me Take You There for anybody who was not around Ephesians 28 the scripture tells us by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves this Faith here is not your faith but it's the gift of God given to you are you together with me it's God's gift for you to be saved somebody say am okay I just want to let you know that the Faith of Christ Christ in you is the believer you cannot even [Applause] hold when that shifts a little biter had a human faith and real strong result or desire to do certain things he sees the stor I mean he is the Lord coming and then he says master I want to walk to you I don't know how far he was from the boat and the master be come and then he began to walk but the master himself knows how to prove that is not ourselves but it is him allowed the storm to come and when the storm came the faith of Peter was diminishing in the face of his stor and he was sinking but the faith of Jesus the gift of God extended the hand and he was able to walk on the water amen by the gift of faith which is the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ and now it's the same Faith which has saved you he doesn't save you today to lose you tomorrow I'm not saying you will not make mistakes in life but because it's the Faith of Christ prayed for you so that your faith fails not amen and so by this faith we continue our Pilgrim Journey amen through this situation but we overcome through the waters but we overcome through the floods we overcome up the hills we still overcome it's not I but Christ in me the hope of glory amen yes sir yes sir so we now enjoy the perfect we are in the age of the token himself the fullness of the goded body this time living in the church as the pass of the Holy amen so true light has come our way we now have a true understanding of God we have taken our baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we are being restored back to the apostolic faith and we know where we are on this journey because the trees are also not only Jerusalem but even out here in the Gentile there is the Life of Christ that's growing to come to The Headstone just like the Jews are growing in their face to up with Christ in this coming amen so St Luke 2129 where he says he spoke unto them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees amen then he says here message rest when you see the Fig Tree putting forth the B and all the other trees not the time is near speaking of the second coming of Christ hallelujah hallelujah all the sides now What Remain is the coming of him amen Through the Ages it was either fig [Music] tree then he would not care all the trees and then sometimes it would be all trees he wouldn't care all this fig tree but this time the Fig Tree and all tree meaning we are coming to the end of time would never with the Jews and Gentiles together amen praise the Lord but now that's what he's doing has a testim he says Israel became a na in 1947 on the same night the angel of the Lord came to him in a cave are you together with me now here is Israel becoming a nation and he is now the law raising up a man to go through all the trees to bring a Revival among the people amen and he says when you see them come together like that then time shall be no more hallelujah hallelujah calling Israel into the Homeland and then the Gentiles to the Homeland for the opening of the world Amen listen now oh praise the Lord I told you one thing that if you are not prophetic in your understanding you cannot have fellowship with a prophet because the prophet draws his understanding from a supernatural Dimension sometimes it SE things that you may not be able to see but then you need the grace of Revelation upon your heart to fellowship with the prophet I told you the things they spoke a virgin shall conceive that had never been before people isolated Isaiah how can that be science alone science does not support that theory but it's a Divine Theory while they were still complaining Isaiah went her face higher and he says a son is born but Isaiah could not confirm it but the eyes of a prophet were looking at a son that's how difficult it is to have fellowship with the prophet unless you are in the same Dimension and praying father give me the grace to see what he see one time when Syria were trying to wage a war amen against Israel there was a prophet in the land who tell the king of is what Syria wanted to do and so now it's time Syria moved their forces to come and attack they landed in Ambush amen and they were beaten and the King said all of us on this military ccil amen who of you of Israel and then one of them said none of us so General but I want to tell you in Israel there is a man he called a prophet his name is Elijah has the ability to see what you think of theer of of the mind when he's not here he knows what we are doing and now the foolishness of the lack of Christ the King said we go and get that one first he's a military strategist so he knows how now to defeat the war our first Target is that Prophet then he sent some people to spy out the prophet they found him staying in some mountain ranges you know he was a prophet and Prophets are eagles and they love mountains amen they want those I mean areas which is not very crowded where they can go in and pray so then the man dispatches his Army and went and they surrounded so the servant of the Prophet wakes up very early in the morning to prepare the day for the amen and as he opened the door he saw the ambushment amen and all the horses and [Music] Horsemen you know Shields he locked the door and came to the [Music] king the people have surrounded us the prophet was very calm sometimes God will allow situations in our Liv but the only way you can overcome is learn to be if you are not come you make a lot of mistakes in your life Lear to become storms will gather around but Lear to be the prophet has come he went into prayer and he says Lord open the young man's eyes and when he opened the door again he came again Shou army of the Lord those were nothing now so you know the I mean the prophet was seeing through a dimension but this man here can be it's not very easy to fellow the prophet if you cannot have the ability to look into Channel amen so brother Bram says this this seven sealed book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of Revelation 10 I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven closed with a CL and upon his if you not that's Christ in the Old Testament was called the end of the Covenant is directly coming to the Jews now for the church is finished hallelujah hallelujah he says the church is finished yes because the church finishes at but that's not the end of the people he goes beyond the church into the bridge and says come up here hallelujah hallelujah and those of you who came out you are not inia you are now in the prach Hallelujah and it's in this prach where the Fig Tree and all the trees being dealt with are you together with me so at this coming when Christ comes in Revelation 101 amen holding an open book Hallelujah he coming directly to the Jews but how possible is it for him to get the Jews without passing through the gentil i t that sometime but I want to bring it back here because we are dealing with the Fig Tree and all tree [Music] together now God is working among the Gentiles is working among the Jews he preparing our going out as he preparing their coming in amen so yes his threee was coming direct to the Jews but the Gentiles are his Junction point amen because the working of God he does nothing without a body he needed a body he could do nothing until he the Jesus body and now he can do nothing until he has the body of the church where his hands where his hand we are his leg we are his embodiment amen and works through us are you together with me so how could we have got the gospel if he was not embodied a man of the the Jewish men the apostles amen who came and brought the gospel and the Jews rejected it then we took it are you together with me how can the Jews take it unless we have received and then rejected so he has to come into Revelation when he came amen way back as Jesus of Nazareth he came to the Jews and the Jews rejected the atonement and the atonement came to us amen and now he's coming back as the revelation of that Christ in his own word until you reject it the Jews will let me say something amen needed to take Ruth for his wife but there was no way he could take her he had to redeem Naomi first and then have all that which was Naomi including r that's the only way he could redeem her so by redeeming Nomi to himself boas could have Ruth and that's how Ruth becomes that beautiful story of the Gentile bride she had been grafted into Naomi was the means by which she could be redeemed amen and now when she was redeemed and became wife to B then came was born then out of bed came Jess out of Jess came David out of David came Solomon and all the way to the coming of Christ are you together with me so Israel gave to us the gospel by rejecting it and as the Gentiles when we reject it the Jews are now ready to take they are desperate they want the Messiah to come back now every day they live upon the promises say This Is Our Land This is the land where Jeremiah and Isiah preached this is the country where David ruled this is the country where Jesus live they are coming closer they have got something that's saying it is homegoing time now if God is dealing with us in the unique way this season there must be a similar desire the genti that we want to go home God has never any time being without witness he kept the Gentile until he could get the Gentile Church Amen brother Bram says here that at the coming in Revelation 10 he's coming directly to the Jews understand this so and The Testament right I mean the statement right here makes us very worried or prepared rather we say Lord we want to be ready we want to go home we prepare ourselves because he coming directly but he couldn't bypass because works by your body that's the way God works amen so let's get a little bit into the deeper waters if we can amen this is now getting a little deeper here that the same day Israel became a nation the angel of the came down and spoke to brother Bram about the restoration of the church you should read the sture I mean uh you should read the message Feast of trumpets therefore the genti bride must receive the fullness of her Redemption and be sealed in he wants to do the best he can he's doing giving us all the word he's allowing situations circumstances trials to awaken the Gentile so that we cannot Slumber because the coming of the Lord is very near so God God s a message to the edge but in the age it looks like there are layers layers to that message let me like a dealing with this book there is a message here then that layer is gone there is a message here then the layer is gone then there is a page here then that layer is gone you understand now so that's the way God is working with us that he has brought to us a message but under that message they are layers which bring Revival to different Generations in the are you together with me now we you know so far we are almost 120 years since the age opened are you together with me we are almost 100 20 years which is speaking about now three generations but now there has been something in every generation that keeps driving the church forward Amen in 1906 the beginning of the church we had Simons here the man who was in ausa Street and he was praying the Holy Spirit came down and they started a Revival in that generation and that drove the church the gifts of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostal movement became so powerful it was a space of time in the age so in the age there are several Generations but every generation must find sound Revival of the message given to the Earth are you together with me yes sir when one layer is fing off in the generation another layer of the same message open and again it finds another are you together with me one begins with justification amen opens up the person's heart amen as a flame of fire comes in there and then weep at the altar at the power of justification they see the Heaven's Door open when they leave the altar they happen because they've seen the Lord Jesus Christ but as the man seems to set down another lay again opens up a stronger fire ignites which is the need of sanctification not that justification is dead but just another layer adds to the justification and we call it sanctification something on the side of you conv you to live clean put some levels of sacrifice in your new work Lord I don't want to be like this I want don't want to be like that amen you are parting with different fashions in life you are cutting off and limiting and godly associations you are cutting of places you go to amen you are investing time into the study and prayer you are investing time in fellowship with the Brotherhood you are saying Lord Jesus Christ I pray that you may meet me have fellowship with me I don't want to be what I used to be that's another layer of Revival the Holy Spirit keeps opening up again comes the great experience the of the Holy Ghost in the chambers of Joy the confidence of God is always Revival after Revival this is how the ages kept moving just like you the individual amen when the Lord visited you he didn't visit you with all understanding he just placed one thing conviction against justification and then you thanked God and you went back home saying I thank God I'm not what I used to be I thank God I I've had the visitation of the Holy Ghost while you settle then the Holy Ghost begins to point to you certain things in your life that need to be settled then you settle one by one you are crying Heavenly Father help me never to go back in those things that how you pray you keep crying father w't you make me better than this help me to be in control of myself Soul you are dealing with sanctification then comes the BM of the and then the joy where you feel like something has burned some stuff out of you like there is a burden that has gone off of you and you are beginning to Rejoice the way God has been dealing with you is the way God deals with every Church text the church age from one layer into another layer so a generation as I said is 40 years and going by the period this age started in 1906 to this we in the third generation so in the same age we've had theusa experience the outpouring of the Holy Gift the gifts of the holy spirit rather burning until God brought his Prophet to the Sea Malachi 4 came and like all this never mattered like the other which came first were not anything anything of value but yet it was but it's a Revival a layer of [Music] Revival and by 1956 theusa Revival Clos and brother bram's Ministry started trying and started the time the lose ends they began he began to put together the areas of the word which was not very understood he started preaching things different from what was meing not that they are not part of the word but not that they are not the major now amen he started preaching messages like the junction time seven Junctions he preached the Hebrews to help the people understand Redemption he preached the mark of the beast he came with handwriting on the wall all the way to the seven churches he preached the statue of a perfectas names and then towards the opening of the seals this the time the fullness of the message was going to come the seals were going to be say is this the time then finally boom into the world and here we came to know the purpose of God the opening of the seals the Jour of his coming amen from Genesis 35 all the way to the New Jerusalem we look at Christ in the word in the word in the word the Bible became a new Bible and when we picked the word and we fed on it it was a Revival the churches were established in the country but even in Uganda is coming to a jubilee since the message started out so what's my message today there must be another layer to this message in this country there must be another layer there must be some young people that should come forth dig into the world cry to God ask father what is the way forward for this message amen are you together with me hallelujah hallelujah listen to what brother Bram say no age ever comes back that's the principle Revival you cannot go and War on a past fire [Music] and you are sitting near the furnace but it is ashes do you hear what I say you cannot do that you need the fire in its present what is the visitation of God now how is God going to keep the fires of the word amen what's the next layer of this message it is not another message it's just another layer that's already in the message amen yeah it can't have like you know he says uh no Revival ever comes back it can't have the life of God in it by natural generation it takes a regeneration from above this last age started with the fire of Pentecostal Revival is right back and they became exactly like the Baptist you know methods and everything instead of taking the word they took their own ideas and did just what every age has done substituted the manual for the world just step outside of that manual and see what happens you are out brother and they will you and blame it on but when you meet the brother you can't even but you are blaming it on God God have mercy and how they they love the organization they are second generation Pentecostal and since God doesn't have grandchildren they are just children their fathers known by their Creed and form of worship they can look they can talk about what used to be but they can't produce it once they had lightning but now it's only praise the Lord he says what shall we do when you see a generation Gathering itself go back into the former Revival they came from it's a time for the people to awaken are you together with me when you see the people gather themselves up get back into the Pentecostal organ it's time to awaken there must come a Revival every generation must have its own Revival young men must the word must pray until something opens up to propel their generation forward are you together with me so there should be there should be a deep cry for Revival from the young people amen the layer today which is opening up now is Christ being revealed in his word in a more significant way than ever before that's what we want to see come to the edge of the cap so we are looking for the layer the true and faithful layer the layer today I want to call it the amen we have to come to the purpose the mark of the High Calling this is where we want to be that's the Revival we want to see rival that will build rapturing faith in the church amen so the message could never lead to anything less than Christ are you together with me praise the Lord because the ministry of the Prophet was to reveal Christ amen it's not the revelation of the ministry of the man so our study and our commitment is not the stud of the works of a great man it is through his works let us see the Lord Jesus Christ that's where the Revival will start from when the person of the Lord Jesus Christ is being so emminent Among Us amen praise the Lord the layer today is the truth of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ Living Among Us you see what I mean there must be a cry because here we are you know we are winding up the fourth generation in the age but every generation must have its own Revival what's going to bring the Revival Among Us in this time Christ stepping forth as revelation Among Us that's what we are looking for father reveal your son in me listen a moment consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost from the people and God sent Luther with the world and spoke for God at that time but they organized and again pure word was lost organization tends towards [Music] dog are not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God the living Epistles read and know of all men for their generation when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until this last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final end will you be that final voice to the final ede amen let me say a few things here before I close Daniel was to by the books understood by the books and he set himself ready for the return to Jerusalem when he was out in Babylon amen he studed the word and he came to a point we shall be 70 years in captivity in babyon it is 70 years talk about the Revival and Daniel began to pray and to search and the angel came down SP Revival are you together with me amen so here we are friends Daniel did not get stuck in knowledge areas he applied the knowledge to open it the next layer of Revival so he came down and told the people s are over oh Hallelujah are over and all Israel that was in Babylon began to sing 70 years is over they started lifting up their hands they were singing songs of Jubilee their eyes were off the Captivity and they were looking back to Jerusalem they looking at the restoration of the temple Hallelujah they are must be something open up another generation we Maring into the fourth generation in this age there must be something that should Spar a Revival amen we ought to understand by books and use the knowledge of the message to Break Forth into another layer the word must bring us to the person of the word hallelujah the world must bring us to the person of the world because the prophet says my Ministry is declare that is here hallelujah hallelujah and we see him in our homes in our lives in whatever we do friends this is the season we are living in where we can say here he is and looking Upon Jesus amen that's what you know John is saying John the Baptist said the Lamb of God and then as he said like that he was the prophet was introducing Christ the word to his disciples are you together with me and the two disciples heard him speak and they left John and they went to Jesus are you together with me we have stayed just enjoying Fellowship we teaching what brother Bram has given to us but as we stud the message prayerfully there will be a voice Behold the Lamb of God that day you get a revelation of what made you believe it was to come to the person of the Lord Jesus Christ amen then Jesus stand and saw the two following and said unto them what seek ye and they said unto him Rabbi which is to interpret Master where dwellest thou he says to them come and see hallelujah hallelujah praise God it was good they followed I mean joh the Baptist but if they failed to see the person of the Lord Jesus Christ the minister of John has failed do you see where the next Revival is is you Faithfully under the Min of Malachi 4 you must come to a point where you can say master where dwell thou and then you follow him to a greater revelation of who he is amen the word spoken by the prophet LED them into fellow amen so this is the hour of moving into Fellowship the word in our individual capacity we are not Believers because we come to church we are believers because we want to see where he dwelleth and have fellowship with him and then he'll say come and see we want to come into fellowship with the person of the word amen so we thank God for the prophet and his message but the message in there lays another layer we must open the layer of divine Fellowship Christ amen because you see through the seven churches it was pulling people into fellowship with Christ hallelujah hallelujah if we don't see Christ The Messengers become a curtain if we don't see Christ the ministry of the messenger has failed I want every one of us to have a personal revelation and the testimony of seeing the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's the next Revival where people have a testimony that God transforming powering on side of me throughout the seven Church ages the timate I am here I am here I am here not to hear about him amen and when I saw him John says I fell at his feet and he say and he laid his hand upon me and said unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am here I'm not here to intimidate you with my presence I am here to introduce you to a greater Revival to a realization who I am and want to bring you amen and then he tells John I am he that live oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God I am he which searches the RS so we need to come to the I am [Music] he that was the ultimate never from I am the transforming message which way to the edges until we come into the [Applause] presence we only be church members God bless you we need to come into fellowship with I am he so beyond the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter breaks into another layer fellowship with the person of the Lord Jesus Christ when he was in prison he was bound but the person that filled him came forward and released him amen you see it's going Beyond to testify I have the B of the it must come to a moment where we say we have got fellowship with the guide that he comes to me when I'm in prison he comes to me when I'm in hospital it comes to me when I am in deaths it comes to me when I'm in misery he comes to me when I am in fear oh Hallelujah he that is in you must also come back and fellowship with you this goes beyond the anointing now into Fellowship next level of Revival that we are look is not knowing the godhead alone not knowing the baptism coming to a fellowship to a union with the person of the Lord Jesus Christ somebody amen there the prophet says justification is what you believe sanctification is what the blood did for you you are Sanctified by [Music] believing but when you are filled with the Holy Ghost it's the person of the Holy Ghost himself the person of the Holy Ghost not imaginations not some kind of psychology the person of the Holy Ghost that's the next Revival to bring him from the Mind reality of his presence that becomes a companion in times of trouble when you are going out into party he's there with you when they are pulling you to prison for whatever reason like they did Peter he was there with him when they two came into the fire amen he was there with the HEB children when they him into the land what does that mean that at this point the Revival is more of Christ than we have ever than we have ever known before because he has to become moral to us as we keep getting closer to the coming of are you together with me Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true btis of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues then God lives in a tabernacle the building living Tabernacle of the living God's Place Nazareth Jesus of Nazareth the Holy Ghost is here in the person of the Holy Ghost when was the life that was in him which was the life which was in him he's here working through people and declaring himself by signs and wonders which he [Music] does he's becoming more real being more closer to us than ever before that's the Revival that we are talking about the Revival where they not tell you let's go to church but the guide we always turn and then you'll say yes Lord and then he guides you to there must be something take control of Our Lives praise the Lord he says today he's standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself more coming into his church making himself known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same thing making himself known and one day you see that the one that you f in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he will become one that's the Revival to come into that image it's not saying I have a message but it is saying the Lord has made me the message of the hour amen will that come to be our testimony amen he says you can't do it now you can't satisfy that hly amen except by God himself living amen hallelujah hallelujah the word must bring us into Divine fellowship with the person himself this is the Revival that we are looking at we must be facing into him I in you you in me much as we are under the ministry of brother BR the success of that Ministry amen is when you have found the reality of the Lord Jesus Christ person to you amen we are just a step away to the perfect realization so what is happening now the next r is the image of Christ getting closer and closer and closer and him becomes one comes the Rapture that's the Revival God help me to be you oh Heavenly Father be me that I may be you that's the next Revival it's not just a matter of coming to church it's not playing tapes and living that to that but is playing that tip and asking the life of God the anointing upon that to come and take over our lives amen he says the things says he that is true oh hallelujah hallelujah it's not knowing about him it's not is knowing him not knowing about him but knowing him now knowing about could be reading through the message the testimony of your pastor the testimony of your brother but knowing him is that relationship I think you pick that out of the [Music] exhortation okay praise the Lord you see that's what I'm trying to talk about he says these things says he that and listen to the word now this word true is a very wonderful word it's not to mean true just in the sense that is opposite of false amen it expresses perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with paral realization amen so for you to understand him that is true you need to see back in the Old Testament where you know he gave them bread from heaven and they ate the bread from heaven but that was not the true bread that bread was speaking of the coming of the bread when Jesus came said I am the true bread so the word true in this sense is so great that it takes away the shadows and brings forth before us the perfect realization of the person that was was hiding before the behind the shadow when John said Behold the Lamb of God that was the true lamb to the lamb were given in the sacrifice so right now in the time he says I am he that is true amen what does that mean that Christ has come before us are we going to take the benefit of his presence that's the next Revival to seek Christ and take him as person and take everything that he has the ability to give we are pulling away from the Shadows into Divine relationship Divine Fellowship not just bread but the true bread not just the right Doctrine now going beyond the right Doctrine until it can bring us the person of the Lord Jesus Christ to become our companion that's the next Revival that we are thinking about that's where can be able to draw the rapturing faith are you together with me not from the Shadows not just knowing what is Right teaching what is Right must produce a person the Lord Jesus Christ so that he may become your companion that's the only way can work you into the body change praise the Lord that's my desire in this hour amen from the shadow to the subance praise God Amen let me give you this last qu you love him amen since this word this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of paral realization as Illustrated in those verses we can Now understand as never before amen take the example now of man from Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven isra but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again day if it was left around it became contaminated but Jesus hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus is the true bread from heaven where of man was just a type man eats of the bread that came from Heaven he will never hang again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he he had eternal life was reality no need any longer for Shad no need for a paral Salvation here is the wall of it just like Jesus isn't a part of God God hallelujah hallelujah amen we are not looking for paral realization although it takes the paral realization to teach us the perfect realization but when you realize the perfect realization take it that is Christ so the next Revival is a people that will be seeing Christ in the word and pick him as life into the soul and that will transform Our Lives praise the Lord that's the only thing that will transform our Liv there must always be Revival to every generation God bless you God bless [Applause] you it's good to the word and the word will take you to the word the person the Lord Jesus Christ what makes us Believers is no longer the letter what makes us Believers is if we can take the life of the letter and take it and Christ lives on the side of God bless you God bless you amen it's my desire it's my prayer weaknesses praise the Lord those weaknesses are there because we have taken the life out of the world we read the word just as a letter but I pray the Lord gives us Grace that we may take the life out of that word and live by it that's the next Revival not what I know about the godhead not what I know about the serpent SE not what I know about the prophet but going beyond the prophet into fellowship with Christ his prophecy God bless you sessions are breaking isra are waking the signs that the prophet so Gentile days number with herrow a come etern it soon will

amen praise the name of our Lord we appreciate our pastor for the service amen amen each and every one of us we must have a cry in our hearts to be revived praise the name of our as the scriptures were read there are so many pressures we go through there are so many things that are distracting us away from God such a time of Darkness that's when the Lord comes but the Bible says blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing so each and every one of us has to cry for a Revival praise the name of our Lord individual as a person as a parent or as a child at home or wherever you are or somebody who is working or maybe housewife maybe a farmer professional or business person because the Rapture is not going to be segregative either you at work it if you are ready you will be taken when you ready either you at home if you are ready you'll be taken when you or maybe you'll be sleeping if you are ready you be taken so each of us has to cry for a Revival ourselves as people our families our children everywhere praise the name of our we just need to take it so serious praise the name of our Lord we we are meant to have an overnight on Friday this Friday but because we have a youth concert of Music on Sunday we shall see we shall not have an overnight on Friday e e
