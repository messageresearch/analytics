========================================

so so foreign so so okay now good morning everyone stand up we're gonna go right to the scriptures brother matt was supposed to take this morning and ended up that something came up just the emergency last second for him um and so we cancelled it but i was like well i haven't i didn't finish last week so the notes are ready give me five minutes to regroup here and we'll go we'll go forward so and you're sitting here so we might as well do it right amen so let's pray heavenly father we're just so thankful for your mercy and your grace lord and uh just this last minute thing i pray that you just your spirit would come upon me and upon each believer here lord and that we would each pull to receive something from you father we ask we only ask for your mercy and your grace lord for we're deserving of no good thing which you give to us so we commit ourselves to you for your glory we ask in jesus name amen so we'll start with the scripture um psalms 82. 6 i have said be our gods you are elohim and all of you are children of the most high may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated and so last time last time i was speaking um about that the word elohim and talking about how that's it's uh people will say that that means that there's more than pers one person in the godhead there's three persons in the godhead but the word elohim means a it's a plural of majesty and you'll see it over and over again what happens is the reason why it is singular is that it's used in conjunct conjunction with singular pronouns over and over and over again to signify it's not plural other times it's used with plural pronouns to signify that it's plural so you've got to know the the context when it's ever used for jehovah elohim it's always singular it's never never in the plural if you look at let us make man in our own image and elohim said let us make man in our own image even in that context the very next verse immediately goes to singular personal pronouns in the image of god made he him male and female made he them and so you look at that and then we begin to look look at the bigger context last time of elohim and the different ways that this term is used we saw it was used in conjunction with angels we saw it was used in conjunction with false gods or demons we saw it was even used in conjunction with the judges or rulers of israel and jesus used it in reference to prophets and i think we got to the place where we saw the witch of endor calling forth samuel and she said i see elohim coming out of the earth so you know samuel being in that spiritual form coming up says i see elohim angels are spirits they're called elohim what is the word elohim really mean if you look in the scripture it doesn't necessarily mean object of worship like our english word means god it speaks of a mighty one or a ruler or an authority and we talked about that how there's there is only one elohim with the attributes that jehovah has there's no other elohim beside him even though there's many that receive the title of elohim i am trying to find where i stopped in my notes oh here we go so genesis 1 26 and 28 we just referred to that so if you just want to pull that up people can see that let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion so here he makes man in his image and we know that that means he makes him in spirit form first right brother branham says god is a spirit so what was man when he was initially made god's not repeating himself in genesis 1 to genesis 2. first he makes him his spiritual the spiritual aspect of his being then in genesis 2 he makes the physical aspect of his being but in this spiritual aspect he tells him take dominion and this is where you see brother branham will say make the statement he made him a little g.o.d god over the earth and guys like me would get confused by that when i first heard it coming to the message and say what does he mean because in other places he says god means an object of worship it's not that adam was an object of worship adam was an elohim a little elohim over the word earth what is that he's god's vice regent he rules in god's place on the earth right is he over god is he above god you know this is that's the problem is with today's new age thinking people start accusing brother branham of bringing a new age doctrine but it's not it's not it's very scriptural him adam and eve are the elohim over the earth they're to take dominion they're to multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over it there to rule in the place of god but in submission under god obviously so then we have we go to the next part satan's not ready to to leave that alone amen he's not ready to say i'm not going to rule over i'm i'm not going to let them rule over it i'm going to rule over this earth and so then he goes and says genesis 3 4 and 5. and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die what is what is he doing here what is this what is his attempt that he's trying to do he's trying to rest dominion away from adam and eve he does not want someone else to be elohim over this earth he wants to be elohim over this earth and so he plays a trick on him look at what he does he offers them something that they already have he offers her something she already has for god for elohim doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as elohim knowing good and evil they're made in the image and likeness of who elohim now you're going to tell me i'm going to be more like elohim but she what was it she was deceived she was deceived adam was not deceived but eve being deceived was in the transgression adam identified himself with her with her sin but he knew exactly what he was doing he re he redeemed her but it put the whole earth into death that always strikes me as strange how in the world you already made them in the likeness of elohim now you're going to say well you'll be like elohim no wonder he didn't approach adam with that adam would said you want me to be more like that you think you're you think you can offer something that's greater than the only true elohim has already given me genesis 3 17-19 and unto adam he said this is the curse that adam receives and unto adam he said because you have hearkened unto the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying you shall not eat of it cursed is the ground for your sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistle shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the dust for out of it wast thou taken for dust our heart and unto dust thou shalt return hear the authority of adam though it's still there in a certain sense now it's lost now it's lost and the authority over the earth what is what does paul say in the new testament satan is the god of this evil age satan is the controller now and the title deed was in adam's hand but that title deed was now lost from ad from man and goes back to the hands of the original owner not it doesn't go to satan it just simply goes back to the original owner but now it's uh under the authority of the evil one he rested it out of adam's hand for it for a season it's under the authority of the evil one and he's the elohim over the earth so what is redemption going to do for us what is that going to accomplish romans 8 18-23 in in adam's fall it wasn't just that adam sinned and he's he receives death but that death passes on all everyone after that receives death but not even just humans not even just his seed the entire creation and not just this earth the entire universe is now made subject to this vanity for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature or the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature or the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body so we're waiting for that time where we have a new body whereas the sons of god are fully manifested in their glorified body in the full redemption now we have the first fruits of it now we have a down payment of the holy ghost in us which gives us access to the powers of redemption right so let's read let's read in uh adoption 1960 brother says but in genesis 2 and he made man he said i am yahweh jehovah what did it mean i'm the all-existent one who's created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine glory why jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur god because he is father god and he made a man an amateur god so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family el ella elohim now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family now god made man to be the predominant over all the earth he had dominion and the earth was man's dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was god over the earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak in it this and it would be so oh there he is god jehovah the one who once existed in itself existent but now exists with his family and his little ones with him now this may choke you to death but did you know that men are that are sons of god are amateur gods how many ever knowed that how many knows that jesus said so jesus said did you know your law itself says that you're gods and if you call them gods which god said in genesis 2 they were gods because they were had full dominion over of the world he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and satan took it over but brother we're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of god will be manifested when the power of god will walk out and will take every power that satan's got away from him yes sir amen amen so redemption has a purpose we lost our elohim ship our godship we lost that position that authority but the blood of christ what does it do it washes us it cleanses us it it's that clorox bleach that brother branham talks about in the sermon the in the breach and in god hiding himself in simplicity this uh another quote from adoption he's the logos that went out of god that is true that was the son of god then he made man that little god he said if they call those who are the who the word of god came to the prophets if they call them gods who the word of god came to and god said so himself that they were gods he told moses i made you a god and made aaron your prophet amen i may act like i'm a religious crank but i'm not oh when your eyes can come open and see those things all right he made man a god a god in his domain and his domain goes from c to c from shore to shore he has the control of it and when jesus came being the one god without sin he proved it when the winds blowed he said peace be still amen when the tree said no man eat from me verily i say unto you you that's little gods if you'll say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you said go right back to genesis to the original what is it now the world and nature is groaning crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of god when true sons born sons filled sons speak and their word is backed i will believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain let it be so again like i said the fullness of that is going to be in the millennium when we have a new body operating in that full authority taking dominion that was taking the dominion that was lost but but we have the first fruits of the spirit right now we have that authority now in a sinful world in a fallen world to do what to speak to speak not speak whatever we want jesus said i don't do anything unless the father shows me first he says i don't do my own will but the will of him that sent me he made you and i to be little elohim on this earth number one is what do we do we create the atmosphere around us right by this everyone does that whether you're saved or not saved if but as sons of god we have a greater supernatural power that we can create an eternal authority around us a a eternal atmosphere around us that changes lives again we're not to receive worship we're not forgiving people's sins that's not what we're talking about when we're talking about being elohim it means we are simply a vessel as i said before a vice regent you know what a vice region is when the king is not here he puts a vice he's off on on a trip i'm not saying god's off on a trip but humanly speaking when when the king is away he appoints a vice regent to rule in his place and whatever he says that's it that's the fi that's the final right but he doesn't rule by his own idea his own will he receives instructions from the king and we serve an invisible king right and he wants to flow himself from that invisible realm those invisible dimensions through us to this world so we look we look at this further i want to grab the quote from that i have here yeah um from faith is the substance after the days of that came along jesus he was god's end sign and he was lifted up he ascended on high and gave gifts back to men and men received the baptism of the holy spirit to made to be made deity himself amen he says no that didn't set very good but that's according to the word a man or woman that's born to the spirit of god is a part of god amen your sons and of god and daughters of god didn't jesus say isn't it written in your scriptures your laws that your gods not to forgive sins now but your sons and daughters of god limited to your faith what is he saying we operate in this position what by faith what is faith something that you work yourself into something that you force no faith is a revelation so you're operating under submission to the one that calls you and second peter verse 1 chapter 1 verse 4 is where we'll finish today ii peter 1 verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust we are partakers of divine the divine nature partakers speaks of being a participant so we participate or we share is another way to say it we share in what the divine nature so what does that mean what does divine mean it's it's uh similar to the word god in uh in greek it has a small difference instead of theos which is the regular greek word for god it's theos so there's an i added in the middle middle and it when it that i is added it means god-like or like god and then where it says nature it's the word phusis which means germination or expansion or natural production so what is it what is peter saying right there we share in the god like uh uh uh descent right what does brother branham say you're from the genes of god so if if birds produce birds and cows produce cows what does god produce divine beings gods no we're not objects of worship we're not forgiving sins we're simply vessels for god to work it's another way of saying you're sons and daughters of god but it's a it's a it's a more clear it's a deeper i should say understanding of that that we have his name it's not merely well you be you're like the denominational say you're adopted sons of god in other words you weren't sons of god but he comes and he says oh look these poor people they don't they're just orphans they don't have anybody i'm going to come and make them my sons that's not the picture of the scripture because you are sons he sends forth the spirit of his son into your heart well by you cry abba father you receive the spirit because you are sons if you're not a son you're not going to receive the spirit and why are you a son because you have the divine germination in you you have the divine seed in you the very life of god is in you and that me that doesn't just mean something static that means something that's moving that's that's uh that's uh life is not stagnant life moves works operates it's not just hearing the word it's hearing it and then living it or another word say becoming the word right the word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming word amen let's pray and stand if you would heavenly father we just come to you now lord and we're so thankful for your beautiful word how it's been unfolded to us today in such a humble way lord but such an incredible way through your prophet things that the world is denominational systems are scared of and run away from or or refuse to comment about lord you've you've made them plain and clear to us through that ministry of malachi 4 and we're so grateful for that lord we're we're partakers of what that prophet has brought lord and we're blessed we ask your blessing upon the worship upon the preaching of the word may your name be lifted up and glorified we ask in jesus name amen god bless you
