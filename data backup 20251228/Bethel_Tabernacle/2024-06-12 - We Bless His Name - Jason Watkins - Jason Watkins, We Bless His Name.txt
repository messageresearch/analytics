might think I'm crazy amen God bless you we're happy to have you in God's house tonight we're going to invite you to the 103rd Psalm amen Psalms 103 we're just going to take this one verse and we're going to let you be seated and uh we'll start right in so so tonight surprise surprise surprise I'm not preaching on these wind but we it'll be right back front and center on Sunday praise the lord well it won't be me brother R brother Ronnie long is preaching here for a Sunday morning so we haven't uh had brother Ronnie in a little bit we remember him well from his last visit here really really fine brother and we're looking forward to the ministry amen praise God Psalms 103 and verse one now see I I don't have to start a timer so I'm good y'all y'all can trust me amen praise the lord we won't hold you long it's a Wednesday night Psalms 1031 you can read it with me bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name isn't that beautiful bless His holy name his very name is Holy the Bible declares that in so many places tonight I had to pick and choose just a few uh to read read it from and that's one of them bless the Lord all my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name I'm taking a a title tonight bless his name let's pray father the hour has arrived and the time has come Lord where the word must go forth the people have gathered Lord you know your servant has prepared before you and waiting on you Lord and father this thought for a number of days has been churning in my mind and Lord now the songs have been sung all things are ready hearts are prepared Lord now we're inviting you to come take your position as our teacher and Minister tonight break the bread of life to us Lord we're hungry and we're needy Lord this is a dark hour and we need to see you clearly father so I commit myself into your hands come Lord won't you and just father just be who you are if you'll do that Lord then everything will be just fine so we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you you can be seated amen you can be seated Daniel oh you are seated oh okay yeah okay praise the Lord happy to have him and paage here paage with us tonight amen so sister Deborah's called in some reinforcements amen praise the Lord all right Psalms 103 I just want to read that for you again bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name so I'm I'm taking the title tonight we bless his name and there's a number of songs that we actually sing along those lines we bless your name I bless your name I'll speak of those in just in a moment but I think that it is important to just acknowledge that it's not just his name but it's His holy name amen because you know as brother brandham talks about you know when he was dealing with his Brethren there and some of them trinitarians and some of them Oneness and Jesus only and he said you know um you baptize in the name of Jesus only and you think that you're better off than someone baptizing in titles Father Son and Holy Ghost and he said ' but you say 'well we baptize in the name of Jesus only and he said' but he said Jesus who he said I am personally acquainted with several jesuses we would say that's Jesus because that's that's the way it's spelled in Spanish but brother Brandon was meaning that he personally was acquainted with people around the world many of them who had the name Jesu s so you know maybe we need to be a little more clear uh whose name it is we're baptizing we're not just baptizing in the name of Jesus but we believe that there was a man by the name of Jesus of Nazareth and we believe that he was the Christ the son of the Living God and that's what Peter believed and that's what we believe amen and I think I like to make that distinction that that's exactly what we believe because that's what Believers believe it's what Christians believe around the world I have I have been abroad I was I was in Syria and winding my way back through old Damascus some of those narrow streets and we encountered a group of people very fine people and they were witnessing and they were singing songs they had a very Godly appearance a very Godly humble way about them uh but they were Disciples of John and that blew that blew my mind I thought wait I didn't know there was such a thing and there you find that of all the Disciples of John of John the Baptist that we find you know John and Andrew of all of his disciples were the only ones who ended up taking off after Jesus and so so you say well what happened to all the rest of them you remember the disciples you know even came across a group of people and they were preaching in jesus' name but they weren't with Jesus and so you know you have all of these various things that are close they're approximations they're near to the truth they're close to to the truth but you know I I I just I'm just this way if God has a truth then I want to believe that truth I want to believe the truth not just a truth but I want to believe the truth and so we realize okay brother I might I might hit a high gear and hit two of them yeah amen praise the Lord now I also might preach longer and it'll be your fault okay you heard it all right so we find that that you know in the day and hour that we live in you have plenty of things that are close uh and and I'm not here to disparage something that's close Jesus said of that group who were who were not with him and he said well anybody who you know who's who's for me could hardly be against me so just leave them alone let them do what they're doing but follow thou me and I just I like to know that I've heard his voice today to say follow thou me say well but you weren't you weren't there 2,000 years ago but I have his word and that's exactly what I'm following and I don't allow any man-made interpretation to pull me off of any standard that he laid I like the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth no matter what it calls for in my life no matter what I might have to surrender give up walk away from change have changed for me I just say Lord by whatever means necessary amen I was walking in the bridge today saying that to the Lord I I said Lord I want to be like job I want to I I don't want to necessarily want job's sufferings but I do want to have this testimony that I know my redeemer liveth and I know that on that day I will see him and I said Lord I want to see you I know you live I know you're alive and I know you're in your word and I know you have an exact word for this day as you have had in every day and I want to have that exact word I don't want an approximation I don't want something close I don't want something that's almost there I want something that spot on the whole word of God as Paul said I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of God the popular gospel song that was actually inspired by this psalm uh that we read in Psalms 1031 bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name according to uh him.org gospel musician Andre Crouch who we most of us would be familiar with composed a song for The Familiar opening phrase of Psalms 103 uh one of the most uh and in fact is the most loved Old Testament hymns about God's love and compassion for his people people is the 103rd Psalm and it goes on to say Crouch retains the conventional Hebrew custom of addressing oneself as my soul and the phrase he goes on in his song you've heard it we sing it bless the Lord all my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name and then we you know come around the corner and we and we follow the music for he has done great things you remember he has done great things and so so we realize that he has done great things then becomes a summary reference to all of the uh of the might to all of of all the good that God has done down Through the Ages and and this was what Andre Crouch wanted to keep pure uh to show exactly how he felt about this 103rd Psalm that it was a reference to all the mighty deeds and all of the compassionate Deeds of the Lord that are in fact described in Psalms 103 had we kept reading the the characteristics of God uh concerning God forgives and God heals and God provides and God redeems and God is gracious and God is patient we got any Witnesses tonight and God is loving and God is just all good things come down from above from the Father of Lights amen amen so I think that that just as as David was careful to say to us that it's not just his name but it's His holy name and I think that we ought to have a a loud voice in this day to say we're not just here preaching his word but we have the full measure of his word we have all the word we have the original word we don't just have a word we don't just have uh Theory and Doctrine and beliefs but we actually have a living presence amen and that's the other half that so often uh can be missing brother Bram talks about how I think it was India or it might have been South Africa I can't remember for sure when he's he's there and he's he's talking about a a minister there a very fine man very Godly man and he was ex extremely sincere almost sincere all if if you can imagine this almost sincere to a fault because and you'll understand a little bit more as I explain it as brother Ram told the story that this man had you know such a a singular vision for winning souls and he had been there for 30 30 years and he had won one soul and when he when brother brandham is standing on the platform and here comes someone up and the discernment begins to work and brother Brandon begins to see done into their life and that minister is standing behind him on the platform and brother Brandon can hear him starting to say under his breath oh lord for that Soul oh for that Soul oh for that soul and he was sincere he meant it he's weep yeah he's broken and and so brother brandom is going to use that story to illustrate as Paul said I came not to you in word only amen but I came also in power and demonstration because it was the power and demonstration of the word that that man was missing and was his mind was not open to he was very sincerely trying to save Souls where there's no fault you can place in that but you know but he was missing the other part and here he is 30 years and he's got one and brother brandham in a matter of minutes has thousands amen amen and and and the prophet turns and and he he comes from Beyond that he says God never called a man to work in the field for 30 years to gain One Soul amen you understand so so you can have ever so good of an intention you can be ever so sincere your motive and your objective can be spot on but you need the whole councel of God you need all the word of God I'm so glad God has sent in this hour the entire Council not only the correct teaching but power and demonstration I'm here to tell you there is power and demonstration in the message that we follow and there's nothing like it for breaking the grip of the devil in people's lives he has done great things Isaiah 57 and 15 let's have that one sister Esther wasn't sure if that was Zoe Zoe's right there sister Esther okay uh Isaiah 57:15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones so this is a holy God who has a holy name who lives in a holy place who I would I think it's fair to say he loves Holiness we sing the song in prisoners chains with bleeding Stripes Paul and Silas prayed that night and in their pain began to sing their chains were loosed and they were free amen I bless your name name I bless your name I give you honor I give you praise I suggest to all of us here today and this is really the the Crux of my burden and I'm surprised that I'm coming to it so quickly but I just can't stay back from it I'm going to suggest to us all today that there truly is no better way to bless his name name His holy name than to live a holy life that's my premise that's the burden of my heart that's the burden of the word for the people in this service in this building over the internet and whoever might hear it at a different time there is truly no better way to bless His holy name than to live a holy life amen a holy life for him whose very name is Holy is that asking too much no is that an infringement upon your rights is that a burden is that a trifle that we're too busy and we and we're you know and it might cost us too much I'm here to tell you sing you bless his name but if you really want to bless his name his name is Holy and you bless his name by allowing his holy life to make you holy no wonder as we were talking about last Sunday he was back in the eternities as a lamb interceding we we talked about that a little bit how that we we were actually concluding there and again I'm not preaching on that tonight but I just by stir you up by way of remembrance that I said to you he was interceding from the eternities well where else would he be interceding because the Bible say that in his suffering he would see his seed and where did he first see you and I in the eternities AM we made the point that the that the eternities are not a memory lane for his family it's not a museum it's not a shrine where he goes through and looks at all his great Champions uh the eternities is where the more real of his family exist and that's you and that's me absolutely friends there's there is a more real version of me than me there's a more real version of you than you Hallelujah there's a version that was with God long before you were here and you'll go back to that version again Hallelujah a different version that he sees of me he sees it as me so I come back to my question I come back around I may come to it several times tonight I want it to penetrate deeply in your heart and Minds tonight would there be a better way to bring honor to his word than to be transformed by the renewing of your mind by the word a little more and a little more and a little more every day you want to say that to the Lord today Lord a little more today a little more tomorrow a little more the next day I want to get more and more like you I want to come more more into that image bring me this day a little closer to the image that you saw of me in the eternities yes Lord I'm here to tell you something friends that transforming power is found in the exact same place and in the exact same way as it was when it appeared in Genesis it was God's spoken word of command we were you know we've been teaching about how that the that the new bir birth brings a new birth nature and the nature of of course we know that the nature of sin remains in the flesh and in the spirit thank God I'm a Triune being Hallelujah that I know that sin remains in my flesh I get it I know I'm sorry it does in you too it hang it it's still in my spirit I still have to keep control of my conscience and my memory and my reasoning my my imaginations I'm sorry it's that way friends but we're going to get out of here one of these days we won't have to put up with it forever I'm already starting to the transition I've already been transformed by the power of the word of God don't tell me it's not for me it's changed my whole life God don't tell me you don't need it because you're not stronger than me I had to have it to get my nature transformed how you hope to do it see we're all in this thing together friends see so I I do have the nature of sin remaining in My Flesh and in my spirit but now my spirit is Under New Management there's a there's a new owner and he's got a different Vision he's got a different nature he's got a nature from above see above where good things uh come down where where from where come comes down all good things I want to say to you today nothing that raises up from this broken world is any good unless it's something God planted I don't care what it is how alluring how much you think you got to have it if God didn't plant it and it grew up out of this Earth it will kill you the only good things come down from above from the Father of Lights in whom is no Shadow or variableness no turning he's Dependable Rel reliable and trustworthy and honest and you can trust him with your very existence there's nothing more valuable than your Eternal destination amen you don't own any you will never own anything more valuable than that oh see when this Earth has gone to Ash and Cinder I'll still be alive I'm I'm going to be somewhere when this when this Earth is rocking on fire I will be somewhere I want to say Lord I want to be around your throne I I want to be in the bosom of Abraham I want to be where the redeemed are I want to walk among those that Joshua the high priest saw in Zechariah 3 he could see those great Champions walking around and he said all you got to do is keep my word and keep my judgments and I'll grant for you to walk around these that you see I want to make it friends I want to be there hallelujah amen so we f find then that this new nature fortunately it has direct access to the still Fallen flesh and spirit to bring it subject to the ways of the word and that is that is that is precisely why that is precisely why only the message of the hour even has the ability to fully accomplish redemption in the individual am see no one will ever say that I I shunned as Paul said in Acts 20 that I no one's ever going to say I son to declare the whole counsel of God you know and I can say as Paul went on to say if you drop on down around 30 some odd verse there Paul went on to say I cease not to warn every every man night and day with tears I want to say it again today as clear as I possibly can only the message of Malachi 4 carries redemption in it that's that's not my decision that's the word if if that wasn't true he wouldn't have needed to send him and and he didn't send him because because you know somebody thought it was a good idea he arrived because he got had promised that's what he would do and that's what he did people say to me what what is this thing you call a message I just say just what God promised not more than that it's just what God promised to do and he did it we have it see it has to have the message of the hour that's been true in every hour it has to have the message of any hour say why is brother Jason why is that true because the spoken word of God is the original seed that all life and all creation came from it's the only way the the original seed of life is the only way to get back to to from where we fell from Brother Bram made that constantly it's such a simple argument it it it it it Stupify the learned and the doctors of divinity and brother Brandon would just say know if if we if we broke everything by just denying one word how you ever hope to get back with a denial of 300 you know three four 500 Words and and only one word it only took one word unbelief of unbelief amen my goodness friends how else do you imagine God will have a kingdom of saints and all of them will have the nature that Jesus had if he doesn't have a word to accomplish that see because people will you know decide to do better you know because Humanity uh will collectively somehow determine to become better people you know I I I I I come back to my question again can anybody tell me a better way to bless His holy name than than to conduct ourselves in Holiness can anybody tell me if I was eoy this morning that that tonight Edy Smith he would say is there anybody in the building come on amen amen who can tell me a better way to bless His holy name than by allowing by you being willing and allowing his Holiness to live and move through you there's such a retreat of Holiness today and that's sad and that's not to be because he he didn't Retreat from being a holy God he doesn't Retreat from having a holy word there's no retreat of the Holy Ghost amen you understand he he's never going to have a different title than that Holy Ghost and and that's how brother Brandon would try to reason with those Pentecostal ladies who would come to church in a Sunday outfit but then be in their yard cut and their grass uh half-dressed and claim to be a Christian and and brother Brandon would he it go back to his little sassafras hillbilly Kentucky way and just ask a simple stupid question sister remember he's a holy Spirit not a filthy spirit I mean is that right or is that not right is that true or is that not true how can someone say I have the Holy Spirit and their life isn't holy amen that's right you know amen I would say today as we sing that song in prisoners chains I would say today that if you were in prisoners chains of the enemy tonight bless His holy name and knowing fully that you have committed yourself to a holy life and and and that would be then blessing His holy name would be a really good way to get out of those chains I would say it again tonight I don't care what kind of chains of the enemy you might be in tonight start blessing His holy name only make sure that your heart condemns you not that you know that there's a life embedded behind that Holy Name see cuz I promise you that the devil will know if he needs to worry if you start blessing the the name of the Lord people do it all the time they start blessing the name of the Lord the devil's no more worried about that than anything sons of ska found that out the hard way am acts acts 1913 to16 then certain of the Vagabond Jews Exorcist took upon them to call over for them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth and there were seven sons seven sons of onekea a Jew and chief of the priest which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you and the men and the man in whom the evil spirit was leapt on them and overcame them this is seven on one and and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded amen sometimes we get our toet tapping when our hands clapping and we we we we we love that song Bless That Wonderful Name of Jesus we sing it here brother Tony rocks the house with that Bless That Wonderful Name of Jesus Bless That Wonderful Name no other name I know amen there's power in the name of Jesus there's healing in the name of Jesus there's saving in the name of Jesus there's Wonder In The Name of Jesus and that's all true that's all true all of those things are true but do you but do you know by experience that those things are true or do you just sing it is it just a song you just memorize lyrics Bless That Wonderful Name name of Jesus man I love it there's healing in the name of Jesus there's healing in the name and we go on there's saving in the name there's Wonder in the name and you're jumping up and down and dancing and singing and I promise you the devil's jumping up and down dancing and singing too so the question becomes have you memorize lyrics that are even true lyrics but do you know by experience that those things you're singing about are true say well I just believe them I I'm glad thank you but have you experienced them have you experienced that there's Wonder in the name have you experienced that there's saving in the name have you experienced that there's healing in the name I'm here to tell you I've experienced all of those things I know he's [Applause] real Now watch how they knew it in on where we're reading in Acts 19 it goes on from the sons of ska watch this now after the devil beat him to death and sent him running naked verse 17 and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified now I mean it almost sounds like wow this is a tragedy these guys got hurt they were trying do a good deed and everybody's rejoicing they weren't just rejoicing watch now that when it talks about fear don't think that that's a fear like brother R said that does fear of God's not fear he'll hurt you he's a loving father see it's not fear that he'll hurt you it's it's you have a fear that you love him and respect him so much he's done so much for you that you're afraid so much you'll do the least little thing that would bring disgrace on him the fear the Lord the reverence of the Lord the admiration of the Lord that I just I just want to be so careful because his name is so precious and he paid such a heavy price Lord don't let me do anything oh I would to God that people would have it that way Lord don't let me do anything let my life be clean let my conversation be just let my actions be true Lord let let my reputation be a reflection of your reputation see and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling in Ephesus and fear fell on them all in the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified now look what else it did and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds people started repenting people started taking ownership I need to be more spiritual I need to be a better Christian I need to pray more I need to I need to love more I need to come to church more I God loves a contrite we read that God loves a contrite heart somebody that'll say I've been wrong but I don't want to stay wrong and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds 19 many of them also which used curious Arts brought their books together and burn them before all the men these were people who were you know you know living in church one way and in their home another way and they counted the price of them and found it 50,000 pieces of silver sold mightily grew the word of God and prevailed all of that happened because seven sons of onekea got got uh uh humiliated by one devil possessed man because the people learned a lesson that you can't go around uh proclaiming and blessing the name of God if you don't have the god inside your life the devil's not afraid of that and you go to challenge him and you'll have a rough go of it but I love the fact that when I know that my redeemer liveth and I know the power of God is in his word and I know I'm a Believer God then I'm going to tell you something friends it doesn't matter what comes into your home what comes into your family you have authority in the name of Jesus Christ hallu Luke chapter 1 couple of verses there Luke chapter 1 will'll catch verse 49 and 5050 for he that is mighty hath done to me great things that beautiful and holy is his name and his Mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation my look at the promise of that give me 49 again sister Esther for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name verse 50 uh and his Mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation so it doesn't even matter how many generations have passed since Luke wrote that and I'm believing it amen that Mercy just passes from generation to generation to generation that Holy Name passes from generation to generation that Holy people with Holy Faith and the Holy Ghost passes from generation to generation amen look at what they conclude in Revelation 15 Revelation 15 trying to trying to get done not hold you too long give me about 15 more minutes and we'll start taking up prayer request Revelation 15 let's start at verse two and catch 2 three and four and I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the Beast and over his image and over his Mark now look at all this there's his image there's his Mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God in the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints who shall not fear thee Oh Lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest 144,000 standing here and the song of Moses and there but now they become Believers in Messiah cuz that was that was always the law of Moses anyway the law of Moses wasn't sini that was the People's Choice the law of Moses was here that the Lord shall raise up a prophet like me from among your brethren and whoever won't hear him will will'll be cut off that was the law of Moses see and so that's why Joshua could cross over the the the Jordan into the promised land and say remember the law of Moses what crossing of the Holy Ghost and remember Mount SII see so that's that that jams up you can't make it say that so so that's why brother Brandon went back to say the law the law that came out of siia that wasn't go that was the People's Choice brother brandham said it was the most rational it was his way of meaning irrational thing they ever done he said they had a prophet they had the pillar of fire they had the Brazen serpent they had all of this and they chose a law see so that was that was man's doing it was not God's doing God had brought him out under the pillar of fire and led by a prophet under grace and so so we find out then that they're standing here uh and I saw as it were uh the sea of glass this is multitudes of people mingled with fire see so theyd come up and there's judgment it's mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the Beast and over his image this is how they came up out of the Great Tribulation and I'm here to tell you there there was a a lot to avoid at the end time and people don't they don't assess that correctly they don't weigh that there's a lot to be avoided at the end time and they were able to they got victory over the Beast and over his image see so it wasn't it wasn't just the spirit of antichrist but it was actually over the mechanical image that he built and the prophet said that's a World Council of churches that's organized religion that's denominationalism and it doesn't even have to be a quote unquote denomination it still can be just organized in a an organized independent movement yesen you know you if you go over here to our mega church they don't they don't believe they're a denomination if you ask them are you denomination they say no we're independent but they're part of an association that still has a board and still has the whole hierarchical uh setup of man and still denies the word and still uh hatches them out of Dallas Theological Seminary and I'm here to tell you something friends God has called us to more than that thank God he's called us to a higher order and I and I don't just want something that's close to the highest order I want the highest order I want to be like here I want to avoid the spirit of the Antichrist I want to avoid his image I want to avoid his Mark I want to avoid the number of his name there's there's a lot of peril perilous times if for no other reason than all of the pitfalls that are going to take mankind to his destruction blessed be the name of the Lord for the word of this day Hallelujah friends where would you go what would you do what would you tell your family how could you get them home oh my I think about it I shiver I say Lord God let me double my effort I want to try to tell everybody I can even if they don't want to hear it I want to tell it to them anyway warning them with tears as Paul said day and night with tears who shall not fear thee verse four oh Lord and glorify thy name for thou art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest you know it's interesting that that you know brother Brandon would try to you know as every Prophet would do so many prophets were always you know mistakenly the people would mistakenly you know alter their position and you know we found John trying to worship them and and even even you know the Peter and standing there in the gate beautiful and Peter and John and them they tried to worship them you remember that they tried to worship Paul you remember that I mean it's not unusual that that great men of God they they they try to worship them they try to treat them as gods they mankind intrinsically knows there's something higher than than him and so as soon as he sees you know the you know remember when Pharaoh when Pharaoh saw Joseph he said you know where we could search the whole world but where are we going to find anyone with the spirit of the Gods any more than this guy amen you know and and they and they were and then Daniel there they built a statue to Daniel and told the whole nation you got to bow to it and worship him see so it's not unusual for these kinds of things to happen but you know but but as a prophet would describe it he would talk about how that that you know he he said I am not he he had to he had to make that statement I am not he and said it in that almost like a weird way like what kind of talk is that I am not he but he's he's got to be a prophet he's got to be clear he would say I am not he see and then he would talk about the pillar of fire the of fire is not he it's the anointing that that veils the theophany it's just a God in a form see and so so and then another time he would come along and he would say I am not the son of man amen I am a son of man revealing the son of man there's only one the son of man there's only one he see and so but but yet a prophet would come down and talk about Adam and we showed you last Sunday how that Adam you know being the first wheat and Jesus being the second Adam had come back to wheat again except a corn of wheat die so now it has went from seed to seed and we're being restored back to that he said Adam was actually an amateur God see he had power of creation uh in his word and he he said you know and and God didn't even make the Earth you know for himself to rule he built the god rules the heavens and the universe he built the Earth for man to rule this is all part of God's expression I don't want to get into the trenches of it tonight because I'm I'm just trying to preach a simple Wednesday night sermon but but as a man you know I I I can say to you tonight I could just stand up here and go I'm not him right amen and everybody needs to have that humble opinion and say I'm not him see but I was buil In His Image see and that makes me in the order with Adam with the potential to be an amateur God Amen see now not one you would worship because there's only one when when the trumpet sounds and the King leaves the throne every knee shall bow and worship Him amen so this is why Jesus would say the Bible would say of him that he thought it not robbery to be equal with God now not equal to God that's something different that could be a second a separate thing just equal to him but he's not equal to him he's equal with him in other words he is him there's no difference in him and him they're the same him they're just in a different form see and so he thought it not robbery to be considered equal with God he didn't mind he didn't mind when the Rich Young Ruler came and called him good he he didn't mind being called good but he would use that at that moment he would use it as what we often call today a teachable moment for that young man not only for that young man but for the whole crowd gathered around him for the disciples who were who were at his sight in fact is the whole world this is a lesson for the whole world this a lesson for you and I tonight see teaching that he was none other than God himself standing in human flesh a he was literally a perfection of the son of man Ministry the word made flesh and he says to him why do you call me good see he's trying to he's trying to get that young man to come on with that Revelation come onen you you just ran up here and called me good now hold on let's just see if you really know what you're saying see so why do you call me good seeing that there is only one truly and fully good and that's God Amen and yet you're calling me that see so are you young man acknowledging that I am he is that what you're saying what about you mixed crowd some of you gathered around me for the fishes and the loaves do you believe that I am he what about you my disciples who are sitting here recording my words and recording my actions what about you tonight bethl Tabernacle What About Us in this day who do you say this is hallelujah do you do you believe if he says I am he say I say Amen if he says this is he I say amen hallelujah I'm a Believer in who he is and he is Holy and his name is Holy and I believe in being holy Hallelujah we who are alive in remain do we see him today it's a really penetrating question do you really see him today as more than just a a good man amen or just a mere Prophet now there's hardly no Christian of any Christian Church who would say of course I see him as more that's unbelievers think that well you know those unbelievers might not be as far off as you think they are because here here he is and what do you say of this am see do you do you take the message of Malachi 4 and think that it's just a man's opinion do do we look at it like that do we believe it was just a good man who yeah he was a prophet and yeah he he brought some word and had some Supernatural That's that is so far removed from the description of why Malachi 4 would come he wouldn't come to entertain people he wouldn't come to for people to have a smorgus board of truth that you can buffet style it and pick whatever you want he came before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord the whole world is doomed to destruction and Malachi 4 is just a temporary judicial injunction it's the it's the little it's the that little that little space of time that brother Bram talks about between the sixth and seventh trumpet and the sixth and seventh seal that little interval of time he's got to he's got to stop the you know he's got to stop the woes otherwise it's going to sweep the Earth of humanity it's got to go in Pace the gospel is going to go to the Jews the Gentiles are going to be cleaned off but before all of that can happen I got to stop it hold it I'm going to this a temporary injunction what are you going to do I'm going to drop down quickly I'm going to send Elijah with a message and it's going to turn the heart to the children back to the faith of the fathers and I'm going to be able to get them out of here and then it can go on forward and that's where you and I are tonight Hallelujah friends so do we see him in his word today not yesterday do you see him in the message today are his words life to you friends be honest are his words life I'm talking about the life of a Kian I'm talking about the the word of God that came through an office and God proved it or are they life to [Applause] you see do you sit at his feet daily do we come on Amen do we are we willing to be like the disciples and sit at his feet daily and ask him say Lord teach us your ways they went to him Lord teach us how to pray teach us what we should do teach us how to do this and he sat down often times on the side of a hill and just began to open the word of God and begin to teach them I just say Lord God oh oh let your life live in me teach me your ways teach me your word you're holy I want to be holy you're pure I want to be pure you're true I want to be true you've sent a word I want to be a believer Hallelujah I want to be a believer of all the things that God has said in this day is that where your heart is friends is that are you you know who you are you're those who are alive and remain Hallelujah to the coming of the lord we didn't think we'd be here this long guess what we are and guess what he's still coming and I'm still going Hallelujah I'm still a Believer I still know that on that morning when we go up to his house what a day what an hour that's what I want to be a part of friends oh that's what he you know I I I have to ask myself I I was thinking to myself this you know not only do I sit at his feet daily not only do I ask him for his ways not only do I want him to to live his life through me but you know does our lives appear as a shining light in this Dark Hour ask yourself that question deeply now does your life appear in this desperate hour as a shining light to a darkened world that that's what he was that that's what he did what about you what about me amen God bless you Amen brother Kenny bring your team back it's 8:30 I'm G to stop we're going to take up prayer request stand up with me friends we say that we want to bless his name we sing songs and declare we bless your name you know know and I mean you you sing that with people standing around you you sing that out loud with people standing near you and you know do do do you do we realize that it's that it's no small thing to bless his name let me just make these closing comments to you you can play some sister Ru as brother K chooses I just want to say this it is no small thing it's not trivial to even to sing I bless your name do do we do you do I you're you realize that when you're blessing his name do you realize that when you're blessing his name that he inhabits the Praises of his people do you realize that when you're blessing his name you're calling down the attention of the creator of all living things in [Music] existence I'll tell you something friends cheap words spoken to a being so great are cheaper still I don't want my words to just be Hollow cheap words the lyrics of a song or the memory verse of a scripture I can read I want my life to match my song I

to be more oh God it's not all about doing more it's about being more and I pray you will help us tonight Lord you see the great desire of our heart tonight Lord this isn't the kind of sermon that reprimands anyone this is the kind of sermon that caes us to ask a deep burning question these are questions that are penetrating and we must we must stand in the presence of God and answer these questions within ourselves is my life worthy of the Gospel am I a light shining in a dark world is my token on display clearly seen by others when I lift my names to my my my voice to bless his name does my life match my blessing does my life address the person of God correctly is there any doubt in his mind who I'm singing to am I so distracted by the world that my worship and my praise is just memory it's just muscle memory it's just tradition Lord there's I don't believe in my heart there's one person in here tonight that that that would say oh I'm comfortable with that we're not comfortable with that we want more of you Lord so I commit it to you tonight I commit this strange little sermon Lord you dropped on my heart a couple days ago and I've pondered it Lord and it's meant
