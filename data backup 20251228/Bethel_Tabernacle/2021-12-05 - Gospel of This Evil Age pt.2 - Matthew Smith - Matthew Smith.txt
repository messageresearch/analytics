[Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] all right good morning everybody uh let's all uh stand and read our scripture here see all right let's um let's turn to um ecclesiastes 1 9. everybody got it i'll give you all right so um let's let's read here starting at verse nine um the thing that has been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be and there is no new thing under the sun is there anything whereof it may be said see it is new it has been already of old time which is before us there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after bow our hearts dear lord ask that you bless this scripture that we've read and blessed the hearts of the people as you be with us the sunday school and anoint my my lips that i would speak the things that the people need to hear i said not just be some information but they would be able to see what you need them to see in this father that you would nourish them spiritually has these things in jesus name amen y'all can be seated um i want to re read that from the new living translation um just because i think it's it phrases a little bit better um not necessarily better but in a more plain english that i liked a little bit more a little spoke a little more to me um it says history merely repeats itself it has all been done before nothing under the sun is truly new sometimes people say here's something new but actually it is old nothing is ever truly new oh we got the nlt on ah cool um we don't remember what happened in the past and in future generations no one will remember what we are doing now and i think that's really the whole theme of any of the sunday schools that from last week and and moving on into this week that really everything that we're seeing now in the in the world in politics in the developments in the religious world they've all been done before it's none of it's new and these things like i said last week it is just a it is the same spirit with a different coat of paint on it coming back around and we can see these things in the past um now with this this week what i want to do is um i understand there was some terminology that i used from last week um things like the word woke people a lot of people were like well scratching their head what in the world does that mean and i want to take some time to go into that and kind of explain the history of where this stuff came from um i remember i mentioned that um the the gospel coalition was putting out uh training on how to see the the scripture through foucault and dereda a lot of people have no idea what i what that what that is but event uh not this week but hopefully next time i'll be able to explain what that is and you can really understand just how dangerous that is to be accepting into the church and how that if you do that i mean it is literally completely i i used the term anti-christ before but really it's anti-scripture that it actually to believe the bible as an authority from god just falls apart if that's the road you want to go down um uh i also don't want to shy away from using some of the academic terminology i know people get scared with big words and i could break a lot of that down into really simple terminology and use simple terms but the problem is we live in a world where people have some really sinister intentions and they use that kind of terminology and if you don't know what it means they'll be speaking a different language and plotting your demise and you will have no idea what they're talking about and you won't see it coming a lot of times there's some really nasty things that they have put into the education system and nobody knew what they were talking about because they didn't take the time to learn the terminology and people like well i don't know what that means so i'm not going to think about it too much and then they end up allowing some really nasty things being taught in schools especially to kids i also think brother jason characterized it correctly when he said that this is really modern events made clear by prophecy um brother branham talked about a lot of this stuff that the way it would come down and what would happen and here it is um you and really you have to understand the history of where this stuff came from and that's why i'm going to go back and talk about that so i want to go back to um and and start with um what i'm calling well it's marxism karl marx back in wrote a book in 1848 called the communist manifesto now 1848 is like 20 years before the civil war right this is this is a long time ago back when nobody would have thought that our current politics would have applied at all like the things that we're seeing today what it's almost like they're such a different people back then how would they be struggling with things like you know the dissolving of christian society you know christian morality as a as a part of politics and yet it's there it's all there i mean marx was talking about this all the way back then and i want to talk about sort of the planks of marxism because marxism communism socialism they're all technically different things but you can pretty much interchange them for our purposes and so last week when i read from the the uh theology of a social gospel they're talking about how they're emerging the gospel with socialism it's another way of saying emerging with marxism so you kind of want to know what marx taught so you know what the exactly what they were trying to put together and why it's so insidious and why we can see that coming back in the church today and i know it might kind of come off as a little bit dry and a little bit boring nobody wants to go back to history class but we're going to talk about a little bit um i ran a lot of this stuff by katie my wife she gets to hear all of this stuff ahead of time and get all the trial runs and um you can i guess she told me she's like you know the more you go into this the more you realize it seems kind of dry on the surface but once you get into it it you can really see how it applies today so please stay with me and try to pardon me if i can make it a little bit boring um so the uh a lot of people think that marxism or communism is about money it's not um on the surface it is but ultimately what marxism was about was the destruction of any sort of leadership structure or hierarchy of authority that's what it was about if you go read the communist manifesto he talks about this how really society is built into these hierarchies and we need to knock it all down but the way to knock it down is through money because he believed that the moving of money through the economy is how everyone patterned everything in their lives so if you knock down the monetary system knock down the economy everything else follow suit um really what he was against was headship and we'll get into that a little bit later when i'm going to read some of the quotes from there so you can really see what he's talking about um but really it's based it's based on resentment it's based on being being bitter that your life isn't as awesome as it somebody else's and so you want to burn the whole world down so that you can build your own kingdom out of the ashes that's what it's about and um [Music] uh the other couple core things is you need to know that mark's taught that the whole world um uh hang on let me share there's all these uh like i said the sort of the products of the economy and capitalism uh and he believed things like the family religion um politics all of it and he mentioned specifically family and religion these are products of the economy and so if you flatten the economy you're going to flatten the family and religion and everything else and it also puts this divides society into into social classes rich and poor he used the terms bourgeoisie and proletariat i'm going to mention those to you because it'll come back later um because anytime you hear people using that kind of terminology you know that they're talking they're directly referencing marx nobody but him kind of came up with that he's sort of the originator of that so when you hear people using that kind of terminology you know what they're actually talking about they're not talking about anything other than marx but based everything on a pressure of press classes a pressure class and a press class that there's this pressure class that's got everybody down and all societies built by the oppressors and us poor working-class people who are just you know trying to make our way through the through our lives or we gotta come together in sort of this class consciousness we've got to be aware of our class we're not an individual we're part of this greater collective of workers and we're going to overthrow the rulers and make our class the ruling class and all of society is is constructed to keep us down so i want to read a couple couple things here um i can skip over that um [Music] so when i mention things like the the product of the family um marx uh was a directly believed that the the what we would call the nuclear family needed to be destroyed that the you know the man the wife the kids sort of in a structure where the man is the head that needs to be flattened because like i said it's all about powers of hierarchy it's not about the economy he just thought that if you blew the economy up that's the social glue that holds all this together and the family would fall apart because he actually hated family and religion so um [Music] let's see here and he says but you say we destroy the most hallowed of relations when we replace home education by social and your education is not that also social and determined by the social conditions under which you educate by the invent intervention directed direct or indirect of society by means of schools etc the communists have not invented the intervention of society and education they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class so they believe that you they have to take over education to teach your kids how to be communists because that's literally what they believed and he goes on to talk about how uh that the communists wanted to create uh what they call a community of women that there would basically be no marriage and it's all free love right the women just sort of do whatever and they don't have to worry about taking care of the kids because the state's gonna take care of the kids um and the um so you can complete you can see how it completely destroys the family and it's completely against any sort of christian morality um now like i said this book was written in 1848 at first it was kind of cast by the wayside but over the course of 70 or so years people started taking it seriously and by 1917 you had the soviet revolution in russia where you had a bunch of communists take it seriously and put into practice you had a lot of other people throughout europe also kind of try to put into practice and um [Music] you got this something called what they call neo-marxism neo means new so it's a new version of marxism um and they talked about how marx was wrong because he was right in wanting to tear down all of society and burn it all down and destroy christian values because how else are we going to get to utopia except by destroying christianity as they put it um but they wanted to do it through social media because they believed that he was wrong and thinking it was about economics because they said well if he was writing about economics then according to marx everything all the stuff should have happened in the uk america france these are very rich countries but it happened in really poor economically broke russia and it didn't make any sense to them so they said well it's got to be the culture we have to annihilate the culture that means anything that holds the culture together has to be destroyed specifically christian values um and so you had two people specifically who really founded this one was guy named antonio gramsci and the other one was a guy by the name of george lucox graham she came with this thing called cultural hegemony and he said that he uh is the idea that the dominant culture was constructed to cause its subjects to conform to itself in order to keep them all in line with the will of the ruling class and he also believed that there were five pillars to culture that should all be broken down to collapse the cultural hegemony namely these were religion family education media and law and he believed that it was the job of the communist party in every country to infiltrate all those institutions and over time inject communist propaganda into them until they completely dissolve you can break them all down and then you can get your revolution because society has collapsed because as long as there's a social glue holding everyone together no one's going to be bitter at each other and you can't use that bitterness to form a revolution right if everyone's happy and getting along you get no revolution right so um the um he also talked about things like that you know working-class people can only be properly educated by um uh other um working-class people that you can't have uh sort of wealthy intellectuals teaching them because they'll just teach them in ways that prop up the intellectual's own culture um and this is actually uh a uh sort of the precursor to something that later became known as critical pedagogy we'll talk about that later but just so you're all aware um but the other guy who's a lot more important this guy by the name of george lucas he was a hungarian who in 1917 was the um the government of hungary became communist for about four months until the people of hungary had enough and threw them all out but in that four months georgia cox was named the people's commissar for education and culture and under his one of his big programs was the institution of mandatory sex education in the schools um he's the very first as far as i'm aware the very first person to ever institute mandatory sex education in the public education system and his explicit goal like this is what he said he was trying to do this isn't some uh nobody was reading into this this is what he said he was trying to do was specifically um he wanted to strip christian sexual ethics from the children um and he did this by showing them graphic sexual content he did this by uh teaching them that they should openly mock monogamy and traditional marriage that free love was the way to go and anyone who didn't want to have some sort of like free love society was just backwards and was being sexually repressed and anyone who's going to try to keep you under their boot of trying to keep you down and not let you have your free love society is just oppressive and not tolerant and you need to throw off their shackles and overthrow them and in a country in the 1917 hungary is very christian the older generations did not believe in in this free love thing they were deeply christian and was completely contrary to their values and he said that it was his goal to drive a wedge between the younger generations and the older generations so that the younger generations would be bitter and angry and resentful towards the older generations so that they would later become violent revolutionaries that he could use to overthrow the government this is and if you don't see that happening today turn on the news the amount of look into anything like the terms they'll use is things like comprehensive sexual education and social emotional learning seo is not necessarily um explicitly going down that road but if you if anybody has any kids in in sort of any sort of public education or or private school anything like that any institutional education system if they have sel courses on their course schedule be very careful about what those the school is teaching them because they will get into it later but the stuff that they are starting to come out with is this it is this exactly um they are they are uh directly using sex ed and as i said social emotional learning to bring in what is literally um propaganda communist propaganda to destroy the the sexual morality of children and i'm talking about ten-year-olds right because if you if you destroy their morality at that young of an age they're not going to grow up in anything anything more and so lou cox his whole aim he believed that if you wanted to bring a country to communism you had to completely rip any sort of christian culture out of it he explicitly said that christianity was an antidote to communism if a nation was christian they could not be communist if they were completely mutually exclusive one will destroy the other and if you're a communist obviously you know which one you want to win so you make sure you destroy that christian culture any means necessary if that means destroying the psychologies of children because they know that's what happens if you show children a bunch of graphic sexual content they said that kids who are exposed to extreme sexual content at a young age have a incredibly higher rate of schizophrenia bipolar disorder clinical depression all these things can be directly linked to the exposure of graphic sexual content at a young age and we are i mean there are uh various news stories of of places like um especially in california no no surprise there um that they're starting to implement this stuff where they're teaching children and they're using graphic sexual content to do it um like i said we'll get into that a little bit later i just want to cover this stuff because it's important these people um okay these people were the foundation for what we are seeing today because they would later go on to form something known as the frankfurt school because a lot of maybe you were wondering how does a couple of obscure intellectuals in hungary and italy have anything to do with american culture it's because um around 1919 like after luke cox got run out of hungary and uh gramsci he was italian he eventually also went to frankfurt as well and influenced them as well there was this um organization called the institute for social research in frankfurt germany and they were explicitly marxist they were communists and when lucox and gramsci came down they took them in they heard what they had to say and were absolutely enamored with it they said these guys know exactly what the right way to communism is we're going to use their teachings to implement communism across the world we're going to develop it into not just theoretical but practical applications we're going to learn how to implement the destruction of culture as a way to push in communist politics we're going to figure out ways of doing that practically speaking and um they create the frankfurt school they lived there for for from it was officially established in 1927 and by the 1930s the nazi party had come along in germany and the nazis didn't really like communists all that much so they ran them all out of germany and the frankfurt school packed up and came to the shores of america and i believe was princeton a university they set up there and that's how you get a bunch of fringe communist academics became integral to american education they were taken very seriously in america they had a lot of authority and they over the course of 50 years began to produce a lot of academics out of that school that went on to become professors at every university in america and by the 1950s or so you had herbert marcuzza who was one of those academics published a paper called um arrows in society where he is talking about how you basically need to rethink age of consent laws for children because this is a path to if you can sexualize children at a younger and younger age and lower the age of consent from 18 to 16 to 12 and start exposing children to this sort of sexual behavior at a very young age you can destroy christian morality in the nation and this is a path to communism this was well established by the 1950s and in the frankfurt school and it was well established in american academics and i think we're about out of time but that's the history of how you got this theory things like um uh just as in my last couple minutes i just want to make one last clarification i did use the terms critical race theory and critical gender theory last time the frankfurt school took the ideas of of um lucox and gramsci and several other people packaged them up into sort of one umbrella and said yes the way to communism to destroy the culture especially christian morality specifically because if you have a christian people they will be completely immune to this stuff so we have to find a way to just rip sexual or christian sexual morality away from the people any sort of christian morality at all take it all away because this is the path to communism and um they titled they packaged all up on umbrella called critical theory they're gonna be critical of the dominant culture and um this is and they is critical they have a larger bill of critical theory and then you underneath that you have things like critical race theory critical gender theory uh critical pedagogy which is a study of education um all these different critical theories and this is how you can take the principles of marx this is why i started with him the idea that everyone's an oppressor and oppressed everyone is you gotta you know fight the power destroy all of culture to promote this uh you know to lift up the oppressed people and um you can apply it to pretty much any different group of people that you want and because they believe that we're not just going to break society up along any one line we're going to attack every line of division that we can possibly find and blow society to pieces so that we can build our utopia and it all come down to the reality of it is human beings wanted to bring the millennium onto earth it's all utopian so they they can see that the world is broken they can see that the human beings are flawed and they want to bring they want they they have a deep longing for god and and what god can do for humanity but they don't actually have a means of doing it outside of politics because they can't conform to the word so they're going to do it through politics they're going to do it through ways that end up killing millions of people and um it's it's just the re-manifestation uh of that is what we're seeing today so uh i guess we're out of time thank you for being patient listening and dealing and going through our bit of a dry history class um and hopefully we'll get into a little bit more practical stuff next week and i can kind of tie it all together for you and make you see how it's really applies in the modern day so we'll stand and have a word of prayer lord ask thank you for this opportunity to speak to the people and hope that you would take my words and do something with it with them that they would be able to apply to their lives and see how the day is becoming evil and corrupt and ask that you would would take all my broken speaking and stitch it together into something beautiful ask these things in jesus name amen [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
