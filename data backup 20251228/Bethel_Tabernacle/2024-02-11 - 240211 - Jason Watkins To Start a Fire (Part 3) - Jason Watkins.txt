shake their hands say God bless you praise the god amen Hearts ready amen hope my mind is ready amen it's a lot and so I I didn't expect to have a third part to this series I turned into that I thought I finished it with the last installment but we're going to go with part three of to start a fire amen let's read from Luke chapter 3 I will um yeah let's just read this Luke 3 and beginning at verse three now this is the story of John the Baptist all right you know verse one and verse two deals with who was in charge of the government what was going on and who was Caesar and who was King and all that and it's uh coming to John verse three and he came into all the country round about Jordan the country about Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straight every Valley shall be filled and Every Mountain and Hill shall be brought low that's pretty descriptive would you agree and yet nothing like that happened look at it again every Valley shall be filled and every mountain and Hill shall be brought low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth I tell you um you know he he's quoting the Old Testament Prophet who obviously must have been a false prophet because none of this happened like like you would think amen praise the Lord now breathe just breathe you'll be okay all right it's all good amen praise the Lord verse six and All Flesh shall see the salvation of God then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him old Generation of Vipers who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Ahab let me read that let that verse again verse 8 don't just come to church and say you're a message believer and don't just come in and pretend to be one of God's family don't begin to say within yourselves well I'm elected God is able to raise up of stones children to Abraham you need to come with repentance and show meat fruit of repentance that's why you come to church man verse n and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is heun down and cast into the fire the Old Testament is replete with examples of trees being symbolic of humans amen amen David said I'm an aloe tree I'm a palm tree you know about the trees in the Garden of Eden one was Christ and one was Satan right all right so um verse 10 and the people ask him saying what shall we do then he anth and said unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and him he that hath meat let him do likewise in other words don't keep your your your blessing of God in the new birth to yourself amen we share the the blessing of God don't we then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him Master what shall we do he said unto them exact no more than that which is appointed you and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do see everybody had something to do the lesson is when you're born again you got something to do now you got a mission now you're somebody see now you're actually living brother Ram says before the New Birth you're just dying amen am amen UAH you're GNA see here in a minute how the Holy Spirit instigated that conversation last night amen you're gonna see it just in a minute again verse 14 and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages so the gospel changes your life it doesn't leave you like it did you agree and as the the people were in expectation and can I can I just interrupt myself and and say that please realize you're reading the ministry of Elijah and Elijah's Ministry was that the Holy Ghost changes your life and you can't say I'm a Christian without being unless you actually live like a Christian and for that kind of approach the people of Elijah's day the king the government everybody hated him so oh no they loved him they killed him for the same reason they hated the tishbite for the same reason that they hate the Elijah of this day because it would not walk among those systems and just leave them like they were it would blow them up right amen all right and the people verse now watch verse 15 and the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of John whether he were the Christ or not John answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water now I'm coming to my title see to start a fire and today I'm going to take a subt a subtitle starting and finishing with fire amen right and John answered verse 16 saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his Garner but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable First Kings chap 10 1 verse if they can just put it on the screen you won't have to race there in your Bibles we're just going to catch one verse First Kings 10:27 and the King made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones and Cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the veil for abundance amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated amen praise the Lord amen been enjoying this fine Spring weather coming in amen I I thought to myself my goodness winter seems to be gone already amen so uh I I tell people all the time when they ask me I get asked two questions what what kind of weather do y'all have and uh what what do you do about those terrible hurricanes that come through and I said well the hurricanes are the easiest part and they're shocked I say that's the easy part I say yeah we just pray them away and almost almost you know they think I'm joking and they look at me yeah praise the Lord what do you really do I said no for real we just pray them away and it's never failed as yet amen even they hardly ever make it here even when they say because we just pray them and turn to Direction and even the ones that have come through the Lord has preserved us hasn't it amen and I say well as far as our weather do you ever get snow do you ever get winter I said yeah but it's usually gone by noon so we we we we have three seasons here and I I tell them I say we have fall and spring and murder so murder will be here pretty soon friends let's enjoy our Springs it's only February I know amen but I got out of my truck today and had pollen already on my hood amen praise the Lord I want to uh before I get to preaching I just wanted to get my text read and let you be seated and kind of wait for everyone to get settled our musicians and and worship team to come back around and be settled um got a couple of prayer needs that I want to pray over this morning and uh we want to pray over God's uh God's blessing that he promised you know he promised that reading the word there's a blessing and so i' I'm already blessed and if you read it with me you're already blessed you say man I should have read along well if you heard it read you're blessed amen blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy but now catch it and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand I'm interested I don't just really want God's blessing I I want his life you know I heard a man say one time when you as brother uh brother Nikolai stepanenko gone to be on gone on to be with the Lord now and he said and we were driving by a graveyard oh we were in uh in Lithuania um we might have been in Ukraine I can't remember we might have been in Russia for all I I don't really remember where we were somewhere in those Slavic countries or one of those Baltic states and we are driving by a a cemetery large cemetery and it was so large and imposing it caught my eye and I turned my head and I looked and he said he saw me you know brother Nikolai you remember a crusty old brother amen and he said something in Russian and I and I looked at the translator and he said brother Nikolai said those people don't need your help and I said okay what do they need and he said they need life you drive by a graveyard they don't need your help they need life I'm not here today say brother help me I the best way I can help you is to lead you to life amen there you know I've said it before that the life here with all of its trials and heartaches and then you live and you strive and you struggle and even if you make the great as brother Ernie used to say even if you win the rat race you're still a rat and then the whole thing comes down and finally you grow old and Rusty and die and that's it and you're done I mean you know remember you remember when I put the blocks of weeks up here to show you I mean your whole life if you base your whole life on the promised 70 now we we've got some in here who have exceeded 70 and some we've known have never made it to 70 some brother brandham said many a 16-year-old never saw their 17th birth but if we use the promise the promised years of 70 I mean listen up young people that's only 3,600 weeks and you're done and weeks go by like that I mean you're sitting here right now going goodness gracious it was just last week and the week before and it seemed like yeah weeks go by like no wonder I mean that 3652 weeks is 70 years you got 36 a little over 3600 weeks on average to live out your life and account for something in the Kingdom no wonder brother Brandon would say now is the only opportunity you will ever have to live and lay up treasure for that life coming and I promise you your 3600 weeks go by faster than you imagine they will amen but but I I I want to I want to take these prayer requests I had a couple that I wanted to pray over and one of them is uh is my nephew Samuel poor guy he's U Got a tooth that he's going to have to have taken out but he's got to have it done through surgery procedure and uh he does doesn't handle surgery so well Sister Lisa is quite concerned so we're going to offer prayer for Samuel and he's actually having it tomorrow morning at 700 amm will you remember to pray for our brother amen put a little note somewhere tell sir or brother Google to remind you in the morning at 7 to pray for Samuel sister Judy Dyer Dan and Judy Dyer many of you know uh sister Judy is near her homegoing time and is suffering from the rapid on set of dementia it's the fast moving kind and they they think maybe she may only have weeks to to live but she's a Christian amen wow I'm going to tell you what 3600 weeks or 600 what does it matter as long as I'm a Christian you know as I was in the middle of saying that this life is filled with so much anxiety and trouble that I mean if you don't get to live forever what's the point I mean come on get eternal life it's the one thing that makes this struggle worth it as brother JD was preaching this morning we're looking for a place with no struggles friends amen and we have several traveling on the road um away Brother Brad is ministering over in Green Pond today and want to be praying for brother Lee in that assembly amen I'm scheduled to preach there myself on the last Wednesday of this month um I want to ask for your prayers also sister Debbie and I will be traveling to Phoenix Arizona for next weekend we'll be there with brother Aaron McGary he and sister Elizabeth we're going to have a weekend of services including a a marriage banquet on the Saturday night so be praying for that brother Matt will be at the same time ministering for brother Eugene uh in Edmonton so if he's going up there to be with Eugene y'all go into fasting and prayer for brother Matt amen praise the Lord Brother JD will be covering base here at home for us amen praise the Lord let's stand back to your to our feet as we ask the Lord's blessing on on these needs father we thank you this morning for your great kindness to us we thank you for the reading of your word Lord we know there's a blessing in reading it we know there's a blessing in hearing it read and now Lord we want to turn our minds and turn our attention to what it is you have for us today we are committing ourselves now we're pushing out all the thoughts of yesterday and the the the the the pressures we we already know about for tomorrow and father I pray right now if you'll just give us a little Oasis as it were in our minds and our hearts to be able to just let everything go step off step out of the rat race of life and just calm our Spirits open our hearts and our minds to hear your word Lord we're asking prayer for sister Dyer Lord uh and I pray that you'll be particularly merciful to her Lord Lord at her homegoing time it's a it's sad but it's also a wonderful time lord for a Believer no wonder you said that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints because you know what that means Lord you know the life that they're getting to go to Lord and they'll never have to struggle anymore Lord all the toils of life will be over my what a what a day Lord we look for it on that great morning when we can all go home together gather around father's thr be there Lord for all eternity amen no more crying sighing or sorrow father now I ask Lord God for brother Samuel Lord that you'll be with him his procedure tomorrow morning may it just go flawlessly Lord may you bless the team the medical team Lord be with his own nerves uh my sister be with her nerves and her spirit Lord and may there just be complete trust in you we commit it to you now now help me Lord as I try to deliver this word to the people today we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated last night um Uriah and I were talking he's in from school for the weekend get gets to be with us today so happy to have him here we were we struck up a conversation between himself his dad and myself and on the use of the word ironic or which is which is uh that's an adjective of the noun irony and so irony refers to a situation or statement that is opposite or different from what is expected or intended I want to say that again I refers to a situation or statement that is opposite or different from what is expected or or intended and a lot of times people are shall I say mystified even at times offended at God for the way he moves in their lives the way he deals with us the the things that he allows and a lot of times I remember one time some years ago and I made a statement and we were uh speaking to a senior Minister much senior to me this was some years back and um and I said you know it's sometimes it's surprises me that will God will do certain things and he says to me and thought it was such wisdom I learned a quick lesson never forgot it he said remember brother Jason sometimes it's better not to say God did it but to say God permitted it God allowed it to happen but brother brandham said that the love of God is made known to us and made clear and made plain in election that he elected us amen he said sometimes he may he may commit you to suffering as he did Paul amen he or or death I mean he said he may cons he may commit you to suffering as he did job or he may commit you to death as he did Paul PA but he says but nonetheless his his love is proven to us in that before the foundation of the world he elected Us in the elected son in Christ Jesus and that means friends that no matter what you would ever face what you would ever lose on this side um you've got a your future is bright amen and so we were reading in our text and I I stopped to hesitate on it there in verse 5 every Valley shall be filled and every mountain and high hill shall be brought low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth and All Flesh shall see the salvation of God uh it's amazing because you know ironically uh none of that happened like the people thought right amen they and brother brandham deals with that now I don't want you to forget this morning that my subtitle is starting and finishing with fire I remember back in the day brother Henry green an old veteran of the Lord it was a hero of mine when I was growing up he always used to say referring to the upper room that what we call the day of Pentecost and he said he he said God he said Christ in the upper room he started his church like he wanted it and now he wants it like he started it amen he started his church like he wanted it and now he wants it like he started it this is exactly why we have a received a message of restoration we've been restored back to now ironically the message of restoration was not what the denominations of the last day were expecting it to be amen they were expecting it to just be the the excesses and demonstration of Supernatural power and brother brandham said everybody wants power and he says but really they don't really know what real power is amen he said you know he says real power is not you know how much noise you can make or how much dust you can kick up and I'm paraphrasing the quote I don't have it in front of me he said but the real battle is to conquer yourself and he said to to be able to surrender yourself to God and let the Lord have control of your life and bring out of you what he put in you to be brought out now it it's not as if you're not already in a bad enough situation given that you were born in sin given that you might have had things happen to you when you were a child given that you might have come up in a culture and had the wrong kind of friends and put all kinds of influences and scars in your life given that you maybe didn't make all the good choices even when you knew better and given that you finally arrived I'm here to tell you by the time Jesus tracks you down knocks you down and picks you back up you're a mess you're broken you're contaminated you're scarred you're wounded you've got haunts you've got uh bruises in your spirit you've got you're filled with complexes amen now don't get offended brother brandham said we all got complexes and that comes through to us some of it comes through heredity brother Brandon meets people in the line says you're always worrying about things you're grandmother was like that comes to a man sir you're always Crossing Bridges before you get to them and and when you finally get to them you realize it wasn't near as bad as you thought it would be see but he said but he put that into the grab bag of Life what he called and so and then you know you might have had uh poor leadership as a child poor leadership in a church poor leadership somewhere and and and you come to the Lord and I mean you you listen it's already bad enough without you now still running interference on the Lord not letting him after your new birth bring you to to the fullness the fruition of the vision he had for you amen you say well it's too late on some of these areas there's no way there's things in my life unrecoverable you might have situations that are unrecoverable that's true I mean sometimes we get ourselves into situations of life and there's no way to undo it in this life I'm glad that all wrongs here will be made right there Hallelujah and so so we find that you know he sometimes we can we can Despair and say oh would to God that I could have been this and done that and if I hadn't made this and brother brandham talks about about Moses in the very same situation 80y old man and 40 years in Egypt learning the ways of the Egyptians and God said then it took God 40 years in the desert to beat it out of him and when he comes ready to finally use him as far as God is concerned he's finally got him ready as far as Moses is concerned brother brandham said that he stood there one day and he thought about his life in Egypt and what a waste and what a a rain wreck it had been and he thought about now 40 years in the wilderness and he's just basically hurting sheep who aren't even his they belong to his daddy-in-law and you know and he and brother brandham says that you know and I'm so glad a prophet could look into the heart of another prophet and say you know Moses stood there thinking but I've ruined it and I've I've made a mess of it and it's too late for me now he was just getting ready to start and he's standing there thinking it's too late for me now and brother brandham said the great Crystal tears began to roll down his beard and then he heard the sound of a crackling flame oh friends I want to tell you today that Jesus promised that that not only would he lose no body whose names were in the Lamb's Book of Life but he doesn't lose anything about you whatever he ordained you to be and whatever he placed in you I don't care what you've done what Satan's done what your parents preachers whoever did did what to you I'm here to tell you this message has come to give it back and to build you back and I don't care if you got one year or 10 years or however long the Lord has you can run for the kingdom of God and everything you do counts times 100 so so the devil can't win for losing poor guy he could actually win if he wasn't always losing so I want to say this to you today that that I want to PR I want to present a thought to you today that let us not imagine that we're just being restored back to an upper room experience we're being restored to a Garden of Eden hallelujah we're being restored back to when sons of God when morning Stars sang together we being restored back to when sons and daughters in the family of God shouted for Joy we're being restored back to when we stood before the father's throne and all was well throughout the kingdom of Christ I'm here to tell you something friends don't let the devil make you feel hopeless he ain't nobody he ain't never been nobody he's just an adversary that God built to help keep you in line death is I'm not the slave SL of death brother brandham said death is my slave it is commanded to do one thing and that is to take me into the presence of God so we are we're not limited to the New Testament Church that he started in the upper room however that is where you need to begin your journey home don't have brother brandham taught us that that that church at Jerusalem that upper room experience set the pattern for the church in every age amen all right but I want to say to you today that we're not limited uh to the New Testament Church he started in the upper room but we but what you are entitled to is to go back to the church that he began in John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was with God in the beginning all things were made by him see so when he said as brother brandham taught us when he said in Genesis let us make man brother brandham is very clear that when he said let us make man he made up his entire family in his mind right then now they weren't expressed yet and brother brandham did not believe in the pre-existence of Souls manifested expressed Souls says you were in the attributes of your father God you were there so he said but he you weren't expressed so he had never got to fellowship with you just like and he he brings it down to the lower image of a husband and wife bringing forth a child so I I was in my father but he couldn't fellowship with with me until through the beding ground of my mother I was expressed and I came from the Lo of my father and then he could Fellowship me amen and so that's why you're here that's why you have life is because God desired your fellowship Own It rejoice in it smack the devil with it God brought you here so he could have fellowship with you so we're talking about how that he says let us make man he makes up his entire family in his mind so he would bring them forth just as he brought forth his first member of his church his first member of his church was Christ see and so then after Christ each child in Christ comes forth in the order that he is ordained or as Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15 but every man in his own order Christ the first fruits after afterward afterward so there's an afterward of Christ afterward they that are christs at his coming are you Christ are you looking for his coming then you're read here in the scriptures your life is hid in Christ is hidden God through Christ friends there's not enough devils in hell to change that and even you can't change that so we can see that First Corinthians 15 how he is uh is uh speaking of the new heavens and the new Earth brother Jason was uh teaching on it so eloquently this morning and we find that in the new heavens and the new Earth and and and this is going to be the the finishing uh of God you know operating in a in a in the limitations of a of an office you know he was he was in the fatherhood above us and while he was in the father he say God limited only in this sense don't don't throw something at me to hear me out when he's in the fatherhood he can't do the work that he's going to do in flesh as a son in the fatherhood he can't do that you right see and that's why even David couldn't build the house because David had been a bloody man and David couldn't build it and we didn't know why in Kings cuz cuz uh the uh Samuel didn't tell us why David wasn't allowed to build it but and when Ezra pens the Chronicles he tells us that God said you can't do it David because you've been a bloody man you've killed a lot of people your sword is dripping with blood see and but your but I'll raise up your son and he it is and I'll call his name peace amen Solomon meaning peace because Solomon is a is a type of Christ see because he's the son of David that's what Jesus was he was the son of David but in the fatherhood David desired fellowship with God but in the father because God God desired fellowship with you David said I live in a house of Cedar and he lives in a tent and he was it was God moving through the heart of David expressing God wanted to have it back that Fellowship that he had lost with his family in the Garden of Eden and God wanted it back I'm here to tell you I know you were born in sin but God wanted you back Hallelujah and I know what the devil has done to many of our lives but I'm here to tell you God wants you back and the devil is not going to be able to hold you he's not going to be able to hold your children he wants you back he wants them back he wants his entire family back and he's going to have it see he say well that that's going to be bad news if the devil gets in the way well it's bad news if you get in the way cuz he loves you too much to let you get in the way and getting you out of the way can be painful yes hear me teenagers getting you out of the way can be painful to you but he will do whatever is painfully necessary he will not be defeated so so but David couldn't do it because he had been a a a man of judgment a man of of death and and had spilled much blood well that's God was speaking of himself just like you remember when he said to he says to Moses I can't I can't Moses I can't go down and and dwell in the midst of these stiff necked rebellious people I'll kill everybody and he said I can't do that I can't go with you into the midst of the people Lord what will you do I will send forth my angel and he will go with you see because now that's the angel of the Lord's presence that's the angel of the Covenant and that's Christ and that's a Ministry of atonement so now he can go in the midst of the people and dwell at the Tabernacle now if they if they if they try to misuse his word even he will slaughter them even though he's full of mercy and holds Mercy yet he will not pardon transgressions in other words he might forgive you but he's not going to let you get by with it remember he said to David he said as far as your sin with ba Sheba and what you did against Uriah uh as far as that sin God hath put it away however the sword will never leave your house and it didn't and David suffered under that so you understand that it had it couldn't David couldn't build it because David had been that David had been a man of war God had been a man of war god David had killed a lot of people God had killed a lot of people and so God wanting to be in the position of Fellowship he couldn't do that because the the Lamb of God hadn't even been offered and he would have to destroy his own family so he says David you're like me you're the father you can't do it but like me I'll raise up your son and I'll call call his name peace and he shall build the house of the Lord and Solomon did built the Tabernacle of the Lord's dwelling place so so we realize then that he his coming as as Paul speaks of in First Corinthians about the coming of the Lord and the surrendering up of the kingdom and how that God is no longer going to be operating and the limitation of office the Bible in in revelation 22 says for the first and only time God himself shall dwell among his people see so the kingdom is surrendered the son can surrenders to the father that God may be all in all I'm not teaching on that today uh keep getting pulled into it amen probably because Jason had my appetite so wetted with with his Sunday school lesson this morning but but we realize that here here here's the point his coming which we all long for his coming brings things finally finally at last back to Eternity at last after it's all said and done we come back to Eternity at last friend you'll finally be able to rest and lean in on the bosom of Jehovah you'll have all will be peace forever more on that happy Golden Shore everything you've ever lost every sorrow you've ever had the Lord will see it restored there because this will be fulfilling him as a redeemer vers 1 Corinthians 15 sees him fulfilled as a redeemer and a savior of course along with the other seven compound Redemptive names that he moved under Jehovah Nissi and rifa and Rea and Shalom and situ and and all of these various names he's he's Raa he's your healer he's your buckler he's your captain he's your provider he's all of these things he's present with you and so so then we see that this is all fulfilled so then then you come to Solomon from First Kings 10:27 uh where we read in our text you you can put it back up again if you like brother Mark First Kings 10:27 we read this in our in our text and the King made silver this is Solomon to be in Jerusalem as stones and Cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the veil for abundance realize something that that you remember when brother um Ronnie was preaching here Wednesday about rooting rooting in the ground like r o o t rooting not rah rah rah rooting but God Roots around in our lives rooting for the Rapture he does that to get you ready because he doesn't save you without at an altar and say okay you're saved see you in heaven that's not how it works he he loves you far too much to leave you like he found you and so the word of God confronts you and it Roots around in your life and it gets up in your business and it and it directs your life and tells you what you should and shouldn't do and the majority of human don't like that don't want that and won't have that remember they wrote a letter back and said we will they sent a letter after their Master saying we will not have this man to rule over us and he come back and said fine then he annihilated them that's why when the when the king sent out an invitation to a supper they made this excuse oh I bought a yoke of ox and I can't come pray have me excused I bought piece of land I go to prove it I've got too much business going on I've married a wife I've got I'm in school I got this I got a career I got I got to worry about this pray uh please have me excused from the Lord's supper and and and the table wasn't filled and he said go into the hedges and the highways and compel them to come for I say to you that not any of those people who are invited shall ever taste of my supper they had their day of visitation and they were too busy hear me they were too busy with life and stuff to respond to the invitation of the Lord wow to come to the feast so we realize then that that First Corinthians 15 he finally brings things back to Eternity again the the usefulness of that little hickey of time remember brother Bram drew the circle and down at the bottom he had a little like a little drop po down a little Loop down and it looped down into time and then come back up into the Ring of Eternity and brother brandham says my wife mea she looked at it and said it looks like a a little hickeys on it you know like almost like a a skin tag on a perfectly on a perfect circle of Eternity and brother bradam said that's that little Loop down of time for him to come and redeem his family I want to tell you something friends the the the history of mankind on the Earth has been has been just a blink it's I mean God spent eons and and perhaps brother R said millions and billions and trillions of years just creating the universe see so he he didn't argue with science science says oh the universe is far older uh the Earth is far older than 6,000 years old and brother B says sure fine Oh you mean you're a preacher and you believe that well the Bible doesn't tell us how how long he took to build the heavens and the Earth it just tells us that he did in the beginning he created the heavens and the Earth and there's a period there that's it he doesn't explain now he took so much time building it and turning it and and gardening it and creating a garden putting man on it and then he fell and then the Plan of Redemption and then Jesus comes and then the New Testament Church and the Holy Ghost and then the bride is wound up then the tribulation and then the Millennium comes and then at the end of that the Earth is purged back the whole thing goes back to Eternity see and so and and I and I just took probably less than 20 seconds in explained 6,000 years to you right that's all it took cuz you're well taught you understand and so in the new heavens and the new Earth then that little hickey of time is over it's not over in the Millennium we're still in time there because the Earth hasn't had its baptism of fire yet so this fulfills him as a redeemer as a savior as I said and so when when Solomon is going to build his T his his Tabernacle and David has a symbol the parts because that's what God did he assembled all the parts see and but Solomon the son of David is the one who's actually going to construct it and we we find that he he he writes to uh the king of Ty to hire him and he says now just as you were Pals with my dad and you you you guys were tight and you know what he wanted you wanted y'all worked really good together my dad has asked me to has left it to me to build a a tabernacle unto God but I I I I don't really have everything I need so I need you to be kind to me like you were to my dad David and send me forth and one of the things that asked for and I years ago I preached a sermon send me therefore a man because it had to be a man skilled see because the Tabernacle in the wilderness is a type of you because you are are the dwelling place in the Millennium you're the dwelling place of the presence of God Amen and so so we find and then in the new heavens and the new Earth God himself shall dwell he can't dwell on the earth in the Millennium because it hasn't been purged yet you understand the devil's still alive and so his Dwelling Place in the Millennium is in you and Jesus is there with you oh friends what a day that's going to be so we find that and I'm trying to keep all of this so I don't confuse you so we find that that this Tabernacle you know there there there's just there's just all these parts and you know I got all these things that God put in my life but how do I put them together and I got this problem and I got that problem and how do I this Tabernacle has got to be great I I I need to I need to build a tabernacle that God can dwell in but my problem is I was born in in sin my problem is I had this problem and that problem and this problem and that problem I got this complex and that complex I'm a wreck I'm a Mess send me therefore a man somebody who can come down somebody who knows me somebody who understands all of my weaknesses somebody who can put it all back together again somebody who can build me a man cunning who can build my life to be a Dwelling Place of the Lord God and he said and and the king hyam is a gentile so you can see the types there I don't want to get preaching that sermon but the but the one thing that he asked hyam for was some trees and the first on the list the primary tree that he needed was Cedars of Lebanon amen see and so so now when you now when you come to First Kings 10 this is the time when the Queen of Sheba has come and she didn't believe the report she confessed it openly of course she how what she going to do you couldn't deny it in Solomon because he could read he he knew the thoughts of your heart and she said when I heard the report I didn't believe it she said but now mine eyes have seen it and she brought him all kinds of treasures and silver and gold and abundance and spices the Bible says never been spices like that in Israel from before then or since and and and friends that's you you understand that's you bringing your life to Christ Hallelujah you're and what and then what did Solomon do Solomon turned around and he he made Shields and he made cups and he made he improved the palace and he took Cedars and he improved the temple and he he outfitted everybody Solomon Solomon used the gifts of Sheba to build up the kingdom it's not like a a fallen man in this day where he gets all kinds of power but he has no character and he becomes a despot and he becomes a tyrant I'm here to tell you that if you dedicate your life to Christ and bring him your offering he won't betray you he's going to build a glorious Kingdom full of his people he won't waste it he won't he won't be underhanded he won't be sneaky he's going to build a beautiful world and you're going to be a part of itall oh I wanted to preach on that today so bad but he but but but we find that that the analogy here is is that he takes he that that that during Solomon the blessing of Solomon on Israel that literally all the stones are replaced with silver and all of the sycamore trees which are so so abundant see when you were born in sin you had sin so abundant you had so many abundant remember brother Ronnie said that sycamore tree was so bitter there's so much bitterness there's so much disappointment there's so much wreckage there's so much say my goodness why did I have to be built like this I've got every weakness what why did God it looked like he poured the whole weakness tub on me and everybody else seems to get Scot free that's not true I promise you we all got them come on let let the man beside you see we all got them we came into the land this way but the but the blessing of Solomon is he's he's now taking out those sycamores taking out that bitterness taking out those faults taking out those stones taking out those worthless things and he's building you off silver and he's building you of Cedar Hallelujah and Cedar was the main product that he used to build the Tabernacle with because wood represents Humanity that's why the Ark of the Covenant was made of wood overlaid with gold because gold represents deity and you are Humanity overlaid with deity [Applause] Hallelujah you with me wow that clock is my enemy I hardly feel like I've got started bear with me for another 20 minutes will you so this is I don't want you to forget that amen this is what the son of David is doing in your life he's rooting out the things of no value and he's seeking to build you up with the things of value you get that so I'm sorry that you had to go through a heartache but it's for your good I'm sorry you suffered that disappointment but he knows what he's doing oh Just Surrender yourself to this master builder Just Surrender your whole life I doesn't matter say Lord just take my whole life my houses my land my dreams my plans I'm placing my whole life in your hands see so we come back then to this discussion again about what is irony and the whole discussion came up because Uriah was pointing out to us that irony is often misused and not used in its correct connotation it's a very common mistake to make it's because people don't understand the various types of Irony or really what it means but again it refers to a situation this is situational irony it refers to a situation or a statement that is opposite or different from what is expected or intended see and so I I I I there there's a lot of people who are going to have broken expectations and have their intentions torn down you say wow this is going to be sad no it's the most glorious thing because your expectations uh of you thinking of yourself as a failure is not going to stand he's going to make you an overcomer and I can promise you that the devil had all these plans and intentions for you it ain't happening there's somebody overruling the whole package there's somebody saying uh-uh that's not my child oh Satan you can do with your own whatever you wish but this is mine and you're gonna I'm gonna keep you on a leash and I'm gonna let you do just enough to keep them in line but at the end of it I'm going to bring them home and I'm going to destroy you and and we're going to get on with eternity again so so ironically I'm going in the Rapture so why is it ironic because the devil doesn't think I will it's not what he expects and a lot of times it's not what I expect but I'm going Hallelujah just like when Joseph come to his brothers and they and Jose and they had did such terrible things and they had did them for real that wasn't metaphorically bad things they really did them for real and Joseph actually Discerning their heart said you actually meant it for evil yep yep no joke you actually meant it for evil however there was a power over the top of it all who meant it for good and allowed it to happen oh friends I we could almost go home right now just rejoicing God is the overseer of your life Hallelujah you believe that do you accept his majesty do you accept his majesty the king to be the Sovereign of your life see so so they thought there in our text they thought all the mountains would go down and uh the Low Places would be brought up and every low place would be lifted up and all of this would happen brother brandham says in my new ministry in 1959 he says how many times we look at men who climb up in great ranks like and and get high names I was telling you earlier without reading the quote that's why I got away from it because I didn't have it in front of me where brother Ram said people wants power they don't understand what it is he said it's really conquering yourself he said see when you can learn the Way Up Is Down and the the way to success is humility and letting God lead your life he says then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise he said because you've learned to conquer yourself so he says how many times we look at men who climb up in great ranks like and get high names but sometimes that's not what God calls High see now you remember Luke 3 and5 they thought it would be this they thought it would be that but it was going to be a big dose of irony wasn't going to be what they it was going to happen but not like they expected what they intended for it to be remember brother brandom said they intended to have a general to come in there and wipe out the Romans yeah and said and God humiliated he said what he said he God sent them what they actually needed he sent him a baby see so he says sometimes what men call high but that's not what God calls high do you remember when John came preaching the Bible foretold that every Mountain would be brought low and every low place would be lifted up see and when it come ironically that's me ironically I'm adding that you back to the quote and when it come you would think it would be coming out of heaven with fiery chariots goodness gracious the mountains are going to be made low and the Low Places made High and the Crooked places all fixed and straightened in a moment and the whole world's going to know God yeah you would think that brother Brenham says you would think that it would be coming out of heaven with fiery chariots but what was it a poor man dressed in a piece of sheep skin wrapped around him you talking about irony and out on the banks of the Jordan preach ing on the Muddy Banks not even in a church amen right so I'm preaching to you today part three of the start of fire and my subtopic as I keep saying is starting and finishing with fire brother brandham says in in concerning the Holy Ghost and Fire remember we read it in our text he said you he shall come his fan is in his hand and he shall thoroughly and he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire amen all right you got that image resurrection of Lazarus 1951 and I can hear him look around and say there was nothing nowhere just vastness of space this is God this is John 1 and one in the beginning was the word and I can hear him look around and say there was nothing nowhere just vastness of space the father covered all that space and then this God become bized bized Microsoft Word hates that word and it keeps trying to make me change it but this version of the word loved it so I'm going to read from this word but just remember we're leaning on this word and then this God become bized down to the logos I can hear him say let there be light and an adom bursted Yonder see and the Sun come into existence deity all right I just want to say you're all already aware that when an adom is bursted and by the way Microsoft Word hates that word too bursted when an Adam is bursted you get a fire that's the temperature of the sun and a shock wave that produces a rushing Mighty Wind amen 1953 questions and answers on Genesis now in St John 1 he said in the beginning was the word and the first and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God now catch this hiil language God unfolding himself down to God unfolding himself down to a human being now when he did that he's not diminished just like when he divided himself in the upper room he didn't get diminished he didn't like lose a part of himself all he did was multiply himself into his church see so that's why you're the Christ is the first of the new creation you're the continuation of that same creation see so all right so he says God un folding himself down to a human being now watch what he did and I can hear him say let there be light and when he did an atom bursted and the sun came into existence she Whirled for hundreds of millions of years forming clinkers and burning and forming like it is today still burning still breaking atoms if the now watch him attach it to the atomic bomb if the atomic bomb would never get let loose the atomic chain would take this Earth would be like the sun Yonder see they science knows that that if they explode too many of them in the right in the right uh synchronization in the right places it'll catch the atmospheres on fire and and set off a chain reaction and I have a feeling armageddon's going to be just that see so he says the atomic chain would be would take this Earth would be like the sun Yonder just bursting and blowing if if you could stand over on another continent and look off at this it would look like another Sun where the atoms was burning this Earth if the chain would ever get loose and it just start turning whirling like that millions and millions of miles reach these big flames of billions of Fahrenheit of heat so he began that's why I I I I'm I'm I'm taking this subtitle today he began and he's finishing with fire because he began with fire when an atom bursted and then he became in John 1 a pillar of fire amen he burned Sodom and Gomorrah with fire that science you heard brother Matt's uh Exposition on that science has recently identified that Sodom and gamorra suffered a heat event equal to a nuclear detonation God dropped a nuke on them and they found the pottery glazed over from a heat event so he begins with fire he bursts an Adam he became a pillar of fire he burned Sodom and Gomorrah with fire he met Moses in a bush on fire when he descended on the Mountaintop the whole top of the mountain was on fire my God himself self is an all consuming fire in The Exodus from Egypt Moses commanded the children of Israel to slay a lamb and put the blood over the door and the lamb was to be roasted by fire it could not be eaten raw it could not be boiled in water they even burned the leftovers this of course you know the when you look at the whole burnt offering it's symbolic it's a symbolic Act of Consecration and dedication to the Lord You're to be a whole burnt offering amen Leviticus 6 uh brother Mark Leviticus 61 12-13 now these are the priest instructions for the for the fire in the Tabernacle and the fire Leviticus 6:12 and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it it shall not be put out and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning and lay the burnt offering in order upon it and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings verse 13 the fire shall ever be burning upon the altar it shall never go out Leviticus 16 verse 11-14 and Aaron shall bring the bulock of the sin offering which is for himself and shall make an atonement for himself and for his house and shall kill the bulock of the sin offering which is for himself and he shall take a sensor full of the burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small and bring it within the veil this is in the shikina and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord that the cloud of the incense May cover The Mercy Seat that is upon the testimony that he die not and he shall take the blood of the bulock and sprinkle it with his finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times brother Brandon breaks all that down I'm not teaching on it today verse 27 verse 27 and the Bullock for the sin offering and the Goat for the sin offering whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place shall one carry forth without the camp and they shall burn in the fire their skins and their flesh and their dung he started with fire he has maintained fire and he's going to finish with fire he's restoring you with fire It Was Elijah who called down fire on Mount Carmel to to consume the offering it vaporized the water the rocks and even consumed the dust and the residue later this same Elijah called down that same fire on his enemies eliminating them in a moment and then when it was all said and done Elijah went home in a chariot of fire see the three Hebrew children met the Fourth Man In The Fire four has been the number of Deliverance to this day brother brandham teaching in Revelation chapter 4 number 3 1961 and four is the number of Earth see Deliverance there was three Hebrew children in the fire furnace but the fourth one come it was Deliverance Lazarus was in the grave three days but when the fourth one come he was delivered Luke 12:35 says let your loins be G about and your lights burning John 5:35 he was a burning and a Shining Light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his lights his servants in Revelation 4:5 are called burning lamps out of the throne proceded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God Revelation 188 therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is is the Lord God who judgeth her I'm here to tell you something friends you are baptized into the body of Christ by Holy Ghost and Fire he divided himself into licks of fire and moved upon the people in the upper room he descended and revelation 10 and his feet were like pillars of fire as if they burned in an oven and and and I and and and chronologically I skipped Abraham because Abraham's fire event I skipped it on purpose so I could connect it to our new birth because the original plan for the upper room to be fire was always the baptism of the Holy Ghost was always going to be fire brother Brandon deals with that in the message from that time and brother brandham shows that when when God made the Covenant with Abraham that he took animals and he divided them and he took birds and he didn't divide the birds because the dove represents Divine Healing and it's in the Old Testament and the New Testament so it wasn't divided but he divided the other animals and he stood between them and he fell into a deep sleep the Bible says brother Brandon breaks all this down in that message you go check it out he says at the time when the setting of the Sun in other words when time shall be no more and when Abraham fell into a deep sleep he said we all fall into a deep sleep who don't go in a Rapture and he said and then there was a a a a burning furnace a smoking furnace and he said representing hell because when you die your destination is that burning furnace your destination there's nothing you can do to avoid it he said but coming down against between all of that was a burning light it was the the pillar of fire and God was confirming the Covenant The Upper Room experience was always going to be fire hallu you're born he whose fan is in his hand will thoroughly Purge and he will baptize you in the Holy Ghost and in fire oh Hallelujah Ezekiel 1113 ask for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appear of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning Malachi 41 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it leave them neither root nor Branch the false prophet death hell the grave and all the Godly are cast into the Lake of Fire in Revelation 20 whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire the Earth at the end of the Millennium is cleansed by Holy Fire to have a new heavens and a new Earth so that God himself can come down and live among us Isaiah 4 4 to 5 he says when the Lord when the Lord shall have washed away you can pull this one up brother Mark it's a little bit lengthy Isaiah 4 4-5 when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and a Smoke by day and The Shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense for upon all the glory shall be a defense and what more could I say today for time would fail to tell you further how that he is a consuming fire how that he is the refiner fire how that he sends forth Trials of fire and in the time of Solomon when he's building the Temple down came a fire and filled up the house so that none they couldn't even carry out the duties the priesthood couldn't even carry out their duties because why the presence of God in those mortal bodies Daniel fainted and passed out brother Brandon passed out just looking at him in the eyes over in a field he told Brother bisc every time that Pillar of Fire comes it's just like I could die Isaiah in Isaiah 6 he felt so exposed he felt undone he felt helpless in the presence of he who was lifted High whose train filled the temple whose voice shook the post oh my I'm undone a woe is me Isaiah said I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell among a people of unclean lips and God sent forth a coal of fire from the altar of fire in the hand of an Angel and it touched his lips and said now thy sin is purged and thine iniquity is taken away and then the voice of God said who shall go for us and Isaiah jumped to his feet send me send me I'm here to tell you we had no chance you were lost and undone but God sent an angel a messenger in this day and he had a burning he was a burning light and he had a whole and it touched your lips and you have fed on this word and what has it done it has taken away your sin it is purg you of your iniquity because when he purges Zion that's the bride the glory of the Lord shall be seen is that your desire today friends to say I want my life to be a a Burning Flame of the glory of the Lord Hallelujah friends that's what he's come to do that's what's happened in our lives Hallelujah see now that'd be a perfect place to close but you've heard me say I always check with the Lord and I'm forbidden to close yet okay you trust me in that you know I've been doing that for years Lord can I close yes and I'll even tell you I got permission I don't have it right now now amen a coal of fire I need you for seven eight 10 more minutes you got me a coal of fire came forth from the altar carried by an Angel who stood Before the Throne we read about him those those living creatures those cherubs they stood before they stood in his presence see they they they guarded the way in the tree of in the from the for the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden and they ran Adam and Eve out and brother R says now those same ones are running you back see so this coal of fire it come it touched his lips it purged him of his sin and he you know it doesn't even matter today the world can resist Christ all they want it's not going to stop his plan they can deny his existence or admit his existence as a great man but denies his deity and I think that's probably worse than the first one they have all kinds of evil opinions about the word of God for this hour and about those who follow it but I'm here to tell you that this fire on that day of judgment will consume all resistance it will consume all resistance at the judgment and every knee will bow no matter what you think of Christ every knee will bow no matter you Rage with unbelief you Rage with Defiance I'm here to tell you let the Heathen rage on that day it will that fire of God that's coming from his throne that Isaiah saw that John saw it will consume all resistance and every knee will bow could I say to you today and here comes the burden that the Lord only gave me this this morning late as I was rushing to get to church he wants to burn all of your resistance I would say to you today in the name of the Lord let him let he's rooting for the rapture he's rooting I know he's into your business I know he's dealing with your life I know you don't like it sometimes it rubs you the wrong way but I'm here to tell you something friends on that day he'll consume all resistance why wait till then let it happen now while there's Mercy there won't be any Mercy then then you'll admit it but it'll be too late if there's one thing that God desires to consume in our lives like he did for Elijah he desires to consume your enemies now before you go out picking the people you want him to consume I first need to advise you that we have seen the enemy and it is us it's not believe it or not ironically it's not your brother or your sister but it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer see so you need to know how this works God removes and destroys the enemy in your life and when doing so he aligns you with his purpose in other words friends he doesn't do it just to do it he doesn't do anything without a purpose and a reason one of the biggest enemies God is seeking to devour is sin in your life you understand he didn't need to devour Elijah Elijah was already following him so he could go ahead and consume his enemies David was already following him so he wiped out his enemies but I'm here to tell you I'm not need I don't need God to go up the street and kill anybody on my behalf because I don't I'm my failures make me unworthy that anybody should suffer on my behalf God forbid goodness gracious don't let anybody suffer on my account I don't care how they treat me I I do not deserve that Lord have mercy on them and let me have mercy on them but his consuming his consuming fire in this day the biggest enemy is sin that is left ungiven to the Lord and all it and all that is therefore is Satan has put that in your life to delay to effect to try to destroy joy to try to hinder every glorious thing that God has planned for you in your life sin invades your heart it invades your mind it wrecks God's plans don't let that happen as brother Donnie was preaching brother Ronnie was preaching Wednesday night let let the mind which was in Christ be in you let the word of God dwell in you richly I'm here to tell you something friends this is the fire that God has for you and I in this day this is what Solomon was trying to this is what the blessing of Solomon and I'm here to tell you I've already said it I'm going to close by saying it again and double down on it I know you've been through trials I know you've had heartaches I know you've had disappointments but Solomon was getting rid of the Rocks he was replacing it with silver he was getting rid of the bitter sycamor he was replacing it with cedar I just say Lord Drive about everything Prophet said however much you'll let go of the world and get it out of you God Christ will come in and fill up that place we're headed for a Rapture friends it's time to let the world go it's time to let the fire of the Holy Spirit consume Our Lives consume Our Lives you believe that let's stand to our feet you see why the Lord won't let me stop till I finish with that oh Bow your heads with me friends and I'm not finished with this thought but I'm I'm finished today and I feel the approval of the Holy Spirit bow your heads with me Lord God I stand before you today and these people we all stand in your presence today Lord having heard your word my how it has challenged us but it it it should be that way shouldn't it Lord should never leave us comfortable in our weakness may we never feel comfor able in spiritual weakness may you put a Zeal and a striving may you rekindle a flame it's not about how that fire may or may not strike the senses of one the the bodily senses of one the different from the bodily senses of another some people speak in tongues some don't I never have some people run and leap I don't some people fall on the ground and roll around in drunken laughter I've seen it I've never done that when the Holy Spirit strikes me Lord I jump up and down and sometimes I'm so excited I jump up and down and spin as I'm jumping I can't help it I don't even realize I'm doing it sometimes in my office Lord I clap my hands so thunderously my dear wife rushes in to see if I'm okay I felt your nearness sometimes your nearness comes in and I I crumble to the floor and I weep and gush with tears doesn't matter how you how this fire plays upon the senses the the bodily senses of a human but that it would remove sin that it would Purge iniquity and Give Us Clean Hands and give us clean Hearts oh God that we might be the Tabernacle of the Lord's Dwelling Place take out all the stones Lord fill it with silver take away all these bitter trees Lord that were born in me in massive quantities they fill up the valley the whole Veil is filled with these bitter trees these sycamores they're hard and naughty and difficult push them out with Cedars Lord bring in the Cedars bring in the chief wood that built the Tabernacle of your Dwelling Place in the days of solom come down and fill up this Temple this Temple that I stand in today so that the works of My Flesh can no longer work granted Lord let there be such a presence of the fire from off the altar that none of my bodily senses which are still unconverted none of my me memory reason conscious affection imagination nothing I taste touch see hear feel nothing nothing can affect Lord or overrule that innermost inner man that that innermost Inner Man in that in that what we sometimes call the the holy of holies Lord whereas the Bible referred to it as the most holy Place same thing Lord that's where the shikina is that's where I want to live I want to be a third realm dweller Lord so I pray that you'll grant that to us today father let this word that's gone forth Lord the Rapture is soon the world in a Twist of of ironic Fate has misunderstood you when you came in this day you were not what they expected you the the the the the intention of the of the systems of Religion Today are going to see their intentions frustrated and come to nothing it'll be a it'll be cruel irony when they stand on that day and realized what could have been maybe there's young people here today maybe there's old people maybe there's both who would say brother Jason today preach your man I've come to terms with myself today and I feel like Isaiah in the presence of God and I need a coal of Fire why don't you raise up your hands to the Lord and say oh God come in I don't care whether you maybe you've already been born again of the spirit of God maybe you need a refilling maybe you need new fire a rekindled Zeal to say Lord God Of Heaven sanctify my heart and my mind cleanse my thinking change my plans and my mind change all my schemes and dreams Lord let me be freshly dedicated to you today when the voice of God says who shall go for us then he answered here my send me we love you today for your word we thank you for what you have given us master I commit myself into your hands and this audience into your hands deal with hearts Lord as you see fit every hand that went up Lord may you take them at their word may you fulfill your promise that you would give the Holy Ghost and Fire Lord I'm not we're not here to dictate how that will affect the our bodily senses but I know this I want it for myself I want it for my family I want it for this church I want everybody to have an upper room experience I want that day of Pentecost raging within us oh God and far we're almost home Lord help us to be purged and cleansed by the fire from off the the altar you've did everything by fire from start to finish you begin with fire and you finish it with fire we love you Lord we love you I thank you for this patient audience who sat today Lord patiently hearing the word of God now Lord As we sing a song or two of Zion the worship songs this is to water the seed of the word the seed of the Gospel that has been swn in our hearts don't let us be in a hurry Lord give us a few minutes to linger in your presence As we sing these songs lifting up holy hands worshiping you in spirit and in truth what a privilege what a privilege it is to worship you in spirit and in truth the world thinks they're worshiping you ironically they're worshiping Satan and don't realize it it's
