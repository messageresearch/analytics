========================================

that's what christ came to do not to give us knowledge he came to redeem us so that the lives that we have are expressing what what he made us to be in in the beginning in his image and his likeness to be the visible expression of the invisible spirit so we're walking you and i are walking around in life people are seeing god that's what we were made created in the beginning to be jesus died on the cross so that we would have that what do we have the message today what is the restoration of the message today so that we would be him manifested why were we restored to the full why did we even have to be restored to the full word couldn't we just have the blood of christ and have a part of the word there'd be no rapture that's for sure there needs to be a full word restored are you gonna are we gonna be a bride without spot or wrinkle with just one part of the word maybe we have seven sacraments and we believe in all kind of nonsense but hey we believe in jesus that's enough i got a relationship with jesus that's that that's doesn't mean anything that has no meaning without the life of jesus being inside of you judas had a relationship with jesus too it didn't mean he experienced salvation right a lot uh caiaphas had a relationship with jesus too oh but i'm not talking about that okay what are you talking about then are jesus in you produces a life of what surrender to the word jesus said if you love me you'll do whatever you want to do and you'll disregard anything everything half of what i say that's what the denomination tells us that's what the system tells us we don't need the full word we're comfortable with where we're at the bride is not comfortable with where she's at until she's in full surrender to jesus christ if you love me keep my commandments and he says where i am there will my servant be also it doesn't say wherever my servant is that's where i am who's the one that's leading you or him my goodness i'm so far off my topic matthew 16 16-18 peter had a supernatural revelation simon peter replied you're the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered him blessed are you simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it that's the revelation of who he is peter is not that rock peter means little stone jesus is not directly the rock rather it's the revelation of who jesus christ is that is the foundation that the church is built upon it's the foundation right it's not the continuation it's just the foundation this is where we start who is jesus who is jesus is jesus the one that's proclaimed on the denominational church oh yeah that's jesus it is jesus is who he says he is jesus is where he manifests himself so when jesus wants to be known he makes himself known we don't get to stand up and say hey this is what we this is what this is what jesus is that's theology jesus declare he's first he's declared himself in the word and then he's promised certain things in the word to be manifested in certain ages then who is jesus the mighty angel that came down with an open book to restore us back to the original faith jesus is not some historical figure that died two thousand years ago that people want to model their lives over because he was such a good man that's not who jesus is that's who he was but who is he it's who he declares himself to be who you know when moses was called of god he said who should i say sent him he didn't he didn't say well you know historical god he made reference to historical god the god of abraham god of isaac the god of jacob but when he said who will i say sent him he didn't say tell him the god of jacob sent you he said i am that i am. tell them i am sent you the god who declares himself that's another way you could translate i am that i am is i become what i become in other words i manifest myself in front of you that's who who is this the one that's been manifested that's the importance of this message let's not get away from that what is it what is this all about we have a relationship with jesus what jesus there's another jesus which is not jesus who is jesus he's the one who manifests himself he's the i am not the i was not the i will be the one who's declared himself in this day through a prophet this is who jesus is the whole world is grasping after something else something different another idea another theology a new book that some superstar quote-unquote christian theologian puts out no no he is the word and he declares himself the same yesterday today and forever he did that through the prophet so that we would understand what is he doing in this hour he is perfecting a bride jesus is not calling in denominations you see denominations they have meanings they have things happen people are coming to the altar they're not experiencing jesus say who are you who do you think you are up there telling us who jesus is and who jesus isn't the prophet taught us the truth has nothing to do with my idea we just need to get rid of this false concept that there's a thousand jesuses and whichever way i live it's fine just as long as i stamp the name of jesus on top of it that's not right that's not scriptural jesus produces a life that's in conformity to the word not in conformity to our thoughts not in conformity to the world to the word that's the jesus that we worship that we're serving people say well that's not my jesus okay you have your own jesus you make up your own jesus but it's an idol jesus has been manifested today we don't get to make up what we like we don't get to make up the doctrines we don't get to say oh we like this one and like that one and this one's okay and that one's okay go ahead go ahead you're doing exactly what they did when the white horse rider was riding don't listen to the voice of the white horse rider there's a word that's been vindicated and manifested we have to take it back to the bible we have to use spiritual discernment to understand what's thus saith the lord but when brother brandon preaches something for 20 years it's not our job to redefine it to change it to say oh that's wrong no god vindicated that word and he expects disa he he says i want you to obey that word when when the prophet deuteronomy 18 when a prophet comes preaches that preaches his brings his message he says those who don't listen i will require it of them in other words they're going to answer to god at the day of judgment for turning down and rejecting the manifested word amen let's let's stand and pray heavenly father i thank you so much for your word lord help us to not conform you to our thinking lord but to be conformed to what's been proven and vindicated help us lord forgive us our sins forgive us our unbelief lord cleanse our hearts father correct us and help us lord to walk more lord in that image and likeness which he created us to be we ask your blessing upon the worship upon the preaching of the word may your name be lifted up and glorified we ask these things in the name of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you
