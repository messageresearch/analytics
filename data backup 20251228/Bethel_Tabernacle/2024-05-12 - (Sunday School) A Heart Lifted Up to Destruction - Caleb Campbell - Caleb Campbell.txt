[Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] good morning God bless you all this morning good to be in the house of the Lord let's just all stand and we're going to open up our Bibles this morning and turn to the book of 2 chonicles chapter 26 2 Chronicles chapter 26 and we're going to read 1 through five and then catch two verses later on there and it says then all the people of Judah took Uzziah who was 16 years old and made him King in the room of his father amziah he built eloth and restored it to Judah after that the King slept with his fathers 16 years old was Uzziah when he began to Reign and he reigned 5 and2 years in Jerusalem his mother's name also was jaia of Jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father amziah did and he sought God in the days of zachar who had understanding in the visions of God and as long as he sought the Lord God made him to prosper and then we're going to pick up two more verses 15 and 16 and it says and he made in Jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers upon the bull rocks to shoot arrows and great stones with all and his name spread far abroad for he was marvelously helped till he was strong and I want us to notice in verse 5 it said God made him prosper in everything that he did and then now going into verse 16 it says but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his Destruction for he transgressed against the Lord his God and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense and my title this morning is going to be a heart lifted up to destruction so let's just go before the Lord Heavenly Father we just thank you for for this day we thank you for the reading of your word Lord we just pray that you would father have preeminence in the service today Lord we just come today to hear from you Lord God in Sunday school Lord Jesus just teach us a lesson father we love you and we ask these things in Jesus name amen God bless you as you take your seats this morning some of this story uh may sound familiar if you've listened to the sermon influence lately uh brother random preaches it several times um just for a brief history this morning the king we're talking about is King Uzziah and we read that uzziah's father's name was amziah and amiah had turned from the Lord towards the end of his leadership in Judah and the the Bible said that he had actually conspired against the Lord and he was slain because of it and his son Uzziah was 16 at the time and he became king Amen in his in instead and the Bible says that he sought God in the days of Zachariah and as long as he sought the Lord and stayed with the word that was given to him as long as he stayed with that word god prospered him and that's something that that's always needed in prosperity is constant humility amen constant uh reflection on on what's important and what's what's what we're supposed to keep our eyes focused on uh we're going to get a little into uh uzziah's life and also the prophet Isaiah's life God was with King Uzziah most of his life much of his life and he greatly Pro prospered everything that he did the Bible says that he went to war with the Philistines and just to dive into some history this morning of just how much the Lord was with him the Bible says that he broke the walls of gath and the walls of jab and the walls of ashod and these were all these great kingdoms around them at the time and then on top of that the Bible says that he built cities about ashdod and among the Philistines So Not only was he successful to defeat those enemies but God gave him so much grace and strength that he built cities among the enemies which showed how greatly feared and revered his kingdom was at the time amongst the ranks of all of these great Kingdoms in the land and it goes on to say that God helped him against the Arabians and the Mims um and we're reading this out of 2 Chronicles 26 all of these victories that God helped King Uzziah achieve during his Reign what happened is his name began spreading abroad even entering all the way into Egypt he began to develop a name for himself you know and I was reading um uh in Deuteronomy lately and something that struck me about Moses is how humble Moses remained during his time you know the Bible says that he became like a god to the people he was so involved in some of the greatest histories in the Bible and the most incredible victories you know with a crooked staff he he went in into the strongest nation in the world and yet throughout all these Miracles and all these victories he was always pointing back to God and that's something with leadership uh like these Kings had or these prophets or these Great Men it wasn't anything that these men did it was simply God doing something in their life that God using them to fulfill his purpose and that's the trouble that King Uzziah began to face he had all of these victories amen and and if you're if you're not careful and catch this if you're not careful blessings are an amazing thing that the Lord does in our lives amen but if we let those blessings turn us from the things of God it begins to influence you away from humility and dependence on God and you as Solomon would put it would start leaning on your own understanding of things and we'll catch that very thing cuz it caused this righteous King to catch leprosy and eventually die um moving further in chapter 26 it says that he built Towers in the desert and he built many great Wells and he had cattle he had great fields and incredible Vineyards in the mountain and his army had grown Mighty in number it had grown to be well over 300,000 men at the time and it said that even these specially they crafted these specially built engines to be high upon Towers so his military was not only on land but it was in the sky these engines they shot large stones and arrows at Great distances among the enemies what was going on was is it was a revolutionary thing in that time to have those engines in war and it was something that God was doing to prosper his kingdom and prosper his land but catch this in second chronicles 26:15 it says and he made in Jerusalem engines in vented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bull rocks to shoot arrows and great stones and his name was Spread spread far above and he was marvelously helped he was marvelously helped until he became strong look what happens when he didn't give humility he didn't bring himself to subjection into the humility of God through what was God was prospering in his life watch what he did he began to forget the import things and how it was God that was the one that was doing these Mighty things you know what happened his prayer life started decrease his study of scripture started to slack and then the most incredible thing is the when Pride stepped in this next verse catches us because when you're not if you're not careful you can be like King Uzziah in verse 16 when God chooses to prosper us we have to ensure that our eyes never get off what what he has in store for us we have to make sure that we're constantly in reflection this is God reflecting off me into whatever he's causing me to do it's not me I'm not doing anything it's God Amen it's God in your life doing the things that he needs to do amen but watch what happens in verse 16 if you want to put that up but when he was strong catch that but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his Destruction for he transgressed against the Lord as God and he went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense when he was strong his heart was lifted up Proverbs 16 you know that quotation of that famous saying Pride goeth Before Destruction and a hotty spirit before it fall he let himself think that it was his name and his power and his Prestige that was what caused all of these great victories and watch we want to catch these next few verses what happened is is that he got himself into this place where he had this position and he thought because he had this position now he can take the place of a priest and he can go in and burn incense when that was not what he was called to do and watch where his pride comes in verse 16 we'll go into verse 17 and Azariah the priest went in after him and with him four score Priests of the Lord that were Valiant men and they with stod Uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee Uzziah to burn incense unto the Lord but to the priests the son of Aaron that are consecrated to burn incense to go out of the sanctuary for thou Hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honor from the Lord God then Uzziah was wroth correction came to the king but Uzziah was wroth and had a sensor in his hand to Burnt incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord from beside the incense altar instantly God gave him leprosy there and Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from then yay himself also had to go out because the Lord had smitten him and catch this verse and Uzziah the King was a leper until the day of his death and dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of the Lord and jotham his son was over the King's house judging the people of the land so you catch this look how he went from this man of great Prestige and a mighty man of the land and he he won these wars and he had all these victories and it was just he it was just incredible and he let his pride get the better of him and God struck him with Leprosy right there and he stayed a leper until the day of his death says he was cut off from the house of the Lord he couldn't even attend to his Affairs as a king any longer it says that his son jotham was over the King's house and was in charge of all the affairs from that time and you know your your first look at this you think well you know he was trying to do a service to the Lord but you look at his attitude toward it and not only his attitude but his position his heart was lifted up towards destruction and then he went into the temple so watch what happens what is the intention of your heart you I just listened to brother brandom and he said catch the intention of what what it is that you're doing and that's what you're going to gauge on what you need to make that decision what's your intention of it his heart was lifted up towards destruction then he went into the temple you know that was that was the job of the priest and he had gotten to such a point in his life that he lifted himself and really there's just a great lesson in this you know God uses men and he uses women to accomplish tasks and and I've made I've made that point several times over the last couple of months um but this is this is a major butt remember it's not you that it's the one accomplishing those tasks it's God Amen it's God in you amen it's God through you Moses didn't have it in him to go and to deliver Egypt but God did and he used Moses and through Moses he accomplished so many things incredible Feats in history you just you go read I mean we we all know the scriptures go read the book of Exodus just it's incredible God was using that man and God God found a man by the name of King Uzziah and he did that was was right in the sight of the Lord he conquered many enemies you know he crafted these armies and this groundbreaking Machinery you know groundbreaking military strategy but somewhere along the way some some thought that he started to get in his mind started to focus away from God and away from well you know in verse 5 God said that he prospered me in everything that I did but somewhere along the lines in verse 16 my my heart became lifted up against my own thoughts amen against myself um or towards myself I'm sorry and you know that's that's uh that's exactly how how King Nebuchadnezzar was humbled he he exalted himself and then God humbled him so low to become like an animal for seven years um so we're going to read in Isaiah chapter 6 and we're going to pick this story up where Isaiah picks things up in his book so if you want to turn in your Bible to Isaiah the 6th chapter I chose not to read it for an opening verse so we could read it now and if you read the top it says Isaiah's transforming vision in the year and this is important to catch this in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his faith face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts and the whole Earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then I said woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged that's one thing I want to catch here in a few minutes my thine iniquity is taken away iniquity and thy sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then I said here am I send me brother brandom says in the sermon influence in 1963 paragraph 165 he says then notice then after the confession after the cleansing then came comes the commission then was the commission after confessed and cleansed it was then that clean Isaiah answered God and said here am I send me after he was cleansed confessed cleansed by the fire then the clean Isaiah was ready for work he was ready to be an example he was ready to have to put his life out so that others could be influenced by him but he says in paragraph 166 but until he had confessed it until he was cleansed then he was a very poor influence and look what brother random says just a puppet for the king just a puppet and in Ser we would see Jesus 1963 brother Bram says you can live with someone so long and around them until you take up their ways and it's good for us not to run off and live with the world but stay with Jesus until we can reflect his life catch this his life be reflected in our life and that's the way those disciples were then they knew that they had been around Jesus because they talked like him he's referring to acts when they had they said that he was like they were around Jesus they acted like them he healed like them and every answer was like them they were inspired like them and they know that he was living in them that's what we should be all the time as Believers at they acting like him cuz if you associate with someone so long amen now I want I look at this point that the prophet makes you can live with someone so long you can hang around somebody so long you can have friends or acquaintances for such a time and you'll begin to mimic their behavior whether you like it or not that is in our nature this is one of the great importances of who you surround yourself with is why it's so important because whether or not you think you will you will become like them amen that's why it's so important and so vital to spend as much time with the Lord Jesus cu the more time you spend with him the more that you can become like him amen it it matters not Prophet or no prophet he was a he was a prophet and it said that he was a puppet for the king God had to Humble himself in that amen and the prophet our Prophet brother Brandon picks this up in several places saying that the Isaiah that Isaiah had been influenced by that King Uzziah he had been so blessed King Uzziah had been so blessed of the Lord in everything that he did and they had become friends and then Isaiah watched as he fell to his destruction and died as a leopard because it was in the year that King Uzziah died and then it was in that same year that the scripture refers to as Isaiah's transforming Vision he stood there in the presence of the Lord in verse 5 uh you know the that's what the header is is the effect of the vision it says woe is me for I am undone Isaiah says mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts amen and his eyes had and his influence was was so focused on King Uzziah and everything that God was prospering in his life that somewhere along the lines his eyes was off of God and it was now on King Uzziah even though it was God doing those things through King Uzziah the prophet Isaiah's eyes now lost focus of God and were focused on King Uzziah his eyes had just been so so lost that it was then that Isaiah could say that my eyes Now Behold The King this King had died now my eyes behold the king in brother Brenham influence another one 1964 he says now the effects of such a vision and we're closing start praying for the sick in a few minutes now the effects of such a vision what did the effects do to this Prophet I wonder about a preacher I wonder about an evangelist or a pastor look at what this Vision look what a vision of this done what he had seen what happened to the self-styled Uzziah and then though a great man that God had honored the great thing they seen it dead what effects did it have on this Prophet iniquity and he says what is Iniquity iniquity is something that you know it's wrong and still holding to it when you know your Creeds are wrong and you still hold to it that's iniquity but when he confessed that he was wrong there was a cleansing power that took that took place he took a coal and did you notice um what happened was when Isaiah got caught away from the influences because it was it was a year that that he had the vision he finally had gotten into the presence of God and it was at this time that Isaiah was given this Great Commission to go amen here am I send me go into and fulfill what I have in place for your life you know and I think sometimes bringing it down to us is we get so wrapped up in our lives and the influences because it doesn't have to be a person it can be a place that you go to it can be a thing that you listen to it can be something that you watch influences get caught up in our life and they're holding on to us when God is trying to send us into action amen he's trying to send us he's saying go who will go for me who will go and that next verse he says verse 9 he says go and tell my people hear ye and indeed but understand not and see indeed but perceive not and it was the very next chapter I I caught this and the Lord just opened this up to me it was the very next chapter when the prophecy comes forth out of a vision that Behold a virgin shall conceive possibly one of the greatest prophecies ever to come forth because it beheld the coming King it beheld our savior it beheld Jesus the Christ Isaiah had that in the next chapter and it wasn't until he could get his eyes off of a king and get his eyes on the king that God would give him such a vision to go forward because I've got these prophecies I've got these things that I want you to do but your eyes are not focused on me your eyes are focused on aching and and look at what the prophet says here I love this now he Isaiah he's referring to is cleansed now he is cleansed and confessed and called and commissioned to be a prophet and God let him write the entire Bible in 66 books of the Bible there is 66 chapters in Isaiah starts in Genesis then he comes to the middle of the book come John the Baptist goes Plum over into the Millennium reign in Isaiah 65 and 66 that's right the Revelation he wrote the entire outline of the Bible why because he humbled himself when he saw the presence of God what did he do and his after he did that and humbled himself was cleansed and set aside cleansed and commissioned he had influenced millions of people here in this book and Isaiah's fting that influenced me men I'm sorry men from this time to on brother benham's just making the the statement that the book of Isaiah has ministered to men and women for for a millennia for hundreds for a thousand years and inspired and done all these things but it wasn't he couldn't get past chapter six until he got his eyes off of aching and got his eyes on the king he humbled himself where you let the glory uh we can't let let ourselves be like the that King get like that King and let the glory shift Focus From God to you or or let your ability or or something that you did you may be and listen to this Saints you may be in a season of blessing and everything you may be touching may be blessed from God just like King Uzziah and blessings are wonderful but listen you need to keep pointing to him amen don't let them hinder you don't let them get you off track sometimes s we let blessings distract our prayer life you know maybe we're not in a financial need at the time or we're not in some need of a physical healing or we we don't have need of overcoming power of some mental anxiety at the time but then that can lead to complacency if you're not careful amen we need to keep our eyes focused don't lose focus and remember that our life is to magnify the Lord Jesus Christ it's to preach him crucified amen Paul would say I didn't come to you and Excellency of speech or in wisdom of man I came with a determined heart to preach Jesus save him crucified amen our life isn't about how much money we can accumulate or the prestige that's what was King uz eyes problem he got Prestige he got money he got nice things he got military strategy and those were all nice blessings but they were from God and His Eyes got off focus amen it was in two verses it was he was marvelously helped till he was strong but when he was strong REM remember the psalmist would say our whence cometh our help our Help Cometh From The Lord who make Heaven and Earth amen and just picking up there in Isaiah one of God's Great Angels took the coal from off the Altar and burning it with the fire of the word of God and I love how how it's put there because the word puts it it wasn't just a coal but it was a live coal it was fresh out of the fire amen and it said that this hath cleansed your lips thine iniquity is taken away and thy sins are purged amen I know this is a Sunday school lesson but Purge my iniquities Purge my sins and then after he was purged then he heard the word of the Lord and it must have sounded like the sound of many Waters amen whom shall I send look at the Zeal of the Prophet after that being in that presence knowing that he had done such wrong but yet he stood there praising and it was at that point that God was ready to use him amen and the scripture that I I chose to end on this morning comes out of Psalms 119 I I may do a lesson on it at some point because it's just so striking everything in Psalms 119 points to words along the effect of teach me the way of thy statutes establish Thy word unto your servant and in Psalms 13 Psalms 119 verse 133 says the psalmist writes order my steps in thy word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me order my steps in thy word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me how do you keep yourselves humble how how do we keep ourselves away from iniquity he writes it so simple order every step you take in the word of God keep it ever before you write it on your lamp post write it on your bed post and God will keep those things away from you amen let's just stand and pray Heavenly Father we just want to thank you for this day Lord we thank you for the word we just pray that father we can Lord just come into your presence Lord just once more Lord just cleanse our hearts and cleanse our minds father wash Us by the water of the word today I pray you bless Lord your people father be with us the remainder of this service Lord we're just here under expectation lord always Lord an excitement Lord to come to the house of God just speak to us we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
