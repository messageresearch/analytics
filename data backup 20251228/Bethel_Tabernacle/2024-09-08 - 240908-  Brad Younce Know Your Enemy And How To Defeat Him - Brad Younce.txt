God we serve how many's happy to be in church this morning like the I hear it say like to say how he's glad to be the church not just the building but the Church of allight Mighty God living through us well when I was asked to take this morning service I didn't think anybody was going to be here he tells me on Friday that he plans change I try to get him to take this morning he says no Then somebody snuck in the back door back here and I said oh yeah you're here you're preaching this morning nope it's ordained we just wanted do our part yes if you have your Bibles let's turn to Ephesians chapter 6 and we'll read verse 10 down to for 13 for now finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God amen that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against brother and sister he's got this split up in two categories here we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places so he's going to tell us again wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day to withand in this evil day and having done all to stand may God add His blessings as you can have your seats for a title this morning I want to speak on know your enemy and how to defeat him I'm going go ahead and start this timer brother Matt he's he's talk I'm going to be a little different than brother Matt I'm G to set mine for 45 minutes it'll be an hour and 45 time I'm done but know your enemy and how to V him let's go ahead and let the devil know this morning that I hate him how many hates the devil we have every right to hate the devil he makes us sick he he causes us lose our joy he tries to take our peace from us he tries to take our happiness he tries to take your children I hate him you'll say well you're not supposed to hate anybody you're right I don't hate anybody I hate nobody you our pastor stands up here and says the devil ain't nobody so this morning I hate nobody I hate the devil and you guess what he hates you too so we got that out of the way right because God says Esau I hated Jacob I love so I have every right to hate him so you're in a battle right there's something that we must wear for this battle you can't wear what you want to you got to be dressed for a battle that's what we're in we're not no picnic we ain't got us a a bucket of chicken we're not going down here to Beach and we're not having a picnic we're in a battle and you have to wear something we can't wear little tight little women woo Hallelujah you can't wear your little tight skirts and your high heels and expect to fight a devil you're supposed to be running at the Devil you can't run at the Devil with high heels you know Guys these little baggy shorts little tight skinny jeans you can't run after a devil with that stuff on we can't look like the world you got to have some to wear I'm sorry but says you can't walk this road like that finally my brethren I'm G read it again be strong in the Lord in the power of His might put on the whole armor we just can't take what we want I'm just going to put the helmet on I'm good how you going to protect this you got to have have it I'll put the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil put on put you know how you went to the closet this morning to get dressed for church you walked in says I'm going to wear this unless you if you're like me wife what do I wear with this shirt I put it on so I put on this suit and came to church so that's what we're supposed to do with the whole armor of God we're to put it on to be ued I like that word endued yes go ye into the Jerusalem and carry there until you be endued with power so he's telling us you're getting ready to put something on you're getting ready to get dressed you've got to put on the whole armor complete armor you have the armor for fighting for protecting yourself the armor of God is that what he has provided for you like I said minut ago we're not on a picnic we're in a battle picnics are for weak back Christians it don't mean you're going to go go home and grab you AK-47 those that have them and we're going to go to battle we're not going to do that but we're going to get some brother BR says God's going to choose for his army the best weapon that could be given and he chose it and it was his word God gave his army the best equipment that it could could ever use and ever could use and would never have to be changed he's never changed it since you don't improve it it Remains the Same it's God's words that he fortified his people with no matter how many things Satan gets and Satan is constantly getting things he's got more things today than he had when I was a young person he's got these things now when before you had to go sneak somewhere but now you should stay home where nobody can see you Satan has a lot of devices if I want to you know sneak around we did have headphones we had our little walkman's we had our little cassette tapes when you go somewhere you got whole case of C tapes you're carrying with you that we used to listen to what are you listening to a good music hello test test one two we'll move on how many things any other Army gets or anything it can never take the place of God's choice his word he gave them his word his promise and said stay with it that's the best he could be known so we're to put on the whole armor this armor is the Holy Ghost we're not to go armed partly we just can't have the Holy Ghost on our spirit expect to make it in we've got to get the Holy Ghost down inside of our soul you know in in a country in a real war a country don't send a soldiers out with no weapons okay you're going to go fight but we're not gonna give you anything to fight with God's not going to put you in this battle and not give you something to fight with he's prepared his best for you he's not going to send you out with something that's not going to help you he's not going to send you some more Baptist Doctrine or even some message Doctrine he's going to send you out with his word he's going to send you out with something you can actually fight with a person needs all the armor to fight the battle of the Lord and if he lacks one of these weapons that God has appointed you are defeated we have armor protecting every every part I like the way Paul says every part except our back he didn't put nothing on our back because we're not supposed to be facing no devil we're supposed to be looking right at him like here we're not supposed to be running from him don't turn your back on no devil because he he'll stab you it's to show that the Christian should never quit but always face the enemy I me we always there's times we y'all feel like just quitting am I the only one sometimes you feel like I'm I'm just I'm done hallelujah you're quiet why we're always to face the enemy there's no cowards in God's Army we're not to be running from the devil we got to run at the Devil don't let him get the surprise tack you do it he likes to surprise you put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil the word WS means that is traced out method that which is well laid out skill cunning the devil's skillful he's cunning he knows you better than you know yourself WS of the devil trying to same do the same thing he did to Eve surely God has said he added one word to it the same tactic he used in the Garden of Eden he tries to use today but he's looking at a second Eve that won't fall that won't fall to his cunning lies Satan doesn't carry on an open Warfare he's not going to confront you face to face the face but he likes to sneak around you know you heard of gorilla Warfare he likes to sneak around the bushes where you can't see him and look around the corner at you attack you when you're not ready attack you when you're at the weakest moment attack you when you're at in bed at night all the lights are off and you're on your phone what you looking at Mama's not here daddy's not around woo hallelujah it's necessary to be constantly armed to meet him you got to be ready whenever the tack is made you'll say well I'm not fighting anything today praise God but be ready Monday's coming that'll be a sermon you can preach one time Monday's coming a man who has to contend with a visible enemy may feel safe if he only prepares him to meet him in the open field but it's different if the enemy is invisible he'll still Among Us like I said he'll sneak around in the bushes what a foe we have a great foe that we're fighting against and almost all of the Christian struggle is a Warfare against his strategies and WS he plans everything he said I'm going to get you when you least expect it I'm going to get you so we always got to be watching and waiting he likes to get you in your mind when suddenly you come across this old website brother Brown was a false prophet there's things that he said was wrong he likes to mess with your mind you know what this message ain't right what if brother Bram was a false prophet what what what what if what if what if he likes to get the young ones who ain't got the Holy Ghost he likes to tell them stuff in their minds these people are crazy he'll invite you to Pleasures that seems to be harmless and lead you into indulge in sin until we have gone so far that we cannot Retreat he has offered everything to you he's promised you a life full of joy no more fighting no more you you'll just be free I've known people who left this message says I am so free of course you are the devil ain't fighting you no more Hallelujah don't give in don't give up keep fighting don't give in to the young to the to the devil young people you are GNA take our places one day some one of you might be a pastor here one of you might be a song leader one of's about to be a Sunday school teacher whatever you may be but don't give in the devil stand against those that try to corrupt you you've been taught cuz the of child the way they should go they should never depart so if you're taught right there's hope you know just like the devil tried the first church he had them killed he I'll shut him up didn't work did it he thought it did because then then all a sudden through the Dark Ages you look it looked very Bleak and then here come a man said the just shall live by Faith here comes the Army starting to build back up for we wrestle not against flesh in blood that word wrestle means you know what wrestle is a contest between two in which each Endeavor to throw the other which is decided when the Victor is able to hold his opponent down with his hand on his neck you see wrestling that fake stuff you seen some real stuff too what they try to do they try to pin you down so they'll pin you down I say I think it's three seconds so hold your shoulders and neck down for three seconds you're the Victor we're in a battle we've got to wrestle with the devil I'm not going to pull up brother Aaron up here and wrestle him there's no way so brother Aaron we're not wrestling against flesh and blood like I said when you're wrestling the go is to pin your opponent to the ground you have to get the opponent on the ground you just can't grab his leg I won no he's still free no you got to put his neck on the ground you got to hold him down you get the point and the referee counts one two three Victor but in this battle you pin one devil down you might have you might be fighting with Lion demon your whole life all of a sudden you have victory over him and you put him down you're like thank the Lord I overcome that devil I'm free then a gossip demon pops on you demon after demon after de you you you think you're winning but here comes another one so we got 200,000 after so let's keep pinning the devil down let's hold him down they'll not be not one devil conquered sorry about that every devil will be conquered when we lead this world even death we'll have death pinned under us only thing death is is something to get us out of here but how are we going to win this match we've got to it's not power it won't be by our power brother Mark I can't do this on my own there's no way that I Brad Ys can beat the devil I've got to have a hidden power from down on the inside of me a h just like Samson had Samson had a hidden power when they had him all chained up and him sitting right here making fun of him he looks over and sees a jaw onone he grabs it and slays a thousand Philistines a hidden Power Burst forth out of him a hidden power come out of shamgar one day when 600 Philistines come after him he got tired of the devil stealing his Joy he got tired of the de devil stealing his Peace So what he do a hidden power from on the inside of him you've got the same hidden power inside of you if you got the Holy Ghost you've got the same hidden power of God that could overcome every devil same power David had when he killed Goliath the same power Jesus had when he died and Rose up on the out of the Grave on the third day that same hidden powers in you so what devil can stand in front of you not one wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand to stand against stand therefore having your loins G about he's going to give us some stuff to put on you got to have your breastplate then you got to have your feet shot with the preparation of the pieace and I probably said this here before the Roman soldiers their shoes had spikes on them so when they marched they had firm foundation so wherever they marched their feet was sticken you have spikes on you today spiritual spikes on your feet not only do you have the devil Pinn down by your by your hand you've got him by your feet you're marching you're walking on the devil so wherever your foot goes that's where the devil is just dragging what's got you what's bothering you this morning put it under your feet and drag him around don't lift him up so if the devil's not there he's out of his place but you got to remember that the devil has no Authority outside of that which God has given him he knows he has a short rain so he's on a rampage he's seeking whom he may devour he knows he has a short Reign you know the devil's like a dog behind a fence all he can do is just bark long as he behind the fence you're safe as long as you stay away from that fence but once you open the door and let the devil in that dog will eat you up leave the devil on the other side of the fence watch him he'll try to draw you into his trap it's like I think I think I did tell this here before about this dog behind a fence I went by a fence one day that had a dog behind it gate was closed I just kick that fence just RW that dog up make him mad so he was that dog ever gets me I'm I'm hurting but I come by that fence one day and didn't know that the gate was open I got out there just in time he tells you that the pleasures of sin is so much fun tells you that you don't have to live this word you can listen to what you want to it's got the name Jesus in the song yeah but you're going down the road headbanging all right amen he uses anything and everything that he can do to bring us down above all take the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts not just some of them not all of them all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God pray in always our greatest weapon is prayer prayer changes things the word of God will I love this saying the word of God will defeat the Devil anytime any place anywhere under any circumstance but the only way you've got to get the Holy Ghost you got to get the full armor of God cuz when the weakest Christian gets on their knees to pray Satan trembles you have to be watching constantly guarding ourselves watching and studying the devil you've got to study him CU he sure studies you he knows a lot about you but you got to understand his ws and what he's going to throw at you because he's got that one punch at you and he knows what each one of us what punch we got all right I know what I'm doing we have to be equipped with the same armor that the apostles had the Holy Ghost but before you take it put this Armor All You must see your need of it and that you are in a battle you got to recognize you're in a battle and you got to recognize that he is mightier than we are talk about the Devil he's mightier than we are by ourselves not talk about God with us we are no match for him unless we put on that whole armor of God and place our trust trust Into His holy name he's not going to fight fair he won't give you even break he's a liar he's a deceiver he'll come with you at all kinds of different disguises he'll come at disguise as a brother or a sister want to cause trouble you watch out you watch out out he'll come to you in many different disguises titing you to disobey the Lord and he's a lot smarter than you are there's a reason why Saints should be strong in the Lord and why they should put on the whole armor of God and prepare for battle since our enemies are described as not flesh and blood for we wrestle not against flesh our enemy isn't each other it's the devil when a brother and sister does something to you it's not that brother and sister it's the devil we don't need to add our brother and sisters to the fight we need our brother and sisters to help us fight 1 Corinthians 9:25 says every man that striveth for Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to tame the corruptible Crown but we and Inc corruptible so Paul said I therefore so run not as uncertainty he said I'm run a race and I know I'm going to win so fight fight I not as one who beateth the air you know you're growing up you pretend like you're in a boxing match you know you all going around all the time and just kind of boxing you're not hit nobody you're Shadow Boxing Paul says I'm not Shadow Boxing cuz when whenever I swing my hands I'm hitting something he says I fight not has one beaten the air so he's making contact with whoever he's punching but I keep under my body when I see I got this definition last night keep under it means to beat Black and Blue to Smite to craw to cause bruises it's like a boxer when they're punching at you they're always aiming at your face they're punching right here because this right here is easy to turn black and blue to beat one out to wear one out so I beat my body black and blue to bring it unto subjection so I'm going to beat my body into a subjection black and blue subjection means I'm going to enslave it so my body is going to do what I tell it to if it don't I'm going to beat it black and blue you're going to get up and go to church this morning you're going to Worship the Lord this morning when a song leader says raise your hands and worship God I'm going to raise my hand you're going to do it if you don't you're going to pay because I'm going to beat you black and blue but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest by any means when I have preached to others myself may be a cast away subjection that's the only time this word is even used in the Bible bringing this body under subjection it's going to do what I said that's overcoming when from the inside of you you control what happens right here to overcome but you got to know who you're fighting against first Peter says be sober and be vigilant because your adversary your brother your adversary your sister your adversary your husband or wife but know your adversary the devil walketh about seeking whom he may devour he's not our friend he's our enemy and I love this quote I read it a lot I think brother Caleb might have read it some not too long ago overcome means to recognize the devil in every one one of his tricks you know a lot of people say there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil and he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he is a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that you have in you has already overcame him and by his grace you are more than a match for him that's real overcoming when you recognize but by ourselves we can't do it we must have someone greater down on the inside not only is God here this morning but the devil's here too the devil's the most faithful member in this church he always feels like coming to church cuz he knows what he's going to do he comes more than we do hello have we ever seen God have you ever seen the effects of him though we feel his effects we feel him when he comes down to a service when his anointing is here you can feel the presence of almighty God you can feel that Joy you can feel that peace but y'all can feel the effects of the devil tries to bring you drown tries to get you trying to get you addicted to the things of the world we'll go ahead and tell him today brother Mark I'm addicted I got addiction I'm GNA confess it to you I'm addicted to church I'm addicted to God I'm Addicted To His holy ghost I'm addicted to his Joy I'm addicted to his peace this is the kind of addiction your pastor can approve of but we're in a battle to know your enemy we must know who it is we fight against you know Satan has fought against God his people since the beginning of time you know Satan before his name was Satan he was Lucifer and he was a great cheram up in heaven a cherubim guarded a throne cherubim guarded The Mercy Seat he protected the throne and you couldn't approach the throne without coming through Lucifer that's what kind of a being he was was Ezekiel 28 says Thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering and he says the workmanship of thy tabs and thy pipes were prepared in thee the day thou was created Created so anything created has an end we weren't created we go way back before the devil does we go back before there even was a star we were in the back parts of God's mind before he even started this thing so we always were with God cuz we got the eternal life in US eternal life is God's life living through you Zoe we always were Eternal so this right here Luther was putting in charge of the music in heaven he says Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverest I have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire how can somebody do that and turn out the way he was thou was perfect in the way in thy ways from the day thou was created until iniquity was found in you Isaiah 14:12 I know this is very familiar how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning Lucifer the lightbearer The Shining one if you look this is the only time this Lucifer was mentioned in the bible Lucifer had a name change so you find him on later on he's called Satan the Devil the Dragon the old serpent he lost his identification in heaven we also had us a name change we've been we was one day called Miss Baptist Miss Catholic Miss message one day we got married to Jesus Christ we had us a name change B said did you know Satan was co-equal with God sure was all but a Creator he was everything he stood the right hand of God in the heavens the great leading cherubim Satan was the original Archangel of God he once dwelt in heaven he once was the greatest person in heaven outside of God he was God's right-hand man to Fellowship but what happened he got puffed up in his heart he wanted to build a United Kingdom a greater Splendor and seemly more cultured a greater Kingdom than Michael Christ had so he could do anything but create but he know he wanted something more he didn't like being second in command he wanted to be the boss man like what in the world made him think he could take over God's throne but he got all puffed up and full of Pride he thought he could do God's job Satan Saidi so tired of all this overshadow on the throne it's my turn to sit there I'm going to exalt myself above the sons of God I want to rule over them I will be their God first sin was in heaven Satan fell through Pride that should tell us what happens if we get Pride prideful God will do to us just like he did to Satan B said Pride such a cursed thing so awful so evil is pride he says there's another little door called Pride oh what a horrible little black devil is all pinned up in there thinking you're better than somebody else he said I'd rather degrade my social standing in the community than to rub my name off the Lamb's Book of Life amen that little pride holds him out oh Jesus I'll join the church I'll accept you but don't look into my closet you can sit in the chair by the door but don't look in my closet then he can't be your lord he has got to have access to every room in the house every compartment all the little secret things of Life he's got to have access to every bit then he becomes Lord so here comes your first sin for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit in the Mount of the congregation I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high the original selfie I I I he probably no doubt took his iPhone woo thank God I got a Samsung Galaxy it's my pull pit this morning and take a picture no doubt him right here by God's Throne this is my place right here I'm G to sit here that's who we're fighting against but thank God yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit the first battle that were fought was not fought on Earth it was fought in heaven Michael had his angels against Lucifer and they were kicked out of heaven then the great Army of the devil and all his imps fell upon the Earth and God know there's going to be a battle I believe he know from the very beginning everything that would ever be he's infinite that great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels the first battle was in heaven so sin and did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then he was thrown down from heaven that battle got brought down to Earth where Satan walking the Earth seeing what God would was doing he heard that God wanted to live in a man somehow he found out maybe one of the days he was overshadowing God's throne and God maybe was looking through his book through his album he seen Chris Watkins they was like who's that I ain't telling you just showed Satan just enough to wet his appetite Satan says something's going to happen happen that somehow he found out that God was going to live in man and so what' he do he injected his into Eve but said the saddest scripture in the Bible don't get nervous I'm taking this off now man up a little bit said the devil works the same way he comes and tries to find something what God has did and then try to find something to counteract it but God never has to change his because he gave them his word at the beginning he's infinite he cannot change it's still his word today it never changes from his word there he is in the word his church is fortified by the word word his first person was fortified Eve but when she stopped just a moment to listen to the devil tactics so what was his tactics he said it's reasoning she just reasoned so whenever you hear anything that reasons against the word get away from it it's the devil don't care how oldfashioned it is how strange it looks When God says so it's settled eternally get away from anything that reasons against the word so what happened we're going skipping a lot but going into Jesus when Jesus was on the earth because Matthew 4:1 say Jesus was led up into by the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil I'm gonna throw this in here so Temptation doesn't come from God it comes from the devil so when Jesus was up there for 40 days and 40 nights he was hungered and so when the tempter came to him says if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread he could have done it Satan used the word a part of the word on Jesus but Jesus is going to fulfill the rest of it he said you didn't say all of it yeah I could turn the stone into the bread but it's also written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God R says yes Thomas after you seen me you felt me and put my hand put your hands in my side you believed but how much greater is their reward who have never seen SE and yet believe he's a good God he'll give you desire of your heart I like this that's the death stroke to Satan when a man takes God at his word that'll kill Satan every time that's the hardest hdden that Satan can get when a man will take God at his word so then the devil took him up to the holy city and sit upon the Pinnacle of the temple if thou be the Son of God throw yourself down because it is written the angels have been charged over thee last you dash your foot against the stone will catch you before you fall Jesus just looks at him again says but it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and again the devil taken him into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them all this will I give you all you got to do is bow down to me the devil tried to give Jesus all the kingdoms without a Calvary because the whole world is controlled by Satan every Kingdom in the world is ruled by Satan we hate to think that that's the scripture the enemy taken our Lord into a high exceeding Mountain exceeding high and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and and he said they're all mine he wasn't ly they were all his Jesus stayed with the word he knew he'd fall air to them I thank God that he didn't that Jesus went on the calvary to claim this world because where would we be brother Travis where would you be this morning if Jesus had bowed right then and took the kingdoms he took it without a Calvary none of us would be saved but Jesus was tempted to do so he knew his in he knew what was going to happen three and a half years down the road Jesus could with his power flipped the devil but he didn't use his power right he used his word he didn't overcome the devil as God he overcome him as a man to show you how you're going to do it Jesus said get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God in him only shalt thou serve and then the devil leaveth him and behold the Angels Came and ministered unto him but say showed that how the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan with just the word you mean Jesus became a weak Christian think about it if he showed that how the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan with the word what that make what what make him at that moment it's like when he was in the Garden of Eden when the spirit of God left him and he was sitting there crying like a man if it be your will let this cut pass from me he wanted something else but thank God he overcome himself not thy will but my but not my will but thy will be done he had powers he could have smoked Satan any way he wanted to but he didn't use it he just took the word and defeated him with it it's written it's written everywhere it's written so he defeated Satan by the word that shows that you can do the same thing this morning what is bothering you what's bothering you I don't know what it is you know what it is and you know how to defeat it it might be hey make these Stones bread we know how to answer that question don't we Bow Down and Worship me well we know how to answer that question so if you got questions we've got answers but we don't read it enough Move Along we believe that God was Tabernacle in the flesh so when he met the devil he never tried to use any of his powers yet the father could have spoke anything through him and he never used it he used the father's written word he never used his powers but he used God's word it is written man shall not live by bread alone so he tacked Jesus in his mind just like he tacks us he tried to get Jesus again in the garden to Gethsemane when God left him we know the story we ain't got time uhoh my watch is vibrating so Jesus for our sins died and went to hell we all know the story very well so he walks up to hell and knocks on the door on brother said on down into the region of demons on down to the very Gates of Hell Jesus took our sins if you got burdens today bring it up to the Altar and lay it on him because he already took it down to hell for you he took our burdens he looked down a year 2024 and knew what we'd be burdened down with and said devil I'm going to go ahead and give you Ethan's burdens he's not he's it's going to be 2,000 years before he's even born but I'm GNA go ahead and give you everything that he goes through he took everything you go through then and gave it back to the devil oh I my bird I'm burdened down by this what happened to the burden I told you what happened to it get rid of the burden it's already been gotten away from you by God himself and when he's in the Tomb his body waiting for the resurrection he visited the places that the just and unjust goes where you'll go one of these days he goes up to hell and knocks on the door the devil come out he said I could just hear him say oh so you finally arrived did you I thought I had you when I killed Abel I can hear him say Satan come here he's the boss now he reaches over and grabs the keys of death and hell off his side and hung it on his own side he gave a CH a good kick said oh that felt for me i' be kicked before by him back in heaven when God kicked him out of Heaven on the earth that felt very familiar with him he says you've been a bluff long enough I am a virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still wet on the cross and the full debt is paid you have no rights so give me them keys amen take a line from brother Donnie he says the devil don't even have keys to his own home this morning you have no rights anymore he turns around and gives him a good healthy kick slams the door and says stay in there I'm the boss from now on that's who you have living inside of you the boss who are you brother Matthew I'm the boss who are you brother Michael you're the boss don't be scared to tell the devil hey I'm the boss I got the boss living in me what's that make me I'm the boss Satan had the keys now the boss has got them submit yourselves therefore to God and resist the devil and he will flee from you so in order for the devil to harm you he must first get to you to doubt God's word that he's got you just like he did Adam and Eve but I thank God that no weapon formed against you shall prosper amen and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn amen this is your heritage for the word of God is sharper than it is living and Powerful sharper than any two edged sword piercing even to the division of Soul and Spirit a Christian can defeat the Devil anytime it don't matter where you're at God forbid we can even Beat the Devil right in the middle of Walmart we were in there the other night buying stuff for a trip we to get ready to take we felt like we was in there for hours we was ready to scream to get out of that place but Satan is a bluff I'm closing the devil's nothing but a bluff snorting and blowing all Thunder and no lightning the lightning power of the resurrected Jesus Christ puts a reality there that shocks the soul from a dead Slumber of those Earthly bound things into Immortal Realms to believe God and take him at his word and cause those things which were not as though they were Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb called out set aside a church washed and ironed out you just
