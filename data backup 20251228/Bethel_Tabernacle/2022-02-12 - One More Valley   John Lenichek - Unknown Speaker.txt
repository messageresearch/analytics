========================================

[Music] when i'm tossed on life's sea and the waves they cover me and the dark clouds they won't let the sun shine through [Music] then a voice seems to say child there'll be a brighter day don't allow the storm to hide sweet heaven's view cause you've got one more one more here and you've got one more trial one more time one more curve in life's row only one more left to go you can lay down your heavy load when you get home [Music] [Applause] [Music] don't let satan see your tears learn to smile through your fears hold your head up high and give the world a smile just be faithful all the way it will be worth it all someday before it all will be over after a while cause you've gotta watch one more tear when you get home oh you can lay down your heavy load when you get home [Music] [Applause]
