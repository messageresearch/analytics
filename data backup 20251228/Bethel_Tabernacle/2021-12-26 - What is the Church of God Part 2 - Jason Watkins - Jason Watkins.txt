lord amen i apologize today that i don't have my bible with me i got a new one for christmas and and in the in the whole you know i had it all set out and should have grabbed it and sister debbie and i and the packing out to go out of town after church today i didn't bring either one of them so i'd left it sitting and my other one in my other satchel and anyway praise the lord i got plenty of spare ones in here if i needed to grab one but i've got my scriptures here in front of me at any rate so we want to continue by the help of the lord with our little series we're doing on what is the church of god what is that true church of god now we read last time we took you into the book of corinthians where paul refers to it as the church of god but i'm going to take you to hebrews chapter 12 this morning because we're going to this will be uh kind of the this will be the second part and if you'll just uh bear with me today we're going to try i know everybody's going to giggle but i'm going to try to teach this amen as best i can amen but just remember i'm no matter how bad i am at it i'm no worse than brother brad yance so but i'm going to i'm going to give it a the old notre dame try at any rate and so uh we did that last sunday and uh and now brothers ever they're laughing at me because what what happens is i get inspired and i i start preaching so uh but that's okay too right amen praise the lord well i've got technical difficulties already but the devil ain't nobody so we ain't gonna worry about him amen and uh and this and then hopefully by part three which i will like and i'm just so appreciative to the lord that it looks like it's gonna stack up to where it can be my first sermon in the new year um because i'm not gonna continue this thought on our on our uh our new year's service but i want to continue it as part three as my first sermon in the new year and it'll be more along the preaching side of everything that we've laid groundwork for last time and today we're going to try to be methodical and go about it amen but praise the lord um by the way that reminds me don't forget that this coming midweek service is moved to friday for to new year's don't forget that so our midweek service this coming midweek service is moved to friday so there will be no wednesday service here to be on friday and there we're going to have our communion and foot washing and we're going to hear a little a little uh snippet little sermonette little inspirational words from all of our ministry team amen and uh i'm looking forward that's going to be a special time so amen i hope that uh you are able to make it to that amen praise the lord it's an important important time amen first let's go then to hebrews chapter 12 i don't think i have any other announcements to make you be praying for sister debbie and i we're going to leave after service right away and uh visit her folks for a couple days and then we'll be coming back in the lord willing tuesday evening praise god verse hebrews chapter 12 and i want to begin uh eth what did i tell you verse 12 yeah hebrews 12 and we'll begin at verse 12. you have it say amen wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed and amazing that you would have to let it be healed you'd think that would be a no-brainer that i might go of course i'll i'd like to be healed but actually the apostle is giving you some instructions so there must be something to letting it more than just some mental ideology all right follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled can i point out to you that he's speaking to the born-again church of god so there we're less than perfect people and we have to hear things like this to be reminded all right so lest there be verse 16 any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright now paul's not calling a child of god esau but he's saying if you don't stay on it you could end up acting like esau okay so so verse 17 for we know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest this is a sinai in the in the wilderness and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with the dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake so we're not come to that all right but ye are come unto mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect i hope to take my place among them my and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh see for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape this is us believers if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven all right whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet more yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain so i i know that sometimes we can end up in trials and tribulations and it seems like you're being shook to pieces but just remember there's somebody behind that with love pulling the pulling the trigger a man flipping the switches all right don't forget that it's all done in love wherefore verse 28 here's why he does it this is why wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire i'm grateful to the lord that he is let's pray father i'm glad you're a consuming fire i'm glad that you you you have the ability if we will allow it if we will get out of our get out of the way get out of our own way get out of your way and let the mind which was in christ be in us if we can get out of our own way and get out of your way and let the word of god dwell in us richly if we can get out of our own way and get over our own self and get out of your way lord and humble our hearts then we can let the word come and do the healing that it needs to do and lord i i i'm i'm reminded of of our service last wednesday where our minister uh showed us out of the scripture that that these things can be these victories can be lived in that they can they can be applied in your life and you can walk in the freedom and the newness that god supplies in this hour lord it meant so much to me to to hear it expressed so so plainly and simply to say my it's not rocket science it's just the love of god who wants to do everything he can to make our lives into his image lord i want to raise up my hands afresh today and say i'm willing lord god let me father humble myself in your presence today to hear this word lord we want to be considered the church of the living god so may you grant it to us today we committed all of our life into your hands we stand proudly under the bloodstained banner of christ we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated so what is the church of god the true church of god we pointed out in our first part we we asked this question from from brother branham's message on the exposition of the seven church ages in the pergam age we brother branham said i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst and i i i was reminded of that point while reading my text this morning in hebrews 12 that see that you refuse not him who spake now that that is telling us that he's speaking that there was a prophecy of this last day where he would not just shake the the heaven but the heaven and the earth and it would be really almost unprecedented the level at which god would communicate with his family and i'm here to bring you to the acknowledgement and in case you've been asleep at the switch you're it and you're living in it this is the hour when there is almost unbelievable amounts of communication coming from god to you and and therefore if there was ever a time when we want to make sure that we are sufficiently impressed with the word it's now now if if if being if being a member of the family of god how many believe you are if being a member of the family of god and and being a member of this church of the firstborn that paul says you've come unto mount zion that if we believe that we are part of that and we do but but you must take a hold of the fact that being sufficiently impressed sufficiently impressed when you're impressed it has an effect on you amen if something doesn't impress you there's no change in you at all you don't even care you're not even pressed at all but but when something is sufficiently impressed upon you it has a way of effectually changing you you start to say i'd like to be more like that i need to adjust this in my life you might not tell another person but you'll tell yourself wow i got i got a little ways to grow amen but but what you understand what you're understanding in brother branham's statement is it's not automatic just because you're the church of the firstborn that that you need to work on you need to pay attention to yourself that that man in the mirror is sufficiently impressed with what god is doing in this hour and address him to say are you getting it and if you're not you better get on with it because it's purpose driven and god has ways of getting your attention if he can't get it the easy way he will get it you can't beat him stop trying so i'm not trying to beat god you are if you're trying to live your own life see because that's contrary to his will that's contrary to why i put you here it's contrary to why he saved you he puts you here to be a light for him to be a replication of his life he saved you for that purpose and redeemed you all right so if you're warring against becoming that if you're not letting the mind of christ being being you then you're at war with god see you might not have declared it but god has declared it amen so it didn't matter whether or not one nation declares a war they get attacked by another nation you see what i'm you said i'm saying so so god has these ways of doing it so we found out that that this was that the corinthian church was the only church while while paul mentions the church of god loosely in a broader sense in other of his epistles this is the only church the church at corinth it's the only church he addresses as the church of god and we we pondered you know what would what would be up with that that that you know and paul why why why just and he did it twice remember in our lesson from last time he actually did it twice in both letters he wanted to make a point and he never said it like that to any of the church and we found out that he made certain points to them that he he didn't really make so directly to other churches one of the one of the points was uh you know that that that that who they were in christ and what god had called them to do and i and i'm realizing that he talks about that in other churches but paul really takes pains to deal with the corinthians where the rubber meets the road right where they live now that's the most uncomfortable place for a preacher and the most resistant for an audience amen because we're humans and you don't you don't like me telling you what to do and believe me i don't like telling you what to do amen and and and so but but this is this is you know i i just i get it when god calls it the foolishness of preaching i get it believe me so here's the plan let me get this straight you're going to use an imperfect person to perfect imperfect people okay an imperfect person is going to perfect imperfect people anyway but but we found out that that paul takes great pains to to remind them of exactly who they were to constantly it's almost as if they needed that and we found out he didn't seem to need to do that in other churches and so i'm glad god put the letters to corinthia in in the bible because too often times we find ourselves with portions of all of those books i think that god has all the bible we need to give us the complete picture of what we need to be and you don't want to read over corinthians because the tendency of a human being is to go oh they were just a bunch of immature babies and i'm not like that i'm i'm more like the church of philippians where he never had to correct them at all never had to set him in order well you've just demonstrated you're the dead center of corinthians thinking that amen so so uh get over yourself a little bit so maybe they needed to be reminded exactly of this because what they what paul seems to be taking a lot of pains to do is to remind them that they were supposed to be an a guiding example to the people around them that where that we're filled with the spirit of god and i gave you the little microcosm of how that god took israel and started a nation and dropped them right down in the big middle of hedonism all around them and that and and and as that nation god established them as the leading nation of the world even though they were tiny and no one else thought of them like that but god thought of them like that these are my people and and you can imagine that if the creator of the whole world had a people and put them inside of borders that's the leading nation of the world regardless of what other people think that's god's decision and you know from the time this is why the millennium they'll be restored to that because once they were dispersed and went into babylon captivity you have times of restoration where they come back under under joshua and zerubbabel and ezra nehemiah and you have all of that but israel is never established after that after that captivity in babylon they're they lose that position as the leading nation of the world but they are restored to that in the millennium they become the leading nation of the world and and the king lives among them in the holy city and the king's bride lives there and israel is restored as the leading nation of the world to to usher god's commands and ways that are to be lived out in the millennium among the gentiles all right and gentile nations and there'll be many millions and so so we find out that that paul is trying to get the true church now you've said here a few minutes ago you felt like you were the true church well just then then absorb this that that we're given the spirit to to live in us to set the record straight on against the false narrative that's in the world on what is a true christian amen and the whole world has a skewed very upside down and broken view on what it means to be a christian just like all the heathen nations thought they knew what the gods were and israel was sit there in the middle of them to go you're all completely wrong and we're not going to just tell you we're going to demonstrate in our lives that there's only one true and living god and that's the true church today here i go that's that's you and me we're here for that very purpose we're filled with the spirit of god not to come to a building and pay ties and sing and sing songs we're here to establish a light of accuracy to the world that's the true church you claim to be a part of to correct the false narrative we found out that the church of god is a fellowship of saints in the earth who share this common purpose to be representatives of god's kingdom in heaven living in the earth we found out it was a brotherhood of love it's a it's a brotherhood of faith it's designed why do we meet here it's designed to enrich our lives it's designed to grow us together so that we're all for one and one for all and there's no great ones little eyed big eyes little used it's all one the cross the ground is level at the foot of calvary we have different offices we have different positions but we're all one in christ it's a family we found out it has great compassion and care one for another it's supposed to have anyway the harmony we we made a mention near the end of of that last sermon how the how that the harmony here we have here it's so appreciated you don't know how proud that makes me uh to see such harmony and and you know and fellowship that comes among us um as we love and care for one another and we meet here and and we've got each other's back and we've all got our shoulder to the wheel that is more rare than you might believe and i'm not just trying to you know well maybe i am trying to brag on us a little bit and that's okay i'm proud of you amen and believe me as one who's traveled the world and preached this message on six of seven continents i know i know what a harmonious church looks like and what it doesn't look like amen amen so the church of god and what it stands for stands for a lot of things we could take off on any one of these it stands for purity and wholesomeness stands for righteousness and and sincerity before god you know uh when something is not sincere i remember years ago brother dale took took a a sermon like that as brother dale so often would do excuse me take things uh and just break them down into a sermon it was so beautiful i heard him preach a sermon one time on the new birth he used a gas combustion engine push rod motor it was fantastic that was brother dale dr smith as we call him and and and he he took a sermon on being sincere he went back to the history to show the origin of that word where you had makers of vessels and you you there there had to be a stamp a sincere as i remember it uh and and it was a seal to mean that this vessel had been held up to light and passed the water test and the light test and there were no cracks that you couldn't see but no light no water could get through and that it was sincere this was a this was a good vessel if you bought one that didn't have that government seal then you you you might get something that you get at home and it's going to leak and be useless and so you know there there had to be a real one and there had to be a less than real one and and that's why one of the things that we stand for is sincerity before god that we're not here as secret sinners and fake christians we're here for keeps we're here for real we're here because we love it i'm not here because i'm compelled against my will to do anything i come here because i want to come here i believe it because i desire to believe it i i'm right i live a righteous life because i enjoy righteous life if i if i slip in my righteousness i repent for that because i can't stand to be under that amen amen a true church is a fortress it's a place where we can come together it's a a city of refuge it's a hospital a hospital to care for the sick and dying who are sick and dying from the diseases of sin and bethel tabernacle here and abroad please don't ever forget that amen because a hospital sometimes takes in the sick and wounded and they sometimes sit among us and i've seen i've seen the sick and wounded come into churches who didn't have this kind of harmony who didn't have this kind of confidence in the ministry and they were biting and judging and and gossiping and killing and destroying i i remember a church and it's not up to me to judge them they'll answer to god for it on the day of judgment i remember a day when my brother who really got a hold of god and gave his heart to the lord and went strong for quite a while but because his past had been so nefarious and off the rails the church that he tried to go to wouldn't give him any any credit they just held him in suspicion they always judged him they always were questioning he never felt at home he never felt confident and you know what it discouraged him and he ended up six eight months later going back off the rails and never recovered never stopped witnessing this message never stopped believing it nathan was the kind that he was so believed he'd give you a book and if you didn't believe he didn't fight you that's a true story if you didn't believe it he would just fist fight you on the spot and he wasn't one you'd want to fist fight with i said nate that's not how you do it that's how i do it okay that's not how jesus did it but it's a hospital for the sick and dying and i'm i'd like to say that i'm glad i don't oversee a church that's like that amen i'm glad i don't see an over church that oversee a church that's judgmental and suspicious of everybody and and i just i just say this friends and i've said it for years that show me an overly suspicious person and i'll show you a dishonest person show me an overly judgmental person i'll show you a person who wants to do that but they're afraid to and so they judge you for doing it see and they're overly suspicious because they themselves go to sleep every night knowing how guilty they are of hypocrisy and so they're automatically suspicious they figure everybody's like them well they're not we're not we're sincere we love god for real hallelujah hallelujah see i've seen a lot of people become very very religious in my life and they they never seem to get more spiritual yeah amen wow corrective love begins at a true church corrective love begins in the church of god its main message now i want to make be real clear its main message is not to tear down but to declare the gospel so that mankind can free himself from sin so sometimes it seems harsh but it's it's not i mean if if you're wrapped up in vines you know like like jesus talks about some of the seed fell by the wayside and some among stony ground and it had no root and the wayside the birds picked it up that's that you heard it in the church and you know it was interesting and then you were entertained by it you got out in the birds of the air the demons took it away and it meant nothing you go on with your life and then the the stoning ground because there's no you never really you're a shallow person you never really have any depth you don't really let the god's word get deep in your heart you anon with joy it excites you you feel like you're part of a new membership a new club you get a new jacket but but you're not you're not one that can put roots down to where what happens is then when offenses come you get offended oh i don't want to be persecuted and you start dreaming up all kinds of nonsensical ideas to say oh well you know we we don't need to be that hard we need to show love to everybody and and i and i and when i see a person going like that i know they're headed one way out and they're just doing this you know we just need to be a little more tolerant of the world we don't need to be so weird and and you know what i do i just go okay bye i see you i know where you're going i know i know you're just posturing that's all you're doing you're posturing you're the next thing you'll do is start finding fault with god's word and the teaching and then the people and then the next thing you know you'll backslide the next thing you know you'll be off into a ditch somewhere and hating god and i know i have seen it yeah i've seen it too many times and and and and and so we you know we we look at it this way and and but then there was a kind that gets among thorns and it starts growing but the you know the it doesn't maintain its garden very well and the briars and the weeds and the vines wrap around it and start choking the life out of it well you know i'm sorry if sometimes the the preaching seems cutting but the only way i can get you out of that is with a sword that's pretty sharp and and it's and depending on how wound up you are might cut you up a little bit getting you free but it's love it's corrective love it it's not to make you feel bad or make you quit church or get offended jesus said blessed is he who is not offended in me see amen its main message is not to tear down it is to declare the gospel so that mankind can go free it's to it's to it's a place where uh a proclamation of liberty uh to free to timothy 2 26 and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will hebrews 2 15 and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage and so in order to accomplish this there often needs to be a tearing down first before i can build you up so sometimes yes the ministry has to tear you down a bit but it's it's got a long-term goal it's not cruelty or being nasty if i get preachers like that they will never get access to this pulpit over the years i have guarded this pulpit i will not let men who like hurting you preach behind this desk and if one ever slips through the cracks he's never allowed to come back again and there's been men that have been banned from ever coming back to this pulpit you would never know who they are but i know who they are i'm not going to let my family be abused and browbeat to death i don't do you that way none of the ministry team here is geared that way you notice that you notice that none of the ministry team here is geared like that because they've been trained and brought up right and god gave them a correct spirit to love god's people and i'm thanking god for that amen amen and so so so so it's to accomplish sometimes there has to be a tear down but remember that judgment does begin at the house of the lord please don't forget that see lest you be you know you know wise in your own conceit and the devil end up leading you astray and gets you all wounded and offended and upset and the next thing you know you're you know you don't like the decision that the that the pastor makes you don't like the way things are run and you're the next thing you're doing is you're leaving the church slamming doors and you're you're being nasty and and and snipey you know to people around you and judgmental of everybody in front of you and in back of you and you're the holy one bethel tabernacle has no place for that and somebody that's like that we'll be happy to take them in but i'm going to start with the sword pretty quick to get rid of that and then try to build them up in the love of god and show them we're all in this thing together amen sure our teenagers go through battles so did you adults so did you adults see sure they parents sometimes are forced into positions less less than where they'd like to be standing trying to keep an arm around that loved that loved one but but listen friends keep an arm around them because god can get a hold of them and don't ever make them feel ostracized and don't any of you adults ever try to do that you will have me to deal with i promise you i will always side with them amen always i've been known from that for that since 1995 i if i have to empty this church and have only my teenagers i'll do it because i will not let them be executed like that amen and i i've had people resist me and tell me i was too compromising well some of them ain't even alive anymore and the other ones aren't even in church anymore but i'm still here and god's still here and the love is still here and the word is still here hallelujah and i make no apologies for that amen and so we we love our youth and we we know the struggles we went through when we were their age and i want to tell you something if you if you've got small children and you're raising small children i heard brother tim pruitt say this probably 25 years ago i never forgot it's so impactful get ready to be impacted he said that if you're raising small children and you're sitting back judging parents who are raising teenagers and they're not doing it the way you think they should be done he said you just be very kind [Music] you be very kind because down the road that's going to come back on you and you're going to find yourself facing a worse generation because every generation is worse amen now how many still want to be the church of god all right for the time first peter 4 17 and 18 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear so you know it reminds me of of the apostles warning how shall we escape if we neglect so great of salvation that answer i forget what they call that that question is self-answering the the answers within the question how shall we escape if you neglect this great word of this hour here's the answer you won't you'll suffer terrible consequences for neglecting it see so don't neglect it you know don't harden your hearts against god's word see so so judgment does begin at the house of god according to first peter 4 but there's always mercy even in the tearing if if i have to do some tearing first there's all there's always mercy in the tearing there's mercy even in the judgment because james 2 13 tells us that mercy rejoiceth against judgment you don't know how many times i've raised up my hands and said lord i'm going to rejoice because i know i should reap your judgment but i know i have your mercy and i'm taking it right now i'm taking it before anybody else gets it gets me from it i'm going to take in all the mercy i can so when judgment comes knocking mercy answers the door and says oh judgment says oh you live here yes okay never mind why does it assemble why do we gather in a building why not just sit home and watch and stream we have a a gathering place to gather for hearing the will of god uh in his word proclaimed by servants of his calling and there is nothing to replace live ministry and live anointing and everybody in here that's ever straight streamed would say amen to that that there it's great we're we're happy for technology we love to be able to stream but there is no substitute for a live service see you hear a lot of people saying amen who were forced into those streaming situations before and are happy to have live ministry now what is the true church well what is it not it's not an organization organized of men it doesn't exist in a box of rules structure and regulation the word doesn't come for that it comes to change the nature of a person so it's not about making you fit into my box it's i'm not trying to reform you i'm trying to get a nature change see this is why a lot of times we'll be very lenient and very merciful and very kind and very patient and very tolerant as paul the jews didn't want to do that you remember paul dealt with that i think in chapter two of romans and he he dealt with those jews who just who just you know here comes these gentiles in and they've been heathens yesterday and the jews want them to walk according to the law of moses the next day and paul's like good grief guys didn't the lord give you wasn't he patient and kind with you giving you an opportunity to repent of of your judaistic ways that was nothing but a form of godliness while you denied the power thereof did wasn't god kind and gentle and merciful to you and gave you time and then you just wanna you want these gentiles to just wash up overnight how about we get their heart changed get the love of god in their life and the holy spirit will do that work you don't you don't need to shine each other up i don't need to shine you up this isn't this isn't a shoe shine this is the power of god to move in our lives this is what a true church of the living god is where the holy ghost is in charge where jesus is the pastor the true church of the living god is not a social service and it doesn't oversee social services programs so you got a problem with social services programs in the church no they accomplish a good task i'm just simply saying that's brother branham said it over and over and over he said i got no problem with hospitals and schools and orphanages he said but god never sent us to build hospitals and schools and orphanages he called us to preach the gospel see the the sick the poor you're always going to have them with you and god blesses and raises and lowers and does he's in control so we just say lord i'm just happy to be your child and whatever life you have a sign for me just let me be willing to walk in it see so what is and what isn't its role one of the things it does is it does supply spiritual food in due season and that's done to meet the challenge of the hour it does it here's one thing it does it hands out life guidance but it does it freely amen it doesn't charge for that it hands out life guys some people don't want it but i still have to offer it see and and remember a pardon is only a pardon if it's received that way i can't make you accept the pardon of christ but i can tell you about the pardon i can demonstrate that i have here's what it's done in my life sometimes people say i can't witness because i can't remember all the quotes in the scriptures and i don't think i can teach it you're not you're not even you're not even called to that don't try to do my job don't try to get up here and handle the fires of god go tell them how your camel got lit go tell them what god did for you because that can't be debated that's your experience and nobody can challenge you on it because you were there you ought to know it happened to you so i don't believe that well that's too bad it happened to me i was there it's all true it happened to me as gulliver tried to tell him these things are all true and happened to me and i had him on trial those are some of the things that it is it supplies spiritual food it to meet the challenge of the hour it hands out life guidance it is not an authoritarian entity not an authoritarian entity it possesses no power of force or compulsion sometimes legalists want the preachers to be that way see but but its leaders have no mandate from god to lord it over the people nor to be elevated by the people amen see those who are invested with spiritual authority they must be approved of the people they they must be found loyal and faithful to god among the saints amen and you have a right to expect that you have a right that preachers live what they preach and that you won't see them preaching it on wednesday and then committing it on saturday preaching against it on wednesday and then it's suddenly it doesn't apply to them that's never ever to be true and the people aren't wrong to question that and say hey what's what's what gives you know and and and a preacher who can't be asked about something he ministered without getting you know his dander all up and feeling like he's been uh confronted just just remember brothers my fellow ministers your servants to these people see we serve his majesty the king we're servants to them on his behalf we're not more than that ever ever see they must be found loyal and faithful to god among the saints you know jeremiah i won't take the time to go to it but jeremiah was assured because the whole thing came up with jeremiah and he almost quit preaching over it and practice he actually tried to do that told god he was finished and threw into town wouldn't preach anymore because people just they wouldn't listen to a thing he said and he kept trying to warn him kept trying to correct them he loved him he was trying to help him but they you know they hung him up in suspended cages they threw rotten fruit at him they fed him though bread of water affliction and and and jeremiah got the rough end of things and and and god you know came to tell him there in in and i'm not going to go into it today because it's a whole sermon in itself that god just simply said listen jeremiah just understand that there's going to be people who who really don't they're not going to listen to what you say and don't worry i'll handle it and that made jeremiah feel like okay okay i don't have to deal with it god will deal with it and he was assured that god would deal with those people who refused his message and thus god's servants and his messengers uh are vessels who proclaim god's word to the people under inspiration and if people will not line up to god's commands then god will deal with them i don't have to spend my time don't you sit there and wonder why isn't the pastor going after them i don't have to do that god will deal with them i'm telling you in almost three decades of pastoring i've learned that more almost more than any other single thing to let people be people and let god deal with his children only in the most i'm not saying it wouldn't exist because it hasn't it would don't think it wouldn't but only in the most egregious situation does the ministry reluctantly uh and in humility does it even attempt to compel a person to keep god's word have you taken people aside yes do you sure would you absolutely but only in the most egregious situation where i could see weeks and weeks and months and months and a long time and and somebody's just such a blatant offender that finally paul said listen you take and you finally deal with it and you rebuke him sharply that's that's not the rule that's an exception to the rule what's the rule that that's an exception to the servant of god must be gentle he must be patient giving people the opportunity to repent and correct because hey in case you haven't noticed this he himself deals with his own ups and downs and weaknesses see my own failures that i am so aware and sometimes so painfully aware of it who who would i be to take you aside i'm god's child you're god's child and i'm gonna i'm gonna you know bring some authoritarian lord it over you forced to compel you and make you line up and stick you in a box and put spiritual handcuffs on you nope amen not happening that's not the kind of pastor i am if you're ever looking for me to be that kind you're at the wrong church because i don't believe that's what the true church of god is i'm not trying to reform i'm trying to change the nature amen what is the church not it is not connected to political agendas of mankind it is not involved in politics whatever that's right amen amen their politics republican democrat independent or otherwise they're all of the devil i know there's good people trying to make a difference in there i'm not talking about the people i'm talking about the system the sooner you get this through your head the better off you'll be in life a prophet said it education civilization politics all of it is of the devil he's the god of this evil age and therefore i'm not involved in politics what i do is interpret modern events through prophecy in god's word what i do is i blow trumpets of spiritual war that's what i do what i do is i sound the alarm when i see the enemy approaching when i see him approaching in your family or your young people are or this church or uh the ministry is here to blow a trumpet to declare war to spot an enemy that's approaching and i'm trying to help you to notice it see it moves the ministry is constantly moving to adjust the signal flags of battle to meet the prevailing threat in the field of spiritual battle how many know that's where we are today you're not at disney world sorry you're in a spiritual warfare and this is what it means to be the church of god you can be in the army called the church of god because there's a battle there's war there's nowhere it's not there's nowhere it's not war so you got two choices pick your army you can be in the army of the church of god or you can be in somewhere else see so you're not going to get out of the fight so i would just rather fight on the winning side a true ministry a true church of god not just the ministry but the people they seek both to create and foster in the hearts of other believers an irresistible urge to conduct our lives to behave ourselves according to the dictates of god's word amen i'm here to tell you today if you don't know christ in this way where all your desires of your heart are are for him and that you and that you love him more than you love you if that's not true for you let me tell you about a man who can help you let me tell you about someone who can give you an irresistible sweep you off your feet into a love affair you'll you'll get swept off your feet like any bride would love you'll be wrapped up in the arms of a king who loves you who puts life inside you said i found you in the wilderness lying in your own blood and i picked you up and i carried you home and i cleaned you with clean water that's the kind that's what the church of the living god is amen there is one we find that and it's sad to preach this in a message assembly but the church of god the true church of god in any age this age or any age all right um it's going to surprise you what i'm about to say and you it's hard and it's going to surprise you because you'd say why are you preaching that in a message church here's what the true church does not do it does not accept the intercessory of saints it doesn't it doesn't collude with the dead it doesn't attempt to fellowship the dead it doesn't stand for that that's spiritualism and good people did you hear me say that good people did the internet hear me say that good people for real good people children of god can get caught in that and it is it is extremely slick and how it's presented and it is it is a growing threat in this hour among messages that mess message assemblies we do not have intercessory with william branham i am not going to perform a wedding and play his tape of a wedding ceremony and say now he's marrying you it's not really me brother branham is here marrying you that is antichrist we're not this this friday we're not going to have a communion service where i push play and tell you william branham is standing here serving you communion that's not true [Music] [Applause] that's not true see and it's sad that you have to preach that the true church of god does not elevate its ministers or even its messengers or even its prophet of the age to the level of the lord jesus christ there is one supreme being who is among us and that is the lord jesus christ there is no other supreme being walking up and down these aisles trying to have intercession with you but he's trying he wants intercession he wants to be your intercessor he wants to be your all he wants to change your nature the true church of god gathers to fellowship with christ alone by receiving his engrafting word in graft is just another form of graft it means to be added into you you've been added into the tree of life you've been grafted in hallelujah and it's christ that grafted you in and it's christ who's the who's the gardener i am the vine jesus said my father is the farmer the gardener the husbandman see just before the rapture how many believe we're close just before the rapture which would be now the church of god is the last connection the world will have on earth between sanity and insanity amen between refuge and harm i've got it highlighted so do you mind if i read that a second time just before the rapture the church of god this is the true ones what we're preaching on the church of god is the last connection the world will have on earth between sanity and insanity refuge or harm you are the last source of pure good you are the last source i'm not saying there's not other good that's not pure there's it's got some impurities in it man-made ideology but we realize that the the remnant are good people and are saved but but we're talking about pure leadership pure good you're you're the last pure source of leadership amen the world will ever see right before the rapture so just ask yourself how should you live amen isn't that an obvious question if you're going to be the last bastion of truth if you're going to be the last possible point the last contact between insanity and sanity wouldn't you want to conduct your life as close as you possibly can with all your heart and all your soul to love god and let that display through your life according to what according to the message that god sent to make you that last point of light you're the last source the last source i mean this is so heavy this is this is heavy before i i close i'm almost out of time under normal under regulation time but i i want to make this point because it's heavy on my heart you're the last source of healing and relief and the world outside of the church of god which is everybody else is hurting they're hurting they're hurting they're hurting from pain they're hurting from misinterpreted theology they're they're hurting from poor leadership and and preachers who told them for so long it didn't matter and they're finding out it does they were told that the gospel would bring peace that passes understanding but it never has and they don't know why and they're they're they're suffering disillusionment they're suffering you're the last place they can find what's in your heart and what you're storing in the mechanics of this word let the dynamics light that up take that to your family take take a message of of love and gentleness and kindness and take it to them because they're hurting they don't know they're walking in blindness you're the last light they will ever have see you're the last healing source you're the last hope right before the rapture you're the last connection point between heaven and earth is you why because you are the true church of god the last source of pure good the last source of pure leadership the last source of healing and relief see there's a kingdom order to everything that should operate in our lives and i'm gonna this is where i hope to pick up in part three there's a kingdom order there's supposed to be a kingdom order in everything in your homes in your child rearing in your marriage and your finances in your assembling as a group your witness your job your career i'm here to tell you you're not left a chance to figure it out there's a kingdom order in god's word and and and that's what god is looking is to show the world right before it's too late he's trying to one last time show him the order of the kingdom and he's doing it in you and i do you see why and i'm not going to go any further than that but but can you see then friends why the church has a responsibility to the community we live in and i'm here to tell you something you will never be as successful with your witness in the community with your responsibility to the community you'll never be as successful as you hope to be if you don't exercise your responsibility first to each other amen you are not allowed to be an island to yourself you are not allowed you you might you might do it anyway but you'll neglect and you'll suffer for that amen you're not allowed to to just say i just i don't i you know i don't want to be around these people and i don't want to go to these functions and i don't want to do this and i don't want to be a part you know i mean if i think of the idea great but if i didn't think of it no i have anything to do with anything you're not allowed to be like that not and be the church of god you're part of a corporal body you're part of a unified heritage of god's kingdom we're not islands to ourselves that's why we assemble do you know you're not allowed to miss a service did you know that you're not allowed to not be here when those doors are open now many of you will will not come anyway regardless of it not being allowed you say will it put me out of the kingdom no will it make brother jason not like me no not at all i'll still put my hand and shake your hand and tell you god bless you and i'll mean it with all my heart i'll still pray for you i'll still try to help your family and help your children it doesn't matter you know if you just if you just seem to just be you know that way we'll still do it we'll still love you but you're going to hurt you're going to hurt yourself and you're going to harm those around you who are watching you and i promise you people are watching and especially your loved ones who you want to w who you want to be of an influence to above everybody i'm i'm telling your friends i love you all but i want to but my greatest desire is to influence my children and my grandchildren i'm sorry they're more special to me than you i'm sorry they can get away with anything and you can't they they they will tell you they don't always get away sometimes pablo takes them aside and we have to have a talk and i get my message of love across to them and what my expectation is i don't let them off the hook see and sometimes but but but listen friends the point of it is is there's a lot of things we're not allowed to do we do them anyway and i just want you to know there's a price for that there's a price for that see there's a price to pay when you do that people who who come to church part-time people who participate part people who pay their tithes part-time or never a time you know i i i shouldn't say that that's privileged information but let me i'm just going to say it again you listen from the youngest to the oldest you know what you should do you should pay your tithes and offerings now it's not enriching brother jason i'm on a set salary i have been for years whether this church grows or shrinks or or that income grows or nothing the only the only salaries that that move are that are always trending upward are the are my ministry team that i try to help for me i've been on salary for years more than a day more than a decade more than two decades so i'm not here after your money i'm here to tell you it it helps you to do that it helps you to do that god blesses you when you do that when you come to the house of god you gain a benefit it used to it used to debilitate me it doesn't anymore i've been doing it too long i don't care i'll preach to five people and i'll be just as happy to have five people here to preach to as i would 500. i promise you that's true god knows my heart that's true i get just as inspired to a larger i'm just here to tell you i'm trying to help you amen come out of your shell be one for all and all for one you know get don't don't don't walk around with your feelings
