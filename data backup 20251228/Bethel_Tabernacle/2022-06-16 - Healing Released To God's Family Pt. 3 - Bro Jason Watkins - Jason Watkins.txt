one gonna try to keep both but we probably can only keep one for now amen so happy to have them and enjoyed all of that singing my goodness so uh you love god amen we're gonna look right into the word of god uh this evening and i wish by the help of the lord to continue we're gonna go to matthew 24 and you'll notice that i'm changing around the text that i use each time and that's intentional because it's such a broad topic and tonight we're just carrying on uh in in the little uh series that we've been working on uh how many believe that god has sent healing into this hour amen he has released a healing to his family and and she needs it amen this was the terrible situation that that the kingdom of heaven faced and brother branham just said it simply like this the bride can't go in the rapture in the condition she's in and she's better so now you're stuck that's quite a conundrum you can't um you can't go forward you can't back up you just have to sit down and raise up your hands and say god have mercy on me well he did and so he the only one the only way to improve it was he had just had to come himself and take over the situation mankind man-made systems man-made organization had taken the church as far as it possibly could take it and it and as and with aft after all of its effort and all of its global outreach and all of its satellite television and all of its radio programs and and all of its missionary work um around the world it it had failed to bring the church to the condition that it could be taken in a rapture and it couldn't improve because the church booted christ out so now how are you going to get better see you the only one that could help you kicked him out so um fortunately that's part of the plan amen and he turns around and then calls a bride out of the church in the last days matthew chapter 24 and i just want to um pick up i think i said verse i believe uh we're going to start it at 37 correct matthew 24 37 there's a lot we could read here but we're just going to try to be concise and let you be seated and then try our best to just carry on it's a little different for wednesday but i'm just in the middle of a series so we're carrying on we'll be carrying on sunday unless the rapture comes and i won't be here so if you show up sunday and the rapture comes and i'm not here i'm sorry but that's the way it's going to roll so so verse 37 for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken the other left watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watched the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye ready be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh i love this verse who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing let's pray master we thank you for your word now this evening and you see the lord my whole day now just thinking and pondering and noting and re-noting and and father trying to set some some order to things and it just seems like lord that you seem rather determined this evening lord to just force me into a more uh more relaxed state as it were to not try to figure it all out ahead of time now you know that's not my way it makes me a bit uncomfortable but at the same time lord i've always i've never seen you fail to come on the scene and just put it all together exactly how you want it to lord how you want it to be put together so now i just surrender write readily lord with no concern whatsoever i give it into your hands now in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated i don't mean by any means to make you feel like that i'm not prepared i'm probably over prepared and that's probably the problem i'm having is because the the topic is so broad and uh i feel it is so important in fact as i have tremendous passion about this subject and so i've just been not in a battle with the lord per se but in a battle with my own self to try to keep my uh self out of the picture and not try to force it in the way that i want it to go and that never works anyway so it's pointless to try all right so so if you will just bear with me i want to just make a few statements that we uh finished with on sunday and one of the statements that we were making as we came down was the difference between the noise that you hear in the world and the still small voice that is the holy spirit speaking to us in these last days quite a contrast between those two they're almost incomparable and and in fact is the you know the world's answer to noise is just louder noise if i don't like what you're saying i'll just talk louder and then if you talk louder and try to shout me down i'll just shout louder and we'll just have a shouting match and right in the middle of the world screaming and shouting uh god slips in with a still small voice and it's so gentle and it's so personal that the world literally they don't hear it at all they don't understand what you what's up with you they don't understand why you are like you are and they have almost no concept of the the beauty that we see and enjoy in the presence of god i was today a rather remarkable thing happened to me i would probably have to say that all things considered and that's a pretty broad statement i don't want to take a whole lot of time getting sidetracked on it but you know when you're witnessing to somebody and i've been witnessing to people all over the world i'm and now what i mean when i say witnessing i'm talking about in a pulpit uh because you know it's not the same kind of not comparing it to that but i'm saying that one-on-one where you're witnessing to one or maybe a two or three couple people and that little small time where the lord is leading you to witness to somebody maybe because they're inquiring they're asking questions they ask the right question in the way that and the holy spirit's just faithful if you knock he'll open if you ask he'll he'll respond and so sometimes people don't like the response of the word but i just remind them you know you asked and so i might i might would have never said that to you but you asked me and so uh today was such a day and in that in that narrowly defined um way that i'm referring to of witnessing i would have to say it's probably the the greatest supernatural takeover of the holy spirit that i've ever encountered i was witnessing today to a businessman at a store that i frequented for almost 25 years i i met him and we were both much younger he and his wife and he owns a business downtown beaufort and i was in there today and we were speaking about a certain thing and he's um he's a very wonderful man he and his wife both and they are nominal christians rather on the charismatic kind of slash evangelical side but he's always he always loves to talk about the word of god he's but yet he's his questions are only ever surface deep and so you know i'm i'm always careful trying to you know because i believe that when you witness you should be led to the holy spirit and so i always want to be you know i want to keep it you know at that level if his if his only interest is just surface stuff i'll stay right there and until he goes a layer deeper and i'll go a layer deeper and as he'll if he'll keep opening up and keep going deeper and deeper i'll just keep going deeper and deeper and deeper and and so but that's never happened and we've always had a wonderful friendship we talk about the things of the world and the things that the book of revelation declares and he he's very curious about things like that he seems to love you know um and it's not un uncommon for you know for the world to love sensational things and especially if they go to a church where they're likely just hearing just they're getting just enough to leave them hungry and and so you know but over almost 25 years it's never really went uh much beyond the surface and i'll just give a few quick answers tie a few scriptures together and always leaves him you know astonished and i walk out of the store saying if you only knew that's just that's child's play and so i but i've always i've always felt like lord why is it so why i there have been people that have expressed much less interest than this man uh who i have far less a relationship with like a fraction as much and and they they'll plunge into deep water and i'll give them deep thing and and suddenly they don't want to talk anymore and and you know your friendship never deepens but over the years you know this friendship has continued to deepen and continue to deepen and so today i was standing there in his shop and we got to talking and it's a very busy place and people are all the time coming customers coming in and out his phone rings my phone rings you know we can we have to get word a word in edgewise as it were and so today it turns out that as i'm waiting there for the customer he's got a customer when i walked in as soon as they exited we start talking about the item of business uh there why i'm there and you know i'm i'm done we're finished we get it all done i'm ready to leave and here it comes and he kind of follows me to the door which is not uncommon and he's starting to follow me you know he's starting to ask about you know what do you think about this and what do you think about that and you know in the the economy and and and and what's happening overseas and you know what we realized the power you know of the enemy in this last day and and i'm saying uh-huh uh-huh and you know we and it just and suddenly i notice it's starting to he's really stopped me and now he really wants to talk about some stuff and so i'm just standing there taking it in responding a little bit and all of a sudden he really starts turning the dial in deep and friends i stood there and i i said to my i started praying within myself i said lord is this the day is this the moment i've waited for more than 20 years and i've wondered when this time would come is this that time and curiously when i left my driveway i was my first trip out for the day so after meeting brother abraham almost 15 years ago and sister debbie and i never back out of our driveway our first trip out of the day without bowing our heads and calling on the name of the lord you should never get in your car and drive anywhere your first trip out i get it if you're going to be in and out a lot but that first trip out i'm going to tell you something the lord has spared us so many times by just joining hands bowing our heads saying now lord we're heading out onto dangerous roads in a dangerous world and we need your care and we need your protection and we need your leadership because i don't know what i might run into and i need the holy spirit i need to know that i'm ready i want to be ready do you ever pray like that say lord i want to be used of you and so uh that and so normally sister debbie's is there in the truck with me we we are a lot together and by design and but today i was headed out by myself and i noticed unusually it was very unusual that as i started to pray i felt a very strong presence of the lord and i just kept praying and i just kept praying and saying i know i'm three four times in length longer than normal and i'm really feeling moved of the holy spirit and when i got done i'm backing out of the driveway thinking wow what was that and so i i'm driving now i'm heading into town and i'm gonna do a couple of things and and here i'm gonna stop by this business and all of a sudden here he is and he's starting to to do a deep dive and i'm standing there praying lord is this the hour now i don't know what'll be tomorrow i i don't know what what what what awaits me when i leave church tonight i'm just simply saying this is what happened to me and we stood there for probably and my friend for probably 35 or 40 uh probably 30 to 35 minutes he literally heard from genesis to revelation and i mean i went through the the seals and the very quickly and the messenger to the age and come out of her my people and and he's just like going wow wow wow wow wow and and i'm talking about world systems and there's no chance and there's no hope and how the how the rapture is a secret catching away and it's a three-fold mystery that of a shout and a voice of trump and the world's on heaven was silent the world's unbe it's unbeknown they don't understand that that's what's happening i said the rapture is happening right now and has been and i said since the opening of the seventh seal that happened in 1963 and that really he really got quiet then and because we're similar age and uh and he thought my and and we just stood there and i'm here to tell you something one one thing that's never happened is i've never stood in his shop and he's the one actually who said it not me i finally i got to the end and i said i said pat i said and i s and before i could even do anything he shook he stuck his hand out and shook him he started laughing he's like wow wow wow like what just happened and and i said well i said you heard a whole lot he goes yeah golly he's all the time saying that golly we've been talking 35 minutes and and he said no customers came in my phone didn't ring i said yeah my phone didn't ring and that never happens i don't think and here we here we go both of our phones are perfectly silent for half an hour space of a half an hour i don't know i just now thought of that and so and he was stunned he was shocked even his wife wasn't there to be to to be in the conversation she's a very nice lady i would have i would have talked with her there too but she might have distracted the conversation i don't know i just know god was in it now i don't know what'll happen but i know my friend has a lot to sleep on tonight and before i left he wants a church age book so will you pray will you pray hallelujah and uh and we're just he's kind of walking off staggering waving and i'm waving and all of a sudden now my phone rings and it's and it's brother brad and i just picked up my phone and walked out there i said brother brad you're never gonna believe what just happened to me i said i think i had one of the most supernatural witnessing experience i've ever had in my life but jack good to see you and sister kathy here tonight praise the lord and so so i it was just astonishing that that the world is so thirsty and they don't even realize how thirsty and how hungry they are sometimes you know you can get to where your appetite is so turned off and then and then but get around a good meal and catch a catch a whiff of some good cooking one time you didn't feel hungry then until you until you got that and you know i went through the house and sister debbie say are you hungry and i'm like no i'm not hungry right now and i'll be sitting in my office and all of a sudden he'll come by my nose and suddenly i'm hungry and i go walking there oh what are you cooking sweetheart uh you know i thought you weren't hungry well that was then this is now and and and and so i just i i feel almost like a giddy child because you don't have you wouldn't have a clue how much i i like this man and his wife and they're just such wonderful people so i don't know if you might have be wise enough to watch the service tonight pat if you're watching that okay buddy well anyway but it but it it was so this whole day has kind of been like that for me it's kind of been supernatural i i i had a brother uh well we got it on the prayer request list tonight and uh our own uh dear brother don sent me an urgent prayer request and he has a friend in a pentecostal church and who wrote a quick re request to him urgent please my wife the the devil has taken her and and she's gone crazy or whatever whatever the case may be and it's urgent and please the whole our whole church is astonished we don't know what to do can your church pray for us and brother don sends me an sos and as i'm sitting there in my office studying this material i had just heard brother branham i had just heard brother branham in the sixth seal talking about how that he says now i'm a little late coming out here he said because i had a emergency call and a and a man was dying and and it and his mother goes to this church and so we got a call that he's dying right now and and so quickly we had to go and pray and brother branham said just a little prayer and the man was standing on his feet a few minutes later and was perfectly fine and the place rejoicing and i'm thinking about that as brother don is talking to me and saying this is an urgent case and i just said i i just felt no fear this is nothing but what i just heard on a tape and i said brother you and i right now we'll bind together we'll agree and i just began to appeal this case to the king of kings and i just said lord i'm asking for your mercy and i don't even know what the case is or why this woman would would be under some kind of demonic control but i i know this the bible says mercy rejoiceth against judgment and so let it be right now oh god in the name of jesus christ that you will bind that devil and let the holy spirit deal with this woman i said to brother dawn i don't know i said i i don't know what will happen but i believe god heard it i know this he heard our prayers and brother don even sent me a picture and here's a picture of a smiling young woman very in the prime of life beautiful just a happy woman and the next picture and it's almost doesn't look like the same person and in one picture she has brother don even is commenting notice her eyes are a lovely shade of blue and in this picture the whole face is contorted and the eyes are jet black and she's just staring into the camera and i just felt such compassion i'm here to tell you friends if the bride can't have compassion who can if it's not you and i who are are who are moving heaven as as the bible says he spoke in isaiah and when he spoke the post and the pillar moved i i want to post in the pillar to move i want to hear the voice of god i want to be part of a bride in the last day who under who knows christ and who knows how to contact christ and who when we send up a prayer god moves and angels start moving [Applause] i thought about the text that we read tonight and it's interesting because if i would have started the 24th chapter of matthew is riveting and it it's largely so misunderstood so much of it in fact is it's part of the i would say maybe the three most misunderstood misinterpreted and and there's three misinterpretations that i can there's probably more than that but three big ones that literally have have have have have hamstrung the christian world from seeing what god is doing and the first is a misunderstanding a misinterpretation of matthew 24. and then there and brother branham goes to that in the sixth seal because they're they come out and they're starting to ask him questions because he just preached a sermon that left everybody stunned and he starts talking about the end of the world and and one stone won't be left upon another and and the end shall come and all these things and now the audience goes home without a whole lot of understanding in the disciples take him privately say now now declare unto us and and what what do you what do you mean what's what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world when shall these things be when there won't be one stone left upon another and brother branham points out and this is what the world is largely missing this is why they can't make the book of revelation fit because they don't understand they've got they're trying to apply all three things to the end time and they're not they're not applied directly to the end time the first of all the time when there won't be one stone left upon another is when titus comes in and sacks jerusalem and and and and then there's another about the end of the world and and then there's a whole other question about the sign of thy coming see and so what what's what's one of the signs of his coming well what was a sign of his coming the first time was an elijah prophet and so the world didn't receive the prophet or his prophecy and in fact is the the relig the people did but the religious leaders rejected mess prophet and his message and so when christ come who was the who was the manifestation of his message they of course rejected him too and that's why jesus challenged him to say you know was john of god or was he not of god and they they were a religious the leading religious movement of the hour the leading denomination of that day was trapped in a simple word play by jesus that they dared not even answer the question because if they if they said john was of god then jesus is going to say well then why didn't you believe what he said about me but if we say he's not of god because we can't dare say that this is the christ so then if we say well he's not of god then we're afraid that people will kill us because they see him as a prophet and so here the religious world is i i can't get my mind around that level of hypocrisy i mean how do you sleep at night how do you go forward knowing you're a died in the wool hypocrite and god is watching and god knows your heart i mean how how could anybody be a secret sinner how do you how do you endure life how do you go from day to day i tell you i've got plenty of mistakes but i don't leave them in secret i bring them to the altar and i say lord god forgive me help me lord i don't want to be that kind of a person because i i want to i want to be a vessel that he can use here at the end time and it has it has zero to do with trying to stand out in the world you know we're not trying to impress the world with great power and signs and demonstration that's already been done it didn't work in jesus day it didn't work in the disciples day didn't work in brother branham's day so if we could just have that discernment if we could just raise the dead that's been done and brother brandon would preach a sermon that every theologian in the in the building would sharply disagree with and he would say now if i've told the truth he'll come and re he'll come and prove it and then guess who came and guess who proved it and it got proven until they were left astonished and they couldn't say a word against it but it still didn't change their mind because the secret is that if the if the gene of god is not there no miracle or no amount of miracles and no one raised from the dead it will not move them and if as gene of god is there no miracle is even necessary there's just something that happens down inside you and that the jehovah eagle comes with his talents and begins to rip layers off of your mind and open your heart and suddenly the holy spirit starts pouring in and you can't run away from it amen and i i thought to myself wow of all of these things and they they don't understand his questions and so therefore they they don't understand his his answers and that's that's one of the items and then of course they they don't understand they can't place the book of revelation because they don't understand that they look at the sixth seal and they say well everything everything has to must be in the tribulation period and and and and therefore if the if the sixth seal is only unveiled in the tribulation period then then you're never going to be able to make the trumpets and the vials fit because they're they haven't they're having a a revealed impact on the earth right now and have been have been for for since for 2000 years but the world is unaware of why the world is the way the world is and they don't realize it's because of what the book of revelation says and these things are our prophecy has been controlling history but since they put it all off into the future what they don't know is that a sixth seal is partially opened all the way back at the dawn of the 20th century what they don't know is that every seal was partially open down through the ages and they don't realize that that triggers the trumpets and that triggers the vials and you know the last vial that was released it was released into the air and that's why we have a neurotic age and the madness on the streets and there's a reason behind all of the madness you see and i'm not going to get bogged down into that tonight well we'll go there sunday and i'll lay it all out and explain it to you but i said all that just to say this that there is and we're going to prove sunday there there is scriptural very clear that will make sense to you i promise it'll make sense to you why the world is in the condition it's in and it's not an accident and it's all being driven by prophecy and you say well then what's your sermon about tonight my sermon about tonight and the real burden that is on my heart is how that when he goes down to describing our day as it was in the days of noah and we know that that's the hour that we live in but he comes down to these verses who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing while the world is looking trying to understand the mysteries of revelation and they're trying to look at the sensationalism and they want to know what the dragon is and the beast they want to know what this power is in the antichrist and the whole world is going crazy a bride isn't that's that's not even the that's not even our main trust my main thrust tonight is to say lord i'm caught in this time and i want to be a servant found faithful when you come and you have come and you're here i want to be faithful that's all i care about that's all that matters to me is that when he has arrived he said i find bethel tabernacle faithful i find the ministry faithful i find the young people faithful and that's what's on my heart tonight that's what's driving me and i can only hope that's what's driving you because if you're not even careful i know this as a bible teacher that if you you know especially in the book of revelations it's extremely sensational and people can just get mesmerized in all of the symbolism and yeah and it's almost like a almost like a gluttonous ravenous you know just tell me all the mysteries tell me all the mysteries oh okay so i fill your head full of theology then what then i've only made you more culpable when you come to the presence of god you're coming to a place that is either the safest place in the world or the most dead dangerous that when people who were dying came to his presence sincerely they left living and people who came perfectly living insincerely left dead you you need to understand that this message that god has brought to us in this hour it's not about theology it's about a person who has fulfilled his word and is moving in the hour that you and i live in and he his promises this to us while the world is chasing after the symbols and the world is chasing after the meaning and the world is chasing after the symbolism the bride is saying i just want to be a faithful and wise servant that's the desire of my heart tonight that's why even even even sunday when we talked about removing the hindrances and we talked to you about prayer life and i thought about that as i left there's so much more i want to say you know just on prayer alone and i thought a real prayer life do we do we really appreciate that when you when you go to prayer and you are going to do you understand you're going to talk to the creator of everything now i want you to absorb this for a minute and take ownership of it do you realize friends that when you walk into the presence you can be standing in your house or in this church or in a field or driving your car it doesn't matter where you are what's going on around you or what you're doing you have the most unique so i said sunday people who just lay around in their misery and i said we ought to be the happiest people we're the most privileged people to realize seven and a half billion people in the world running around in blindness and a little sliver of humanity he has revealed and opened our eyes and it doesn't matter what's happening around you the devil can be raging and you can just step into another dimension and say father and have the great creator of all the universe step from his throne and say yes my child what what do we need to do here oh father i want to be found faithful i want you to work through my life you realize that that would you realize how privileged that is that you're literally you have 24 7 365 access to god not only do you not need anyone's permission there's no guards there to stop you not only do you not need anyone's permission it's an inalienable right that can't be denied you brother branham said every child of god has a god-given right to have a conference with jesus how many people want to exercise their rights say i'm not interested in marching in the street for republicans i'm not interested in marching in the street holding up signs for democrats i don't care about none of that kind of stuff but i do want to exercise my rights and i'm here to tell the devil you're not going to get any peace because i'm going into the king and i'm going to shake your kingdom and i that's why that's why i said to you here some months ago i i i'm not a i'm not a race i'm a son of god it is it doesn't color has nothing to do with it culture where you were born how you were born it doesn't matter the blood of jesus christ calls it all out anyway it doesn't matter how you got here or what happened and you say well this that this that or the other well i would ask you here tonight how did you get to this building and if you would be honest and you'd have to say well before i was here i was here and then before that i was here and well what were you doing well i'm not too proud of this one and go back to you more and i'm not too proud of that one go back a few more not too proud of that one well how did you get here well i don't know well you're here and none of that stopped you and you're still a believer hallelujah do you realize that all of those things are probably just the devil trying a last-ditch effort to stop you but he cannot stop you and you say i got a weakness i got a weakness we all got them but i'm still standing i'm still a believer and i'm still going forward and this is where i find myself blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing and i just removed the hindrances as i said to you sunday and i've recognized my ability to pray and there is no substitute i want to say to you friends there is no equal there's no substitute there's no second choice other than by comparison to a fervent prayer life a fervent prayer life is the is the most is is got to be the should be the highest priority in your life because a fervent prayer life can do the impossible a fervent prayer life knows no borders boundaries or stops a fervent prayer life can reach a hold of god and god can step over the top of anything i don't care what it is god can just step over the top of it say but this case you just don't know how bad it is it's nothing for god he can just step right over the top of it if you'll have faith and go forward that's why jesus would say nothing no whatever you ask get the father in my name if you don't doubt it in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you shall have it hallelujah that's what the devil does not want you to to understand it's very important to come to the house of god but that pales in comparison to a fervent prayer life a fervent prayer life is the one thing that will keep you coming faithfully to the house of god in spite of all the fear the world tries to bring upon you in spite of all the entertainments of the world in spite of all the schedules in business and politics and tiredness and friends and social activities if you have a fervent prayer life i'm almost never preaching to you because your fervent prayer life keeps you above it all and you're just up in that atmosphere where god is and the least little thing satan comes along to try to put in your mind try to bring it in your heart he you're you're impregnable you're impervious to that you're talking about an inoculation they want you to go get an inoculation and they want you to get a second one and then a third one and none of them work if you had 30 of them and finally but here here's an inoculation that will work every single time brother branham was talking about in the message the other dad's listening and the infallibility i think of god's word or something like that every wonderful tape 1956 april 4 if you want to hear goodwin hear that one and and brother branham talks about you know that that that that 60 of sickness comes from people worrying you see and that's what a fervent prayer life can keep you above that that's how you can you can soar over the top of temptation and just keep right on pressing and even if you do even if you have a trip in a stumble it's you're almost restored instantly because very quickly your your life is constantly you constantly keep short books with the lord that's one of the things i say to ministers all the time in ministers meeting brother jason what's you can only give me one sentence one line what's the best piece of advice you can give me as a minister keep short books with the lord don't get way downstream and not talk to him on a constant basis it's where joshua messed up he he met him he met the captain of the lord's host and and and he got instructions that were ridiculous so we're going to march around the city and not say a word and we're going to do this for a week and then finally on the seventh time we're gonna march around it seven times and everybody's gonna shout hallelujah and the priest is gonna blow a trumpet and that's it that's it that's it yep that's it well what happens next the wall's a cave down and every man just go right over the wall and kill everything in your sight and that was ridiculous that was probably the worst military advice ever given and then and then and then joshua here they come well now the next city where's that ai oh it's just tiny don't even take the whole army just take a few men you just take a couple garrisons you wipe them out they're just tiny they're nothing we just look what we just did that's the problem look what we just did see and instead of going back to the captain not realizing that he needed to keep short books because had he done that the captain would have said now here's what what you're going to do to aya however before you can do that aiken is hiding gold wedges under his tent floor and you can't go anywhere until you deal with that and instead instead of instead of a victory parade joshua is knocking on the hou 36 tent post and he's got to visit 36 families to explain to children that dad's not coming home and i'm sorry it's on me and he's got to talk to 36 widows and tell him i'm very sorry your husband's never coming home and it's all because of assumptions and not keeping short books he got he got caught with the men coming from a near land thinking they were along trying to fake him out that we're from a long ways away and if he had kept short books that wouldn't have got him either i'm not criticizing general joshua he was the same as the holy ghost i'm i'm glad that the that the holy ghost not just a man i'm glad the holy ghost himself which takes me into the promised land will give me will tell me about every enemy and it'll position me correctly to never be defeated if i'll stay in contact with him if i'll design my life to have a constant daily multiple times continual prayer continual times and i'm not just talking about continual alone where you're just constantly with a a song on your lips and a psalm in your heart i appreciate that i do that all the time i talk to god constantly but i'm talking about that time where you get up a little early and you sit in the quiet and you talk to god and you pour your heart out or when you're laying asleep at night you don't drop in the bed just in time to go to sleep you lay there and you thank god for the day and you ask him to watch over you through the night and you wake up the next morning and thank him for another opportunity i'm talking about a fervent prayer life faithful that servant who the lord finds faithful blessed is that servant whom the lord finds how many want that kind of a blessing we found that last sunday how that he said to moses draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet and i was showing you how that word nigh means it's it's the it's the coming together in a in a close spatial proximity of the it says it like this of the of the um to approach the basic concept is a close spatial proximity of the subject and the object so now it's you and god coming together close on a daily basis all the time this world is too broken for you to live loose and not have that in your life young people if i could if i could just open up your mind and take my years of experience and just drop it in there and what you could do with your youth and your strength and paul wrote unto you young men i'm looking at young men and paul said i write into you young men because you're strong don't don't let those years pass by and the pursuit of of the of the layout of sin dream and trying to win the rat race and uh you're here here you are with all this vitality all this strength let god open up your heart and your mind and pour into you while you're really here and what this life is really about and be filled let me say you in the words of the scripture be you filled with the holy ghost don't just take a halfway experience well i go to this church or i believe this or i do that because mom dad the preacher whatever well what about what what do you say i know what your mom and dad says i certainly know what the preachers say but what do you say young man young woman this is there you're as i said to you i opened up sunday and i i used that quote from a science digest and said this is the best time to be alive or something like that it's the greatest time to be alive and that's all yeah i agree but for a different reason this is the hour of our transition and the devil thus knowing that has brought every gun he's aiming it he's got every tactic he's been practicing on human beings for six thousand years he's a master of psychology you cannot max match wits with him he he he knows your buttons he knows your weaknesses he studied you since you were a child your only defense is to have a fervent prayer life where you talk to god close deep a lot we talked about that still small voice because he's leading you leading you by love drawing you into a secret place that everything that i can show you and i i will by the help of the lord but let me just let me just preempt a little bit here on sunday for sunday we're going to look at some things and i'm going to try to use some slides and draw a real picture in your mind to equip you why are you doing it to equip you to understand what's going on and who you are and why you're here and what you need to be doing see but remember remember remember knowing is half the battle so that's good but remember knowing is half the battle okay knowing is half the battle but knowing is half the battle because the other half is always application see and so so when we start to look at it in this way that god is is drawing you into a secret place and you know he he he doesn't say why is it a secret because he doesn't want the world to know he wants you to know this is a this is a love mystery this is his elect lady as john would call her this is his bride this is his family there's all kinds of times i go all kinds of events and i got people around and everything but and i'm happy you know i can go i can i can go be working over here and in some venue and be in the public and mingling and and that's one thing but then there's a then there's a a deeper level that comes you know around my kin folk but then there's even a deeper level than that if they happen to be not born again of the spirit of god there's a deeper level being around the family of god sure family of god becomes closer than your unconverted blood family that's a phenomenon but it's true and so but but then you know when you've got family and they are blood and they are can and they and they do you do have that relationship around the word with them there's nothing like it and and i can i can pull my family in and my children and my girls and my grandkids and and we can all just there there's there's a there's a level of of love and a level of of uh a feeling that's between us all that i don't i don't even want the world there this is my family there there's a level that i feel here that i don't even want the world it's not that i don't like the world but this is my family and this is god listen when it's so secret it's so intimate that brother branham when he has the vision of the tent or in one place calls it a tent in other places call it a cathedral and some kind of a thing and there's a little wooden room and he's watching this woman go in and she's terribly afflicted and she goes in one side and she's in there for some in undetermined amount of time and the next thing we hear in the narrative she's coming out of the backside and she's totally healed and here's a man and he's totally healed and missing limbs and everything is made right and all wrongs are made right and everything's broken is fixed oh hallelujah there's a lot of broken people but i'm here to tell you joy comes in the morning there is a fix there is a repair and god's going to repair everything god's going to repair fix and restore everything that you were supposed to be and the devil sidetracked you jesus christ is here to give it back to you and it was so intimate that even the person and they said brother branham hears them in the conversation they're interviewing what happened in there and the person says i i don't know i don't even know but you had a missing limb yeah and now i don't and well you're you're all fixed yeah what happened i don't know that's how intimate it is friends that god is looking to do things in your life you can't even explain to you you can't even get of your mind around it but i'm here to tell you something you're living in the greatest hour that's ever been for the family of god oh blessed is that servant who when his lord comes finds him so doing who's who's found faithful to god that's the great desire of my heart brother branham tells a story and i'm gonna i'm gonna close in seven minutes you with me brother branham starts telling at least at this one place he may perhaps tell it in other places as well but i chose this rendering and believeth thou this 1953. it says i was passing a a museum here not long ago and they had a picture of a man's body in there that weighed 150 pounds and and so this is a museum so obviously from the description it appears to be some kind of science exhibit perhaps or something of biology but he says here it was a picture of a man who weighed 150 pounds and said he was worth 84 cents in chemicals so brother branham here in this 1953 audience is gonna kind of use this to make a point and he says so you put a hundred dollar suit on 84 cents walk around with your nose up in the air think you're somebody you're not worth but 84 cents if you weigh 150 pounds wrap a 500 mink coat around 84 cents and won't even speak to your neighbor and brother branham says there's a couple boys standing there and one looked and said well john we're we're not worth very much are we and brother and brother branham butts in he says i said look fella that's your body but you got a soul that's worth ten thousand worlds that's right i said that body will go back to the dust some of these days you know this is a particular thing you know we used to only have to say it to sisters but some men have become so sissified in this last day and men want to be pretty and and and brother branham talked about you know even brother branham talks about here listen whatever you do don't disregard what i'm about to say because it sounds trivial but it's not because if it was trivial elijah prophet wouldn't have said it don't ever trivialize the prophet's words whatever you do it's dangerous to your health and brother branham talked about bangs hanging down in a boy's face and brother branham said bangs now he wasn't calling the boy a brother branham goes on to describe he said that's a spirit that's a demon spirit see and we talk about girls and the and the spirit that gets on girls and want to uh strip their body and show their body when they shouldn't their body is sacred and and these days it's just as bad to the boys because boys trying to be as pretty as girls and such attitude and spirits on them and i want to tell you something brothers you need to be men you need to act like men you need to look like men you need to dress like men present yourself like a man be a man be rough be burly don't be a pretty boy whatever you do that's that is so disappointing to the holy spirit i know your girlfriend might like it but it disappoints the holy ghost remember brothers you remember young men you know brother jason's teaching on that manhood is not a gender you can be a male that's a gender you you can be a 50 year old male and have never been a man in your life brother and i said i've seen men six foot 200 pounds didn't have an ounce of man in them because manhood is an office it's not a gender you don't get to automatically be a man just because you're a male and you've gained age in years manhood is when i'm is a man living after the image of his maker god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness see and so manhood speaks of character it speaks of honesty it speaks of decency it speaks of integrity it speaks of responsibility reliability amen that's a man see what what's a woman a bible woman there's no other kind not they're the only kind of lady is a bible woman you know you don't get to be a lady it's because you're female a lady is is what god the elect lady see and so she she cares about when her lord comes and he she wants to be found faithful happy blessed is that servant how many want to be blessed be a blessed servant say lord when you come i want to i want to be blessed to know that you find me faithful and and and so we're all the time having to the vanity that's in this world and gets on teenage girls and gets on teenage boys just remember sister i mean in 1953 the chemicals of your entire body was worth 84 cents if you weighed 150 pounds was worth 84 cents but brother branham says but you got a soul in there that's worth 10 000 worlds that body will go back to the dust some of these days but you got a soul that will live forever take care of that look at the value that jesus put on it he come from glory to die to redeem you that's the trouble we look at the outside and take care of the outside but the inside we let go see and this is why sunday i i i'm gonna come with charts and things but i'm not i promise you now i'm not interested in equipping you with theology what i'm what i'm gonna try to show you is that that that that seventh vial that is breaking out upon the world now pre-tribulation and comes full steam in the tribulation after we're gone that that that's released into the air you can't believe how many things brother branham attached to that to that seventh vial and talks about the perversions in the world say why is this like this why was it never like this 100 years ago because we're at the time of that seventh vial and it's a plague and it's being poured out on the earth and you know where it comes from can i give you a little insider where you know where it's coming from it's judgments it's plagues being poured out on the earth why is it happening so much in the seventh because it rejected the the seventh angel's message and the message was so great the message was so unparalleled and so unprecedented in history that the punishment for rejecting it is almost immeasurably bad and the whole world even even with the bride here even with our presence here to hold it at bay the world's still going crazy even with you here even with the holy ghost in the bride around the world through the darkest jungles members of the bride the holy ghost holding that beast right that fourth rider from his full ride but even with that he has still so polluted the world that the whole world has gone insane with us here what will it be when we're gone and all those chucks and stops are pulled out and the wagon rolls off the cliff i'm here to tell you something friends hide me in christ oh that's not a place you're going to want to be the world is a very tame place right now compared to what it's going to be when this bride is gone but i want you to i want to take you through a trip and and watch what brother branham shows that was released in this hour and you're going to understand the craziness that you see on the streets and it's that and it's and it doesn't matter whether it's religious crazy religion craziness and religion craziness in the ecumenical movement insanity and politics insanity and social issues and the upside down inside out total depravity of man it's all the same devil it's that antichrist system moving in every category brother branham said it's a triune uh thing of religious power political power and demon power but i'm here to tell you there's a word that is sufficient in this hour to combat it there is a presence of the living god that you cannot just break into on a wednesday night or on a sunday morning you can live there you can create a world called jesus christ and go live there how many want to live there that's where i want to live i want to live on the planet jesus i want to i got enough power to create a world and go live there so let's go do it i want to bring that world around me and fold it around me oh hallelujah this is this is where i want i want us to take a look at because i thought about this friends and i'm going to close i'm in one minute in overtime i want to say these last comments anthony bring your team please brother let's make these comments if humanity now listen don't get distracted by musicians coming forward pay close attention if if your scientific value of your elements and in your best most fit and prime condition and you're you're only i mean i mean even if we factor in inflation you might be worth a couple bucks no matter what you achieve no matter what plaque you hang on your wall no matter what trophy you put on your shelf no matter what your office door where you work says no matter your name or your title it wouldn't matter you're still only worth at best a couple of bucks you're not worth more than the guy living in the street on your scientific elements if that's true and it is then what's the point of life if god is not in control of it what is your life even worth if god is not in control of it let's stand let's bow our heads and we'll get ready to take up some prayer requests and if you're streaming somewhere and you have a prayer request just send it directly to me i'll get it i have a few already with our heads bowed and our hearts bowed [Music] lord i with with my last sentence i i just feel a sense of satisfaction i felt in quite a whirl before when i when i walked out where am i gonna start how am i gonna but now that i've went through it and just backed up and let you take over i think some things of value were said i think your children have received the word of god tonight and i feel satisfied in my heart and i feel your feeling of satisfaction now now comes that part that i can't do with any amount of words all i can do is uh i'm just a spreader of the seed that's all i am just sewing seed i've i've used my broadcaster tonight and i've broadcast seed all over this building and out across the airwaves and men and women young and old married and single male and female and [Music] they have received that seed and now we're looking for the moisture of the holy spirit to water that seed lord give it meaning in our hearts and minds i give now this service to you lord we're going to sing we're going to pray over some prayer requests but right now lord god i'm just going to step back we're going to have our worship leader lead us in some hymns and lord god i just i'm looking for worship a spirit of worship in these people lord if the word has penetrated their heart tonight may they just receive it and freely freely say now lord holy spirit let that rain now come lord let that moisture of the holy spirit as i raise up my hands to begin to worship you lord let the spirit of god now move in my heart lord god all the words that i've heard lord may they become living in reality in my life granted jesus who knows lord we may never get another opportunity to hear words we may never have another opportunity to have a a a a a broadcaster broadcast seed into our heart we don't

against judgment oh i've needed that so many times have you there's been many times i've went to the lord i knew i didn't deserve to go to the lord but i always thought well mercy rejoices against judgment so lord i'm here for mercy because listen friends bottom line is um you know if you could if you deserved it it wouldn't be mercy then would it so it obviously means you don't deserve it but he had mercy anyway these are i just wanted to read all of those out and thank you sister becca for reminding me again let's go to the lord in prayer what is it oh okay okay so meredith all right
