Happy to have you all here with us today. Amen. Happy to have brother Chris [music] Kathy and his son here with us. Amen. And um heard you all had a wonderful banner time last night. Amen. And um [music] wanted to be there myself. Wasn't quite possible, but uh I'm looking for another round of the word today. I so enjoyed Friday night. I tell you that was just for me um just next level. And so I I told I said, "Brother Aaron, what I'm going to do is it was so successful when I told you this Friday, [music] I just want you to be at 100% liberty and imagine your home." I said, "That worked so well. I'm going to do it again this morning. Take your complete liberty and imagine your home." How many would like to offer our brother [music] Aaron McGary that wonderful liberty? Amen. We're happy to have him and his family [music] here with us again. And uh we've got an afternoon of fellowship planned. So if you want to hang around after a while, Amen. And we're reopening the fellowship hall today at last. Seems like it's been years, but um we're going to have that today to give you a chance to greet brother Aaron and his family and fellowship them a little bit. Turn around and shake hands with somebody standing near you. We're going to go right to the word. Invite Brother Aaron to come forth [music] at this time. Such a good friend. uh brother Aaron I have in brother Aaron and and uh now that he's been pastoring a [music] number of years we um our we have a whole next level of things that we can have dialogue back and forth and it just makes for a a growing constant friendship. We love his family. Amen. I've been knowing them since they were all super small. Amen. And so we're happy to have him here with us today. Amen. I want to have brother Drew sing that [music] course again. And that's maybe a half a key higher than we're normally used to. Let's just do it with him. Amen. There is a land. Do you believe there's a land? Oh, our future is bright, friends. As we invite, brother, there is [music] a land. A land. [singing] I'm home. Single. [music] I'm never. [singing] [music] I've got love on this show. Oh, there is [music] [music] no [singing] miles away [music] for so far distance. I'll speed up and they'll [music] slow down. There [music and singing] is [music] amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's so good to be in the house of the Lord today and just enjoy his presence and enjoyed all the singing. I don't know if I've mentioned it here before, but I have a rule. I always have to outdo the song service and we're at 51 minutes and I usually try to do double. So I appreciate all the specials this morning. It makes it easier on me just to follow the leading of the Lord. If we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer. We'll do this before we take our scripture, but just to ask God to be present with us in the remainder of the time that we have together today and this weekend. And our gracious heavenly father, we want to offer thanksgiving to you for giving us this opportunity to be together, not just this morning, but beginning Friday. Uh for my family and myself, Lord, it's just been a privilege to be here for all the extra events that have taken place and the time together last night around a campfire and all the effort that went into that. We're appreciative of it. Lord, our time together is always virtuous. And so I just trust that as people have served and they've given of themselves that [music] and we've received of their virtue, may you pour back into them all that they've expended this morning, Lord, as people have labored. I hear the musicians and song leaders just already practicing in the pre-ervice and making sure everything's just submitted to you and yielded, Lord, and as they've given of themselves and created such a tremendous atmosphere today. May they be rewarded for their labor and their service. But above all, Father, we trust that you have been pleased with our worship &gt;&gt; and that you've now come and having inhabited our praises, you desire to speak to us. So take the bread of life and break it to us as only you can as we submit ourselves to you now. Reading your word, we pray that you bless it, sharing quotations from the message of the hour. Make it alive to us by revelation. We ask this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. And if you could take your Bibles, I'd like to read in Mark chapter 3 and read verses 22 to 27. In Mark chapter 3, again, it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. It's good to see everyone that's here. And we saw you see a lot of new faces um from the last time that we're here. And so, it's nice to see a church growing. And I think there's ways that churches grow and there's other ways that churches swell. And um if you add numbers the wrong way, that's swelling. But if you can add numbers the right way, it's growing. And so it's good to see the House of God growing. And um we appreciate the Watkins family very very much. And we're and so we are have tremendous gratitude for being able to be here this weekend and trust we'll have a little bit more fellowship after service. Mark chapter 3 verse 22. And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, he hath be elabub, and by the prince of devils casteth he out devils. And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, how can Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom be a divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rise up against himself and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. No man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house. Amen. You can be seated. [snorts] I'd like to take a um just as a part two to what we ministered on Friday night building Bethl last night around um the campfire. We shared just some similar principles along the same lines. And as a matter of fact, what I was going to preach this morning, uh, we just kind of, uh, moved and consolidated to last night. The subject matter just seemed to fit. Um, the way this weekend's unfolded, uh, it's been unique, but I just believe God had in his mind what he designed for this weekend. He's just having his way in these services. So, I'm going to make myself at home this morning and continue on this subject of building Bethl. Uh, just since we did, it's been since Friday night, maybe a lot of you weren't here on Friday night. We were looking at how that we make our heart or us as an individual a home for the Holy Spirit. Uh and then by extension our house, we make our house a home for heaven. And then even our church, this Bethl is a home for heaven. And that's a place where God dwells. It's a place where God is made known and it's a place where God has met. And so God dwells. He manifest himself. And then others can meet him there. We took it from Genesis chapter 28 where Jacob woke out of sleep and he said oh surely the Lord is in this place and he said this is none other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven and he called that place Bethl the house of God. It was a place that he identified with the supernatural, with the very presence of God. And he's saying this is where God dwells. And and it was different to him. Not that God was in creation or everywhere he went, God was there, but rather there was something special about this place where God had manifested himself on earth. He's like, "This is the house of God and the very gate into the presence of God." And so I was using these scriptures and some other things on how that our body um and our dwelling place where you live and our church are represented in this phrase Bethl or the gates of heaven. &gt;&gt; And we must have all three. &gt;&gt; You have to have a body to be a person. You have to have uh a a place to live or you're homeless. Um and you have to have a church. The scripture teaches us to gather together. The message of the hour emphasizes the need to that for that. And then we have this duty to make the inside right by the grace of God. So we have this duty to consecrate these gates whether it be our body, our home or our churches as homes to God. And I believe these things and maybe today it might still be on high level teaching just in other words not very granular or specific but it has very practical impact on home life has a very practical impact on how you live your life. When you want to be a place where he heaven is welcome, you want to be a place where God is manifested. You want to you want to be a vessel where the word is expressed. If you look at yourself as being a Bethl individually, it's going to change the way that you live your life. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And so that's uh I think maybe a good summary for where we were at on Friday night. Now, if you look at our text, I'd like to look at how Jesus when he had cast out devils, uh the response of the scribes was, "Well, this is none other than the power of Satan." and called him Beelzebub uh the prince of devils and he says Satan cannot cast out Satan. He asked the question but we know the answer is he cannot and so it's rhetorical and he says if a kingdom be divided against itself it cannot stand and he says a house if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand and he says no man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house. So say Jesus uses this to say that if I could put it this way, Christ had entered into Satan's house and he had bound Satan and because he had bound Satan he was able to cast out devils. You say Satan has not done this but I have entered into Satan's kingdom. I've entered into his house and I've bound the strong man of the house and therefore I can plunder his house where he made an individual's vessel sick. uh um I could I could go and I could cast that devil out because I bind Satan. So this that conclusion teaches us a very very great principle. But the foundation that he bases this on about a house and a kingdom being divided teaches us a very great lesson. So I want to come to those that conclusion here in a little bit. But I want to look at this foundation first in verse 25. If a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. So that word house in in in the Greek, it can refer to um an inhabited place or a property, someone's wealth or even their goods. So it's not just a room, but even all those things that relate to it. So any dwelling place where one would say this is my residence, my fixed abode. Um but then it can even mean any building whatsoever. Could be a palace, could be the house of God. It's used even of the tabernacle. And so it's more than just uh a room or a place you live, but it could even be a a tabernacle. Can be a church. uh it's used as one a body a human body that demons live in a house is considered um is used of the human body. So we can look at this to see that it looks to persons a person's individual body or the persons that form a family like a household would be the family of God or the body of Christ the church. So in this he says if a house be divided I want us to be able to put ourselves into that individually our families into that and then our church in that if it can be divided it cannot stand and he says divided against itself. So it's not just a matter of division but it's a way in which they're positioned to where it's not just um being separated out but being separated against one another. In other words, we're we're all different individuals and we're different families. And I know I don't think that we're all intermarried now in this church where everyone's related to one another. We know churches like that, don't we? &gt;&gt; Uh where everybody's related. We won't name names, but we know churches where everybody's married and every family. So, every church gathering is a family gathering. Therefore, it's just it's just toxic. No, I'm just kidding. Family uh every church gathering is a family gathering. But here you have different families, different personalities, different callings, different gifts, different backgrounds. And so it's not that we would be different, but it's being divided against ourselves. &gt;&gt; To be divided means to be separated into parts or divided into parties, split into factions. And so if it be divided against itself, the Bible says in James chapter 1 vers8, a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. If there's this double-mindedness, then there's the um the divided loyalties. Jesus says you cannot serve God and mammon in Matthew 6:24. You can't serve two masters. You'll either love one or hate the other or just hold to one and despise the other because you cannot have true 100% loyalty to two different things. You the master is the one that's an owner, a possessor, the disposer of a thing, one that has control. So two people can't have full control. So, if a man is double-minded in all his ways, he's dividing his loyalties. He's he's not giving 100% to one. And one of the uh I still can remember very very vividly when your pastor ministered at a a men's meeting years ago and he took this very very um scripture and he brought out and I hadn't caught it before in the message of the hour, which is it's no surprise. Every time a a man of God takes the word of God, I see something in the message I've never seen before. That's what I appreciate appreciate about the gifts of God. But he brought out how brother Brandham used that double-minded man as one who believes God in his head but doesn't have them in his heart. &gt;&gt; And that creates an instability because he's going to have a desire to do one thing and then a desire to do another. But there's the possessor. God isn't the possessor of his soul. So we could see that there's a um a dividing that causes instability. Cannot serve God and the world. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. So a house that is divided and then against itself that house falls. And it says on in actsap 2:es 1:2 and when the day of pentecost was fully come and we know there was a definitive point at which prophecy had to be fulfilled. So when the day of pentecost had fully come there that's when the holy spirit is poured out. And from that moment on there's no scriptural requirement that we have these tearings until the holy ghost comes. Every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the true believer. &gt;&gt; That God God can give you and is under obligation to give you the Holy Ghost. And we're not having to wait till some moment on the calendar. But it's a matter of our own yielding. And so it says when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. At one accord, it means with one mind, with one passion. And and the picture that's being painted is a beautiful one as if it was like when those the outer walls of the tabernacle were finally being raised. what happened. It was that last step for the structure to be completed. You have to have all three uh rooms. And he says as soon as that happened, the glory of God appeared a a and made himself known. And so it's when the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And and then suddenly there came a sound from heaven that one accorded uh in with what accord it means to rush along and and passion along with in unison. So to rush along or to be passionate but in unison and it creates a musical image. It creates this very uh it you seem passion and energy but it's it's done so to where nothing is out of order. They're they're rushing there's enthusiasm. There's energy but everything works in harmony. It has that musical image where in a symphony uh notes different notes are being played by many different instruments. And and though and though there's different instruments and different qualities to those instruments and different notes, they all harmonize in pitch and tone and rhythm, there's no chaos. There's no disorder. Despite those different roles, the different positions, the different notes, the different chairs, the different gifts. All those positions, different experiences, yet still it all works together to harmonize, to make one voice. When they were all in one accord in one place, suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting. Just like those walls of the tabernacle being raised, the presence of God came pouring in. And that outstanding characteristic is they were all with one accord in one place. &gt;&gt; Unity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This was a a gathering where they were unified. And and I believe it's an important characteristic. So there's we don't have to wait until the day of Pentecost for the Holy Ghost to be poured out, but there was unity that didn't hinder that Holy Ghost from being poured out. &gt;&gt; Amos 3:3 says, "Can two walk together except they be agreed?" The walking together is can they make progress? &gt;&gt; Can they journey together? It's talk the scripture speaks of being unequally yolked. That the purpose of a yoke is to bind um two beasts to the same burden and the same goal. The unequal yoking would be one who has a different goal, a different passion, a different ability, a different quality, and you're trying to yoke them to do the same job. There's an inequality. So to make progress, can two to walk together, they have to be agreed. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That agreement speaks of an appointed time or a place of meeting. And and and so one way to think about is how can two walk together unless they first meet. It's like the saying I use sometimes is, "Oh, we went to different schools together." And and and if you say it fast enough, people think you went to school together, but you went to different schools together. In order to walk together, you have to have met. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If someone walked along the beach this morning on one side of town and of the beach and then we walked the beach in another part, we couldn't say that we walked the beach together, &gt;&gt; but we both walked the beach. &gt;&gt; And so to you have to have met there's a meeting of the minds. there's an understanding. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you have to be their twin or it doesn't mean it has to be uh um this forced uh pretense where we all look the same outwardly, but there has to be some connection, some joining together. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And so there has to first be a unity because if there's not a unity, this he says that house cannot stand. &gt;&gt; It's unable to be established. &gt;&gt; It it won't stand still long enough to be placed. It it won't it cannot become grounded. It's division that prevents growth. &gt;&gt; It's division that'll cause one even in divided loyalties and the double-mindedness. It's what prevents that maturity and that develop. It's what prevents use of power. Doesn't mean you're you're not in the process. But this lack of unity is what can keep an individual from growing. Uh that double-mindedness, the divided loyalties, an unsurrendered room in their heart, then they can't progress because it says the house cannot stand. And the word even speaks of being established. So you can be established, but your growth, Paul said, who did hinder you? &gt;&gt; So there can be a hindrance to this progress that we're to be making. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 12:2, it says, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. &gt;&gt; And every city or house divided against itself shall not stand. When it's divided, it makes no progress. It may exist, but it's not going to thrive. may survive but it won't thrive. So when turned in against itself it will come to desolation. It falters or it dies. A statement that kept coming to my heart as I was preparing for these services even especially last week. Brother Bradam said, "Do you know where there's disunityity, the spirit of God is not welcome." &gt;&gt; Amen. They were all in one one mind and one accord in that upper room and they had to be in that condition because the Holy Spirit wouldn't have been welcome in that place. &gt;&gt; So where there is disunityity the spirit of God is not welcome. He said where there's a resenting spirit God won't reveal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I may be paraphrasing that a little bit but he says if there's resentment then God can't reveal himself. Where there's a spirit of disunityity the Holy Spirit is not welcome. So a house that is not united or a house that is divided, it is not a home. It's not a bethl. &gt;&gt; It's not a place where God is pleased to dwell. And so there are certain characteristics that are required in order to have a home, in order to have a dwelling place of God. If there's disunityity, the spirit of God is not welcome. So unity is required for it to be a dwelling place of God. So there's a character or if I could put it this way, God's presence should leave a mark. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are certain characteristics or attributes of God's character that should leave a mark in a place that he calls home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 32:18, my people shall dwell to me, this is the perfect definition of a home. My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places. &gt;&gt; That's more than a building. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's more than an address. That's more than a roof over your head. That's more than a cot. My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation in sure dwellings in quiet resting places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's a peaceable habitation, it's not a place of striving or fighting. It's not disturbed with the alarm of wars. You're not sleeping with the enemy. There's there's peace there. There's agreement and harmony. The sure dwellings. It's secure. There's confidence there. We read last night where brother said, "Make your home a happy place. A place where your children are pleased to be. Uh that's a place of safety. There's a place of acceptance, acceptance and comfort. A place of provision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A house that's not divided against itself where there's this infighting and this politicking, peaceable habitation, sure dwellings, quiet resting places. Not it's not solely a place for labor. And it may feel that way for children who have a lot of chores and wives who stay home and take care of the family. But the home should be a place of rest where it's not just a place of labor or strife. And this is the idea that I have in my heart. When I use the term Bethl, we could just have easily said the house of God or a home, but it's a place of peace. It's a place of provision. It's a place of comfort, safety, and rest. It's a place where you feel that you belong, a place that you want to return back to. &gt;&gt; And so, a house united, a house divided against itself is not a Bethl, but a house united is a Bethl. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that uniting and I I want to take some time to to look at this uniting because I think we do sometimes have uh different ideas of what it means to be united. And I think that in my experience, I can only speak to my experience, what I've uh some of my most difficult things to work through in my message experience has been the politics and pretense of it where there's so much that's external and there's so much conf concern about getting the outward to look right. So, we kind of all look the part of message believers, but we don't ever have like this unity in our faith with each other. Well, we we all believe the word of God and we believe these things and that becomes our common basis and our common ground. We kind of felt like if we could all make the outside look good, &gt;&gt; then we could we could play the part. &gt;&gt; But we make we got to make the inside right by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; And so a a uniting is order. A uniting is a particular arrangement. And the so the order of something and the arrangement of something gives it strength or it's what gives it its character. In 1 Peter 5:5, it says, "Ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder." And all the elders said, &gt;&gt; "Uh, they said it. They said it." Amen. Yes. Submit yourselves. He says, "Yay, all of you be subject to one to another." And all the young people said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." So, yes, we are to submit ourselves uh the youngers are to submit ourselves to the elders, but all of you be subject one to another. &gt;&gt; It says, "Submit yourselves to one another in the Lord." And then it says wives to their husbands and and husbands are going to be submitting themselves to even to their wives to this certain degree. There's this yielding to one another. &gt;&gt; It's a mutual dependency is the best type of arrangement in a family in a marriage in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Where it's a codependency that's when one is solely relied upon the other for everything. Then that's where you get manipulation and abuse. And that's where there's unnecessary controls put into place and it leads by fear. But when there's a m mutual dependency, the best way that I could describe it is one is standing at the door says after you and the other one says no after you and the other one says no after you. That there's this will this attitude. It says and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble. When it says to be subject, it means to arrange in order, to arrange under, to to uh subject oneself or to obey. But it speaks of a voluntary attitude of giving in. So that there's cooperation there. There's an assuming of a responsibility. There's a carrying of a burden. So it's one recognizing I have this part to play. You have this part to play. And this the part that I play will benefit you. The part that you play will benefit me. Together it'll benefit each other. So, I'm going to submit myself to for your need. I I'm going to submit myself to you and your need to do my part. I'm going to submit myself to my part and my need to do your part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we speak of accountability. But do you realize you cannot demand accountability? &gt;&gt; The very concept of uh accountability is that it's willfully and voluntarily asked for. &gt;&gt; I I have to ask to be held accountable. I can't just say you need to be accountable to me. Accountability doesn't work that way. So there is a acceptance of a of a position and an order. Ephesians 5:21 5, excuse me, 5:21, submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. &gt;&gt; So we're to submit ourselves to one another in the fear of God. So this submission to one another is not a hierarchy &gt;&gt; or we create people who are more powerful and people that are better. Uh because if you do that, it creates imbalance. It creates weakness. But this submission to one another is best seen as an arrangement among parts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That different parts work together in such a way to promote that part's virtue to assist this other one in their virtue so that we could all together fulfill our purpose. So when we speak of submission, it's not solely for the sake of making one subject, but it's for the sake of the whole body, for the health of the body, so that parts are arranged together. And yes, a body has a head, but the head is nothing without the body. &gt;&gt; The body nothing without the head. They see themselves then working together &gt;&gt; to fulfill a common goal and a common purpose. &gt;&gt; I'm my what comes to mind is how Paul teaches that every man must bear what his own burden and that means what he is laden with. &gt;&gt; It speaks of a ship that is being given something for carriage and they have to transfer. every man must deliver what he's been given to carry. But then he says, "Bear ye one another's burdens." And this isn't in another book. This is in the same chapter. &gt;&gt; And so there and it's two different words. There's a burden that you are tasked with carrying that you must you're you're ladened with and it's a position. It's a duty. It's a role. It's an office that you must submit to for the benefit of the whole. And you must fulfill that purpose. But when it says, "Bear ye one another's burdens," that burden, that word there means something that's weighing someone down. &gt;&gt; It's something they're not supposed to be carrying. &gt;&gt; It's something that they're not tasked with bringing through to the other side. It's something that's going to cause them to not take their their carriage and what they're laden with and properly fulfill that purpose. So, we're to lift the burden up of others. &gt;&gt; And so, it's each one taking their part. In the sermon, believest thou this? And he make, brother Banner makes this statement in a few places. He says, a home isn't the house you live in. It is the order of the house. That's what makes a home. And he quotes a tenner cottage. Why should I care? They're building a palace for me over there. He said, I've seen people lived in palaces and didn't have much of a home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the question, who is the rich man? the one who lived in a house that was very large and and big and beautiful and ornate and then quarreled with his wife and wasn't faithful. Uh who who had heaven on earth? &gt;&gt; Is that couple in the box car and even the proverbs speak of dwelling? It's better to live on the rooftop or in the corner than it is in a house where there's disunityity. &gt;&gt; I know you brothers know what that scripture says and I'm just going to use the updated the modern Bible. Come on. &gt;&gt; It's better that they live on the roof of a house than to be with them that quarrel. &gt;&gt; See, I used my they them. &gt;&gt; And so there's a it's the order of the home in the sermon thirsting for life. He says a church is what's on the inside of it really. &gt;&gt; That's what makes it up. We pass down the street many times we see a house and sometimes we say, "Isn't that a lovely home?" &gt;&gt; I remember one time my wife and I were driving uh in our travels. We had a family with us. We drove by this absolutely beautiful homestead. Everything about it looked so beautiful. My wife said, "Oh, I'd love to have that house." And I said, I wasn't threatening her or anything. I said, "Do you want the divorce that comes with it?" You know, uh I don't know if the gift was working at the time, but maybe it was. But you just there's sometimes you don't know. In other words, you don't know what's behind the white picket fence. &gt;&gt; You don't know what's on um what's on the inside because it's the inside. You go, "Oh, that's a lovely home." home. He said it might look like a lovely house, but the home is the order of the house. He says in one place, it's the characteristic of it. So he says, you see, it's the order that's in it. Order of the family. Brother Matthew, I was thinking of that sermon you ministered one time on the order of the anointing that there's an order to it. It's not just the anointing. It's not just the parts. It's the arrangement of the parts. &gt;&gt; How come the statue of a perfect man is laid out the way that it is? It matters that way. &gt;&gt; It's not all the pieces are there. It's all in there. No, they've got to be arranged the right way. &gt;&gt; He says, "I think that's what the house of God is. It isn't so much a beautiful temple, which we do appreciate, but it's the order that's on the inside of it." &gt;&gt; So, there's Brother Brandon once again bringing a parallel between the home life and the church. So, a house out of order, a house that's not arranged appropriately is a house divided. &gt;&gt; So, all you have to be in order to have disunityity is to not be arranged correctly. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this arrangement is not division, &gt;&gt; but union. &gt;&gt; So you're we're not separated into roles to divide us, but we're placed into these distinct roles with these different functions and offices in order to fit together. &gt;&gt; That's why a church has to have one pastor. &gt;&gt; There has to be there has to be one that makes certain decisions. That's why you have um church order. That's why you have a set time for church. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we just kind of all show up whenever we want. There's there's a reason for order and it's to be able to promote certain virtues to give an opportunity for certain gifts to be used and for God to speak. It's not chaotic. &gt;&gt; What we might call rules and restraints and church order and and all these different disciplines that we have, it's for the purpose of things working together. Order is necessary to have function, proper function. It's when you don't have order that you get strife. When a when a machine even in the cogs and different wheels aren't working together, you get friction. You get chaos. You get noise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Order. Even in the original Latin speaks of rows of thread in a loom. Different threads being woven together. So a house must be woven together into a home. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says it's not just the house but it has to be a weaving together just as the body of Christ is set together and woven together in Ephesians Paul describes it in these uh scientific terms about the human body each part woven together sewn together uh through which the energy flows and makes increase to the whole body itself each organ playing its part we have to have order &gt;&gt; unity is order it's an arrangement of family members in relation to one another Again, it's not emphasizing hierarchy where you have one who calls the shots and everybody else just says yes, but it's how all those parts work together. &gt;&gt; We read the scripture last night on how a pastor should rule his house with all gravity. It means honesty. And he rules it in a way where those that he rules respect him, &gt;&gt; not afraid of him. Well, if we don't do it right, he's going to beat us. And the most triggering sound to a kid is the sound of the garage door. It it's it's more respect. It's respect for one another and they have respect for their dad and and their parents for the reasons why they made the decisions they made. And so it's not a hierarchy where you have someone on the top and someone on the bottom. I'm sure you've heard the phrase low man on the totem pole &gt;&gt; and you say, "Oh, well, I'm just the low man on the totem pole." Well, the myth was that the person on the low end was the least important. But there's no evidence uh to suggest that order of the totem pole meant anything to them and their religions and their superstitions. Uh there was no particular order. But as a matter of fact, there's some that speculated the one on the bottom was the most important because they were usually larger and they upheld the structure. &gt;&gt; They're the basis. They were the foundation. And so God doesn't have this low man on the totem pole mentality. Each part is necessary. &gt;&gt; Each one has a role and has a function. And without it, the body's not whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I like to say that in the true body of Christ, there is no such thing as an appendix or a tonsil that we can just get rid of without consequence. &gt;&gt; Maybe. Well, I'm not going to go there. I was going to say maybe if you cut out tonsils and remove an appendix, it causes gender gender gender identity crises in future generations. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying it is, but could it be? We don't know. In the sermon oneness, brother Bram says any man in his family, a correct, good, noble, obedient families one with another and we're looking at building Bethl and the unity that's required because a house divided against itself cannot flourish. It cannot thrive. And so we want to be united, but it's not external pretense. It's not agreeing and submitting to rules and res regulations. I'm sure there's been times when we all thought everyone should just sign a contract. This is what we're going to do. this is what we believe and we if we don't get everyone to agree well we've just drifted right back into denominationalism &gt;&gt; but it's uh so it's not this external idea of um the appearance of being together but it's a you this uniting and this arrangement where I know my calling I know where I fit in I know what I'm doing so he says an obedient family is one with another if there's something in the family that moves them apart it's not right the family is broken somewhere they should all be one father with mother with father children of parent parent with children all in agreement. So there's this an agreement, there's an accord, there's un mutual understanding. He says, "And when you see that, you'll see one lovely picture." That's God's purpose. That's God's nature. God in the very beginning, that's what he wanted to have is he wanted he want he brought forth the family. That was the ultimate of his expression. It's when the family came forth that he said, "This is very good." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so this is something that speaks to God's nature, different parts being arranged together. And we know that there's a head. So we know that there's headship. But in in that we might say well the head has uh is and this headship gives it this preeminence at the top. And we and we see that example in Jesus Christ. But the head then if we use the example of Jesus Christ had greater service. &gt;&gt; All right. I'm gonna I'll preach over here. I I feel like everybody else look look is looking at me like a mule at a new gate. [laughter] Think about it. The service that Christ rendered was the greatest service. &gt;&gt; So the head, yeah, he may be the most preeminent, but it has a lot to do with how necessary his service is. &gt;&gt; So the head does not exist to be served. The head exists to serve. &gt;&gt; It is a position of greater service. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in life's story says home is not the house. It's the order of the house that makes the home. That's what makes home. No matter if it's a shanty, whatever it is, if the order is right on the inside and godly, it's more of a home than if you had a palace somewhere. I'd rather live in a shanty and be happy than live in a palace and be unhappy. &gt;&gt; It's arrangement. It's order. Not forced. Because the head, if you're the head of the home, I I hate to break it to you. I told brother Jason, "This might sound very odd for the stream." And so, I know they're not using that mic, but we perfor we did, we did a divorce last night. &gt;&gt; Hey, we identified who your spiritual husband was at home and or who your pastor is at home. It's your husband spiritually speaking. And and our our pastor isn't our spiritual husband. That just upsets the order of things. &gt;&gt; But we recognize in families, the husband is the head. in the church, the pastors, the the supreme authority, I believe, is how brother Brandham expresses it. And that means they are tasked with greater service, &gt;&gt; greater oversight. They have they have to be sacrificial in their love. They have to Jesus sanctified himself for the benefit of others. So, a father isn't able to say, "Well, I can do what I want, live however I want, say what I want, and do what I want because I'm the head and this is my house." As a matter of fact, he might have to not do more and restrain himself more and sacrifice more than anybody else does in the family for the sake of the family. &gt;&gt; Greater love hath no man than this. &gt;&gt; And he sanctifies himself, sacrifices himself for others sake. And so that's that position. There is headship, but in order for it to be a home, there's order. And that order is that the head serves and finds its place in in relation to the rest of the body and the rest of the body begins to serve with that example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must have order in our personal life as we relate to those three rooms, those three gates. That's our body. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9:27, "But I keep under my body and bring it into subjection." I believe this is the place where he says the words means I beat it black and blue. I treat it rudely. One of our recent family devotions was on why God askked us to do hard things. And we think, well, why does God asked us to do hard things? God knows the human uh our evolution and growth by a being hybrid and he knows our fight orflight responses. He knows how we're wired chemically and what our responses would be. And he knows that if we can when we do hard things, we become more perseverant. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we we get greater endurance and greater stamina. So God just doesn't save our souls and we're saved and now everything's fine. He begins to ask us to do hard things. You know, one of the first hard things he asks us to do, be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ fully immersed in water. You say, "Well, it doesn't seem like a hard thing, but it's hard intellectually." Well, why does that matter? &gt;&gt; But he asked us to make ourselves uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; He asked us to make oursel vulnerable. He asked us to discipline ourselves to restrict from certain things. And we say, "Oh, well, I'm not allowed to do this. I'm not allowed to do that. That's God knowing you. &gt;&gt; That's God knowing that there's going to be difficult decisions to make later on in life that as a man, you you may be put in a position one time where the devil is really trying to entice you into something and you're going to have to be able to say no. Say, "Well, how did you learn to say no to that?" Because I learned to say no to things that might have seemed very trivial in terms of how I cut my hair, the kind of clothes I wore. I got used to doing hard things so that when it came to that point, I say hard, it was hard maybe emotionally or intellectually, but not hard physically. &gt;&gt; How hard is it to present yourself in in a in a a a manly way? &gt;&gt; Maybe not very difficult in terms of the ease with which it takes to put on decent clothes. But when it comes to that time when you're having to say no to a lust and to say no to a terrible situation, he said, "I've been building up. I've been spiritually lifting weights and now it's time for my personal best because I've been lifting to failure. Now I'm put in a position where I have to say no to this. And it's because God's asked me to do hard things. When it comes time to do the hardest and put death under my feet, it'll just be another step. &gt;&gt; And so we have to bring our body under subjection. Bring our mind and body body into harmony with the word. That's the order of the individual. There's order in the church. As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:40, let all things be done decently and in order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Decently means in proper form. &gt;&gt; Wellformed. It actually speaks of the beauty, the form of something, the shape. Let everything be done decently and in order. That's a fixed arrangement. Order is a fixed arrangement. The right order, the right position, everyone being at their post. And that post that says every fixed decently and in order, it speaks of a person's quality or character. So, there's a quality, there's a gift, there's a a way God has made someone. They're suited to play the piano, they're suited to lead worship, they're suited uh to run the sound. Though, they can be some of the most uniquely suited people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In my experience, you've heard this statement before, I'm sure. United we stand, divided we fall. It's from Asop's fables. You know, there he gives these different fables about the the four oxen and the lion. There's a bundle of sticks and the lion and the bulls. And each one spoke of this principle of united we stand, divided we fall. This is a common principle that we can see over and over again. And that uniting is order, arrangement, taking my position, staying in my position because if I if I step out of position, it breaks the unity. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Corinthians 14:33. I I'll even go so far as to say this just to to help some. Sometimes we're striving so much for the the affirmation externally. And we want we want things to agree that really all you have to do is be in your place and pray that everyone else gets in their place. And just by being in your place, it creates the accord. &gt;&gt; Well, you don't have to meet somebody else uh elsewhere and say, "Well, you're out of your position, so let me get out of my position." Just stay in your position. And if you're in your position, it helps for others to be in their position. &gt;&gt; A husband in his place makes it easier for the wife to be in his place, which makes it easier for the kids to be in their place. &gt;&gt; Says, "For God is not the author of confusion." 1 Corinthians 14:33, "But of peace as in all churches of the saints." There's the unity in the local body. &gt;&gt; God is not the author of instability and disorder. But he's the author of harmony and accord. That's what peace means. Judges, it says that the Israel was knit together as one man. That's that strength that comes from being in your position. Spiritual amnesia. Just need to go a little bit more quickly now as song service is close to being matched. It may have already been. I'm getting nervous now. And you say now, well, you've you've felt nervous. You sounded nervous before, but maybe now I am nervous. I get nervous when I'm not nervous. So now that I'm nervous, I'm not nervous. Figure that out. The sermon spiritual amnesia. Brother man says, "We are identified with our families." I know that may make some of you cringe, but we are identified with our families in this human life. He says, "By marriage." So our marriage identifies us. I believe this is important to remember that as we're raised in a family, I am identified with my mother and father. And so to my mom and dad, their family was identified through their marriage. So that was the Mciris. And so now what I hope by the grace of God through my marriage, I'm creating a new identity of Megiris. So I don't have to bear the reproach, which camera is on right now of Matthew and David. [laughter] You're identified through your marriage. So when a man gets married, he now has a new identity. His loyalties aren't to mom. His loyalties aren't to dad. Now he has a new identity because a man is identified in human life through his marriage with our wives. He says and our family is identified by the union of our marriage of our marriage. So when you're a child in a home with married parents that's your family identity. But when you get married it's the union that begins to defy a new brand &gt;&gt; a new name and the son becomes a builder of that family name with the new identity. So you are you are identified by your union. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a house divided against itself, the upsetting of harmony, the breaking up of arrangement, the disorder cannot stand. As a matter of fact, the dividing against itself, a word that's used for that is contempt. You have heard where you know you're being held in contempt. Anybody been held in contempt in court and sentenced to 30 days in municipal jail for contempt? Anybody? Where are the preacher kids? Let me find out. Have you been accused of riot and unruly? I was picking on brother Gideon a little bit last night. So none of you been held in contempt. Neither have I. Even in my legal practice, I have not been held in contempt. But it means you've upset the order. &gt;&gt; Things are out of order. &gt;&gt; And they say that one of the biggest signs of a divorce is contempt. And they look at it as maybe I'm just I can't stand what they say. I can't take uh you know stand what they do. But it's orders broken somewhere. You are now divided and a house divided cannot stand. &gt;&gt; The division is not the ruin. The division is what leads to ruin. &gt;&gt; So if you're divided, it's not, oh, it's over. It's no, that's the seeds of ultimate ruin. &gt;&gt; So it's at that point where you see that we're drifting. There's contempt. There's disorder. Something is broken. We've got to got to come back together and unite. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's look at verse 24 where we read before because I think we can just take one last step here and finish finish this morning. I I feel pretty good that we finished this morning, especially now that it's 12:35 and Lord willing, we'll finish this afternoon. In Mark 3:es 24, 25, 26, 27, says, "If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand." And if a house div be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. Put yourself in that. Put that three- room house, the gates of heaven. Me as an individual, if if I'm torn internally, if I'm divided, I'm can't flourish. &gt;&gt; If I make a step and I'm not sure of it, I'm going to be wondering, did I make do the wrong thing? So, there's got to be some there has to be harmony. The Holy Spirit on the inside of the inside is the control tower. And your spirit gets aligned with that, and then your actions align, and there's no worry about hypocrisy. Same within a family. We looked at that unity and that order and then by extension that works to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see where we could preach for weeks on those subjects. &gt;&gt; And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rise up against himself and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. So the division becomes the precursor to the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 27, notice this. No man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house. This is the conclusion that was based upon this foundation of a house being divided against itself cannot stand. A house divided cannot stand. And Jesus then to amplify that and kind of cap it off says no man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil it and ruin it. Because he's talking about something being brought to an end. He says, "Satan's house could not be um spoiled except one first enter into and bind the strong man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hope you're catching this. And then he will spoil his house. So this is very rich in meaning for us. &gt;&gt; Christ entered into Satan's house and he bound the one in control under his authority and cast out devils. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so binding the strong man divides the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where division begins. Bind the strong man. And that's how you can ultimately defile a house and destroy it. &gt;&gt; If you can bind the strong man, it unravels the strength &gt;&gt; and that unraveling of the strength. I hope that I can amplify this a little bit. So I'll make the statement now and then I'll try to come and back it up. to to bind the strong man is to take that strength that it ought to have and cause it to bow to the wrong order, &gt;&gt; to submit to the wrong arrangement. &gt;&gt; Binding the strong man, we think, well, we put him in shackles, but really all you have to do is create a different subjection, &gt;&gt; create a different order. &gt;&gt; You bind the strong man when he ought to be submitted to one thing, but now he submits to another. &gt;&gt; You bind the strong man by getting him out of his place, because then that divides the order. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want you to think deeply. The div the division begins when we get out of place. &gt;&gt; So if you can bind what gives any house its power, you can divide it and you can ruin it. &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus could not have come in and cast out devils unless first the prince of devils, unless first Satan was bound and had no power and then he could rid that house of those evil spirits. The word bound here it means one who is under. You have to bind the strong man. This word means one who's under a lord to give service. So you're bound to service or loyalty. So to bind the strong man is to bring him under the power of another. This word is used in other places. says in Luke 13 11 it says, "And behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of an infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift herself up." The infirmity made her bend forward. It was she was bowing under the weight of that sickness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Caused her to be uh bowed in Luke 11 13:16. And ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan hath bound lo these 18 years be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day. So look at it this way. We I know Jesus says, "I am the one who entered into Satan's house. I bound the strong man and cast him out." But he said, "If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand." And he gives us this one-s sentence look into how this can happen. Just bind the strong man and you can spoil the house. So we want to learn from that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not looking at the anatomy of a devil being cast out, but we're looking at the anat anatomy and the autopsy of houses that fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. of unions that that break. Satan in these verses, Luke 13, he had put a woman under a bind. He had bound her. And what did Christ do? He loosed the bond. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He broke the tire, that chain. So, I I I'm bringing this to a close. As a matter of fact, I want you to begin to anticipate that musicians may shortly be on the platform. I have just created without artificial intelligence a new turning point in a service. Usually we say if the musicians would come, &gt;&gt; right? But now I'm saying that I will be in the future inviting the musicians to come thereby creating anticipation of a close. But Bethl, if we're talking about building a Bethl, &gt;&gt; it's spoiled when we're bound by another power. When another power bows us down, &gt;&gt; says, "Bind the strong man." &gt;&gt; The strong man of the house, it's the man of strength in a house. And if we're looking at an individual, that should be the husband. &gt;&gt; So the the easiest way to put a bind on a house, the easiest way to create disunity is bind the strong man. Bind the husband, bind the master of the house. And in doing so, that bond even needs to to cause to grow the husband, that band. It means to cause to grow, bind the strong man. If the husband is under a different influence other than the headship of Jesus Christ, then that gives rise to the influence of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's that through which through that power alone. It's just a gradual step out of place in room enough to work. &gt;&gt; First Corinthians 11:3. But I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man and the head of Christ is God. There's God's order. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "The head of Christ is God." And Jesus says, "When you seen me, you've seen God." And the father was in him. And Jesus did nothing but what the father told him to do. There was that union and that harmony expressed between the father and the son. That same dynamic now works between the bride and Christ where it's together. It's mutual dependency. We're finishing his work. And so there's headship. God is the head of Christ. Christ ought to be the head of every man because the man is to be the head of the woman. And if Christ isn't the head of the man, but he maintains headship over the woman, that breaks headship. It moves it into a different category where it's by hierarchy alone. It's by gender alone that he's now been made the head. But man is the proper head of the woman when Christ is the head of him. &gt;&gt; Man should be the physical and spiritual protector and provider of his wife and his family. And so when you compromise the strong man, then you can weaken the unity of the family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I know that uh I'm not trying to alienate my friends here today as being husbands and fathers in their homes, but I do think that that's where we can start &gt;&gt; is as a strong man. But there is even a spiritual application of Jesus, the word Christ being the strong man in the home. And that if he when he leaves your home, trouble's on the way. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't have place, &gt;&gt; if his spirit's not welcome. &gt;&gt; And so there is power in that the unit of the husband and wife, the father and the mother. Brother Brandham said in the world has fallen apart. He said the beautiful virtue that God gave a woman to be a mother has been marred and that's the backbone of the nation. &gt;&gt; You break motherhood and you've broke the nation. Right? Then he said that's what holds it together is real genuine parenthood. The condition of the nation today, the sin that's reflected in the nation today. This ought to be a comfort to everyone here. If I've mentioned this before, it's by means of repetition that I believe is reinforced and I believe other ministers uh here are certainly more capable of teaching these things than myself. But don't let the familiarity uh water down just how impactful this is. But brother Brandham is saying that the the worldly condition, the perverted condition of the world today is a result of the family unit being broken. &gt;&gt; Like, oh, I'm afraid to raise kids in this world. Well, only be afraid if you're not committed to a good strong family unit. &gt;&gt; Because if the cause of the worldliness is a broken family unit, the cure for the worldliness is a strong family unit. &gt;&gt; The protection from the worldliness is a strong family unit. How did the filth get into the church? You broke the family. How did the filth get into the markets? You begin to break down these other elements that make up society. Society didn't get together one day and say, "I think we should just get more worldly." And then society began to get more worldly and families started saying, "We want to be like society." No. Families begin to get worldly and it permeates into society. The world looks the way it does. The world looks the way it does today when Christ was kicked out of the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How was Christ kicked out of the church? Individuals and families developed a taste for fanaticism &gt;&gt; in isms and humanity &gt;&gt; and they went chasing after their traditions and Christ was kicked out of the church. So what's the way to strengthen your your home from world? Invite Christ back in. &gt;&gt; Strong family units are the cure, the inoculation, the strength and the defense to the worldliness that's on the outside. It's the strength of a church. the sermon thirsting for life. He says that's what breaks up homes. That's what spoils children. That's what makes neurotics. That's what makes teenage delinquency is when motherhood and fatherhood is broke. &gt;&gt; The crisis we have today of mental health and the crisis we have today of all these social problems and identity issues, it comes back and it traces back to the defiling of the family unit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The upsetting of the order of not just a a leave it to Beaver, Mr. Clever type look. It's not um father knows best look. It's not what Holly would present, but it's the image of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's that picture that we see in the word of God that says how a man ought to treat his wife and how a wife ought to reverence her husband and the way that they work together submitted one to another and they create this dynamic in the home where there's mutual respect and there's a passion for their children and they love one another and they love their children's hearts and they want to cultivate them to grow up to be decent uh uh uh children and human beings of integrity and honesty with virtue and character and we're all in this together. But if you begin to break down that structure, that biblical structure within the home, that's what you get on the outside. &gt;&gt; And listen, I don't mean to get caught sideways here and and brother Jason, just tackle me if you need to, &gt;&gt; but there's so much uh so many lies spread on social media about trades. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; You're going to make me start preaching. and this image of a a an alpha male in the home. And it's nothing more than a perversion &gt;&gt; because they've tried to create the the appearance of a traditional wife and an alpha male without having the alpha and omega in the relationship. &gt;&gt; They don't they they are using tradition to make the word of God an effect. But I'm just happy being a submissive wife at home. It looks nothing like the scripture would have a wife to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so there is this there is a little bit of a an upswelling of morality and traditional virtues and Christianity and it has a rise within a political a political reign. And let me say this, if you think it's just brother brother Aaron's opinion, the antichrist presents more as Republican than he does Democrat. &gt;&gt; There I said it. &gt;&gt; I'm free. [laughter] and I don't have to worry about getting assassinated. &gt;&gt; But it's that false religion. &gt;&gt; It it's this pretense. It's with the lips. &gt;&gt; But they have the same motive and objective &gt;&gt; of power and control. &gt;&gt; But what breaks up homes? What's caused spoiled children and made neurotics? Why do we live in this anxious age that we do now? Why is there so much delinquency and a lack of even of decency? We broke motherhood and fatherhood. &gt;&gt; It's a a lack of respectability, &gt;&gt; hypocrisy. That's how you break motherhood. You become a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; That's how you break fatherhood is you become a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; It's where there's selfish ambition in the father, selfish ambition in the mother. This inability to feel for one another, for their spouses, for their children. They make things about themselves. It's uh they become uh they're no longer self-aware where they impose restraints and restrictions on everyone else, but they can indulge themselves. There and listen, it there's there's way too much to be able to try to address it all in one sermon. I could speak without end on these issues now, but I'm so glad that it's been diagnosed through a prophetic lens to say the problem is a lack of alignment and harmony with the word of God in these positions and offices. So, I'll say this, musicians, if you'd come, it has begun. &gt;&gt; We cannot, we must not allow ourselves, no matter who we are, we must not allow ourselves to be subject to the world. We have to individually purpose that I I am going to I'm going to put God first. That was what we ministered on last night. our first duties to God, the next duties to our family. I'm the third. And your first duty to God is then to offer up your body as a living sacrifice that your soul would become a temple for God. So it's not to put family first without a new birth experience and say, "Well, I was just so busy serving the church and serving my family. I never had time to get the Holy Ghost." No, you put God first. That means he dwells in you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then you put your family second. You're third. All your ambitions, all your plans, all your dreams, all your individual idiosyncrasies, those are third. I have to see how I can serve God first and then my family through that service to God. We touched on how God would never call you to serve the church at at the sake of losing your family. Now, following Christ may cause you to lose your family. &gt;&gt; But what we've done is we've substituted service to church for service to Christ. And our families suffer because we we were serving the church. We were at our post of duty. Meanwhile, families are falling apart. And you say, "Well, if man's not willing to leave father and mother and wife and brother and sister and we've completely confused what the gospel is and what Christ's sake is, &gt;&gt; and we've made it just church. And we really get it upset and we get it turned upside down. But we must be submitted to the word of God. In Luke chapter 24, it's on the road to Emmas that those disciples that begin to walk, it got towards evening and Christ has opened up the word and they said, "Abide with us toward evening. The day is far spent." And and so Jesus went into their home. That's what that's what we're wanting to do, right? Wanting to invite Jesus Christ into our home. &gt;&gt; Lord, I invite you into my heart. I invite you into my family unit, my house, my apartment, my cottage, whatever it might be. Lord, I I want you to make my house a home. I want your presence to be welcome. I want it to be a place, yeah, we we we maybe have family movie night and we play games and there's certain things that we enjoy to do. We let our kids do and our house, we just we live in our house. We're ourselves and it can get messy. But I want it to be a place where if anytime we need to turn to the word, we can do that. and that we have times that we do do it in the evenings for devotions, maybe in the morning, but we pray and and sermons are being shared. I I I love um I love I know this may be a triggering word, but family chats can be very triggering for people. And so we have a we have a family text group with just me and my family identified by the union that I have with Sister Elizabeth. And in that we have our children are in there and we have in that family there's more quotes shared from the sermons my children are listening to than memes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we might respond with a meme to the quote but you know it's it's there. The words being lifted up and the opportunity it's he's welcome. That's what our goal is, &gt;&gt; right? Is for him to be welcome. Not imposed, not forced, but welcome. And so they constrained him to stay stay. And it came to pass as he sat with meat with them, he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them. And it was then that their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight. And what's remarkable about this story is when they went in verse 35, they're now saying that, "Oh, Jesus came and he made himself known to us. This is what they say." And they told him the things that were done in the way. Verse 35, and how he was made known of them in breaking of bread. Jesus Christ was known by breaking [music] bread. And why was it that he was known when bread was broke? We know that he did something he had done before. But it wasn't just the bread that was being broken. And whenever someone would break bread, they I remember Jesus broke bread. But who was it that broke the bread? Master. And when he broke bread, he did something in their home that the head of the house would normally do. When you're invited into someone's home, how many of you on turkey day here most recently went into someone's home and after brother Aaron had smoked a nice turkey, I'm glad there's another brother Aaron that smokes. So now I have a partner, a brother Aaron that smokes. And so if anybody ever accuses me of smoking, I said, "Oh, no, no, that's not me. That's that's another brother." He goes to brother, he plays the bass in brother Jason's church. [laughter] You smoke a turkey and you have everything ready and the guest you brought in, hey, why don't you come? They go over there, they just kind of get in the way and they start carving the turkey. No, it's reserved for the head of the house. &gt;&gt; So, the breaking of the bread was an act only performed by the head of the household. And so, what did what did Jesus demonstrate in that moment? And what did what did these strange these disciples allow Christ to be? To become the head of the household. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he broke bread. And when he broke bread in that house, they he was declaring himself to be the master in the head. And that is what we can do to be a Bethl. Lord, break your bread in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he can do in our homes. He can be the one that takes control. He breaks the bread. That's what he ought to be in Bethl is it's a place where God's bread is broken. The word of God has preeminence. All these other things that we do as a church are there to create this kind of atmosphere and have everyone in their place where they sit spellbound by the word that's going forth. &gt;&gt; That's why we have service time that we do. That's why we come early and pray. That's why these musicians sacrifice throughout the week. That's why there's effort put into making the sound just right and everything. It's so that Christ can come as the head of Bethl and break bread. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And so he wants to break bread in you personally as you read your Bible and pray. wants to break bread in your family homes as you have a family altar as you fellowship with one another. Let Christ demonstrate his headship. &gt;&gt; That's the order that we need more than ever before. Let Christ come and break bread &gt;&gt; as the head of the house. Don't let that one be bound. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in Joshua chapter 24, as we read yesterday, verses 14 to1 17, he says, "Fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord." We say, "Well, the gods of Egypt were buried and the army was uh uh buried in the sea. We're we're in a new land." But now he says, "And if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you'll serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that are on the other side of the flood or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell." Listen, as children raised in this message, we may not go back to serve denominational gods that our parents came out of, but there's plenty of Amorites in this land that we're in. &gt;&gt; And he says, "But as for me, in my house, we will serve the Lord." That was Joshua's commitment. at the point at which we're going to possess this land. And it had to it wasn't a matter of consecrating the land. It was a matter of consecrating me &gt;&gt; and my house. &gt;&gt; As for me and my house, we'll serve the Lord. And the people answered. Listen to what how the people answer. God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods. For the Lord our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what are they identifying? To continue to serve gods in their promised land would bring them under the same servitude they had in Egypt. That service to other gods is bondage. That's how you bind the strong man of the house. He says, "Choose you this day whom you'll serve. Who will you labor for? Who will you work for? Who will you be subject to? I believe that each one of us can say or what I'd like to challenge you on this whole subject of building building Bethl is challenge yourself. I will not let the strong man to be bound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if he can be bound, that will weaken me. &gt;&gt; If he can be bound, it'll weaken my family. If he can be bound, it'll weaken the church. If the if the message could be somehow distilled down to uh to a sound bite, maybe sound bite's the wrong word, but just to some theme, it it in a final analysis, it's the unchaining and the loosening of Christ. &gt;&gt; The one that had been covered by creeds and dog, the one that had been bound by denominational changes, the one that had been kicked out. It's a restoration that this Bible is our absolute and you can trust it and count it as the word of God. That's how the Bible became a new book. So now that when we look into it, we're seeing the face of God. We're seeing a mirror image of Jesus Christ in ourselves. &gt;&gt; And so it's letting Christ be free. Do not let Christ be bound. Do not let yourselves be bound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a deliberate decision to allow your heart to be established as a house for God, your homes to be a home for heaven, to let God's promises be your foundation. That's our That's what we can do to build Bethl. Let's stand to our feet. Let's pray together. What key are you in? &gt;&gt; Can you put it in G? Maybe we I don't know if you sang worthy of it all in G. I know [music] it works in G, but maybe we could just sing that he's worthy of worthy of all that we have to give him. But let's just pray together. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, in this afternoon as it begins to get later in the day and we've taken our liberty today to expound upon things that are very relevant and feeling pressed to do so in a way that was uh relatable and and applicable. I ask Father that you hear our hearts cry now from individuals, young people, young married couples and families and this church. Lord, if a name means something, if Ricky and Rquetta carried with it a negative connotation of these ways that we can use these nicknames and they [music] carry with them spirits, if a name refers to a person's character, then by calling this church Bethl, it means something, Lord. And it's reflective of what every single one of us ought to be, a living tabernacle for the living God. And so Lord, I pray for the individuals that make up this church, the families, the individuals that make up families and the families that make up this church that we could just now in our hearts maybe without this precise detailing, but just as a a vision, as a overarching theme, Lord, I I want to commit myself. I have a duty to make the inside right by the grace of God. And so Lord, I want to commit myself, make a deliberate decision to be a dwelling place of your presence. I want to make a deliberate pre uh decision to be in my place, to be arranged properly, to find the gifts that you're cultivating, the position that you'd want me to be in, Lord, so that I could begin to thrive spiritually as an individual and thereby, Lord, be a better husband and a better father and our family units could begin to thrive. And then as our family units begin to thrive around your presence in our homes, it just adds to this church. And then this church can begin to grow through character development, begin to grow through souls being saved from off the streets because they're meeting Bethls all over town. So Lord, I commit the people to you now. We give our lives to you. All that we are. Lord, I don't just give you my dress. I don't just give you my haircut. I'm not giving you my language and the movies I watch. Lord, I'm going to give you my heart. Give you my body. I'm going to give you my mind. I'm giving you what I am on the inside. Lord, just as revelation from out is an impossibility that it has to happen within. May it please you to reveal your son in me &gt;&gt; so that it can be done in me. So, I give you myself. I I give you my heart that you're worthy of this offering of my soul. Now, I just surrender. And I'm not worried about what the outside's going to look like. I'm not worried about what my home's going to look like. I'm not worried about what church is going to look like. I just know if I can be a Bethl, if I be a dwelling place of your power and your glory, Lord, from there peace will reign. I'll be safe and I'll be secure. Let hell and high water come. I'm safe in your arms. &gt;&gt; And Lord, may we stand as individuals, strong and secure, in a peaceable habitation, a sure dwelling, a quiet resting place because you're there. You found home in my heart. And Lord, may it just flow from there to these other gates of heaven. May we be a heaven on earth. May this church be a heaven on earth. May these homes be a heaven on earth. Lord, for brother Jason and sister Debbie, [music] they're moved into a a church cottage, Lord, that has housed many weary travelers and ministers and families. Lord, Lord, may it be dedicated and set aside for them that give service to this church so near to the place that they've committed and dedicated their lives and they've cried and they've bled and they've been wounded and they've served and they've given and they given. But Lord, pour out your presence upon them in this little place, Lord. In this dwelling, may it be a quiet resting place. May it be a peaceable habitation. May it be a sure dwelling. Not because it's of its proximity to the church, but despite its proximity, Lord, not because it's such a beautiful, expansive, vast uh mansion, but Lord, because you're there. You're the lifter of their head. You're the you're they're you're the calm in the midst of the storm. You're the the rock and the shadow in a weary land. You're the high place above our enemies. Lord, I pray that you would grant it to each one of us that we could find solace in you and that when we return home today, we could have Lord, you promise me that this home could be a sanctuary. Lord, I don't have to leave church to go to a sanctuary. But I'm going from sanctuary to sanctuary. Let us purpose to apply the token. Make our hearts a sanctuary. Make our homes a sanctuary. So that when we come to this sanctuary, it's the omnipotence meeting in an omnipotence gathering. have your way we pray Lord as &gt;&gt; we commit it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you are worthy of it all. Just worship him now. You are worthy of it all.

In the vapor of your breath, the planets form. If the stars are made to worship, so will I. [music] Oh, I can see your heart in everything you make. [music] Every burning star a signifier [music] of grace. If creation [music] sings your praises, so will I. Oh, and as you speak, [music] oh, [singing] a 100 [music] billion galaxies are born in the vapor of [music] your breath. The planet is full. If the stars are made to worship, so will I. [music] Oh, I can see your heart in everything you've [music] made. [bell] Every burning star a [music] sign of grace. If creation sings your [music] praises, so alive. And as you [music] speak, 100 billion creatures. Oh, a 100 [music and singing] billion creatures catch your breath. [music] Oh, evolving in pursuit of what you said. And if all of nature reveals [music and singing] you so alive, oh, I can see [music] your heart in everything you say. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; every painted sky, a canvas of your [singing] grace.

[music] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. [singing] [music] Oh hallelu. [singing] [music] And I know it's not much. I'm nothing else fit for a king. Oh, except for a [music and singing] heart singing hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. [singing] If [music] you know it, just help me sing it. All my words fall short. I've got nothing [music] new. How could I express all my gratitude? [music] I could sing these songs as I often [music and singing] do. The every song must end [music] and you never do. So lift up your hands. Oh, [music and singing] so I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; is all that I have. Listen, despite how hard it's been, thank him for it.

[music] [singing] Oh, except for a heart singing [music] hallelujah. [singing] Hallelujah. [music] [singing] I want to just encourage you. Oh, [music] so come on my soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me.

[music] [singing] I want to sing the bridge again, but I just feel to impress [music] something on you before I turn it over to your pastor or whoever's taking the service. The devil would want you to be afraid to leave. Why? Because, well, [music] it just felt so good to be in Bethl. But you are Bethl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your home is a Bethl. You're not leaving this sanctuary to uh to to return to a place where there is no sanctuary. You're going to go from one sanctuary [music] to another. And you're a sanctuary in between. &gt;&gt; And so, if you feel the least bit timid or shaken or fearful or worried about what the future holds, come on my soul. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't you get [music] shy of me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not a matter of praise while we're singing it beautifully right now. But when you leave, you got a lion, Jesus Christ [music] &gt;&gt; inside of you. And because the lion's in you, you can be a lamb in whatever in different situations. And I think about you young people, the young married couples. I have a just a deep love for brother Jason's family and his children. Brother Matthew and his children. Got to know his family. I said, "Don't be afraid of what the future holds." And you've got Christ on the inside. [music] and and the world is in its oppositions and its questions and everything we face. Let you've got a lion inside of your bones. [music] And so don't get up. Get up and praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand as a a Bethl. I'm a rock that's been stood up erect and a vast desert of Leodysia. And the anointing oil has been poured over me. And I'm nothing but a gate of heaven. &gt;&gt; I'm a dwelling place of the living God. And I'm not afraid of what tomorrow holds. I'm not afraid of the future persecution. I'm not afraid of the stress. I'm not afraid of the the physical words. I'm not afraid of everything because I know in me is Jesus Christ and I want my voice to be heard. So come on my soul. Don't you get shy on me. Lift [music] up your song cuz you've got a lion inside of those lungs. Get up and praise the Lord. [singing] [music] Oh, and come on my soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me. Lift [music and singing] up your song. Cuz you've got a lion inside [singing] of those lungs. Oh, get up and praise [music] the Lord. [singing] Come on my soul. Come on my soul. [music] Oh, and come on my [singing] soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me. [music] Oh, cuz you got a lion inside [music] of those lungs. Get up and praise the Lord. [music and singing] So I throw up my hands. I'm going to praise [music] you again and again. Day and night like day [music] is [singing] a hallelujah [music] [music] singing [music] hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] [clears throat] You know, Solomon said that there's a time and a season &gt;&gt; for everything under the heaven. There's all kinds of different services and church services [music] that you can attend and you have attended for years and if you're like me raised up from a child attending church services and there's every every kind of variation. There's there's there's high octane preaching. There's there's teaching. There's and then then that has all of its categories. There's teaching on prophecy, teaching on this and that or Bible principles. [music] There's [clears throat] there's stuff that just puts the real meat of of God's word on your bones. And ever so often it comes a time in a season where God just brings it down to really like brother Bisco used to say, right where you live, right to your address. &gt;&gt; How many know that the Lord has found us this weekend? &gt;&gt; He's found your address. He's found right where you are. And I have been so penetrated by the material [music] and it's so challenging to me. Did you ever imagine that Bethl Tabernacle was never to be just a church building? &gt;&gt; That's right. I think to myself, how did it how has it taken me 30 years to realize that you're Bethl Tabernacle? And remember, as brother Aaron just said, you know, you leave you leave this dwelling place of God, you go to your home, which is the dwelling place of God, and you're the dwelling place in between. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Did you ever imagine that you are the gate of heaven? Just say it. I am a gate of heaven. &gt;&gt; I'm a gate of heaven. I I think this should this should inform our thinking to such a level your whole perspective after today. You're headed into getting ready to head into a new year. What a better way to close out a year to to suddenly come full circle and realize I'm a gate of heaven. I am a Bethl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am a Bethl, &gt;&gt; a house of God. I think I think about I was thinking as brother Aaron was preaching and I've never looked at that he he did the same thing to me he did on Friday took an angle to a scripture I'd never looked at it like that before. I told him I said man brother that sound like brother Abraham Myra. He does that all the time. And then today, as many times I've read over the years since a boy, you know, Jesus giving the parable, you know, you first got to go in and bind the strong man. And Jesus is giving the insider trading in intel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They're they're they're they're accusing him of, oh, you're you're using Satan to cast out Satan. And Jesus is answering that question. That's not what's happening. That's he's trying to say to them, Satan, first of all, if Satan is divided, he can't even stand. Here's what's happening. Catch it. There's no way unless you first go into a man's home and bind that strong man. That's what you see happening. I've went into his domain. I've came into his domain and I bound him. And you know, a prophet talked to us and and it's in the scripture and in the message. The power of binding and loosing is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand that Jesus he he went into that's how he he conquered every principality. He went into death, hell, and the grave and conquered all of it &gt;&gt; and bound the enemy. And that's why the Bible says that we now catch it because now what are we fighting? Principalities, powers of darkness, powers of the air. But you have been given the secret [music] that the ability is in you as as a gate of heaven for God to come through you. Go in right here and walk these streets of Satan's Eden and bind the enemy. Yes. &gt;&gt; And spoil his house and bring your loved ones out of his out of his prison. Bring your family out of his prison. Bring your neighbors out of his prison. Oh my goodness, friends. What God could do in a revival if we could catch such a vision as that. I just say, my goodness, blessed be the name of the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Have you enjoyed this whole weekend of services? I told brother Aaron after Friday night, I woke up actually this morning thinking about it and I had so many good reports from the the campfire service last night and the gathering and well attended and I and uh and I I thought to myself, wow, th this is this is ridiculous. We've got to bring brother Aaron more often. Amen. Bethl Tabernacle. How many would like to see our brother and his family come more often? My goodness. [applause] Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Did you know you can say that backwards? It means the same thing. Turn around and shake hands with somebody. We're going to get ready to be dismissed. Amen. And we want you to go in the love of God. And uh before we go, I want to close out the day in prayer and just say, "Brother Chris Kathy, could you come on up and close us out in prayer?" And I just want you to know we'll have brother Aaron and his family in the in the fellowship hall uh throughout the afternoon eating and fellowshipping. So give you a chance to come in and greet him. Greet his family. Tell them how much we appreciate them being here. Amen. It's [music] good to be a Christian, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Like brother Brandham. He says, "If I wasn't a I don't even know what I could do. If I wasn't a Christian, I don't even know what I could do." Oh my. It's I'm happy to have had you all here today and the different visitors. We're glad uh Amen. and that Jeff and Hope and Milo got to come be with us. [music] So happy to see them and all of you different ones. Amen. God bless you all. Come, brother Chris. So happy to have you, your son, here with us today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Treat the people. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Wow. Wonderful word [music] today. &gt;&gt; I needed it. &gt;&gt; It's going to be stronger in my house. &gt;&gt; It's time to stand up &gt;&gt; with the word of God. Thankful for the word. Let's just go to him. Father, God, we're so thankful that you've applied the Isab to our eyes, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God, and opened the book from Genesis to Revelation, Lord, God, as I was driving here today, Lord, I we could be in all these other churches, but you've called us out. &gt;&gt; God, [snorts] you've gave us a truth, Father, and a charge to stand against the devil, Father. And we just thank you for the word that's went forth in our homes. And God has penetrated deep in my life, Father, to stand in in my home, Father. And God, I just ask you take this Bethl tabernacle, Father, and let it be stand against every stronghold, every enemy, Father, that might come in charge, Father. We take victory today, Father. We love you, Father. We thank you for this service. We thank you for your servant that gave out today, God. May you refill them, Father. May you just bless everyone that's came, Lord. Every father in here that would leave this place, Father. They wouldn't just take it lightly, Lord. They would God, just take charge and stand strong in your word, Father. We love you, Father. We give you our lives. We give you our all and all, Father. We just thank you for another day to serve you, Lord. God, to know you in a a special way, Father, as your prophet was saying when I was just coming over here, God, if we were be ba Beethoven, Father, we would write good songs. But God, you've called us to be sons and daughters of a king. And God, how much more who we who we should be today. Forgive us of our failures as we leave this place. Let us be a light in this dark world. Father, we love you. Bless your pastor here, Father. everyone that's here. God, we love you, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Chris, [snorts] God bless you, friends. Go in the love of God. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise you [music] again and again. [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] And I know it's not much, nothing else fit for king [music] except for a heart singing hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I've got one response. [music] I've got one move with my arms stretched wide. I [music] will worship you. So I'll hold [music] my hands. Praise you again and again. [music] All I have is [singing] [music] hallelu [music] and I know it's not much fit for him. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sing hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. So you give [music] me [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. [music] Yeah.
