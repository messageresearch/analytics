and we're very happy to be here amen sister debbie and i had a really nice visit with her folks there in north carolina so i sure appreciate all the prayers and that went forth and the lord just we accomplished quite a bit amen had some really good extended time with her mom and dad and and her siblings and the family come over and we're just looking for the lord's perfect plan in it all amen i've just said lord you know if the time of sister linda's departures at hand well the lord knew that the day she was born what day she would come home and so uh you know i just said let her depart and and in health there's no need that you know calvary purchased every redemptive blessing and just because you leave this life it doesn't mean you have to leave it sick you know i just i mean that is an ultimate healing but still i just say lord give her every redemptive blessing that she's entitled to and calvary entitled her to all of them amen and i said if it's not her time and the enemy's just trying to run in with take do something prematurely because he'll do that he'll do that and that's why we have prayer that's why you have the ability to interdict see don't let him get away with that he comes in prematurely like that no sir we're saying lord god extend her life and and restore health to her so um we love her and i i was able to express some thoughts on my heart i've never been able to relate to people who talk about in-law problems i just can't get my mind around it i've loved my mother and father-in-law wow 40 years it's been a tremendous tremendous tremendous relationship amen and so uh amen they they gave me the best friend i ever would have in the world amen and i got the pick of the litter and i tell them that all time amen praise the lord so god bless you this morning we're going to invite you to ephesians chapter 3 we greet some of our visitors we see here god bless you be welcomed among us god bless you we're happy delighted to have you just make yourself at home in the camp of god's family we're just simple people who love the lord amen it's all good brother anthony i appreciated that worship service and those specials amen two of them were at my request and i got a bonus mr amber that was wonderful god bless you amen praise the lord amen my i'm sure you were singing along weren't you honey yeah amen praise the lord so i love that song that is a epic song and so just done so beautifully today i want to invite you to ephesians chapter 3 and we want to just uh catch verses 14 through 21 and then we'll be turning to genesis 28 but we'll let you be seated first so ephesians chapter 3 and verses 14 to 21 amen let's read all right let me find my place here oh i'm not going to find it in ephesians 4 will i okay 14 to 21. for this cause paul's speaking to the church at ephesus for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man how many want that that should be the quest of your life friends to be to have god come and strengthen by the power of his spirit your inner man verse 17 now here's why here's here's what this will accomplish that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god i never cease to get amazed that paul is saying to this ephedian believers who have been born again for three decades and he's saying i want you to be filled amen so there's one filling in many refillings amen and there's a uh we'll know as we follow on to know remember i've said to you many times you know it's god didn't meet you at an altar and say okay you're saved see you in heaven you know he he's he has a grand purpose and we want to talk about that grand purpose of our life today amen so that you may verse 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god now unto him that is able to do exceedingly exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us that's that's the uh somebody someone says god's got all of this for me what's the catch well there's a little there's a catch that now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think how many want that but here's the limitation according to the power that worketh in us so however much prophet said however much you'll empty out of the world christ will come in and take that so how much do you want from him he you can have it all but it's going to require surrender it's going to require letting him come into your life seeing that you're you don't realize you're your got your hand on the regulator amen the lord's purpose remember i've said to you before the lord's purpose is that you be filled with all so don't don't leave here today and say oh i wish god would do this i wish god do that i wish i could have this always could have that you know the only decision to be made here is yours because you now already know his his decision is to fill you with all what's your decision see are you willing to let him be all see so you're a free moral agent he's not going to force himself on you all right now verse 20 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us verse 21 unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen i want to speak to you today on a world between worlds let's pray father we commit ourselves into your hands just now we ask for your divine anointing lord we've we've read the word and we know that the word comes anointed it's the bible says there's a blessing just reading it or even there's a blessing just hearing it read so father we know the word is anointing anointed but it's we now that's both speaker and hearer who stand in need of a supernatural anointing otherwise lord the gospel is just knowledge and it's just a letter and that doesn't really accomplish the goal it's got to be anointed by the spirit of god lord it's got to be able to come to life so i pray that you'll grant that today we have some visitors here lord and others streaming and i just appreciate all the the saints of god lord who have come out today to hear from you we commit ourselves into your hands for service much on my heart limited time to say it so would you just take over and say the portions that you want said father we and the way you want it said we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you as you're seated and if you'll find your place in genesis 28 now how i'm going to get ephesians 3 and genesis 28 connected i know not but it's the it's what i have on my heart all right and we're going to begin at verse 10. genesis 28 and 10. and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran and he and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder was set up on earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places wither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of and jacob awakened out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place that in nuna this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it and he called the name of that place bethel because the name of that city was called luz at the first and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in the way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that i come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be god's house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee now we realize here that that jacob this is quite a scene and i i hope you can get your mind around what our brother was seeing here i mean he's just in a wilderness area he's at a location where he thinks he knows where he's at there's a city named luz and and he's gonna bed down for the night and suddenly he has a dream and he realizes in this dream that he literally made his bed at the gate at the gate of heaven and he sees the world he's standing on but now he sees another world above him and he sees a ladder that's connecting two worlds and angels ascending and descending on this ladder and he sees the lord standing at the top of the ladder looking down on his life and begins to speak to him and the lord begins to covenant with jacob that here's what i'm going to do for you jacob and here's my covenant with you and your seed and then jacob will will return that that pledge god is pledging to jacob jacob is pledging to god if this is what your choice for me and you'll do everything that you've said then i'm here to tell you that i will you'll be my god and i'll i'll follow that now uh you know so so when we talk about you know worlds be between a world between worlds i want you to think for just a moment now and let me just try to capture your mind to where my mind is now we we know according to the book of ephesians uh particularly chapter one and i'm not going to turn to a lot of this today because it would just slow me down and i'm not trying to teach this per se we're just trying to preach something inspirational to you as the lord laid it on my heart but we know as bible readers excuse me if you read in ephesians 1 and especially when you come to ephesians 1 and 4 and 1 and 9 you can go over into the book of romans and find you you're going to find out romans chapter 8 you're going to find out in your reading that god has a great purpose for your life and that actually you're going to find out that all of the family of god started in god before the foundation of the world and so we can see by the bible that before there was ever stardust that i had an existence previous to the one i have now now we're not here to teach on that we we're we're not here to break all that down and we certainly don't believe some of the you know um over the over the edge doctrine that that some different sex and things taken different movements have taken we're just simply here to to just say it like a prophet said it you existed now you were in his mind but say oh well okay then i was just if i was just in his mind that was just a figment of his thought well not exactly it's a little more than that because now if you were just in my thoughts that's all you'd be you would just have been a figment of my thought there would have been no sense of reality to you but we find that god's thoughts are different because he's god and his thoughts actually are a form of reality that all that that are real god's thoughts are real they don't have to be expressed become real the expression is just that it's a further expression but whatever come out of god's mind whatever was in god's mind before it was expressed is just as real when it was in his mind as when after it's expressed only now it's further uh accomplishment of what god had in his mind when you were in his mind that god saw himself not merely creating a family but in the beginning when when god said let there be and he created man we realize that god is not and i don't have time to get into all this teaching on genesis today but it's very provable in the word that god was not simply creating a family god was more perfectly more properly for you to understand it you understand the godhead better if you look at it like this god more than he was creating a family it's it's it's better to understand it god was becoming a family through expression see and so so this is exactly why that you see you know in the book of revelation you come from genesis you come all the way to the book of revelation and you see a bride who's standing with him in the book of revelation and you find that that she was actually an expression of him she's a continuation of his life life of his life amen and so so we realized then that that when in our age that the seventh seal was opened and it unveiled the mighty god it also unveiled the bride when it unsealed him it unsealed her and you and you've come to find out that you are now christ jesus being the beginning of a new creation that you are now the continuation of that same creation that's elementary to us in the scriptures and so i'm not i'm not just trying to get cabbage down on that today i just want to make this point clear and you can see that if you if you read in in in in the book of revelation chapter 11 and you know you you can even find where if you go into chapter 12 you read about how that when the bride goes up and satan is cast down and he incarnates the false prophet and becomes the beast you realize that a declaration is uttered in heaven a voice cries out and says now now that satan has been ejected physically from heaven he's been there to accuse the brother now granted his accusations don't hold weight in heaven but he still tries to do it his his his accusations are dismissed because you're in christ and it wouldn't it doesn't matter that he has dna evidence of your transgressions and he has video replay in high definition it doesn't matter it's not admissible in evidence because the blood of the lord jesus is perpetually atoning it's just perpetually atoning and satan can't can't get it to stop for a nanosecond to get his charge in because as he tries to bring his charge the blood just says they're innocent they're innocent they're innocent now it's not saying that it's not just saying oh you never did it what it's saying is that you have died in christ and resurrected and therefore since jesus was innocent you are innocent i tell you something friends there's privilege to being a christian there's privilege to be having all the fullness of god in you there's privilege to saying amen to every word it entitles you to quite a bit but we find that when satan is literally cast out the bride goes up he can't occupy there you see that in the book of esther you know haman was all the time plotting against mordecai and the jews built gallows for him but we find that before haman died on his own gallows that esther exposed him to the king and and haman was ejected from the palace forever before he died and that's what happens to satan in the in the tribulation period he he's given a sword to conquer him to kill but we find out in the fourth seal he gets killed by that sword because what is it it's the word that he's been mishandling and misappropriating and blinding people to the truth of god's word but god in the last day would restore the truth and the bride would handle that sword and put him down [Music] and that's what you're doing when you're when you're holding the token over your children that's what you're doing when you're believing god for healing that's what you're doing when you're saying i'm free and i'm delivered you you are literally the hand attached to the arm which is christ holding a sword and the enemy is slain by the bride amen see she's holding the sword that cuts in two two ways and it's it's the law and its grace and but you find out that in the tribulation see right now there's still mercy right now it still divides us under soul and spirit for salvation and redemption we find out that when that sword when the bride is gone and the sword is in the hand of moses and elijah then it's not then when they it had always been a sword proceeding out of the mouth but now in the judgments of the tribulation it's fire because it's only judgment it's not there to redeem gentiles anymore the gospel has gone to the jews and so it's only fire of judgment and so when the gentiles try to come against moses and elijah fire proceedeth out of their mouth no they're not fire-breathing dragons symbolic that the fact that their power over nature is going to bring judgment on the world i don't want to be here during that time right now the sword has the power to judge you say oh i don't want to be judged don't fear god's judgment it's to cut you free from the enemy and give you eternal life see so we find that the bible testifies how that when satan is cast down the bride goes up satan is cast down then it says the voice says this is now the kingdom of our god and of his christ because now the enemy has been removed from heaven and now jesus is in is the only voice now speaking and when you get to heaven you're going to want him to be the only voice speaking but when you find later that's at the beginning of the tribulation because the bride has just went home when you find at the end of the tribulation it now has evolved it's not just limited to the kingdoms of god the father and christ but now it goes forward to the kingdoms of our lord which is jesus and his christ which is his body which is his bride and i'm here to tell you your whole life is nothing but a continuation it's a continual continuing of god bringing you back to the image that he saw of you before the foundation of the world amen and scriptures replete with the evidence of that the book of revelation that just just between revelation 12 and what it declares and what it declares in revelation 11 because remember you don't read the book of revelation linear like linear history like a newspaper because the events of of revelation 11 15 happen after revelation 12 3. say why revelation 12 3 why is it later because revelation 12 3 is the beginning of the tribulation revelation 11 15 is at the end of the tribulation amen see so so so so we we we see you you know you don't exactly read it like a newspaper but it's testifying that i didn't start here and i'm not finishing here it's testifying that i didn't choose him he chose me amen it's testifying that it's not it's not you know me you know some credit comes to me because i had enough sense to accept christ no it's god's grace and god's mercy that called to me and there was something down inside of me like a deep calling to a deep and said that's a voice that's familiar somehow the world's voice doesn't mean anything to me anymore i hear the voice of another being and i want to go in that direction today that's what the holy ghost is given for see and so we realized then that that you have a you that existed in god and in that version in that world you were perfect you had never fallen you had never sinned amen you with me i'm going slow so i don't lose you in the shuffle we had an existence in god in that world now that's definitely not this world see but in that world we were perfect we had never fallen but but when we look in the book of revelation and you go to various chapters especially over into chapter 14 you you'll find well not just chapter 14 chapter 11 chapter 14. you're going to find this particularly in chapter 11 that that the bride that was taken into heaven and the 144 thousand taken into heaven in chapter 14 that they are there's a there's a name that describes them they're redeemed amen amen they're under redemption so now i want you to see this picture and you're going to get my title so there was a world before where you were not redeemed you had never fallen you were perfect and when we come to the end you're going to be in a world that's future where you're redeemed well the only way how did i get from perfect to redeemed the only way is a world between those two worlds that you're in now so that you could be born in sin so that you could be conceived in iniquity so that god could redeem you out of this world out of this sin so that when you stand in that future world you you have the song of the lamb you sing the song of redemption you're redeemed the angels can't sing it but you can sing it so i'm here to tell you something friends that this world that you're living in this is exactly why brother branham would refer to this world as just a whistle stop and the problem becomes that we commit so much of our lives and so much of our energy and so much of our drive so much of our dreams set all of our goals want all of our objectives and it's all in this transient world between worlds what are you chasing you're just a transient that's all you are you're just a homeless person yeah no no disregard people who are generally on the street but you're a homeless person spiritually say i've got a home no you don't if you do if if you believe this home is your home then i feel sorry for you i'm here to tell you this world is not my home i'm just a passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue the angels beckoned me from heaven's open door and i can't feel at home in this world anymore brother branham talks about god's single goal and he's going to talk about talk about it in two ways he mentions how that the entire bible this is from christ is the mystery of god revealed the entire bible he says god has showed or revealed in every type that's in the bible he has shown and revealed christ and so he concludes therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ hence his title christ is the mystery of god revealed so he says the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible so then then that portends that as he says every life that you read every story including jacob every every story you read is all just god getting to that one goal and he's going about it over time and he's putting his family out of his mind into the earth to redeem them back and bring them back to himself as redeemed that's what life is about that's what this world is about it's just when you realize that this world listen to me teenagers when you realize that this world is just a training that it's just a proving ground and then you wonder you wonder why i would say to you good grief don't chase this world let just just acquiesce to god's will for your life and say lord whatever you have for me in this life i i accept it i'm not trying to get away from your will i i don't want to go beyond your will i want to go all with your will i want everything that you have for me but i i guess what i'm trying to say lord is just take me out of the equation and that's the real desire of my heart i hope it's your heart and it's what paul said in his in that was paul's desire that god fill you with all of his knowledge that he's trying to bring you into an image he's trying to get you back to something that you used to be only now you're going to be more valuable because you've been redeemed from sin amen now that blows fuses because that's suggesting that i'm more valuable having fallen i'm more valuable to god having fallen and now redeemed than i would have been had i never fallen in the first place you say can you make that case i can because if your first cr if your first perfect creation in god was all god was achieving he had a list left you right there the very fact that he didn't leave it there and actually committed you to a wrong birth and you come the wrong way so that god knowing you before the foundation of the world could could stalk you your whole life and follow you you say i wish this hadn't happened god knew it would happen i wished i hadn't done this god knew you'd do that i wished i hadn't got to hear god knew you'd be right there i'm here to tell you he's never lost sight or control of you and today we stand redeemed and listen friend if he had control of me before that i was born again by the spirit how much more control does he have now that i am born again of the spirit of god amen so he's got this one goal and and his his entire goal has been expression it's one goal one plan one goal one purpose that he wanted to achieve and that was the expression of himself in a many-membered body see this is why as you've heard me say so many times this is failure to see that is exactly why the trinitarians see him as three persons incorrectly and this is also why the one to see him as jesus only one like your finger incorrectly jesus wasn't his own daddy see and and he was a complete human so what what the trinitarians their error is their formula chops him into three separate individual persons and then they tie it all night nice and neat and say well it's all one purpose one mind and they all act in the same way it's still three persons and that's polytheism that's ancient babylonianism traceable through history see noah didn't believe that but but samara must believe that after him after shem died then the ancient babylonian custom of multiple gods come in see and you can trace that through history and but the problem with the oneness is they they only see him they don't see his body they don't see his bride and that's what the opening of the word in our day revealed it revealed that that that christ is the mystery of god revealed and the bride is the mystery of christ revealed and this is why brother branham would say with such authority she is him that you are the blood of god by the spirit you're the final voice to the final age now he's not suggesting you're literally him because you didn't save me you can't redeem me i don't pray to you i'm not even to trust in the arm of flesh yours are mine but hebrews say well then how is she him hebrews 13 8 shows us that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i'm not literally him i'm the same as him i'm a continuation of that same expression that christ was he was the perfect sacrifice the perfect lamb i couldn't save myself i couldn't get myself out of it i was i was headed uh legally to a devil's hell and no way to stop it see but one came and took my place see and that's the beauty of the cross that he not only was a worthy sacrifice to appease god's judgment but as i've said to you before he wasn't just the atonement he was our total satisfaction because he was the atoning lamb the atoning life because it was god's life but he was also lived the perceptive side of the word so that he never broke it he kept every precept upon precept and now i get credit for his life and my life and my failures are not counted against me there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ i am unassailable i'm unchargeable i'm unarrestable and i'm unindictable hallelujah i'm above the law where are you i'm in christ say well then you can live any way you want yes thank god i can and i do and the way that i want to live is according to this book i could have never done that on my own the human mind was enmity against god and would never never acquiesce to god's word but oh something came in my heart and it changed my whole life and my whole nature and all my goals and dreams change [Applause] it's astonishing the world today parents raise children and they they just start trying to it's just parental delinquency they don't really want to do the harder work and they say well i'm just let the child start making their own decisions and you get children five and six years old boys deciding they don't want to be girls oh and the parent says okay cool we'll just get you a surgery i know you're only six but you obviously know what you want to do with your life and then the whole world goes oh you're such a good parent you're not even a parent and i you know i just say what what world do you live in where's your mind what would ever make you think that a child born with a sin nature is going to automatically choose the right way when the bible says his little mind or her little mind is enmity against god from the day they're born can never agree with god why would you think just letting them go their own way because you want to be the 21st century parent and you're going to let them go their own way and you're not going to make the decisions for them because you want to be i want to be a modern parent how would you think in what world would you imagine they're ever going to go the right way it's impossible say well i can't save them you can't but what god does god only god can change their nature but what god charges moms and dads with is raise them in the way they should go raise them in that path that that leads them to so they at least have a fighting chance so that when god gets a hold of their life they're already familiar with his word see and so it's parental delinquency otherwise it's not it's not child delinquency yeah that's right and so stop preaching at me man i agree amen amen that's a good what you just said was excellent i'm not going to tell you who that is amen somebody real close to me but but but well see you're only going to get one of seven you got a 107 shot at getting who it was and i'm not going to tell you who it was but i appreciate is that he's listening and so so so we find that that god is now transitioning you from one world to the next and that's what this life is about so so you know sometimes you know we brother branham makes this statement let me let me get this this last statement here now that was in 1963 talks about the bible's an expression of one goal that god had one purpose you want to achieve in the entire bible that's his expression in a family and then several years prior to that in the queen of sheba 59 he says now it's going to take it takes more than the power of gifts it takes more than joining church it takes the birth of the holy spirit to break down our walls and to unite us together as one great christian body moving for one objective and one goal now we're going to notice in these two quotes that that that the goal of the word is the goal of the word is not and has never been the goal of the word to make you ecumenical amen you say oh yeah see brother branham he's just saying it's going to take the holy ghost and then all the churches can get along all the denominations can come in and we can all be one well that's the exact formula and model that the world council of churches uses and that in the book of revelation is the image directed to the beast with the authority of the nation of revelation 13 which is the united it's all st by the power of the beast's system and this is why you've heard me say that that the greatest existential threat to humanity is not north korea or china or russia the greatest existential threat to the to the to an extinction we're not talking about an extinction event see the the greatest threat that you that faces the world today is denominationalism yes amen you see because that's contrary to god's word god never created that that's a man-made thing and god has god's message has always been come out of that my people and be not a partaker of that because i'm going to destroy that he says that in the bible he's going to destroy it and so he says to his family get out of that when i say i'm trying to make you one i'm not trying to make you that kind of one i'm trying to make you one and the same with this see and so so we realized then that that when you look at these two quotes the goal of the word has always had more in mind than just making us ecumenical see what god what god's goal is is not limited to just human cooperation it's always been about coming into his vision of his expression in the form of being his eternal family now it's a mouthful i'm going to say it again so it's god's goal is not limited to human cooperation it's not to make us ecumenical it's always been about here's what's your life in this world between worlds amen now i've explained that to you thoroughly i've proved it in the bible you can see yourself there and there but what about here see and so we realize that this world between those worlds god's goal has always been about bringing his family into his vision of of his expression in the form of being his eternal family now sometimes that you can't believe how that will help you because sometimes we wondered his dealings with our life we wonder down across years many years sometimes decades and we question why did this have to happen why couldn't my why couldn't it just if it just went like that then i wouldn't be in this position if if this could have happened and what if and what if and what if and why did and why didn't why did and whose fault is it it's got to be fault right so sometimes we wander at his dealings with our life down across our years and it can very often very often from a human perspective seem to make no sense to us and leave us wondering but he's never you just understand he's never been trying to make us better human beings that's not the goal he's he he's been honing us into his vision of us that's what's up that's what's been going on he's been he's not trying to reform us and make us better humans he's been honing us into a vision into his vision of of us and he's often times needed to move you into positions so that he can better mold you into into the image and order that he had of you before the foundation of the world because whatever you were here you're returning to here only redeemed which makes you more valuable which gives him reason and purpose of being that that that in order for god you know there's no way to attribute sovereignty to him you have to realize that it was necessary in the sovereignty of god it was necessary for god to create a man who would need salvation in order to give himself a reason and a purpose for being to commit that man into the world into this world between worlds and then save him out of it bring him through sin birth bring him through a new birth bring him and then grow him and bring him into that image so that the final image before you're taken in a rapture looks almost identical to him save your fallen body alone and even that is going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye so that you get even a body liken unto his glorious body so it's a beautiful plan so you realize that this world we live in presently is a world between worlds so we we find then that that then then of course that you know brings us and i'm skipping a great deal of stuff because i don't want to get locked up here this is this brings us to the life of jacob see now i want to i probably should have put it on the overhead but i i just didn't want to get slowed down and so i'm just going to read it to you it's only it's not very long it's a statement from charles spurgeon um from from yesteryear i want you to listen close very inspirational was the was the inspiration behind this whole this whole sermon so he says in our christian pilgrimage it is well for the most part to be looking forward forward lies the crown and onward is the goal say why is that important because people get trapped looking behind looking over looking at spilled milk looking at what if looking at who did me wrong looking at why did this happen to me see and so it's always better to be looking forward because if you look at your past you're only going to see failures and you're never going to have the faith to believe that you can ever overcome it so you're going to want to look forward and say what am i looking forward to to the promise that you're headed to perfection and say i don't i i don't feel like i'm getting very close don't you worry the lord knows how to get you back to where he needs you to be see so he says forward lies the crown and onward is the goal whether it be for hope for joy for consolation or for the inspiring of our love the future must after all be the grand object of the eye of faith it is for me i'm going to tell you something friends i i look to my future and you hear me say all the time our future is bright that will give you more strength in times of sorrow and times of trial if you just realize i don't have to stay here forever i've got an escape i've got an exodus and once i get there i don't ever have to come back and do this again hallelujah oh i want to tell you something friends that's the time and that that god is bringing you to that state where he can translate your body into a glorified body and if and if and if and if the time comes for your body to die and the rapture hasn't come yet don't you worry because the same one that can translate the living will first raise the dead and i promise you when that happens you'll never die again hallelujah oh my and he says looking into the future look at this here's here's here here your future's bright friends let me give you some encouragement today looking into the future we can see sin cast out the body of sin and death destroyed let me say hallelujah to that the soul made perfect and fit to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light looking further yet the believer's enlightened eye can see death's river past the gloomy stream forted and the hills of light attained on which standeth the celestial city he seeth himself this is you this is how you look forward he seeth himself inner within the pearly gates hailed as more than a conqueror crowned by the hand of christ embraced in the arms of jesus glorified with him and made to sit together with him on his throne even as he overcame and has set down with the father on his throne i couldn't give you a better future than that amen and you know today while you're thinking about the purpose of your life in this world just remember this world has no eternal value and so that's why i say to people all the time and we say particularly to young people but not just to young people there because i've seen some uh adults who are quite seasoned and should have been way further in their maturity still as immature as a teenager and still chasing the american dream still chasing the dream of the world still there's nothing wrong with excellence there's nothing wrong with pursuing excellence and being all you can be and there's nothing wrong with that i i'm not hindering i'm not saying that's a wrong thing at all i'm just simply here to say see it for what it is that everything that that that science education civilization that we see today in this world according to this book you don't want to believe it but according to this book is all of the devil we're going to have education we're going to have civilization we're going to have than the laws of natural science but it's going to work in a new world and it's going to be so far above and beyond what this transient world has it's not even be compared to and my my constant sermon is young people don't invest your life here invest your life there seek that which is above see and so because that's the only treasure worth chasing see jesus said not to lay up treasures for here because you're going to lose it anyway and and but lay up treasures where no rust thief moth corrosion can ever get to it spurgeon concludes his thought here i love this now he says the thought of this future may well relieve the darkness of the past and the gloom of the present the joys of heaven will surely compensate for the sorrows of earth i think about this brother now he's been enjoying it for 150 years oh my let me read that again the joys of heaven will surely compensate for the sorrows of earth hush my fears this world is but a narrow span i love that and thou shalt soon have passed it hush-hush my doubts death is but a narrow stream and thou shalt soon have forted it time how short eternity how long death how brief immortality how endless me thinks i even now eat a vesicles clusters that's the grapes they went when they the spies went me thinks even now i eat a vascular clusters and and sip of the well which is within the gate the road is so so short i shall soon be there you know we very often use the term and i'm my time starting to get away from me so i'm going to try to come come to a conclusion we very often use the term life and we use it very loosely really to describe many things you know this is my life you hear people say it's my life you know that's your life you know that's their life you know you need to live and let live but rarely does a person especially a young person grasp the true reality that it's really his life went to you for a purpose so to say oh it's my life oh that's your life oh that's their life live and let live no no that's all wrong that's what the devil wants you to see it as but really the bible informs us no the only one that can give life is god and therefore it's his life on loan to you to live out a purpose in your life that brings him glory that's the only value that this life has if you're not living for christ you're wasting your life see because it's going to end the life of christ is the only life that's eternal and so you know a lot of times this is why we we gather young people we've got a young people's weekend coming up uh very soon we've had youth camps we're gonna do more of them our desire is to impart a wisdom of years to you you know that we've learned through observation because that's really what science is it's observation it's not that they don't subscribe to theory and it's not that they you know um but but but science i mean there's theories and there's all kinds of things but and it's not that they don't subscribe to logic they do but to create scientific law the only way they create scientific law is by observation and it has to be repeatable in a controlled environment you see that's that's science all right it's at its core and so at least man's understanding of it science actually is something of god god created science not not the other way around but but we realized then that that that the whole you know our our our life absorbs of observation through many trials and through many errors you know living life and learning from it because that that's my value as a minister of the gospel speaking to young people particularly that i i hope that you will allow me to impart to you my observations that i have seen and proven and they're repeatable and i've seen them repeat in my life and other people's lives that i've counseled and many times people can sit in my office and say i'm looking at this situation and i'm considering going in this direction and i can tell them their future and i'm not a prophet amen and i don't need to be but because of my observations of the word i know that if you input this and then put that you'll output this and if you keep going in that direction here's the sure here's what's going to happen to you and it's not going to be pretty you're going to be just like brother diggs was speaking to the teenagers uh the senior youth group uh the other other night i think friday night sister debbie and i got to listen to it coming down the road never heard it put so poignantly my goodness he just pulled no punches and brother diggs has a way of just saying and you can't get offended because he's just saying it from a pure heart he's lived it he's observed it see he come off the streets he knows what he's talking about he's saying to young people don't don't chase things outside of god's will because anything outside of the line in order of god's word will fail it must fail it has to fail because that's not eternal the only things that don't fail are things that are eternal see and so so we find then that you know that it now it's true you you have to live your life and you have to make your own choices you can't get in on my choices you do have to accept the plan of god and come to know him by the power of the holy ghost yourself and and i as a pastor or or any minister or parents or mentors all we can do is try to guide you uh to to god's sure life that you can have and live that paul described in our text to be filled to to have a life of purpose that that god has purposed into you now brother branham talks many times about time blending with eternity i'm not going to take the time to read them all he goes from 63 through 64 and several different places where time you know will cease and eternity will blend right in and so i'm here to tell you know that that that the one who gave you life is the only one who can blend this life with an eternal life you're not capable of doing it only god can do it so i say to you let him don't resist that just set your sails you know we find out that that jacob when he comes few mortals few mortals were ever given such an opportunity at such a young age to view the true multiverse as jacob did multi-worlds multiverse as they call it today it's a it's a catch phrase the multiverse and they you know they i looked up some stuff and they yeah they they underst what they're missing is that it's all just dimensions see it's just dimensions that's what jacob was seeing jacob was seeing beca you say oh god is somewhere beyond alpha centauri the bible says he be not far from us from you all right see so so you realize when abraham built an altar trying to find the king of salem trying to find his city because he met the king he knew it was somewhere and he builds an altar and right where abraham built his altar the city he was looking for was just above him see and jacob now catching his eyes are open in a dream to this multi-world this multi-world reality that that there's a heaven above and there's a hell beneath there's a god who rules there and there's an enemy who rules there and the the promise of this age it was that and it's not a good one the promise to the last age is that the lid would be torn off of hell and demon powers would come to the surface and now you have satan who's the god of this evil age and it's now satan's eden and it's no place to be without the holy ghost i'm here to tell you every decision you make is going to be wrong it's going to end up a train wreck and that's why you need to have a experience with the holy ghost otherwise you're going to choose the wrong path you can't not choose it it's there's too many wrong paths and there's only one right path and that's the and the only way to see that path is god rich in mercy to show you the path and he doesn't ever have to do that at one time is all god ever has to call a man he's if god calls a man one time and the man refuses it at any level doesn't even matter what it is even something as simple as seeing god in nature might not be the seventh seal it might just be god showed you himself in nature and you decided to believe darwin and god at that point can just say okay fine you're done i'll see if the don't worry you'll get a fair trial but when you come before my throne i'm going to play this moment back to you and what that literally means is that everything from this moment in your life no matter what you do and achieve at all it's going to equal zero no matter what you accomplish put put plaques on your wall that have put more letters behind your name than are in your name and it's all going to equal 0. it's all going to equal 0. put put 12 digits in your bank account it's all going to the antichrist and it's all going to equal nothing the only thing worth anything is eternity and the only form of eternal life is god's life see amen so few mortals had ever been given such an opportunity well i gotta hurry give me 15 minutes and we'll stop few mortals were ever given such an opportunity he saw heaven above and the earth he lived on just beneath it with only a ladder between them angels ascending and descending climbing up and down this ladder and he sees christ the king the creator of all the worlds see he's aware this is the creator i'm i'm standing on the world and there's another world and there's beings from that world who don't live here and they're going up and down there's a connection between that world and this world that let jacob know that this life isn't aimless this life has a purpose that i came from a world i'm headed to a world and now i'm in this world to do what to get me back to that former world in a redeemed condition and christ now standing the god of all the world standing at the top looking down on his life and he he had that absolute reality that i hope that you can have today that he was living in a multi-world reality suddenly that was more clear to jacob than few before or after him had ever or would ever realize a world between worlds is this life it's a very as spurgeon called it a very narrow span of mortal existence between eternal realms of a previous existence and and the realities of god's mind unfolded into an expression of his life on the other side coming back redeemed and being an expression of christ for the eternal ages to come you believe that so when we when we look at this reality when you when you get it say brother jason what's the real value of your sermon today i want you to grasp what life really is i want you to get an understanding to to bring you to snap you to attention and go wow i i i'm just in a little transient world and your even your life that you're promised on this transient world not as it's it's not as if it's not bad enough that you're homeless in a transient but you're promised that it's actually very short and it's full of trouble so excuse me if i don't like living here you excuse me if i want to go there you excuse me if i preach to everybody to say you don't want to live here trust me trust me you don't want to chase this life it has no value let me tell you about a world that has value that's the purpose of my life that's what brings the fullness of joy in your life that's what gives rhyming reason to the to the questions of your past and how you were born and what happened to you as a child and what happened you at another church and what happened to you in life and who cheated you and who robbed you and how you got hurt no you're sick and all this kind i'm here to tell you it's all transient we're headed to another place it's all just training it's all grooming it's all honing and molding you for a much grander purpose you come through a fallen birth to be redeemed back to god oh so much i would like to say i'll make this final point we'll stop if i need to get to more of it i will later when when when brother branham drew your life and he drew it as a circle it had a you know it started on this day and your birthday and people say i remember brother uh stepanenko the uh the old man uh pavel's dad i can't remember his name now and we were talking one day and he was preaching to me across the table and we were talking about the spiritual birth and i said you know sometimes people have to try to tie their experience to a certain date or certain feeling or i got dizzy or got lightheaded this happened to me and i can tie it back to that date well fine grand i'll give pen a pen a ribbon on you for that but many times we don't exactly can't pin our exactly our new birth all we know is i used to be that person and now i'm not anymore i somehow i'm different somehow my whole purposes have changed say when did it happen i don't know exactly but i know it did and and brother nikolai that's what his name was and he says you know you don't remember your spiritual birth he says you don't remember your natural birth and i said no i do august 4th 1963 he goes but you don't remember it and i caught it i went you're right i don't remember nobody remembers their birthday i know you you remember what somebody told you your birthday was and you've celebrated every year the calendar comes around and you celebrate it but you don't remember your birthday say friends you don't you don't remember that you started in god but you had that's that's why you agree with the word today because this is just god in another form and the whole purpose of the gospel is to is to is to make you into this image as i as i've said to you before this is the third iteration of a bible the first iteration was in the stars the second was in the enoch's pyramid and nobody understood enoch they don't they still don't understand his pyramid there's lots of people who tried to copy it they didn't even have enough sense to not put a cap on it because it was going to represent a rejected christ only enoch had that revelation they don't understand this bible but i'm here to tell you god in the rapture is not coming to rapture a bible this is coming to behind skin he's coming to rapture the word made flesh in a living people hallelujah and that's why we have the word and he draws a circle and he comes down to a little point of it and he now the circle represents eternity say i think i just tried to express that it's talking about your birthday it's not the circle was in the circle was eternity but in the circle of eternity he draws a little loop and he comes out of this circle of eternity loops it down and brings it back up and joins into the circle again and he says his wife looked at him and said it's got a little hickey on it bill that's a that's an old southern word it it literally you know it's it's like uh it's almost like uh you know uh i didn't want to go into i've got plenty of the definitions here but but it's but we have these words that you know my i had a friend used to i say i said what in the world is that he would go oh that's a duma flitzy for a thingamabob and that's synonymous with the word hickey see and so so we find that that it represents your life it's just this little loop of time that you drop down out of the circle of eternity to do one thing to be born in sin go through your life bottom out and then god saves you and now you start going back up again and from the front you say where's the bottom of of my little of my little loop at the moment god redeemed your life and you were born again in the spirit of god and then from that day you've been going back up in to be rejoined to the circle of eternity that little thing is what this world is that's what coming to church is about that's why you believe what you believe and it was beautiful to me to behold that when this life is over that little hickey is gone and the only thing left is the unbroken circle of eternity now you say well that's neat but no it's more than just neat that means that that however i was here whatever happens here by the time i get back here nothing down here altered what i was there and it didn't matter how many failures i had and it didn't matter how weak i was and it didn't matter how many times i made the wrong decision god is bringing this vision back to this vision and it's redeemed and i'm here to tell you this life cannot stop me cannot trap me there's not enough demons in all of hell to keep me from coming back up into that circle oh friends hush my fears this life is but a narrow span hush hush oh don't worry about about what has happened to you don't worry there's a new world coming god has a great purpose for our lives and i just say lord help me to keep that perspective so that i don't chase this world and so that i don't also don't sweat this world that i'm just here to to try to come back and live out the word of god i don't always get it right i've got a body that's fallen you know but i'm going to tell you something friends you don't you don't realize what uh what an ability that you have that paul was speaking of in our text you know if you have a computer and i'm quite adept at it have been for years and and and i'm all i'm i'm heavy into security and things like that and i've never suffered a serious breach or hack and and because probably i'm overkill but some there has been times there have been times where my security software would pop up and say you know you know you click the link on an email or you you thought you were going to a a website and it turns out to be fraudulent and you know any any kind of a thing can happen and it says we have detected a trojan we have detected a virus and we cannot delete it but we have quarantined it now you can just go whoo okay oh it's on my computer no it's quarantined it can't hurt the computer it's literally locked away it's chained up it can't get out it will never get out it can't hurt you anymore and the and the only way say well how can i get rid of it there is a way you have to reformat your computer which is not an easy thing to do because it's it's quite involved and you got all your backups and your files you got it you got to try to get it all back to where you had it in the beginning all right now let me tell you what happens how devil here's how devil works you come to church like today you hear a sermon like this you're you're a teenager you're older adult you're single you're married you're i don't know you're male you're female and the word of god falls on your heart and you say lord i thank you for the sermon i am going to make some changes in my life and i'm not going to go the way of the world anymore and i'm going to believe your word and very often times you see god can save your soul which he does and your soul then is already sitting together in heavenly places with christ jesus right but your flesh is still not saved and flesh is still not redeemed your flesh and your spirit all 10 of those inlets and outlets whether it's your smell or your taste or your hearing or your sight or your touch whether it's your memory your reason your conscience your affection your imaginations all that stuff is still in a falling condition what you've done in a new birth is you've changed the inner nature of that spirit and now you've got another voice calling for holiness and righteousness but you've still got a sinful flesh so that's why you still can't feed on the things of the world that's why christian doesn't do that because when you feed on the things of the world then that that inner man that's christ he is in such a weakened state and you find yourself on all kinds of sin and mistakes say what is wrong with me i know i love the lord i know i believe his word and you're not kidding you really do you really are you've actually had an experience with god and and your love for his word is real and it's and god did it for you you say well then why do i constantly have these ups and downs because what you feed on see you're feeding you're feeding one side of your fallen nature versus a side that's redeemed and that's why we read our bibles that's why we hear sermons that's why we gather together that's why we have a prayer closet to do what strengthen the inner man that was paul's desire that the inner man be strengthened so that god can let your body realize glories and service to his majesty you follow that so a lot of times you come in here and you make a big declaration i'm going to make some changes you know what the devil does you know what the devil does who's still trapped in your flesh he just retreats into his castle he pulls up the drawbridge and he just waits you out he knows you you'll be back on netflix he knows he can get you back on snapchat again he knows he'll just wait you out he's going to sit there in his castle you'd like to get him gone but you can't not until you get reformatted amen until you get a body change you see i'm saying but what you can do is when he retreats into his castle you can quarantine that dude in there and you can take the book of revelation talks about satan was bound with a chain it wasn't a metal chain it was a chain of circumstance that he could have no one to work through i'm here to tell you something friends you're here today to say i'm going to make changes well here's one change you need to make why don't you say lord he ran into his castle he raised his drawbridge i can't get rid of him until a body changed so how about you chain that castle up and trap him in his own place and he'll never have influence on my life again from this day from this hour i'm going to live for god i'm going to let the word surge through my mind and direct my purposes and i'll tell you something friends you have the ability today to put the same chain on him that an angel puts on him in the book of revelation chain him up quarantine him away don't give him access to your life that is what the word can do for you let's stand god bless you i i got finished enough i'm not done there's more i want to say but oh my so much you were singing anthony um i think you were singing if you weren't i can hear it in my head because he lives i can face tomorrow i want to sing another bar of that thinking about this sermon i so appreciated the lyrics to the song um that uh sister amber surprised me with i just thought wow what what what words to that lyric because it it's so it was so conducive to my burden on my heart today i want you to bow your heads just before we sing that and i i hope that i've opened your understanding that that that i've been able to as paul can say that the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened to know to know to know god's purpose in your life to to realize god's attempts to bring you to something more than you've ever been or could ever be i hope and i trust and i am feel sure the word has spoken to you today why your heads are bowed now all over the building we're going to sing this song but i want to offer a prayer for you first now if you would like you don't have to maybe the word didn't mean a whole lot to you today but if it did and you would like for brother jason to pray for you in my prayer wait raise your hand and i'll pray for you right now wow that's a lot of hands that's a lot of hands that's young people and old married and single male and female alike lord jesus we love you today lord and as i come to the end of this service i i don't necessarily feel that i i finished saying everything that you wanted said but i did my best lord and the time has expired and at this point lord it would be wearying so i i'm just going to stop and commit it to you i pray that's okay with you because lord now i i just feel a greater pull in my heart to now just turn it over to the holy spirit and let him begin to deal with hearts i've said i believe in my heart today i've said all that needed to be said for that i can say that for sure i believe i have said in my heart i've said all that needed to be said there's much more to say but i believe i
