the house of god today amen happy to have brother jd's family here with us this morning and um i want you just to everyone just to feel right at home and make yourself at home because you're among family and among friends praise the lord i'm happy to be a part of the family of god amen think about what that means to be a part of the family of god amen i like i like my family quite a bit but i like actually that family even better and when i when i realized that my family's part of that family i'm just like it can't get gooder than that amen praise the lord well we're happy in the lord we want to just give you a quick prayer request i did hear it mentioned but i just wanted to kind of give a little bit of an updated version um one request is for uh sister brenda that she found out a family member near her that if that a family member who was near her and around her indoors for several days who was very sick actually tested positive for covid she's asking us to pray that the lord shields her from getting ill now she did get a covet test and she sent me a text this morning saying it was negative so we just want to pray that that will stay because we realize the lord takes care but who wants to be sick amen not me and so also she asks a very sincere prayer for her mom who's really struggling with anxiety and fear over the loss of her husband she said her mom just not in a good place so we remember sister brenda and her mother this morning amen i got a a wonderful report from brother jack this morning he said praise god my precious brother in christ me and sister kathy just got up every thing has turned for the good for sister kathy y'all just keep mentioning her name she said um uh she still felt a little tingling he says tinkling in her feet i told her it's all going out her feet because the enemy is under her feet he said and under her feet uh her feet in victory she is eating better and nausea has left her praise our lord and i am pampering her very good uh he says i know he says uh just please servant of god please you know he wants continued prayer so that's with all love from brother jack and sister kathy and i wrote him back and i said thanks for sharing that brother jack god bless you for your love and tender care of your queen amen the lord will look upon this with great favor for it is like christ amen told him we were rejoicing with him sister kathy wanted us to know that the lord willing she says we will both be back at our post of duty next sunday hallelujah amen listen friends they they packed that sister on a helicopter for a life flight for emergency surgery you know and uh 48 hours later the doctor's testimony to brother jack was sir we can't find anything wrong with her hallelujah so the lord i tell you prayer doesn't just change things it changes everything so we're happy uh for the lord's great provision for us and god still moves doesn't he amen so i wanted just to give you those updates uh in prayer for prayer this morning we will take that to the lord as we get ready to go to prayer i want to invite you into the scripture this morning and we're going to turn to saint john chapter four and i'll just read this text and let you be seated one two verses john st john chapter 4 verse 23 and 24. amen i apologize to those who were trying to stream the sunday school this morning the video looked amazing but we had an audio cross up and it didn't exactly have any sound so hopefully i asked gideon if that be in the archive i hope sound is in the archive amen we're getting a head shake of no amen well it's in the archive of heaven anyway so if you were faithful and loyal enough to be here for sunday school class you got the benefit amen and if you weren't oh well amen praise the lord saint john chapter 4 verse 23 i'm not going to read right in chapter 18. will i saint john chapter 4 and verse 23 and 24 jesus speaking but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth amen let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word today and i i lord confess and ask an extra grace from thee this morning you know the the struggle i've had trying to decipher lord with so much to say knowing i couldn't say it all and trying to find your exact path this morning proved a little difficult but lord i i felt your nearness in the back office and i'm sure that you have ready now you have it you have it ready to go and we're we want to hear it with open hearts today and i pray for your grace upon the speaker and the hearer we commit ourselves humbly to you completely to you we're not deserving actually of any of your grace and mercy but lord if we did deserve it well it wouldn't be grace and mercy so i'm i in that regard lord i'm glad i don't deserve it because now i can be a recipient of your great grace and mercy so i committed to you now in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated i want i would like to by the help of the lord continue from the last time i ministered on finding god's current and i'm not continuing that thought per se but i i want to take a rather natural uh extrapolation from that and so i i want to just read a quote that i read near the very end of that sermon it probably was exactly my last quote made my last one or two comments from from this quote and this will help you to help me to recapture and get your minds set to where we want to go and we want to be in prayer also for a couple of families who are out of town traveling just the lord give them mercy amen brother branham says from um so i want to speak to you today on the power within the spirit and the truth uh if you'll notice that jesus said the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth now watch this next line for the father seeketh such to worship him now you wouldn't say that if you were perfectly happy with the worship you were getting amen so it becomes obvious in what jesus is saying that that god wasn't finished perfecting praise he wasn't he hadn't arrived yet at what his great vision was for his family amen remember how that jesus goes back and picks up under inspiration he picks up the prophet and says in sacrifices and in offerings thou has had no pleasure amen remember that because brother branham said you know mount sinai that was that was the most rational thing the children of israel ever did when they actually had thus saith the lord they had a prophet they had a pillar of fire had a brazen altar brazen serpent they had every provision they could ever need for making it into the promised land like brother branham said everything you have need of for a rapture is in you now in you now praise the lord brother you from brother shawn's praise the lord god bless you we're happy to have you here today visiting us from brother sean martin's assembly amen so brother sean is a awesome friend and so we we find that that when you when you think about it in this light jesus went on to say that it is it is written of me in the scrolls that i come to do thy will o lord and so so jesus is now trying to get them to understand that there is a new day dawning and it's not new as in the sense of nothing like it has ever existed but it is now the next advancement it is now the next step in the goal that god had when he said let there be the first time brother branham shows us in uh christ is the mystery of god revealed that that everything in all the bible and all the lives and everything you read he said god had one goal just one and he said now we're going to take this morning and we're going to find out what that one goal is and when you listen to the sermon you realize that it's all about expression god unfolding his expression because god wasn't he wasn't he wasn't satisfied to be alone with his thoughts in heaven amen he wanted a family but he knew that there's a difference in just speaking something into existence like you know like you create and the bible says he created hell for the devil and his angels right but we know that hell death and hell are cast in the lake of fire so hell's not eternal you understand that's just something he temporarily created for a temporary purpose but he didn't he didn't he didn't create his family that way because like brother branham said if you take a piece of paper and he said and you burn it you'd say well i've annihilated it now he said no you actually can't annihilate anything only god can do that he said well i i burned it so well all you've done is turned it back to its original atoms and gases and molecules it's not it's not paper is a manufactured item from wood and so you've reversed all of the the manufacturing you reversed the the tree growing you reversed the seed in the ground you went all the way back to the elements that actually spoke the seed and grew a tree and was cut down and turned into paper brother branham said if time would go on long enough those elements could be repurposed into paper again sometime see so so god wasn't interested in a bride that would someday maybe pass away and have to start all the way over he was going to express a bride he was going to express a heavens and an earth and that's why the earth is part of his eternal attribute and can't ever be annihilated see so even when peter says i saw new heavens and new earth brother madam shows us clearly in future home doesn't mean it was annihilated can't be annihilated it's an internal attribute you can't be annihilated that's why you can't go to the lake of fire because you'd be annihilated and you can't be annihilated oh my friends and so you know uh there there's two ways to look at god as an all-consuming fire and i don't want that all consuming fire but i do want this all-consuming fire to consume me oh lord consume all my plans motives dreams and objectives me as a person and let me as a phoenix rising from the ashes be recreated in the image of god is that your desire today as a believer i hope it is or i don't know why you're a believer right amen i don't there's a lot more there's many many many thousands more christian nominal movements and countless hundreds of independents who have a much less rigorous uh you know if and and of course if you're born again serving god's not not rigor it's actually a pleasure it's actually natural you're on you unconsciously live that way because you've been you've had a nature change if you haven't if you've only had enough some people only get enough religion to make themselves miserable that's a sad sad situation to be and you don't ever want to be that i can tell you that's not why god sent the message that's not why he made you a believer uh you know but but you don't want to be uh you know brother jd was talking yesterday in the men's breakfast how that you know some people um you know they're they're kind it reminded me as he was describing it it reminded me of paul coming to those to those scholars on mars hill and the bible says you know it shows it looked like they were like all excited about paul's message and oh please come back and preach for us again but actually what was behind it was they just loved hearing something new yeah paul said i i noticed the other day in the market you had a an idol a temple to the unknown god i'd like to tell you his name and they wanted to hear more because it was it was uh exciting it was you know and and and so we find that some people you know love conspiracy love you know intrigue love something that's juicy and wow that's that's new that's intriguing you know you don't hear that airing every day and and and that's and they come to the message because the message identifies the dragon and the beast and the powers and and and shows what's happening in history and everybody's like oh man oh wow wow and they said in message churches 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 years amen and suddenly oh well i'm moving on see because because the message didn't come for that it didn't come to entertain you it came to restore you back to something you've got to always remember that that that that when you when you when you look at why every everything god did since the fall in the garden of eden has been one his final three-phase plan ends up first to reveal himself in christ then to get preeminence in his body the church down through two thousand years of church ages right but then to restore us back to our rightly position that fell by sin in the garden so he's we're being restored back to that fellowship that adam had because adam didn't have to be adam didn't have to be brought into the image of god adam was born in the image of god adam came forth in fact is his first thing was a spirit man and then later he's put him into soil and be god breathes into his breath nostrils the breath of life he becomes a living soul and so adam came from thought and then was word and then was flesh like jesus that's why he's the second adam jesus was came from god as an expression he was the logos the word and then he became flesh now brother branham said you bypassed that middle stage you came right from thought to flesh for to receive your temptations because god's not interested in a kingdom full of robots he rather god would rather have you lost and saved god would rather have you with failures and forgiven that's hard to get your mind around but that gives him reason and purpose for being that's what we're taught that it was necessary that god permit a man to be born in sin then god could come and save him and brother branham says that gave him reason and purpose for being you won't talk about blowing fuses wow that want to blow fuses see so so you find that that that what happens is now you come you bypass your word form you came straight from his thoughts his genes to be expressed in flesh and you are now being restored and the bible says glory upon glory upon glory upon glory you see so you're being restored back glory upon glory upon glory adam didn't have to do that but you have to do that amen see so we find that that he he's saying here there's coming a worship that the father hasn't yet got to enjoy and they've been worshipping i mean think about the mind of god he's been receiving worship for 4 000 years at this point 4 000 years amen and he's not he's not reached his satisfaction place yet he's got a whole nother a whole another expression now we're getting ready to go into the next phase and this is going to be the phase of the era of the holy ghost jesus lived his life that brother branham said that was the christian era because it was christ he was alive on the earth three three and a half years by roman calendar three years on a jewish calendar but he was there and but now when the holy ghost comes brother and says now since then we've lived in the holy ghost age the holy ghost era we've lived under the pentecostal feast the jubilee all right you got that right now so so brother branham comes here in exposition of the seven church ages and the laodicean age by the way excuse me and i read this last time now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous i can say amen to that no chastening seems joyous seems grievous nevertheless nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby and i i made a comment to you in my closing remarks last time that that some may not have uh much interest in this peaceable fruit of righteousness but i do i do i declared that to you last time i get it most of the world and and you know i there's nothing i can do about that because i'm not a messenger to the whole world i'm a i'm an angel a messenger an earthly messenger sent to this local community and you are the sheep who god has committed to my charge and that's all i am i'm just a little shepherd on the side of a hill somewhere and the father said here's some lambs and take them into their life and bring them back to me mature grown and bearing wool and that's what i'm doing amen if you wonder what i'm doing that's what i'm doing if you wonder what your tithing supports supports that and sometimes i have to do and say things that that that make you want to stop paying your tithing oh boy but all i'm doing is trying to grow you all i'm doing is trying to bring you to something see and i'm trying to get there myself amen isn't that i mean you say that's kind of a dumb plan yeah the bible actually uses a harsher word the foolishness of preaching that god uses an imperfect man to perfect imperfect people okay all i can do is acquiesce all i can do and that means to reluctantly agree because it's it's not something i ever craved or chased in my life it's hard enough and you know as well as me it's hard enough being responsible for your own self without having to be responsible for everybody else but such is my lot in life and i just say i rejoice and i just say blessed be the name of the lord then if i gotta do it well i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it i'm gonna go all in i'm gonna go all at it and and the only time i that it becomes grievous to me is when i find myself not being all in and i say come on man stand up get going yeah you got a job to do come on friends the the the whole the whole uh mentality of the world is all about a free lunch and give me something free and i don't wanna work and i don't wanna trial and i don't wanna you know i just wanna just give me give me give me give me what have you i know what you did for me last month but hey what have you done for me lately and that's that's feeding the neurosis that that's what's causing everybody thinks that oh everybody's got to accept me and i've got to be celebrated and i and i and if i if somebody offends me then i'm going to have to take an action oh good grief you know the bible says that whenever you get to feeling that way and you start fainting in your own faith said here's what you do consider the lord jesus who endured such a contradiction of sinners against himself uh my my monitors went away completely if you can give me just a little bit of that back uh g-man i would appreciate it not a whole lot i don't like a ton but i had a little more a minute ago and so so you find that that god has us here and these peaceable fruits of righteousness and i i'm on a quest today you know now not a virtual reality game come on all right i'm not here to finish some level all right i'm here i'm here to find and enjoy the peaceable fruits of righteousness and i i told you last night i told you last time that it's all i think about night and day well i want to tell you today my quest continues are you on the same quest today my quest continues i'm trying to find celestial city hallelujah i started at the wicked gate and i went through many hard places but i'm pressing on hallelujah i've got plenty of companions to go along with me amen if i get sideways evangelists will show up and straighten me out and pull me out of the miry clay amen for those of you who've never read pilgrim's progress i feel sorry for you so most wonderful book about the christian life you'll ever read in your life amen it's the brother brown said the two books abraham lincoln kept constantly was the pilgrim's progress in his bible and so you know i i i last time i when i was talking about finding the uh current of god for your life and i i so appreciated you know the testimony you heard brother kenny give that testimony wednesday about he had heard that sermon and he remembered a story about when he was a marine you remember and he swam out and suddenly a current wanted to take him somewhere he didn't want to go remember that and brother kenny started swimming against it and fighting against it and trying to swim against the current and actually was ending up drowning he was in the process of drowning all right and so he said something just spoke to him and said just relax go with it and brother kenny with no training of that no one had ever told him that's what you do he just relaxed you know why god did that because god saw brother kenny sitting among us god saw a family god saw sister anita and she's going to need a husband he saw children they're going to need a dad we he saw a church and we're going to need a song leader amen and so so brother kenny just laid back in the current and he quit struggling and the current the current saved his life you understand he was dying trying to go against the current and and my whole point was there is a current of god in the upper atmospheres or in the sea of life and god has that current for you and he has a it's predestinated to take you somewhere and as long as you will just let yourself go into that current you'll arrive safely it's when you try to swim against doggedly determined to keep your own current and to swim to your own destination and that's when you run into problems you're you're you know i told the story of being in a jetliner over the pacific and they had to make an unscheduled stop because they ran out of gas because the pilot said from the time he lifted up from lax they ran into an unforeseen strong headwind and he had to give it the juice and he burned up all of his gas and had to land on a u.s airfield to refuel mid mid flight unscheduled see and so so that's what happens when you try to fly against the current when you try to swim against the current god has a predestinated path for your life you need to slip into that slipstream amen and i i asked you last time from an article i had read about questions concerning decisions and i i feel that these questions say you know why why would you what was the real purpose behind those questions and here it is it's just an honest shepherd's heart i felt that these questions could cause the the much needed deeper introspection that we often overlook we often overlook we get in too big of a hurry we act too quickly prophet said don't don't be hasty amen don't be hasty see and these questions they are they were thought provoking for decisions that we make or are making or if i'm counseling you and you're coming to me and you've got to make a decision you've got to make some life choices they were simple straightforward questions and you all agreed with me sensibly they're very good questions and every decision you make you should ask yourself these questions have you question number one have you carefully thought this through question number two this is a big one how do you think your choice will impact you and those involved because i promise there's always those involved yes amen it's bigger than you all right number three do you think this is the most suitable choice i didn't not asking if you think it's a good choice i'm asking if you think it's the best the most suitable how do i know what's going to be the most suitable choice what what do you feel is god's will for your life if if choice a takes you away from this and choice b brings you closer to this the answer should be b amen question number four is that what you really want and then i i spoke about a fifth question that you know would you like uh to take time you know to to to think about uh your response because you know this this might be a a pretty big uh issue in your life and so so when i when i looked at these questions you know that i i i used actually in this pulpit i had a uh what i would call a certain well aimed um how would i say it better i it i i asked you questions the context of which were well aimed for this assembly now i've got plenty of people who watch from all over the world who aren't in this assembly that's fine well and good i preached along some of these lines at the men's meeting and it'll go to here in yawn that's that's fine that that's just because i've traveled the world preaching the gospel but but as a shepherd as a pastor i i felt like i wanted to ask and there's plenty of different contexts there's plenty of different contexts but i had a certain context based on my observation as a shepherd and the need that i sense for those under my responsibility does that make sense to you would you not want me to do it that way see and so so i used a certain context in the in the sermon last time but the questions are good questions they're good principled questions and they're usable uh broadly in many other contexts but i but last time what i was doing is i i i wanted to use my if i could say it like this i i was using my god-given high-powered scope to look downrange over the flock of god that he had committed to my care amen committed to my charge to form to inform my thinking to form my particular well-aimed questions to this assembly i used my spiritual laser range finder to make sure because i wanted to hit the target targets all right i had a target but i'm shooting at more than one target see and you know sometimes a well-placed shot oh my sometimes these things always have their humorous side sometimes a well-placed shot can be actually blown off course by an unexpected and sudden wind amen in our case it was a bug in our case it was a little one and a half inch creature that terrified three quarters of the church i'm glad i didn't see it because i just kept going along but sometimes an unexpected win can cross you downrange and you're you know you're uh you're you're most well-placed shot can miss can go awry because of an unexpected and sudden change that you weren't anticipating so i'm gonna fire my shots again amen now stand perfectly still please don't move because i want to hit the target amen we asked the question number one you know the number one question was have you thought carefully have you carefully thought this through the decisions that you are making or have made and i knew this morning friends i knew this morning studying this and i found i realized at least i believe to the best of my ability i realized why i was struggling so hard to find the exact path of god this morning because i was in my own desire wanting to turn this into a preaching sermon and the lord was determined that it was going to be a practical sermon so you okay with that so so i so my my long range my laser range finder my my law high powered scope that god has gifted me with to see and to determine and to make judgment and a gift to rightly divide the word and and it's it's not now i'm not the gift the gift is a piece of machinery inside of me it has not it's not me see it's that god called me to this office and put that machinery in me and it turns itself on all right so you should never take anything personally for me because it's not me it's coming through god's channel and so and i know that can be difficult especially if my flesh gets in the way and i make it sound personal and i that's always wrong that's never right but i here was here was my first shot downrange because here is here's a decision that too many in bethel tabernacle are making might make or have made i have work and school and hobbies and social friendships and social obligations and career obligations and i'll come to church when i can i'll get there when i can rule number one have you carefully thought this through come on amen now if you have okay it's not up to me to run your life but have i just want to make sure you've really thought that through amen see there's a brother in this assembly i'm not going to call his name first of all he wouldn't want me to he had quite a bit of years and money already invested in college and a career and a career and had that career with long-term security and great benefits and a growing family to think of but this question was on his mind this question was on his mind as he carefully thought it through his he realized that his career kept him too often from the house of the lord amen for him that was untenable at least long term short term things come up i get it sometimes short term life is life i get it god gets it too trust me all right but long term that was untenable for him he began some time ago asking the lord to give him something different i mean this means throwing away years and lots of dollars in college and a career he began asking the lord to give him something different the lord looked on that prayer and the desire of his heart the lord was so pleased with that that he arranged a completely completely new career opportunity and it turns out it's one that will actually end up paying him even more money best of all best of all it will allow him to be in church with his family when the doors are open amen say that's not that important to me okay okay okay you know good luck with that then carry on god bless you i'll still love you we'll still love you you got to make the best decision for you and your family i'm just asking you have you have you really have you carefully thought through that decision concerning attending the house of god when the doors are open amen this listen this is just brother jason asking you to think about it fair enough just asking you to think about it number two i'm an adult with my own family and i don't need ministers bawling me out and telling me what to do rule number two how do you think that decision will impact you and those that it will involve if you don't want the preacher telling you the truth if you don't want if you want to change the scripture to where the house of god is not the house of judgment that judgment begins at the house of god but you don't want that okay this is just brother jason asking you to think about that you know how do you think your decision will impact you and those that are going to that it's going to involve you know just just as just as you know all preachers get terribly misunderstood uh brother brown talked about how he was so misunderstood and all faithful ministers do brother branham said everybody thinks now there's a reason for that people weren't just being stupid he said everybody thinks i'm a he said all the people think i'm against everybody now there was a reason for that it's because of the way he ministered and he said but if they only knew i'm actually for everybody and he said but i have to be loyal to a message he said humanly speaking i wish it wasn't mine i can say to you today i wish this wasn't mine but it is so what would you have me do see and so you know i i if you haven't can i could i do a little promo here for last weekend brother jd's sermon oh my goodness wow say it backwards wow brother jd that may be the best sermon i've ever heard you minister goodness and you know it was so helpful that's what the word of god should be it should be helpful it should teach us how to how to serve god and how and and the purpose about of why we're here because i promise you oh brother jd you didn't get to hear all the bragging or were the speakers on okay good okay amen praise the lord just want to make sure that you got that rose pinned on you properly i know sister amy would have told you but i wanted you to hear it amen and you know one of the one of the parts among the many that just sent me into the stratosphere is brother jd talked about missing the mark now this is interesting and he didn't call it that but that that's that that's what he was referring to and i've got the scripture that he actually used you know sin because he identified what sin was and you know i have been i have been studying the writings of great scholars since i was a boy i have been studying this book since i was a boy and i'm here to tell you that i that i have heard that statement what is sin sin is missing the mark i could take you to my lexical aids by dr zodiates and and show you that's even what he calls it what is sin missing the mark but they never tell you what the mark is like it's just like a cliche it's like what is sin missing the mark oh that's pretty profound okay what's the mark i understand there's a mark i understand there's a prize i understand there's something depressed too what is it if you answer that you'll answer why you're here amen so what is sin brother jd quotes romans 3 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god what is sin you living in a way that misses the mark what's the mark for your life to look like his life for your life to bring him glory so that the world who's misunderstood him completely because of their teachers and misinterpreted theology the world is in a state of blindness that's the bible there's darkness on the world and gross darkness on the people and perilous times and there's a time like has never been and you've got pre-tribulation movements happening to us right now you've got the the reaper the sowers overtaking the reapers i mean i'm here to tell you something friends you're living in the most chaotic dark but yet the brightest most light that's ever struck the world and you have free access to it it's yours for the taking and what is its purpose so that your life can bring him glory that's why you're alive amen the bible says the bible teaches us in what it says let everything that has breath praise the lord what is the lesson if your life if your breath doesn't praise him stop breathing because you're a thief you're using air you can't manufacture you understand you're filling your lungs with god's product but you're refusing to give him glory you have life flowing through your blood you couldn't put it there you can't keep it there and you're not using that life to bring him glory which is the purpose of why you have life oh man i get to spend the rest of my time on that point alone that's our purpose that's our purpose your life is not about you it's about him it's never been about you it's always been about him this is why we preach this is why the judgment begins at the house of god this is why you have to come here to have your mind washed clean how do you how does that happen by the washing of the water of the word the condition of the world today everything you contact from the tree of knowledge of good and evil contaminates your mind it contaminates your mind it contaminates your spouse's mind it contaminates your children's mind it contaminates whole churches whole families preachers everybody we need constantly not less we need more of the word to keep our minds washed how you going to make life decisions that affect you and your loved ones if you don't have a clean mind to make it with amen because you you've allowed career and college and school and social activities and social connections you've allowed you know these kinds of things to reprioritize your schedule so so that your prayer life and your church life and your bible time and your hearing a tape time and all these things that are designed and purposed to keep you strong and clean you you don't you never get to them they're they're you know what you know why a lot of times you don't get to them because they're only fitted and sometimes they don't fit because they're not they're not your main state they're just fit in you try you make time and then sometimes things happen life happens and you can't make time you see what i mean you see what i mean this is why you have life is for his glory i got i'm going to stop early i'm not going to stop early i'm going to stop on time today you just indulge me another 10 or 15 minutes can i get it because i this is so vital say well you preached it last time but the bug okay we had a bug missing the mark i don't need to be more spiritual i can believe the message and still dress and live like modern nominal christians they're christians too well of course they are brother branham we we put that quote up or brother branham said they ascribe how was the how was the language uh they ascribed to the fine qualities if you can find that matty if you can find that real quick and put it up matthew my matthew yeah if you can find that put it up they ascribe to the fine qualities just do a search for fine qualities i'm sure you'll hit it it's in the church age book and because they ascribe to the fine qualities of jesus they they're they're they're they're identified as christian just like anyone who would ascribe to to muhammad would be a muslim you see amen just like anyone who would ascribe to atheists become an atheist that's their identity and but brother branham shows there's a big difference in being that kind of a christian and actually being born again see because because in it and it's really simple it's not a complicated topic here's here's the deal here's the history you ready all right in the early days of the christian church every church was a message church there's no such thing as as a not a message church not a christian church there's all kinds of churches to diana and astarte and all these kinds of things and temples but there was only one christian church and they all believed quoted from and observed paul's teachings because he was the messenger to that alpha church amen and even all the other apostles and prophets and ministers and pastors ascribed to his teaching amen here it is if you yeah thank you son appreciate that look ephesian age uh where'd you go you had it there it is yeah right there so go up just a little bit all right now why does god call these churches because he uses plural in the book of revelation go read your bible churches why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine the truth of the matter is that they are christians but they are not christians of the spirit that means you're born again when you're a christian of the spirit they are christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain mark 7 teaches us that jesus said how be in vain do they worship me here's why teaching for doctrines the commandments of men but indeed brother branham goes on to say they are christians for what else could they be a is a mohammed and that is his religion no matter how he lives it's because he subscribes in theory to what the quran teaches in the same way as a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose that he is the savior of mankind etc in fact in the laodicean age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity deny his deity is not not just limited to denying that he was god in flesh but because as soon as you deny that then you deny the holy ghost because they're all the same and then then the holy ghost has no authority in your life because you don't you deny him authority see see so his deity christian science have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel he's a nominal christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true spiritual believer teenagers young people look at that i want you to know that i want you to know that because there's a lie being propagated a whole world over that anybody who just reads a sinner's prayer and says he was the son of god and died for my sins they're just automatically going to heaven and that's not true jesus said many shall say to me lord lord who will never enter in it's those that do the will of my father see and so i want you to understand that that's bible teaching brother branham didn't make that up brother jason didn't make that up the world is overspread in this kind of a flesh christian now many of them are very good people extremely fine people you have listen friends listen especially teenagers listen because i'm determined to have a generation that debunks that completely there that what you have is three kinds brother in one place called it three kinds of believers you have an actual real believer who's born again in the spirit of god past from death to life never come into the judgment you've been born again of the holy spirit then you've got you've got that believer you've also got make believers and you've got unbelievers now let me let me re re-describe it to you in a different way saying basically the same thing pre-tribulation now before the tribulation before the rapture you've got three kinds of christians in the world you've got those who are truly born again of the spirit of god you've got a remnant who the bible calls an unwise virgin now she is a virgin she's not the harlot daughter of revelation of book of revelation you don't put her there she's a virgin to christ she's not exactly born again she's she has received uh the effects of his holy ghost on her flesh and on her spirit remember your body spirit soul your triune being and that's why they have been justified of their past sins but they also are sanctified and that's why the king and matthew chapter 25 calls them righteous because they live righteous holy they're saints saints means sanctified they live a holy you meet them you meet them i i i just bought some of my girls my granddaughters i told them hey go on this website and papa i'll pay for your find you a nice skirt camp's coming up and it's a christian i mean if i pulled up their picture they sent me a nice email today i'm going to write them back my goodness such a beautiful family man woman the children wow and i just thought wow they i might need to witness to them and you say well what if they don't believe the message well that's just up to god you can't determine that that's a gene of god or it's not but that doesn't mean you might not tell them enough that they could save themselves in the tribulation by not taking the mark of the beast so you should witness to everybody because you don't know who is or who is it say well is there any way i can find out who is and who isn't sure if they have a gene of god and brother branham said the light ever flashes across that seed it'll come to life but if it's not there they won't see it and can never see it but that doesn't mean that those righteous saints go to hell they don't they go actually after the millennium they're granted eternal life and live with us in heaven so you've got the elect lady as john called her born again of the spirit of god you've got righteous christians who live sanctified lives and then you've got a third category of those who call themselves christians they have a form of godliness they call themselves christians that's a for they go to church they sing gospel songs they have a form of godliness but they deny the power brother madam said that's the living reality to change their lives see the the first three feasts are passover unleavened bread and first fruits we were dealing with this with the brothers yesterday and the breakfast the unleavened bread jesus was the passover lamb the next feast which started the very next day was unleavened bread it meant that all leaven is driven out of your life 11 is in the bible is sin paul teaches us that and so anybody who's a real christian drives sin out of their life you don't read a sinner's prayer i believe jesus the son of god died to save my sins and that's actually written out if you say it then praise the lord you're in the kingdom but if you really accept christ it drives sin out of your life you don't keep on going with no change you don't just take his name get baptized and the women keep dressing immorally and they even dress him early now going to church for goodness sake and the men keep smoking and drinking and cursing and and gambling and all these kinds of things and carousing that's not a christian it might be a christian of the flesh who goes to church that's not a real one that's an artificial one and you've got those three kinds see that little card that sinner's prayer there's nothing wrong with the wording i love the wording but what it's represented to be that's the big lie being told and we said yesterday brothers and i set nine of us seven and the tennis and two online and we'd had a discussion about how do we how do we expose this lie say what's the lie here's a lie denominationalism leads to the mark of the beast stay in it you're doomed it'll lead you to the mark there there's an image to the beast that's already built and will soon come into power say oh well we got a constitution so does canada but i there's a pastor right now who who kept his church open just during covert when the government said don't hold services he said that's house of god i'm gonna hold services and he held services and then he came to the u.s to preach some at a conference and when he went back as soon as he landed they took him off the plane in handcuffs and handcuffed him put him on his knees right on the tarmac with everybody watching and handcuffed him and since he's now facing six years in prison and he said you think this can't happen to you america trust me it can and it will see after the bride goes in the rapture those three kinds of different christians real ones sanctified ones and those who have a form of godliness but deny the power don't have any change in the life when the bride goes there's only two remaining and this one will be hunted down like dogs and killed and give their life in the tribulation but they'll be in heaven and the third category who denied his power never let him have rule and reign in their lives will go to a lake of fire by their own choice by their own choosing see say brother jason you've kind of talked about a lot of this and i've talked about it a lot recently because it is an abiding burden on my heart why brother jason because in my long-range scope i see too much of it in this group i see that lie being brushed under under a rug shouldn't we witness shouldn't we move among them absolutely that's why you're here but what message are you giving them if your life isn't bringing him glory what are you telling them in your life if you're dressing just as as as horrible as they are yeah amen if your church attendance is no better than theirs in some cases not even as good as some of theirs because for them it's a social gathering they wouldn't miss it see so what what is the message that you're giving to expose the lie amen amen i don't need to be more spiritual i can believe the message and still dress like and live like modern nominal christians do you think come on do you think introspection do you think that is the best choice you can make are you sure are you sure brother jason i'm young i've got my whole life ahead of me i just want to be free to live in sin is that what you really want is that what you really want i'm gonna look you all in the eye look me in the eye i want you to know something young and old alike there is no life value in sin zero it pays wages some people choose sin as a career become career centers it pays wages wages you can't refuse it's death the wages of sin is death there's plenty of physical pleasures in sin plenty of social pleasures in sin but no life value because it all comes to an end it all comes to a sad end my goal for me for my house and for you and your house is that we will serve the lord amen i have one goal for my house and my family my children my wife my grandchildren if the lord tarries their children i have one goal that overrides every other thing i have and that is that they will all be gathered with me on the other side i have that same goal for you and for your children and for your spouse and for your grandchildren that is why i preach that is why i labor with it that's why i stay with it that's why i think about it night and day is because i want all of you to be with me over there and i know that no matter how upset you might sometimes get and sometimes it's my fault for letting my flesh get in the way i own that but understand here's what i understand on the other side you'll thank me on the other side you'll put your arms around me you'll say brother jason thank you for telling us the truth thank you that you wouldn't let it go you wouldn't leave it alone thank you and i and and we're all going to go up the father's throne and say thank you lord thank you for the word thank you for christ thank you for a message i tell you something friends jesus never promised it would be easy only that it would be worth it amen i'm going to keep my promise and stand you up we're going to stop praise the lord any bugs we get get through that anybody got everybody good nobody ran for their life [Laughter] i'm glad i didn't see that i'd have probably died laughing amen oh hey can i request a song sir blessed be blessed be blessed [Music] blessed [Music] raise up your hands now bless

his room to talk to him for the last time and i looked into those gray eyes of his and he's looking at me and smiling and i realized i was looking at the man living behind those eyes that old worn out body was just his temple it wouldn't live a few more hours but i knew that the man inside that temple had trusted you [Music] and i'd see him again and i said grandpa i just want you to do me one favor when you cross over because i know you will i want you to find the highest mountain you can find in glory i want you to run to the tip top of it throw up both hands and scream the loudest scream to praise god that you made it i said do that for me scream out at from the highest peak you can find i made it and i'll see you again and i know i will see him again [Music] that's been many years ago lord death being a part of life we all come to it sooner or later but we're believing lord that we just might be those people upon whom the ends of the earth have come and that we are the ones who will be alive and remain at the coming of the lord i want to be standing believing preaching the same gospel i've i've sold out to it lord i've bet my life on it i've led the people that i couldn't love more the people i loved the most the people you gave me my own family my own flesh and blood there's no one in the world i could love equal to them and i have banked their soul on this word of god would i do a thing like that if i wasn't sure lord when i lay my head on a pillow each night i go to sleep in perfect faith that you have sent us your restored word we have it we see it we see you prove it and manifest it in our lives we see you do the supernatural we see impossible things become possible lord we want to see more of it we want to see more of it in our lives and in our homes

hold the banner high to blow the trumpet loud so that everyone even the ones on the fringe can hear it lord because we don't want to leave anybody behind i want to raise the end sign higher and higher

that so you're coming today see what this is is this is your life making a statement you can say anything with your mouth but what what are your actions so this is actually an act of obedience because the bible says you should be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and then the new birth is yours it's the holy ghost is promised to you amen if your whole heart is completely dedicated to the lord you've repented of all your sins and you are ready to make christ the lord of your life is that all true wow this is going to be easiest baptism i've had praise the lord we're going to let

before and i've seen it manifest and i've seen it go lord i know adults right now that that decided even as early as five years old i know them personally that made that decision and they've never looked back to this day raising children in the admonition of god so lord we don't we don't we don't worry about his his young age we can see lord his his mature heart in believing your word and wanting to take your name in bad baptism i believe lord that the holy ghost is his portion from this day on lord we commit him to you now take him grow him in grace teach him training train him lord that's what life is about it's why we're here it's for the next life it's not about this one never has been lord you've taught him that he wants to be part of that next world so we commit him into
