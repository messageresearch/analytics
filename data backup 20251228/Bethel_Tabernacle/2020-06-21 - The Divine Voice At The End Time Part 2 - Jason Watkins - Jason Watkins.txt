praise God we're glad to have you here in the house of the Lord today amen while we're still gathering under our self-imposed restrictions you can be seated momentarily I just want to make a few announcements before we dismiss the musicians want everybody to be able to hear it we've got a you know a unsettling time in the world right now and you know there it looked like maybe that we kind of had things going in the right direction and I know what the political climate that's active right now it's going to keep going forward and I'm not so much concerned about that I think things will continue to open up and I don't I really don't have any not any way to know you know what governors will do individually our governor has been somewhat conservative you know and kind of even when they were originally shutting things down he was very reticent to do that I I know that from the federal standpoint from the White House they want everything to go forward but they can't always make that happen state to state so we don't know what's going to happen exactly going forward here in South Carolina but there there definitely has been a spike both in testing which has spiked positive tests coming back because they're testing so much more but they're also as a margin of that and what I can't determine is the exact margin nobody seems to be separating it out how much of that is hospitalizations which is the real number that's the one - you've got to be cognizant of because if people are is testing positive then that doesn't mean that they're even presenting any symptoms I was just reading today or my wife was actually catching me up on it that you know South Carolina just set a new record in this kovat environment over the last you know since the spring I think yesterday was our largest day of new confirmed cases but that's largely because of increased testing which is a good thing I had it suggested to me by a good brother as a medical provider that it's it's possible that we all will eventually come in contact with the corona virus maybe many of us already have and don't even know it that's I would say that's probable so but but but you know I did I was able to get an update concerning our local hospital that they are pretty much running to capacity ICU and regular beds are getting rare and they're having to really you know labor to get patients admitted and they have had a few increased or some increase in covent hospitalizations so there's no doubt that the very much expected second wave probably is underway I think that there's a little doubt of that myself personally you see the trend happening in China and Beijing is actually shutting down again and so these kinds of things are going on so what I can report to you is that I was just in North Carolina and there's two or three churches up there that have had to close because their assemblies became infected with the corona virus and I the only serious case that I've heard about which actually he's now on the mend and improving his brother is pastor Tim Hayden there in North Carolina he caught it several members of the church caught it there's several other churches that have shuttered because it hit in their assemblies the word I got is everybody's doing fine but the Tim really got pretty sick but you know disliked with our own Charles prayer prayer changes everything and so you know brother Tim is on is mending and the last word I got this morning even from brother Jason work is he's starting to recover but we want to hold him in prayer told him we would and this the Lord would keep strengthening him several churches you know we've certainly found out contrary to false understanding that you know we couldn't possibly catch the kovat virus because it was a tribulation plague well that was never true and I'm you know I'm glad we never taught that from here we have followed a path of prudence I'm not at all afraid I haven't operated in fear at all I know the Lord my life and time and your life and time is in his hands and so you know if I was gonna operate in fear I'd certainly kept my family home certainly would have kept my mom home at her age but you know I've not operated in fear I haven't felt afraid I encourage you to not be afraid but it's not a matter of fear versus faith it's about prudence and wisdom and so that's really how I have tried to operate before the Lord several churches in the message around have now gone back to their streaming only I think Happy Valley is now going back that one that I know of I think maybe in the Phoenix church has also gone back to internet-only where they have this like we did for awhile skeleton crew of just some musicians of worship leader and a skeleton booth crew just and we distrained it I I I don't feel to do that just yet to go back to that if I do go back it will be to that we will continue to meet here and preach the gospel to you and if we have to do that I would encourage you heavily catch every service if your home today streaming let me just say to the audience who aren't allowed to be here today if your home streaming and you haven't been faithful to catch every service go back and get them well you make sure you catch all of them because every word that's being spoken to the bride now is of vital vital vital importance things are happening at an alarming pace that are happening in the world that we've never seen the conglomeration of we've never seen it as a whole as I said to you sometime weeks ago that it's not that things are happening in the world judgment signs it's not that we haven't seen them before it's that we've never seen them all happening at the same time before and truly friends the coming of the Lord would have to be nearby every metric any measurable standard you'd want to use you have to conclude that there is no eighth age there's not another age coming there's no more messengers God only had seven he deployed his last one a half-century ago the the the Israel's back in their homeland Moses and Elijah are ready to come on the scene if for no other reason than that alone Moses Elijah can't enter the field until we clear the field so the coming of the Lord is soon you want to make sure that everything is buttoned up tight in your heart your life this is no time to play loose you know with your experience this is time to make your calling and election sure this is time to lay aside if you were ever going to take a time to lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily more easily than you'd want to admit beset you this is the time so you know right now we're meeting using 50% of the alphabet and then I'm always open to letting families we've relaxed even that a little bit we've added in that anyone that's on duty as far as any of the offices are concerned if they're on duty their families welcome to attend with them I like to keep families together I don't want to see them broke up just because we're you know splitting up the alphabet like that others who travel at distance are always allowed to come and then I occasionally get nearly every weekend I'll get at least one special request for the Jason for such-and-such a reason can I I'm not scheduled I'm not on the list but could I come yes I always say yes happy to have you and so we're going to carry on with that but just bear in mind I'm watching it I just wanted to normally I've been sending out a letter to you and I haven't done that with this one but I just kind of wanted to give it to you verbally and while everyone is watching that I am I am keeping close tabs with the municipalities the government the hospitals our own team of doctors we have here their inside information on it and so we are watching that very closely we're moving very prudently if we decide to go back temporarily to just a video crew and worship team I'll make sure to let you know in plenty enough time I'm sure by now you're able to keep up with the alphabet when you're signed I don't I've not been continuing to send that out I think everybody's got that figured out by now after today one one one thing that I am going to do I I contemplated two additional steps I've decided to not do one but to apply the other I was going to suspend our Sunday school class just to limit the amount of time that we're together because that's a factor one of the reasons that we're that we have a low risk is because we're only here for a couple hours and it's in a small group and you know you we gather in families and so we keep families seated together and even if we have you shake hands it's usually family to family so you know you want to be still be vigilant outside we want to be very careful remember friends we're still we're still got a testimony to protect all right when you go out front and you congregate like like it there's no problem that people see that so just be careful you know if you want to stand out in congregate intentionally have a little bit of distance I don't I'm not worried about six feet the World Health Organization has never said it needed to be more than three feet so you know just try to at least have some semblance of distancing because we want you to fellowship I know you love each other and you want to see till I get it I love coming to church for that reason as well and so we're going to continue with the Sunday School class I just felt like I didn't want to lay that down I want to keep it going but concerning the fellowship hall after today now not counting today because some of you may have come with prepared food expecting to eat in the fellowship hall if you are be my guest but after today to the Deacons I'd like to keep that close please until further notice in the afternoons I hate to do that because I really really really really really did I say really I really enjoy that fellowship in the fellowship oh man you people are so awesome I so enjoy sitting out there drinking coffee and talking about the things of God or just talking about how you been Amen so it's just a wonderful weave it's a little bit of a little bit of seasoning on our church that is rare people that visit here say wow I've never seen things like this where y'all just seem to come out here in the pastor and his wife jumps right in the big middle and y'all just all like one big family I won't yeah that's my design we like it like that so you know people who tend to be islands to themselves don't usually last here at Bethel Tabernacle because we like to be one big happy family amen and we like people included anytime we have an event I don't want most people there I want everybody there it's just how I'm natured I've had to learn to press through that sometimes and I get that not everybody can be as amazing as me and so I should have said that oh well just wanted to loosen you up just a little bit you just all staring at me like oh no so until further notice not counting today if you've come today preparing to stay a fellowship all god bless you I probably won't sister Debbie you'll notice not here today she's making tremendous progress in the problems he's been having in her intestine and stomach but then she's also having some side effects from medication today intestine Elysee so just keep her in prayer and myself as well so we just come back from North Carolina for a few days visiting and did some visiting and ministering while we were there with the family and so I'm from the trip I'm a little bit tired so I'll probably head back home today after service but god bless you if you're planning to stay around and fellowship but after this Sunday we won't have the fellowship hall open until further notice and we will continue with Sunday school and we will continue to meet using half the alphabet and granting anyone special request I'm sure I will continue to do that as well let's stand back up god bless you we want to remember to pray for brother Tim Hayden that the Lord will continue you know friends we're gonna have to have faith I mean you're you're at the day where faith is going to be an imperative you're not going to be able to go a day and it's only going to get more and more imperative till it becomes so essential that you dare not face a day without strong settled faith in your heart there are there are there are things listen for sure for sure for sure I can tell you thus say at the Prophet under the inspiration of God things will get worse they must get worse they cannot get better they must get worse even if we have periods that seem to be respite and quiet understand it's just the next wave is just almost coming we're either coming out of 1 in 1 or about to go in 1 the world as we know it is coming to a conclusion the Bible describes the the system of man in the world as it's old like a garment that's old and more out it's ready to be wrapped up it needs a new one we need new bodies amen so I know that we're we're going to have that soon you're going to have to have faith there's things that the doctors will not have answers for we have beyond measure the most sincere of heart and dedicated medical care givers in this assembly that you could ever hope for they will face things increasingly they have no medical solutions for I'm glad that patients who go to see them are going to see a praying caregiver a care giver who can lay hands on them and the patient might not even know they're being prayed for amen I know that they do that they've told me you know brother Branham my sister sent me this quote I'd I don't ever remember reading it though I've heard this message make the valley full of ditches and brother branham's got a man in a discernment line and he says this is this is odd doc Meredith listen to this he says brother madam starts seeing a vision talking about waters running on the road or something like that isn't that right and he says they speaking of the doctors they can't understand here it is brother Branham says it's caused from a nervous condition it's putting water in your lungs Wow and it's caused from a nervous it's not a disease it's an affliction of his mind and that's the that's the chief devil in this age madness in the mind and he says it's coming from a nervous condition it's putting forth water in your lungs now listen to what he says that's a demon power that a doctor would never find in the world I'm gonna tell you something friends we're gonna need this kind of God among us we're gonna need this kind of God among us I don't need the Prophet to come back from the dead to bring me back the same God that led him is here same pillar fires here amen all right praise the Lord e 1st Thessalonians 5 this morning first Thessalonians 5 and we're going to begin at verse 1 I apologize brothers in the booth for not getting you that scripture I try to get that to you and I I didn't have my mind made up until right before I came out so if you'll find that for me thank you 1st Thessalonians 5 we want to continue today on a divine voice before the end time part 2 divine voice before the end I think is what I titled it I think we proved that last time we were here that the world will hear once again from God direct a man as at Pentecost how did they hear direct from God direct from God direct God didn't step out on a cloud and start preaching but they heard direct from him he didn't come down and throw his voice around the earth and everybody heard it speaking he had done that in the gospel era when Jesus was walking in God's the Father spoke to him and people said that sound like thunder somebody said that was a voice of God and Jesus called it a voice so this voice came not for your sakes but mine are my sake but for yours and so God had done that he'd been known to do that but that's not how the world heard direct direct not indirectly that's an amazing statement not indirectly but directly as at Pentecost you know how it was through the body through the body God through his church the world heard direct from God they had thus saith the Lord whenever you are speaking thus saith the Lord it doesn't matter if you're William Branham or Don gurgel or Travis Jackson it doesn't matter who you are if it might be seal Carter it doesn't matter who you are if you're speaking thus saith the Lord that person is hearing not indirectly directly from God doesn't make seal Christ it doesn't make dawn or Travis or william branham christ doesn't make him Jesus but the people did here direct from God through the voice of a man but he's still just a man right all right now 1st Thessalonians 5 verse 1 but over the times and seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they now notice this isn't you is not the church this is they when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon who not you you're not the one running around crying peace and safety because peace and safety is a lie the world is in upheaval and the the age of mankind in a fallen condition is ending thank God as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape do you know how every by the way happy Father's Day brothers god bless you I thought of that because I want to think of mothers do you know how that every single mother in this building knows that the rapture must come it can't just keep going because they've given birth and they went into labor and sometimes it was a long and it was hard and it was painful and they agonized but finally it was inevitable it couldn't not happen once they went into labor sister Debbie she went into labor and she was crying and we were at hospital she said I don't wanna do this I just want to go home I don't wanna do this other honey I don't think it works like that your your you're nine months and you're in labor I'm pretty sure we're going forward when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye now look at him draw the line in the sand but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore for this cause for that reason having said what I said because of this because of this let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober we're the only ones who will we're the only ones who can you know why because we're the only ones who know what to really look for for they that's not you that sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on this is a proactive putting on the breastplate of faith on love for a helmet putting on a helmet putting on hope of salvation for God hath not appointed elected predestinated determined for us to have wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do not a beautiful passage may the Lord bless the reading of his let's pray I want to pray for brother Tim father we're asking prayer over your word today over this service asking prayer for brother Tim Hayden Lord I pray you will continue to strengthen him in all the saints there may be sick Lord may you just bring them completely back to perfect health watch over us now today keep us keep us under your care and under your leadership above all things Lord in Jesus name Amen god bless your friends you can be seated I started to go today and and I took a lot of my time making my announcement so it's already noon so I won't preach a full sermon so if you just give me your undivided attention I say for about 4045 minutes we will we will pull the chute stand on the brakes and get it stopped amen I I started to go today into the book of Revelation into those first chapters describing the church ages and till we come along and skipped along till we get to the sixth age and you know the the sixth age is it was unique because you know six is the number of man and we find that that seven then is completion and so that you know that that brother Branham talks about the sixth age and then it moves into the seventh age of lair Tasya and brother Branham calls it the shortest of all the ages and in one in one reference he kind of correlates it he says you know it could almost be thought of as an extension to the sixth stage that the seventh layer the CNH could almost be thought of as an extension of the sixth or the Philadelphian age now thank you Tony now the reason for that is of course that you have to really what I would call seminal events one in the sixth the end of the sixth stage and one in the end of the seventh age as it relates to God dealing in the church now we can talk about a bride age which is just the time within the last seventh age that God is dealing strictly by the pure word to his bride and if you want to come and be redeemed you've got to come to that all right and if you and if you have a salvation experience in a in a in a church system you certainly can have that you certainly can have a salvation experience there but the Holy Ghost will then lead you and guide you into all truth to to bring upon you the seal of the token and because you it's not possible in every case of the Bible that somebody was given the token every time somebody was given the seal now that's not to say the Holy Spirit can can work in people's lives that doesn't mean there yet sealed all right so the justification is a work of the Holy Ghost why did you repent see and hear you felt sorry for your sin that was the Holy Ghost you could have done that Paul said your carnal mind is enmity against God can never agree with God so it took a force greater than you to move upon you and you felt sorry for your sins and you repented now that meant that you are absolved of all the guilt of all your sins past it does nothing for your future it just simply brings you into right standing with God that now all of your sins are under the blood of Christ but then the Holy Ghost will continue or try to to work with you to bring you into sanctification and and to start sanctifying and cleaning up your life and then he will take you on into a complete state where all the doubt of the world is gone from your heart and that boxcar which is your heart not your flesh it's not about getting your flesh perfect enough to get sealed that's never it that's just a black that's just a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his tail and he's still Raven he never can be a peacock disgust he sticks them on his tail looks like a peacock that won't matter he's got to have a nature change he's got a he's got to go from a crow to a peacock so so we we find that that when brother Branham gives the analogy of the boxcar that's your heart and what's inside that box car is only one of two things faith or doubt and so if there's any any at all any doubt still in there you might have joined a church and repented and even stopped your lion and it started singing in the choir and maybe started getting sanctified but if there's still elements down inside your heart that you kind of still like the world you kind of you know yours there's still that thirst there there's still that hunger you're just you know you wanna go to hell and you're trying to be a good boy or trying to be a good girl that's a miserable place to live anyways but the devil will keep you there and tell you you've got the seal you don't have the seal because he won't seal that boxcar until every bit of doubt is gone out of your heart and the inspector looks in there and sees tight faith it's not rattling it's not shaky faith it's solid it's tight and he says this guy's a believer seal the door and you're sealed to the day when that when you roll into the final station hallelujah now the sad part of that is people go years getting through those processes and that is so ridiculous because you don't have to wait five seconds to get all three of those in your life all it takes is a moment where you are completely done with the world and you and you want him and you own only him and you don't want any more of the world and you fall on your face and say dear God I want you I want your life in my life I'm done with the world I'm done with being me I don't I'm tired of being Jacob I want to be have a name change and when God can see that that is real and it's sincere and you really mean it and he looks in the Box card sees Wow that's for real i'ma tell you in five seconds you can go from the rank Center to a saint of Almighty God sealed into the kingdom of God you need not wait 10 days in an upper room anymore that was only until the Holy Ghost came now you don't have to do that you don't have to fast you don't have to you don't have to pray you have to believe you have to accept it you have to have a complete dying out in your heart and from that and then from that moment you're only beginning now you're gonna begin to add and add and add and add you're gaining in virtue and knowledge and temperance and meekness and your your your you're growing you're strong you're fully empowered as a son of God the moment you're a son of God you're not lacking in any authority of heaven but you know God's not gonna bring a man out of the barroom and stick him in a pulpit the next day you know so so there is a growth there is a maturing that takes place and so so we find in that that that that two things the seminal moments that would happen at the end of the sixth age and at the end of the seventh age is where at the end of the sixth age after the messengers actually gone off the scene God is going to set an open door which is a revelation of Jesus Christ and there's going to be people rise up contrary to John Wesley and catch a revelation of of Jesus name baptism and one God faith that he's not three like John taught them and they're not rejecting John Wesley's teaching to not be turnit Ariens that's not a rejection of the sixth church age messenger because his message is sanctification he didn't have all the understanding so if he had have been alive and God would have sent that open door in front of him Wesley would have walked in it immediately so it's very obvious it's it's evidently apparent that it was sent there after his departure he cuz now the church was going to begin in the six states to understand Jesus name baptism and and and and it kind of it still wasn't the full picture kind of was a Jesus only oneness thing which is not exactly the the whole package either one is their Trinitarian oneness we've explained that before they they don't have in either one of their formulas the exact formula it took the opening of seals to do that and so so we find that that quite naturally then that revelation that began in the sixth would continue carrying on into the seventh oh that's my brother Brandon would say the seventh is almost like an extension of the sixth almost like a continuation because the opening revelation of the seventh starts at the end of the six before the seventh arrives and that's why you have men like like lake in different ones who were ahead of this as a revival in the late 1800s starting to preach an experience and the Holy Ghost already starting to understand Jesus name baptism and then it's it's it's a half a decade into the 20th century before the Azusa revival hits and when it hits one of its founders daddy Seymour didn't even William Seymour didn't even get it himself his wife got it three years at him people mocked him said you're a prayer preaching about something you didn't got it yourself he was honest enough to admit it but he got it oh he had that experience let me tell you something and that was God bringing forth another not they called it the Pentecostal revival and brother branham fine brother Brandon went along calling it that as well that was the the language they understood it to be but brother Branham after the seals corrects that understanding even though he kept using that phrase because that was the accepted phrase Pentecost but brother Branham said it wasn't actually the long-awaited restoration that was promised we were promised a restoration a full complete restoration he said they thought they had it he said when they denominated it proved that have it because they denominated and you can't denominator for restoration you follow me cuz it's Christ you can't denominating a man and so so we find then that brother Brandon would say you can't mix Pentecost with this message and to my astonishment has left me at times almost stupefied to hear people imagining that when he says you can't mix Pentecost with this that he's somehow talking about the original faith of the father's that hid in the upper room you can't mix that with this wait what this is that restored this is picks up where that declined in his end and moves on to a body change they had the token you think Paul didn't have the token you think they didn't have the Jubilee you think they didn't have the abstract title that was what the whole Old Testament promise was promising them and Peter said this is that that we were promised what they go back and look what they were promised it was the full Jubilee the full abstract God and man coming back being United in one now they were going to move on to a body change only they didn't the disciples went off the scene and the Church fell away just like the Bible said it would and when it comes back it comes back in a three justification sanctification Pentecostal Azusa revival you understand but then the seals had to be open and when the seals are open now we've got the fullness of everything that Luther had and the parts Luther didn't understand everything Wesley had plus the parts he didn't understand everything the Azusa revivalist had plus the parts they didn't understand and now we've got the mighty angel descended among us the pillar of fire living in us and once again the Jubilee the abstract the token is in the bride she's the final voice to the final age when brother Branham says you can't mix Pentecost with this he's talking about what the Azusa revival turned into it became a denominational mess and brother Branham said you can't mix this seven sealed message with that mess wasn't talking about the Bible Pentecost that was the full Jubilee and I get astonished that somebody could think that I said my goodness what are we even God I mean if this message isn't the restoration of that then you've got another Jesus you've got something the Bible never prophesied was coming whatever every scripture that prophesies about this message is that it's a restoration of the original of course they didn't fully fulfill everything they all died the church fell I get that that's what the that's if you want to say where this is a bride age wonderful just don't make it an anything you know I don't like them making an eighth age because then they got to have an eighth messenger boy if we had a ton of them ding-dongs pause more trouble let me taste some friends you're looking at it I can say that authoritative Lee I was born in this thing I was raised up in this I've watched it my whole life I'm not a johnny-come-lately ding-dongs man who promoted their own self and ruined families and ruined churches and gave false expectations and blew up young people before they could even get out of the blocks destroyed marriages and destroyed homes enough of it away with it it's the word of the word only hallelujah we're not here to lift up a man or another super ministry I made it a something we're all the family of God we're all in this thing together friends Wow I'll never stop crying out against that nonsense [Applause] too many times we've saw it wreck homes and churches and people come to nothing then better to have never started and so so we find that the harmony of the word is flawless if you'll just let it speak for itself and stop trying to bend it to your own agenda it's when I say to him stop trying to bend it to your own agenda just let it speak for itself it flows it's perfect it's it's harmonious it's one will make the symphony play in sympathy yeah that's what I want to be I want to be in sympathy with the composer hallelujah and so the jet the seventh age then what's their epic moment if in the six age it was the open door starting at all what's the epic moment in the seventh age and I covered this a couple of weeks ago they the last age is unique in many respects first of all we're the only age that takes a global body change man now the first age had the word to do that and they got to the point they could have done that but they couldn't do that they could but they couldn't they could because they were they elected they could because they had the Jubilee they could because they had the token they could because they had the perfect word from Paul they couldn't because the seed had to go into the ground the seed had to go into the ground Jesus could have chose to live forever but he couldn't he could have but he couldn't he get me he could have decided no that's not gonna die forget it no I'm not gonna do it but he couldn't so so the age could have went but they couldn't go because the seed had to go to the ground we had to be here this is God's masterpiece plan don't fight against it just be glad you're in be glad you see it hallelujah I'm glad it makes sense to me it feel said it it puts my puts wind under mine under my wings the unique thing that happened in the latest Sein age as a church dealing God dealing with the nominal church systems remember brides called out of that right the the the seminal moment of the church ages of of man-made systems was that they got into a very bad situation and the only one that could help them they kicked him out read revelation three he's on the outside knocking and now when he's knocking he doesn't even he's not even now he once he's put out he's not dealing with that with those systems or groups notice what he's saying if any man not if any group I'm done with groups they threw me out fine if any man hear my voice and open I'll come in to him and I'll sup with him and he with me come out of her my people whole you can't make this stuff up this took God to put all this together and so the earth you know had had reached an amazing time and prophecy when the as the sixth Gentile age was drawing to a close God still had a seventh star in his right hand and it's interesting because God was not thrown off and never is thrown off by the contrivances of man man thinks he can the devil thinks he's been trying to throw God off his plan and the devil does a certain move and God lets it happen and the devil goes gotcha and God goes no got you again and then God rearranged at it in and God two steps back the devil runs him haha gotcha got you again and so you know God knew what he was doing we we've been talking about the very characteristics of even the native Americans and their their characteristics that had to be designed by God because the Prophet was even going to come out of that culture and beat because he remember I taught you how he had to be a wilderness man but he wasn't gonna be in Palestine he's gonna be North America so how does God get a prophet let me see what's the best way to get a prophet a Gentile prophet in North America and I need him to be a wilderness man like a for-real one okay great I'll make his grandmother a full-blooded Native American and his mom will be a half-breed and that'll be just enough wildness in him to make him a man of the wilderness perfect so as the age was winding down and I'm going over all this because and I went over it very slow last time I'm doing the same thing again today because I'm taking on a journey I want you to follow me and watch all this unfold because you're in it you're in this story I'm telling and so we see that the earth had reached a time and prophecy when the six Gentile age would start winding down and would start drawing to a close history shows us that all of Europe and Asia the African nations the Middle East they were all feeling the grips of a almost an unappeasable stagnation you all through year the European battlegrounds had been bathed in blood for for hundreds of years centuries of fighting since the time of our Lord's departure and they start keeping the time with the calendar that we have today and it's been adjusted various times but more or less tracking along the first century the second century the third century you know and and you get to 11 you know 92 and then you get into 1450 and and so on and so on and at all this time all of Europe and Asia especially Asia one of those ancient civilisations known to man all through the scandinavian countries and the celtic lands and the and we're not here to give you a history lesson I'm sure you're familiar with the history of the what they called the old world and it had reached a point by the time you came down to the end of the of the sixth age with this with the stagnation and centuries of war and upheaval had so thoroughly and so it had so thoroughly wearied the advanced civilized parts of the world we find that that that that the last that the last phase of God's seven part plan for church ages seven church ages it would require fresh ground non destroyed in history it would require fresh ground it would require a vast clean swath of land and at that time America was largely unexplored undiscovered it was really almost like an not completely undiscovered but almost undiscovered and largely unexplored part of the earth they even referred to it all over Central Europe as the new world they called it that it's the new world that's hard for your mind to get around that because there's nowhere in the world people haven't been but at this time this was an unexplored continent it wasn't uninhabited but it was uncivilized and unexplored and largely undiscovered they had no it they had they had they didn't even understand you know it took Lewis and Clark Tut to go out from from from Old Hickory from from Jackson had to hire them I think of Jackson or Jefferson I think with Jackson hired them to go and find a Western route to the ocean see if you can differ if there's a navigable course that we could sail there and of course there's not because you run into the Rocky Mountains and so so we find then that that revelation now here's another unique characteristic so revelation and brother branham picks this up I'm reading here in a second look away to Jesus so revelations showing how that in this land when revelation spoke of this land brother Branham says revelation 13 plainly explains it this look awaited Jesus December 63 the Lamb you read it revelation come up out of the earth now the other beast which is in the book of Revelation it come up out of water because in the book of Revelation water mint thickness and multitudes and peoples and nations see it come up out of water thickness and multitudes of people this lamb here come up where there were no people just scattered natives there was no civilized culture it was just scattered natives right and and he's and and it shows he come up in land where there were no people a lamb represents a religion the Lamb of God remember remember it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb then after a while it received power and spoke like a dragon now from the days of our founding fathers and we've been examining the lives of them from the days of our founding father to the hour that we're living in it's been changing from a lamb to a dragon see watch and we find that that and the dragon alright and it spoke like a dragon and exercised all the power the dragon had before him and a dragon is Rome always so don't you see Roman denomination a mark Protestant denomination an image to the Beast get it again a Roman denomination mark of the beast Protestant denomination an image unto the Beast those were the beast in the image were two different things in the book of Revelation making here's what it'll make it'll make a power that'll force all Protestants like a union you'll have to be in this Council of Churches or you won't be able to have fellowship and you say man that's gonna be a long time coming it's already in effect has been for a while there's there are things that just like for instance I'm a Christian Church there's other Christian churches but I can't go into them and preach they won't have me you know why I don't have one of their letters I don't have a letter of reference from the headquarters so now we both carry a Bible I can't preach there see it's forcing me oh you want to preach in our church you got to go join our headquarters and take some classes and get a certification and then you can come here and preach see wow that still I say well that's kind of small remember it's going from a lamb to a lion I mean from a lamb to a dragon you haven't seen the dragon full on yet you're starting to see it now you're starting to see it now we found that as I've been showing you that the very molding and I'm trying to get you to here's what I'm trying to do in case you're wanting where is this going I'm trying to get you to show I'm trying to get you to understand that your being here here in America in Revelation 13 at this time under a message is a very amazing thing and it is something that God has been controlling and controlling and controlling you are at the end of a long daisy chain of controls that God has been implementing globally he kept this world unexplored and and undiscovered why because the last age would need a vast clean undisturbed land for this message and he put you here he didn't put you you weren't born in Europe you're born here you're an American you're you're in the North American continent in the United States of America you're in the land of rebel 13 you're in the land that a prophet was sent to you are the people that God foresaw 2,000 years before this nation even died here now if that's true and I'm showing it to you in the Bible and by prophecy in my history then what doesn't that inform your thinking it informs my thinking it starts telling me my goodness none of this was an accident I'm here as a purpose of God because remember my whole sermon is there's got to be a voice at the end time and I showed you couple weeks ago it's not just a voice of your lips it's a voice of your life that the world in its madness can't find right from wrong can't discern it can't discovered they've already lost the ability there's a plague say Oh Corona Corona is a toothache compared to this plague there's a plague infecting men's mind that he can't comprehend the the condition he's in the proof of that you want proof you only need to read the prophecy concerning lair to see that that when they're actually poor and miserable and naked they say I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing because there's a there's a global humanity wide blindness that has set down upon them and largely because that God says in the last days that people who resist the word and they did they resisted Wesley they re in there in his age they resisted Azusa Street revival in their age they resisted in lights of the Prophet and God says every time you resist my messenger I'm going to send a strong delusion upon you and it will blind you and you'll believe a lie and be damned by it and it won't be God doing it to be doing it to yourself yeah and so God then if you can see that you're here it's almost poetic it's it's so choreographed it's like a ballet it's it something of beauty that this thing has been with such timing and perfect synchronous harmony with history and politics and God raised up dictators to perform his will and you can even he was describing what they would do before they were born and they were born and rose up and did just what he said come on friends this isn't an accidental you're not an accidental believer you're not just here persuaded by we got good preaching or better doctrine it's nothing to do with that there's a person among us and it's Christ the word and I am infected with Jesus Christ and what is it done it is open my eyes and remove the blindness from me so I see clearly what is around me I'm not wondering Oh God thank God I'm not groping in darkness Satan always pushing at our minds oh I I always never never fails every generation of young people that raised up what we've had think we're working on our sixth or seventh generation by this point every generation of young people that raises up I see some come in and believe and be strong and some drift away and go into chaos breaks my heart every time I woke up at 3:00 in the morning praying for some of our teenagers let me tell you something teenagers this is the hour Satan is so determined you just don't know how determined he is to wreck your testimony because there's a voice in the last day once again the earth will hear from direct from God through you and Satan is trying to stop that don't let him don't let him stand and be a voice for Almighty God we're going home soon from the molding of its native carrot carrot culture shaping their very characteristics down through millennia adding just enough of it and a prophet to the final age who would come to the final land it be a nation what would it be it would be a nation that would be privileged to hear the final revelation of Jesus Christ to the world first be the first ones to hear it in your native tongue people disregard it and trivialize it saying in the Senate school class today hardly ever listen to a tape ever and yet you were granted the privilege to hear it first in your native tongue and even and and and then the only country in the world that can definitively understand Kentucky English the rest of the world depends on you for that even when they go and learn English they still have to ask us about some Kentucky words brother Bonnie don't worry brother I mean by that okay sit down it's gonna take a little bit I got to explain why you need to know the history the only nation with enough financial resources and global influence to propagate it around the world this world jumps up and down because they think they're so smart we've accomplished so much we got the greatest military we got the greatest economy I got the greatest government got the greatest you got nothing but what God gave you for this message and and and when this message and its believers are gone you're gonna see that you really ain't got much you're gonna find out when you're laying under atomic destruction you think that's easy for me to say I love this country I love this nation I talk about not being an American that's I'm only talking about I'm not identified with the culture I love my country very patriotic breaks my heart to see the calamities that are going on I I know I know I realized that of George Washington and an Abraham Lincoln in every county wouldn't turn it around that boy I'd sure love to see that I'd love to live in a land where I could just go see George and Abraham and sit down and talk to him you know what they would you know what they would tell you if you did they tell you what I'm preaching to you and say listen man we got a message you don't have to worry we got a way out of this we got a way through it and out of it this is the nation that would produce the shock to carry the word long safely while it was developing that the Pentecostal revival that didn't fall in England or Europe or Asia or the islands it fell here and it didn't even fall on the East Coast it fell as far west and you can go before you go back east it became the cradle this nation became the cradle of the restored mystery that Paul's age fell back from failing to see it fully manifested the third pole landed here one of the most epic consequential something God waited 2,000 years to bring back to the earth the third pole operated in Jesus ministry it operated in the early church you know why you know the son of man minister say well we got a prophet son Aaron ministry they had a son of man ministry because the son of man ministry means the Word made flesh the office of son of man is a prophet the ministry of son of man is a broader term that's all of us I'm not the office of son of man I'm not a prophet but I have the Ministry of the son of man you understand at 4:18 p.m. on July the 20th 1969 you remember that date with Charles I hear brother Charles in here yeah I hear I hear somebody 4:18 p.m. July 20 1969 Neil Armstrong's voice cracked from the speakers at NASA's Mission Control and he said simply the eagle has landed it's a great monumental moment for us great swelling national pride it was a fine announcement but it was more than half a decade late the eagle had already landed and he didn't land on the moon he landed on the earth Jehovah Eagle a half a decade prior to brother Neil jehovah eagle had already entered dropped into Earth's atmosphere over arizona and lifts a prophet up off the ground into that and says now go back east for the opening of the seven seals people can believe what they want about that it happened it didn't happen whatever I don't care I I could not possibly care less than I already don't that makes any sense I believe it happened it's changed my life it's changed people I preached to so you've come too late to tell me that was this it was that it was a rocket rocket formed a really a rocket over the Arizona desert form the cloud that when you turn it it looks like the perfect profile image of Jesus Christ really I'm sorry you got more faith than I got I don't believe a rocket can do that let me take some friends there is nothing about this message accidental or incidental it is all Purpose Driven and it is all vitally important this is what God has done in this age to Ireland to us as a people what are we doing with it what does it mean to you to see you know a javo eagle arriving with a sonic a literal physical sonic shockwave that shook the whole countryside so powerful a prophet thought he would would be the end of his life jump 10 feet off the ground people heard it for miles Jehovah Eagle today truly the Eagle didn't land on the moon brother branham said what are they gonna find on the moon nothing said that years for they went and found nothing bunch of rocks and he told him he said I don't care about the moon he said I want to pass the Moose fast the Milky Way oh my friends Jehovah eagle has landed and a bride for the final sweep to the potty change that's what you're a part of that's what are part of that's what we're preaching that's what we believe to see how this nation I got a hurry at six minutes was blessed with every virtue and resource that the nations of the earth were lacking desperately needing the door then is open under the sixth age but there there had to be a continuation it couldn't just be as I said in the beginning it couldn't just be a door that opened and that was going to be it it was going to continue to the full power then the full revelation had to be realized the door now watch this now there had to be a prophet to bring this message amen but there had to be a people to express it because it came I think I could end right here today send you home with this it came to be expressed it didn't come to fill us with knowledge it came to get behind skin it didn't come to just stay on a tape it came to come off a tape in the ears down in a soul out through flesh out through testimony hallelujah it came to be expressed in people it came to live behind flesh some day this book will be closed for the last time and when that happens the word will be flesh again and that's why it came in that's why we had a nation and that's why we had a culture that's why we had a prophet that's why you're here you're a believer you're the one who God said propagate this around the world live this here and understand the Kentucky whose rise up tell the whole world about it and we do and we are hallelujah we're trying to tell them on every platform we can I can't worry about coronavirus I can't worry about governments I can't worry about lockdowns I can't worry about doubters and unbelievers and rejecters and defectors and people who want to do whatever they want to do I don't care I don't have time time is too short it's a precious commodity we gotta we gotta we gotta take the last bit of time we got and be an expression of this word stand to be an expression of this word is not only I want to say this now real listen close to be an expression of this endtime word it's not only vital but by comparison it's all that matters now I say I qualify it by saying by comparison because hey we got to live we got to work jobs pay bills buy food raise families we take vacations we live a life we do live here you understand I've not got out yet not trying to get out I'm trying to finish my job so I get that we have life life's happening but while I'm here I need to understand that the first and foremost thing of importance in our lives is to express it to make everything God has done up to now should I say worth it no it's already worth it but to to make it complete the whole thing all along listen listen all along God has had it in mind that this would be a family affair Jesus came and did what only he could do that's why he doesn't need you to do it the disciples Peter said you know we'll do this in you know no man takes my life I lay it down I pick it back up Jesus came and did the only thing he would ever need to do alone he died alone he raised alone he ascended alone but when he came back to the church into the Upper Room he would never be alone again and he would never make a move alone again he would need you just like he needed pull just like he needed James just like he needed Peter just like he needed John Bartholomew Thomas il-10 the cave Thomas was martyred in in india's in india they were hunting and they couldn't catch him he the reason they were trying to kill him is because he wouldn't stop doing miracles and he was converting them by the thousands because he was doing impossible miracles breaking all laws of science and physics right in front of their eyes they couldn't deny his message and so they decided to send assassins and I I stood by the cliff and put my hand in the places where assassins scaled because they couldn't get to him any other way they had to scale up a mountain and come in and sneak in behind him and he was down praying when they ran him through with the Lance from behind and he died on his knees Jesus told him that would happen men will hate you and kill you thinking they're doing me a favor God used those men and when they were gone he used the church and when that age was done he just raised up another one and when that one was done he raised up another one and another and another and another and another and we come to now and you're the other other you're the remaining other you have a great family tree that's why I can say I'm not an American I'm a Christian I'm not a politic I'm a believer I'm not a race I'm a son of God I don't care what's happening in the world this world is not my home I'm just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue I'm just trying to tell everybody about somebody who can help anybody [Music] once you bow your heads with me just before brother Anthony starts to sing with us won't you bow your heads and just let me pray for you a moment Wow Lord you saw our faithful you know the prayers I've prayed in my secret chamber last
