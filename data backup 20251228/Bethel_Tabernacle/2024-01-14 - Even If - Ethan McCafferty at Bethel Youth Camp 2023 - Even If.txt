I want to give a quick testimony before I sing the song So for the past 5 years I have been battling on and off with depression and uh anxiety and uh one particular day I was having a very bad day uh came home from school and was just in a really really bad mood and uh I uh went downstairs to our basement and I was just uh blowing off some steam and was like God I've been praying for this for five years to uh for you to deliver me from this and uh then I sang this song and uh the word say even if you don't My Hope isn't you alone so I sang that song and uh halfway through the song I started balling because I realized um even if God doesn't take this away from me it doesn't matter cuz he's all I got and he's all I need so uh I just ask you to uh enter in and worship with me as I sing this they say something sometimes you win some sometimes you lose some but right now right now I'm losing B I've stood on this stage night after night minding broken it'll be all right right now oh right now I just can't to sing there's nothing to bring me down and what will I say when I'm Hil to the flame like I am right now I know you're able I know you can save through the fire with your Mighty hand even if you don't My Hope Is you alone [Music] oh see it only takes a little faith to move the [Music] mountain good thing little face is all I have right now God when you choose to leave mountains and mo [Music] give me the strength to being able to sing it Is Well with My Soul and I know you're able I know you can save through the fire with your Mighty hand even if you don't my hope is you alone I know the sorrow I know the hurts would all go away if you just say the word even if you don't My Hope Is You Al you been faithful You' been good all my days Jesus I will cling to you come with me cuz I know you're able and I know you [Music] can I know you're able I know you can stve through the fire your Mighty hand even if you don't I hope is you alone I know this St I know the will all go away you just say the word even if you don't My Hope Is youone My Hope Is you are [Music] Lord it is where with My Soul It is Well it Is Well with My [Applause] [Music] Soul
