lord we were enemies lord we were at variance with you our our hearts were darkened by sin full of evil lord but the blood of christ was shed for us that we might be made one with you again lord be [Music] be in a position to be your sons and daughters living expressions lord of you glorifying you with our lives lord once we fell short of that glory of that image it was broken lord but jesus christ came to restore that broken image that broken glory that we might be radiating manifestations of the glory of god thank you lord thank you lord that's where our value comes from that's where our confidence comes from that's where our joy comes from lord not our circumstances not what we're going through not the troubles that we face the trials that we're going through but it comes from knowing you and knowing what you said about us lord may we value you and your word above all else lord we ask for your holy spirit to come and to speak lord i need you there's there's some points here that i feel inadequate and hardly know how to express exactly i ask that your holy spirit would come and express what you're trying to express to your people that you would be glorified that your word would be magnified to our hearts lord and that we would be walking in unity with your heart father we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen god bless you all you can stay standing for a few moments i'm going to continue on my topic it says part two i forgot to update that it's part three beautiful branch of the last days and we're going to read the scripture isaiah 4 1-2 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so there's such a contrast in this verse and there's such a contrast in the day that we're living between the true godly woman who god describes as beautiful and the woman that the world describes as beautiful and i think this this these verses speak of that seven women taking hold that picture of taking hold of a man uh saying we'll do what we want to do we'll live how we want to live we don't have to submit to you we have to listen to you only let us be called by your name to take away our reproach i think we're living in the hour of what is called so-called feminism and the rise of feminism over the last 150 years and where it seems to me we're at it's pinnacle now in this spirit of feminism the really the reality is it's not about women's rights it's not about women being equal we've if you're a bible believer you've known for 2000 years that a woman is equal in value to a man jesus came and demonstrated that paul spoke of that reaffirmed that clearly and so this is not news to a christian they wanna the feminist movement wants you to think they're attacking christian values they've made up some strange a false dichotomy and spoken about history as though it's one tale after the other of christians misusing and abusing women and that's not true that's not a fact that's not what happened but it's been presented that way and it's a great disservice to the world and especially to women the the rights we talked about this before and i don't want to re go over the whole thing all over again but the rights of women are not the concern of feminism the concern of feminism is tearing down now that's what every feminist would tell you they are the rights of women and equality that's not what it's about it's about tearing down biblical standards in in many levels let's look at our next scripture this is one of them um keeps bouncing back the woman deuteronomy 22 5 the woman shall not wear that which pertains unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are abomination unto the lord thy god we've taken this verse and we've seen only the garment portion but you have to re realize there's a spirit behind that brother branham talks about that he gave a woman a feminine or as he said a feminist spirit and he gave a man a masculine spirit so he made us to be different made us to have different roles different functions different purposes he made men with certain strengths and he made women with certain weaknesses and he men made men with certain weaknesses and women with certain strengths we're in equal in certain areas our value is equal that's what the scripture declares us our value in the sight of god and should be in the sight of all believers is equal but but as far as our attributes they're inequal they're not the same they're different that's scientifically proven and scripturally backed up completely and we'll talk about that more god wants a man to dress and act like a man he wants a woman to dress and act like a woman it's not just dressing you can dress like a woman and act like a man it's the whole picture that god wants to see the attributes god wants to see true womanhood is a beautiful reflection of the bride of christ true manhood is a beautiful reflection of jesus christ these things need to be balanced okay that's that's many of our problems is this is spoken a person in the world hears one thing right a person who is perhaps a man who's a chauvinist is like go get them jason i'm not going and getting them there's balance god does not want does not want a woman to be domineering or bossy right he does not want a woman also to be fearful and weak willed so timid you know the picture of a a southern belle is so timid that they couldn't even let the sun shine on their skin be so afraid of it god doesn't want a woman to be afraid he doesn't want her to be bossy balance he wants a woman to be balanced as a feminine spirit he also doesn't want a man to be power hungry verb verbally abusive drunk with his own authority because of his physical strength doesn't want a man to be that way he also doesn't want a man to be disconnected checked out uninvolved or the other reverse of that is to become effeminate and then sees authority by being effeminate because it's okay to be a bossy woman in culture today so if you're a bossy effeminate man no problem but if you're a man that takes authority respects people loves people wants to achieve the best for every person that's not something that people in this world want or appreciate a woman that says i enjoy submitting to my loving husband is not something the world wants it views it as weak it isn't weak it takes a lot of strength takes a lot of strength for a woman to say i will submit to what my husband wants my husband wants this i have i will submit to the vision now it doesn't mean you don't talk to each other doesn't mean there isn't a back and forth connection that takes place i'm talking about a vision that god gives to a husband to lead in a certain direction in the life right that's what we're talking about headship headship is christ leading a family through the husband and the husband and wife together communicating about what's happening leadership isn't just doing what you want to do and let everybody else figure it out leadership is communicating a vision of what god is leading you to do and then the will of the family because the holy spirit is leading you and not you leading you of course a woman wouldn't have to listen to a man that's telling her to do something that's unscriptural she wouldn't have to submit to that whereas a woman is to submit as unto the lord so if the devil is saying something you don't have to listen to the devil you don't have to submit to the devil but if god is leading by the spirit that's where a woman is submitting to because she if she has the holy spirit she can see the holy spirit is leading us both in this direction i believe god leads both a man and a woman a husband and a wife it isn't just god leads the man and the woman just lays there as a dead carcass and he drags her along she has a heart that god is dealing with and working with and changing and transforming there's a balance in all of it if a husband says i would like to see us more in line with the word of god in this or this or this a true godly wife will take it as a correction and say thank you you're protecting me not say i have my own i have my own walk with the lord i don't have to listen to you that's not scripture that's not right together husband it's not you beating your wife across the head i have a i have a dear friend he's come to the message i'm saying verbally beating across that obviously not with your hand you're not even a man if you do that but i have a dear friend he's come to the message recently his whole family is not yet embraced the message so what should i do then should i verbally abuse my wife until she follows the message no should i force her to do that brother branham says you have a right to divorce her if she cuts her hair it's a right okay but we surrender all of our rights to the leadership of the holy spirit okay and so the brother i feel like is a great example because he's not manipulative he's not controlling even if his wife says things that he doesn't like about the message he doesn't fly off the handle he remains calm he lives the message he talks to his family about the message he won't he's not stopping talking because they don't like what's being said but they know that for him the word of god comes first and they find a balance in that even though his wife doesn't yet believe the message would it be better if he just flew off the handle forced her hand and then the marriage was broken i think some people sometimes think that but i don't believe the heart of christ is that while we were yet sinners christ died for his bride while we were filthy rotten evil people christ died for us still and he forgave and he forgave and he forgave and he had patience and so i think that's an expression of leadership the leadership of christ is forgiveness and patience and that's what we men have to have and that's what you sisters have to have that's what a relationship there's patience there's forgiveness that takes place uh in satan's eden brother branham makes this statement that's what satan does he perverts the nations he perverts the nations so the culture the cultures of the world he perverts he perverts the church he perverts the people he's a deceiver a perverter of the original truth god made a man a man he made a woman a woman and he dressed them different and he meant for them to stay that way and to act that way one is feminish and the other is masculine brother bran um i had this question overseas asked me why is brother branham always harping on women and of course historically christians followed the bible but when it came to the 20th century out of world war one women started deviating from biblical standards because men said it was men preached that it was fine it was okay so the deviation happened in the 1920s and this is what carried forward so of course a prophet would have to come and correct it but previously they were following all of these things all of these things that we are teaching was just common you bear you didn't even have to teach it it was just just just the norm now it's not the norm so now a prophet has to rise up and come against it but as i'm looking and reviewing and studying i'm seeing what brother branham's talking about in the 1950s and 60s it was basically nothing compared to what it is today and why did he spend so much time over and over again speaking what he did about women i believe that the holy spirit knew what was going to happen in the future and was using him to bring correction to it it it's it just stuns me over and over again as i see it so as i said before men and women are equal but they're not the same men and women are literally different at the cellular level every cell of a woman's body is is marked female every cell cell of a man's body is marked male 1 matt we talked about that before the weaker vessel men have denser bones larger hands greater muscle mass men tend to be more aggressive and as a result have a greater tendency to be attracted to conflict competition and as such leadership women tend to be attracted to nurturing and relationship building men tend to in their think way they think compartmentalize everything everything's separate and in a different box and they don't touch each other women just connect everything remember remember god made male and female in his own image so both of these are reflect a reflection of who god is right it's not better worse it's just different he made a man different from a woman both of them express something in the heart of god and when those things are out of balance and and are being handled unscripturally it's not expressing who god is it's what is sin falling short of the glory of god it's not expressing who god is god's law right is an expression of his nature so when we violate god's law we violate god's nature and that's why he says we've all sinned and come short of the glory of god we're to express the glory of god and when we sin we fall short of expressing the visible manifestation of the of who god is and so we're wired differently men are wired in such a way to lead women are wired to nurture or you could say within that influence right okay so first corinthians 6 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind isn't that strange that paul puts in there a man that would act feminine as someone who will not inherit the kingdom of god we tend to think well well that man just today's culture we see someone act effeminate we say he's a homosexual right that's directly connected but if you look at the rest of this verse paul separates those homosexual and effeminate so a man that would act like a woman would have soft gestures like a woman it even speaks of the word effeminate there speaks of being soft right and so god wants a man brother branham even uses the word he made a man burly not burly williams i'm not talking about him he did make brother burly absolutely but he made a man to be burly he didn't make him to be like a woman and he says here that that would a man acting like a woman would disqualify him from inheriting the kingdom of god woe all right so our culture is feminized strongly feminized the portrait that we have in society is that men are self-centered dopes led by wise powerful and bossy women this is the general picture that you'll see in portrayed in sitcoms and movies and so forth i mean i know it's not everything we still have jack bauer and all these manly guys that are tough portrayed on tv too but in general when you see in relation to a woman you see a man as a self-centered dope that doesn't lead then we the next thing we have there is that video games video games are being used by the devil to deaden manliness to turn boys into perpetual boys and it's not something that god is pleased with for a man to be a boy i remember one time amy and i were went to a restaurant kind of in a vacation city up in minnesota and we were looking around and we saw i see all kinds of teenage girls but there's not a single teenage boy anywhere following around those girls or anywhere near him and i'm looking everywhere where's the teenage boys there's no teenage boys it's all girls what's going on here where are they they're playing video games they don't come out of their house anymore they don't care for anything but that it's it's an addiction to the point where it's total control over the lives of young young men and it's destructive i'm not saying you can't play a video game here and there as long as it's not an ungodly murderous wicked thing what i'm saying is addiction that leaves a boy a boy into his 30s you know i heard somebody mention oh the women the sisters here can't find any husbands because they're all still boys they they work into their 30s now waiting for those boys to become men because they're so addicted to video games what a sad state that's from a message church what a sad state i'm just warning you about video games don't let them become an addiction if they become an addiction burn them with fire and get them away get your especially get your boys away from those video games they're not going to make you a man son we're gonna make you a perpetual boy so women work and lead the family well the man works too but he remains disconnected unaware the quintessential american man he runs from his wife mo's the lawn runs from his wife goes to the store run runs from his wife drinks the drinks a beer runs from his wife so he can get away from her and be disconnected have his own stuff going on his fishing his hunting his video games his sports with his beer in his hand i s i some somewhere along the lines i think i had a family somewhere but who cares let me have another beer that's the picture that we find that disconnected man or the other picture you find is an effeminate man acts like a woman dresses like a woman sounds like a woman this is what the world wants a man to look like that's what they want to make normal and what's the normal woman portrayed in is she runs the family she works she cooks she cleans she does everything and she takes the leadership role because why the man has abdicated it not what god wants it's not god's picture it's not him and you say well we're message believers we won't do the same thing that's nonsense you think you're impervious to the work of the devil you think you're impervious to the influence of the a church where i mean where how many years after brother branham went off the scene churches will always slowly move away from following the word of god being on fire for god say well we're message believers it could never happen no you're wrong all of this stuff is influencing us in the message and unless we get on fire for the word and on fire for the power of god again the result is going to be a bunch of lukewarm dead churches with dead families with women who have taken the leadership role because the man has abdicated it the woman will always take the leadership role why she's not going to let her family be destroyed so she'll kick her husband in the rear end out of the house and run run the family men be men stop being boys provide for your family be tough be strong stand for the word of god in your home that's what god wants that's what he desires for each of us the identification that we have of masculinity in our culture is all of it is toxic so what is the result time to check out i can't even i can't do anything right i can't be right as a man so i'll check out either that or i'll become more like a woman than i can be a then i can be a bossy woman now again i'm charac i'm characterizing something as ridiculous right but you have to understand that there is there is a pendulum here and we swing on the pendulum that's where things are out of balance the pendulum starts to swing and then you go out of balance again you don't come back to the balance of the scripture right here true leadership in a home and true submission in a home base scripturally the church has also been feminized this is this is the one where i need the help of the lord because there's a balance to this there's a balance to this and i'm going to try to put that forward the church has been feminized spiritual in spirituality and in worship and what i mean by spirituality is that true spirituality is portrayed in a feminine way it's very touchy feely emotion based worship okay that's fine god made them male and female both expressions but he didn't just make them female just want to remind you that he also made them male the gospel in america and from what you from what i understand worldwide is becoming more self-help centered jesus came to give me unconditional emotive love regardless of my sinfulness and it's all about a personal relationship well there's not even a single scripture that says personal relationship in the entire bible now if you're a son of god you have a relationship with god right if you're the bride you have a relationship to christ i'm not taking that away absolutely as part of it it isn't all of it jesus said follow me and what did he do he trained his disciples to sit in pews and listen to very emotive music and lift their hands and go out to the buffet afterwards and enjoy themselves no he called us to be in the midst of a war and he told us you're going to suffer you're going to have pain you're going to have trials and tribulations jesus didn't come to take away all our emotional troubles he came to bring a sword and he put the sword in our hand because he has an eternal purpose to achieve he came to redeem a world that's literally given over to evil and all the people in it all al the people in it have committed high treason against an infinitely holy god who hates sin and evil and wants it destroyed and will destroy it in a lake of fire one day but jesus came to deal with my emotional trauma he did that's an effect but the reality is that's not what he came to do he came to offer himself as a sacrifice to an infinitely holy god who wanted to destroy sin and sinners with it he didn't come so you could feel better he came so that god could feel better he came that so that god could forgive your sin which separated from you from god we feel no horror over sin anymore in america sin is just it's a little it's a mistake brother john it's just a little mistake it sin is treason against god and it's god says you're dead you should y'all should go read the sermon sinners in the hands of an angry god one time by jonathan edwards you'll have a different viewpoint of the cross and of christ now part of that part of what christ did was he came to heal brokenness absolutely but don't take that and make that the only thing we talk about and preach about we also have the aspect that god is infinitely holy and he hates and is angered about sin every sin he hates it even the sin that you do now that i do now he hates it and he had to torture and kill his son he came in that son and went and received torturing and killing and and he was brutalized so that you could receive forgiveness it's not all about you it's about what god did to redeem a world that's broken and destroyed by sin and must be burned with fire god loves you he does he also hates sin and we don't we don't lose track of that don't be so influenced by laodicea that you just call it's a mistake it's a sin against god view it the right way it's high treason and what is treason punishable in america by death what does god say treason against him is punishable by death don't get it wrong don't look at it wrong that's uncomfortable to talk about it's uncomfortable to say but it's the truth your preacher is not sent to make you feel happy your preacher is sent to put you in right relationship with an infinitely holy god that sent his son to be tortured and murdered so that your sins could be forgiven and as a result of receiving that holy spirit he heals us he touches our heart he changes our heart he puts us in a personal walk of fellowship with him of leadership by him and guess what he also brings lots of brother matt preached on i think was that last weekend or the weekend before he preached on wednesday wednesday it was awesome one day and a half ago i've been gone for a week sometime matt preached on it and it was amazing god sends us trials he doesn't come to take away all trouble all pain all hurt sometimes he sends us trials pain and hurt to do what to grow us to cause us to grow in him it's not to hurt us it's to grow us right because it's not to hurt us because jesus died on a cross so that you when god looked at you he didn't see you in your sin and the evil that's in your life but instead he looks at jesus christ and says perfectly righteous perfectly holy forgiven not just forgiven just justified as just as if you've never sinned in the first place but don't get so full of yourself to think you didn't sin because you did be humble understand you did sin you are sinning and you're gonna continue doing so until you have a new body that should keep us humble okay so back to the back to the trying to give a big picture let's come back to this the gospel is not self-help that shouldn't be the focus of our preaching if that's the focus of our preaching it's not balanced self-help it's not even self-help it's god coming in your brokenness to heal you all right but that's not the whole reason he came that's a fruit of the very reason that he came is to restore a people elected people and a world back to perfect condition again now we have hurt now we have pain and god puts bits in that pain bits in the mouth of that pain that struggle that trial that tribulation in order to perfect you in order to cleanse you and clean you it's not so that something's wrong if you're suffering something's wrong if you're not suffering because god he pro jesus said in this world you'll have trouble we can say amen to all the rest of the word of god but we don't want to say amen to that in this world you have trouble but be of good cheer i have overcome the world trouble hurts trouble is painful trouble is not fun but god uses that to make us more like jesus it's not all about a feeling it's not all about emotions that is part of it that goes along with it but that isn't it that's that's the balance american and christianity around the world church around the world it's all about the feeling that's produced on sunday the performance that takes place the emotionalized relationship between christ and the believer the touchy feely aspect is there an aspect to that i mean i think we can read song of solomon and i think we can read different scriptures and in the psalms and so forth where we see there is there's deep emotion between a believer and christ absolutely that's not what it's all about that's not the center of everything that's not the focus of of everything but in america that has become the main focus the drawing factor and you hear the praise and worship songs not all of them but many so focused on that touchy feely aspect of things that it might speak to a woman's heart that's fine and that's good that's good we need god to speak to a woman's heart but if that's all that we're getting it's not speaking really to a man's heart uh i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna stop there i don't want to go out of balance david merrell an author says in today's church the gospel is no longer about saving the world against impossible odds it's about finding a happy relationship with a wonderful man that's the picture that's being painted i believe in in christianity today let me see here what happened all right let's let's continue let's just i want to bring that thought to a close before i move on talk about biblical note and womanhood in more detail it's important the church has become feminized and what i'm saying is that it's taken one aspect of who god is and so emphasize that and push that to the forefront that it's it's literally causing irreparable damage to the church now to the bride it might it might it's coming against the bride but the true bride is going to receive the correction of the lord and come back into the right balance like i said before you won't find anywhere in scripture the word personal relationship brother branham mentions it but you know what brother branham mentions mostly fellowship fellowship with god he doesn't go that direction of personal relationship touchy feely he goes to there's a fellowship which produces a relationship it's his leadership his direction but brother branham's favorite way of talking about our connection to god is fellowship that's what god made us for is for fellowship and worship but again that's broken we have to understand it's broken god didn't make you for fellowship and leave you in a sinful wicked state that's not what he wants that's not what he's looking for god let's put it this way we we hear this god will accept you just as you are actually he won't he never would he never would accept you just as you are that otherwise jesus we didn't need jesus as you are you're a sinner and you're separated from god that's as you are he doesn't accept you as you are what does he do he makes a way so that he can accept you jesus had to be tortured on a cross executed in the most shameful painful way that man has ever devised satan has ever devised for a man to die in order that he could accept you get it right well he just accepts me as whereas where i am because because of the blood of jesus christ if you just say he accepts me as i am you're wrong he accepts me as i am because there's a sacrifice because there's an infinitely holy god that couldn't accept me that's why jesus came stopped with the self-help garbage let's get our stop being baptized in self-help of american americanized christianity that's spread through the whole world jesus loves you god loved you so much he loved you so much because you're elect he doesn't love everybody what no he doesn't love everybody can you find can you find a scripture that says god loves everyone jacob have i love but esau have i disliked no hated he hates sin and well he hate the sin and love the sinner god hates the sin and hates the sinner and will destroy them both both their sin and them okay we have all these phrases all these americanized phrases that have become scripture and they're not scripture god so loved the world jason he said god so loved the world who's the world who did he die for the whole world which whole world if you love the whole world then and put the blood on the whole world then the whole world is going to be saved who's the world that he's talking about the elect what did what did what did they what did he say he came to do what save his people from their sins his people his elect so what is the world that we're talking about god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son it's his elect he said he hated jacob or he hated esau that's a type of the those who are not chosen by god again i i'm i'm maybe i'm being shocking to you a little a little bit but the reality is we've got our minds have to be cleansed by the holy spirit and renewed by god god wants us to love everyone and in a sense also god loves everyone in what sense not in a redemptive sense but he loves them in the sense that he provides for their needs he makes the sun rise on the just and the unjust he wants us to do the same thing he wants to us to love our enemies to take care of our enemies to pray for our enemies and those who persecute us but god is different than us did you know that god's different than you god isn't exactly like us he's on a different level he commands us to love everyone but the fact is we read in scripture that god hates i'm really uncomfortable now it's getting hot in here let's be okay with the word of god let's be okay with what god said let's get rid of our own thinking and our own way of looking at things and let's stop being influenced by memeology the theology of memes we love the lord right we want to follow his word right we don't want to be in conformity to the way the world or american christianity is preaching to us be careful you know that god gave you a brain and he wants you to use it what am i saying is i'm saying there's disc you need to have discernment biblical discernment you need to be able to sister teenage girl teenage boy mean to be able to look at something on the internet i'm giving you a grand revelation right now just wait for it the holy spirit is moving he is he is moving not trying to tell a joke [Applause] but we identify the holy spirit moving with some emotion the word of god is be coming forward the holy spirit's working get out of get out of your emotions feelings etc god gives emotions the word produces emotions but that's not what it's all about the the word of god has to be our final authority we have to stand on that we can't stand on our emotions god is not going to call you in in in before the white throne and say did you follow your emotions but american the the world acts like that's what's going to happen did you follow your dreams what brother jason was talking about on wednesday make sure your dreams are put aside we're following christ that's that's me if you want to follow your dreams follow them i want to follow christ i want to be led by him i want to be found on that day say you you put your you laid your emotions aside you laid what you felt about things aside and you took my word and you lived it that's what i want that's what i want to hear look at the look at the whole bible again i'm not attacking i'm not trying to attack the way our sisters look at things what i am trying to do is let's come back to a balance women would look at things more emotionally god made you that way he also but he'd make you to follow that above the word of god he made you that way to help your man understand things better your husband understand things better right because we don't unders we don't see the connectedness we don't see necessarily the emotional side so he gives us a wife to help us understand but we're not supposed to put emotion above the bible feeling above the bible and that's the danger that's the that's what i'm saying is there emotion yep is there is there pain is there hurt is there struggles is there emotional highs and lows yeah we're not supposed to live on any of them and we're not supposed to find our value as individuals based on them again we have to bring this thing into balance he made them male and female god made them male and female in the beginning he didn't make them only male i didn't make them only female i think the church today wants it to be only female that's not how god made us that's not how he works genesis 2 24 therefore shall a man now this is before the fall okay this is before sin this is before heartache it's before any any of that therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this is god's original purpose and remember i think we mentioned this before what was eve's name before the fall her name was adam she had one the same name as her husband she didn't have a different name they were to be one they were identified in one this was god's purpose from the very beginning this is god's heart from the very beginning man eve his parents it's not a bad thing needs to leave their influence their direction their control and to cleave to his wife so that they can be one all right that's before the fall god made adam first and then eve that's paul's argument for the headship of man he made adam first and then eve all right so god's purpose from the beginning before the fall was the headship of man and submission of woman it's not a post fall thing i want you to look at this next verse genesis 3 16 now the here is after the fall and here comes the punishment unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee okay so what what is how can that be god's curse if if he made a man to be the head of the woman from the beginning okay seems strange but i want you to understand this word rule there is different it's not what you think it is it speaks of ruling with harshness ruling with rigor in other words what you see from the point of the fall this is the curse man what was the curse of that god put upon man thorns and thistles he disobeyed in his headship of all creation and therefore received the all of creation was made subject to vanity subject to decay all right so that was man's curse woman's curse was your desire shall be to your husband he'll rule over you so i said that before a man gets thorns and thistles and a woman gets a husband well a husband that rules with rigor and harshness if you look at the history of the world that's that's absolutely the case jesus came to bring redemption to change to change things to turn things around and paul said in christ there's neither male or female jesus demonstrated the the value and the worth of women in his personal ministry he didn't relegate them to have their word and their testimony is meaningless he didn't put them in that level he gave them an equality that scarcely the world does today in fact they don't and so when we look at this what is what is the curse that her desire her desire went away from her husband to the serpent producing the serpent seed so so there's that aspect in other words now that the curse has come now that sin is here you being the weaker vessel are going to be completely reliant on this man to protect you now the whole world has not been as it is in america as it is now things are vastly different what am i meaning at one point in time all you were trying to do was survive you were trying to find food raise food and live much more reliant on the strength of a man now in our society today it's almost to the other than in sports it's almost meaningless unfortunately but because of the fall and because of the sin her desire will be her husband she needs to look to her husband for safety protection and as a res and then in turn he's going to rule over her with rigor now the apostle paul in let me get there colossians 3 18. i'm going to skip around because i'm going to try to close shortly wives submit yourselves and your own husbands as it is fit in the lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them this is speaking of harshness so ruling with do not embitter against them so husbands are to love their wives and not embitter them in other in other words not to rule with rigor over them so this is really the antidote this is a redemption this is the proper picture now of christ and the church not ruling with rigor but with self-sacrifice with love i'm not talking about emotional love i'm talking about putting someone else's needs above your own the way jesus and the apostles speak about love not love as an emotion but love as an act an action word that's what love is husbands love not the emotive type of love yes that's there that comes that's a part of it right it should be but that's not what this love is talking about it's a self-sacrificing giving love that looks to the good and the need of others and goes and meets it regardless of whether it's asked for or not right and then it says be not harsh don't rule them with rigor lead with love self-sacrificing love musicians if you'd come ephesians 5. wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord now look your submission to your husband is showing that you're doing it as unto the lord your submission to your husband isn't because he's worthy or valuable or needs to have it your submission to your husband is because the lord is commanding it that's part of your obedience to christ part of my obedience to christ as a our obedience as husbands is to lead with self-sacrificing love for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body you're supposed to you're you're called you're charged by god to love your wife as your own body no man never hated his own body but nourishes and cherishes it so does christ the church that is what we as men that's that's the kind of love we're to have to our wives always having her best interest in heart now not her emotional need but the looking at the eternal need more than anything else right not just not just being ruled around by the emotions that your wife is feeling we're to be led by christ right and sometimes your wife all of us sometimes our emotions are true sometimes our emotions are false we have to help each other in those things so that all of our actions and acts are according to scripture that's love love is not being carried about the nose by every emotion every feeling everything that happens that's not love love is corrective love is kind love is patient love has tenderness so there there is a submission and there's a leadership man you can't abdicate the leadership of your family if you do i promise you your wife will take it and then you'll complain against her for being being bossy get off the couch get off your lazy rear end and lead your family god wants you to be active to be doing something that's why i said love is an action and i'm convicting myself i'm pointing out at you and there's five fingers pointing back at me four fingers i should say i don't have six figures god love god loves us god cares for us he sometimes he expresses that love by giving us hard spankings and we have to be thankful for that kind of love otherwise if we didn't have that kind of love we'd be considered bastards in other words we're not children of god somebody else's child and so we want to be in a position where we can take correction and we can appreciate it that's the zeal of the laodicean the true believers of the laodicean age their zeal is they what they repent be zealous therefore and repent this is an onslaught that we're facing right now this spirit of this age an onslaught of feminization that's taking place and we have to be careful we have to be wise we have to be discerning again as i spoke we it's about balance we don't want to take it and swing the pendulum and say well because the world is feminizing the gospel we're just going to masculinate it and that's that's all we're going to have that's what the devil would have us do swing the pendulum all the way back here no it's in the middle we have to be balanced we have to be wise and discerning amen let's stand up heavenly father we come to you in the name of jesus christ and we're so thankful for your goodness and your mercy we're so thankful for the light lord that you give to us and that you shine to us lord
