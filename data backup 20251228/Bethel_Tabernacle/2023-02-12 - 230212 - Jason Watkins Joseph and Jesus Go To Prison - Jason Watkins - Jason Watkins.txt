bad to forget in amen and my Ministry team the brothers who are here today could just step forward sister back why don't you come on up and receive this and pray with us amen she says um could like to ask prayer this is for Ray Reddington a pray over a prayer cloth that I can send he's a close family member that has to have a heart ablation again many health issues and most of all needs the Lord Jesus amen I think that that's always the greatest need ever amen amen but you know what you want to realize is that same atonement the exact same performance that saves your soul heals your body salvation Salvation is just healing of the soul and so it's all the same Covenant that make your hand go on the top right Brothers father in the name of Jesus Lord receives such wonderful miraculous things come about even so recently our heart is filled with faith Lords we send forward to this prayer cloth according to the book of Acts the Lord they've taken these items from the body of Seton Hall and Lord when it was laid on the people demons fled and sick were healed the Lord and so now we're not in Saint Paul father but we are still your family with the same commission so we committed to you now let it be now when this prayer call comes to it more than he'll see his need of the Lord Jesus Christ and in doing so you'll receive Divine Healing into his body flesh all right we're going to um why you're just still seated let me read this and then we'll stand you up and get to our scripture they can go ahead and put that up brother Brad we're going to go to Genesis 39 I believe uh this is from um Brother David sister Sharon and family for all of you wonderful people at Bethel Tabernacle we are so grateful for all you did for us with the memorial service that you remember for sister Jan that was Sister Sharon's sister for all of us with the memorial service they the food was delicious and we appreciate all the hard work and expense that went into it the fellowship was so uplifting it was nice to meet new people too you're all a treasure God bless you Dave Sharon and family amen that's from them so praise the lord we want to you know continue the Lord to strengthen the family and amen through the trial of life there's many aren't there amen but the Lord gives us victory in all of them praise the Lord let's stand to our feet and turn to Genesis 39 now I'm going to read the whole chapter so I won't leave you standing we'll just catch the first maybe two verses and then we'll let you be seated but keep your Bibles open and keep it on the screen so we can finish out the chapter amen praise the Lord all right um sure enough sister Phyllis I'll catch that when I pray over the uh over the reading that's right I remember that Tom all right sister Emily we've got this one as well amen all right so I've got a kind of a quirky little title this morning and uh again I've been uh hijacked from getting my back to my series and not even going to apologize I'm just going to say blessed be the name of the Lord amen a couple of mornings ago I was sitting up in my 5 a.m chair and I opened up my daily devotional collection of readings that I read from and I never got past the first four words of the very first one because as soon as I read the first four four or five words all of a sudden this whole Sermon Just Just came like that and every day I keep adding and adding and adding and then in the fella in the back hall in the back office I was still adding so I know it's for it's helped me I know I believe it'll help you amen but we're going we're going to minister today with the Lord's help on a title Joseph and Jesus go to prison all right Joseph and Jesus go to prison Genesis 39. and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which had brought him down thither and the Lord I want you to notice how many times you're going to read these words right here and the Lord was with Joseph all right so now maybe you're getting a little angle of my title already the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian let's bow our heads father you know the request that we have before you we're praying for our families traveling we're praying for some of our ministry team away Lord dealing with family issues we're asking for strength for them Lord keep our family our traveling families safe Lord bring them back to us at your perfect appointed hour we think of uh sister Linda tester just now Lord still on this side Lord but Lord the beautiful part is that I have known her uh so long in my life and I can say today she can never die Lord she has eternal life and I thank you for that now we ask for your special Grace for her Lord during this time father you could lift her up again it wouldn't father she could carry right on we're not going to limit the god of Israel by any means but Lord we just put her in your hands Master we pray for Sally Duke Lord request coming in Lord the asking prayer for San am who's having stomach issues only seven this is this has been about for seven months and also for sister Jeannie and also for Susie Our Sister phyllis's Sister Lord we've been uh privileged to talk to her and witness to her a little bit and pray with her and so father our sister headed out to California to visit with her I pray you'll be with sister Phyllis Lord on the flight going and coming Lord may she just continue to shine a light Lord and drive out all darkness and fear we we commit these things to you now with the reading of the word Lord and the audience that's present we ask your blessing on it all in Jesus wonderful name amen God bless you you can be seated and let's continue reading verse 3 and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer of his house and all that he had he put into his hand and it came to pass from the time that he had made him Overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field and he left all that he had in Joseph's hands and he knew not what he had saved the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a goodly person and well-favored and it came to pass after these things that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master what if not what what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand there is none greater in this house than I neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee because Thou Art his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God and it came to pass as she spake to Joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her now I just want you to catch that Joseph understood what it took to overcome temptation he he wouldn't have anything to do with her he wouldn't hang out with her he wouldn't even stay around her he actually avoided her see so so overcoming is not rocket science Joseph is showing you how to overcome even before the Holy Ghost was even given see so if you keep finding yourself stumbling at the same old uh you know stepping in the same hole then hey get a different path Go a different way all right so let's carry on and it came to pass about the time um and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within and she caught him by his garments see and he was on surprised at Joseph she caught him by His Garment saying lie with me and he left his garment out of her hand and fled and got him out he literally just ran out of his let his coat go and took off see and it came to pass when she saw that he had left His Garment in her hand and was fled forth that she called unto the men of her house and spaked them saying see he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and I cried with a loud voice and it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got him out it's funny at his trial none of the nobody testified they heard screaming and she laid up His Garment by her until his Lord came home and she spake unto him according to these words saying the Hebrew servant which thou has brought unto us came in unto me to mock me and it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and cried he left his garment with me and fled out and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which he spake and him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled and Joseph's Master took him and put him into the prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in prison did you just read that and he was there where and the Lord but the Lord was with Joseph all right and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word so you know when we when we come to Joseph we are coming to kind of a conclusion thank you for Tony of God is now establishing his kingdom in the Earth Abraham Isaac and Jacob and then Joseph and you find that the whole Plan of Redemption is wrapped up in those in those men and so this is the Christ line the Christ seed line that was going to eventually lead to the Son of God sitting on the throne in the Millennium and so you know you can see how that to get to Joseph he first had to get to Abraham and he first then had to get to Isaac and then he he had to get to Jacob and he had to deal with Jacob and Jacob you know brother Brown talks about how that you really boy You Really Got to Believe In the grace of God to include Jacob and the seed line of Christ but he was not just a a fit in or a squeeze in he was a direct in the direct line you couldn't get to Joseph without going through Jacob and God doesn't try to God God didn't need to set anything aside to get to you God was able to find you it didn't matter where you were under what condition how you had been born what your family what your past what your ups and downs and failures had been that God knew you and fordained you before the foundation of the world so God then has as we've been you know if I if I was on my Series today I'd carry on you know with talking about you know how that God is continually unveiling himself and unfolding himself and even you find that if you when you see in Genesis 32 we didn't read it today but he's going to let Jacob know that you're no longer going to be called Jacob you're going to be called Israel so so what had brought that about and now this was a very important thing because Jacob was just about to reiterate the LA the promised land he had he had he had to go out of it because of his carnal Shenanigans Shenanigans he had to leave and run and he gets way off down you know with a father-in-law and gets he's he's cheating and getting cheated he's crooking people and getting crooked he's lying and being light too and so but yet he's the seed line of Christ but now he's got to come back full circle he knows he can't stay out there oh I think about that day that I knew I couldn't stay out there any longer I couldn't keep being me I had to move back into the promised land where I was always supposed to be God changed Jacob's name to Israel because Jacob had acknowledged God as the source of life and you know oh if the Lord if the Lord couldn't be his life then Jacob didn't want to go on he didn't want to cross over he didn't want to go face the music he didn't want to he said I Won't Let You Go in other words I'll die right here on this side I won't go forward I'm not going to try to to join a church I'm not going to just try to say a catechism I'm not just going to try to turn over a new Leaf I got to have a whole new life and so he's about to re-enter the promised land and the Lord had acknowledged him as his servant by changing his name and and you see as I as I was saying last Wednesday how that Jehovah you know he the Bible talks in the Genesis we read it how that God did this and God did that but then finally as he advances and now he's got a family then it switches to the Lord God and then we we see Satan coming to Eve and he he Waters it down and goes back to saying God in other words he's trying to point to an understanding of a previous hour with its limitations and he's not willing to go on and he's trying to get Eve to regress back and not go on with the message oh I'm here to tell you don't regress don't back up go forward so we find then that you know he he he he he alters and takes on new names he said that to Abraham in Genesis 17 we're not taking the time to read any of this today but he said to Abraham he said to Abram and Genesis 17 5 I'll read it here neither shall thy name be any more be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham now God had a reason for that he doesn't do things without a purpose and here's the purpose for a father of many nations have I made thee and so now now Abram has got to have a name advancement he's got to have a something else moving forward his name he's going to go forward and he's going to get acknowledged by God and God's going to give him that name before the family's ever on the Earth in fact it's not even materialized yet and he's already calling him by what God knows he's coming to I'm here to tell you something friends once Abraham got that name he was Unstoppable he was unkillable he couldn't die nothing could happen until this thing went forward I don't I know the world is falling apart and I know sin is on every hand but you've been called as the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ see we went from going to be we went from going where we were called church and now we're called bride it's the exact same thing the name change was a further development in the interaction you know the interaction between God and man and his and his Plan of Redemption and that's exactly why it's not poetic license for a prophet in this day to say I'm not going to call you church anymore I'm going to call you bride that had significance that was that was God testifying through his servant that something has advanced that this isn't any longer just in the ages that now we're coming to a a transition because we're we were never building a a wall we're building a building we're building the Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place and that and as we rise up we've got to come in harmony with the Capstone so that it can come down and invisibly unite a pride Hallelujah that's why we could never be settled with Creeds and darkness of men that's why it would never work because that stuff can't go forward it gets it gets fixed it stagnates and you can see that in history but I'm glad for a living word in this hour friends so even in the transition of Jacob and this is all relevant to get I'm going to get to Joseph in a second it's all relevant because in that in that Jacob slash Israel the the nation of Israel actually gets its name because it needs a a name to fit how God sees it Israel was going to very much act like Jacob but God was going to see them as Israel they were very much going to be a failure but God was going to see royalty oh my God I'm so glad I'm so glad today that he sees me as failure but he sees me as royalty God's not God doesn't turn a blind eye you know to our to our ups and downs we'll talk about that a little bit more as we go but there's a covenant that God made God had already made the Covenant with Abraham and nothing that Isaac did or Jacob did or Joseph did nothing could stop that Covenant two persons went to prison that day Joseph and the Lord the Bible says it you read it with me the Lord was with him didn't say the you know the Lord thought about him it didn't just say the Lord was mindful of him Joseph went to prison the Lord was mindful of him said the Lord was with him and said it again the Lord was with him said again but his but the Lord God was with him and the evidence that God was with him was that everything he touched was blessed Joseph could literally could do no wrong because that's now now you're understanding why Peter said that that if if your faith and your virtue and your Temperance your meekness and brotherly kindness and godliness and all these things if you can get them to abound if you can daily die out and daily be in contact with the Lord if you can press toward the mark you you'll actually get to where you'll never be Barren nor unfruitful and in fact is you'll get to a place where you'll never fall and I'm not saying we won't still be human and in our weaknesses but I'm here to say your faith in God's word will never fall they don't know I don't care what happens to you you can't stop going forward it'll keep moving you forward Joseph kept going forward I mean look by the time he goes to prison a lot has already happened to him we're going to talk about it we see ourselves in this story so two persons went to prison that day Joseph and the Lord now I want to point out to you that on the very first day on their very on there very first day behind bars they were very much alike in in many ways but one particular way neither one deserved it they were very much alike in that both had been done wrong both had been done pretty severely wrong Solomon gives us a way to to kind of read between the lines and surmise Unwritten background and Unwritten emotions and thoughts and feelings in the scripture where we we read about God interacting with his family and we can we can kind of know it doesn't always have to be written on you know the Bible doesn't always have to describe what what someone was thinking what evil people were thinking in a certain situation do you know how I can already know what was going on in their minds because I can see what it is today man doesn't change and so Solomon gives us this way because mankind doesn't change and Solomon would say that what is has all has been already and what has been will be again and there is nothing new Under the Sun so so I can see things in the past and surmise the future by what I see now that sound fair I I know what was going through Abraham's mind when he's God gives him a promise and he's trying to fight the internal you know here I am this age I mean Sarah tripped up on that me an old woman how I mean come on you know she's getting an unconditional Covenant and it's almost just too impossible I'm here to tell you can't we relate to that today to say but but you just don't understand I've had too many failures and I got too many problems and you just don't know what I what's happened to me it doesn't matter he knows I know the battle Sarah was facing I know why she stumbled I've stumbled yeah I I've said it can't be it's too beautiful it's too wonderful it can't possibly be me and it is I know what it means for Abraham to have that dog at faith that every year that it kept going his faith got stronger I've had those same kind of victories where I just became dogged about it and I just would not let it go it's God's promise and I'm gonna have it and in fact as I already have it and I'm gonna start thanking God for it and because whether it comes now or whether it comes in a year from now it's already done so he says you know the this this ability to see the intentions of man this is you know I I I I this is very helpful in accepting you know natural and obvious things and you're going to need to I need to say that to you today because we're gonna we're gonna surmise some things of what Joseph No Doubt went through because Joseph's no different than you and me don't make him some super saint that never had a problem all right because the Bible says there's none good not one not one they're all an open sore they're all just uh it's almost like a grave see there's only one good and that's God see and there's only one perfect and that was Christ so I'll give you I'll give you more scripture to help you with that so that you can you can appreciate some of the surmising we're going to do this morning and it's necessary to understand you know some things that would have been naturally obvious that you know to me when I when I look at the lives and I see Joseph and Jesus going to prison together and I I can see them on that first day being very much alike that they both had been done wrong neither one of them deserved it but but you know they wouldn't be as much alike as they as the days went on they wouldn't be as much alike as they had been on that first day differences are going to appear and they're going to be apparent to us as mortal human beings I'm not going to have a text to read you to say Joseph was afraid or doubted or had anxiety or worried about this worried about that but I I do have scripture to say that there's nothing new Under the Sun and what has been will be and is now I do have scripture to say there's none good not one I do have scripture to say we all have our ups and downs Elijah was a man of like Passions Paul confesses to fightings and fears we'll see here in a minute so I don't want you I want to I just want to let you know that these that what I'm going to say is not just me presuming see so it you know it's one thing uh if you suffer you know and God comes down and explains it to you you know kind of like he did Paul when Paul had his Affliction and and uh Paul God didn't explain everything to Paul you know brother Brown said God don't tell His prophets everything prophets don't tell the people everything but but when you and this whole Humanity side of it is what I is what has came so clear to me as I've said to you in my series The where I wanna you remember we took the caribou and the bear and and the the humanness of the interaction this wasn't Divine Heavenly beings causing something to happen this was two men walking believing in a vision and you know he's there in the woods with the squirrels and he he he's hearing a voice and it's it's stressful and it's he's anxious and he's afraid amen so I I want you just to understand the Bible is about real life and it's about a real God who knows what you're going through and has a way to help you you don't want to think of it as so antiseptic that I mean look brother Brown would make a statement shocks me to this day the Lord help me to understand it some years ago but it's still an astonishing statement says Jesus Christ is in every verse of the Bible and he says and if you can't read him in every verse in the Bible go back and read it you missed it now when I go back in here I can read a lot of Glorious things and I say yeah that's easy but what about when I get to the heinous unspeakable things that you don't even own you don't even hardly want to read it yeah of terrible sins and terrible failures and heinous crimes against humanity and against God's word you say how is Jesus in those verses but you have to realize you said because you're you're going to say like me but he never did any of those things and I said that to the Lord one time I said Lord I don't see how he's in those verses because you you never you never did those things and the Holy Spirit just come right down on me said yes but you did and I took your sin upon myself and I I let you go scot-free he who know no sin became sin and took on the sin of the whole world and died under the Judgment of sin and went to hell so that you and I would never have to go I'm glad it couldn't hold him so sometimes when God comes down and explains things to us you know like he did Paul when he had this terrible trial and he kept praying for deliverance and God would deliver him and then Satan bring it back on him and he'd pray again and God delivered him again Satan bring it back on him again that can happen you're in a body that's dying and and uh God healed him again and and then Satan brought it a third time and Paul goes back let's pray again and finally after the third time he hasn't quite learned the lesson and so now God in his Mercy is just going to say Paul my grace is sufficient for you in other words Paul I know what you're going through I'm responsible for it and when Paul realized well he said well okay now that I know that well I'll gladly endure it now that I know it's it's his hand allowing the enemy to do it so that my life can bring him glory that was a wonderful thing but sometimes God don't always do that God didn't explain anything to Joseph see and as I said don't imagine however much a saint of God and filled with his spirit that you are you know you're you're still a human and Joseph is still a human you see by day two one of these convicts naturally didn't want to be there can you agree it was all so unfair I mean after all what had Joseph done but tried to be honest and decent and moral and he committed his whole life from a teenage boy to serving the Living God what had he done but humbly served even his Egyptian master see certainly I mean I want you to I want you to absorb that just for a minute he literally was Faithfully had served people who purchased him from a slave trader who per who had purchased him from people he loved who sowed him into slavery his own blood who had hated him Without a Cause Mr brother Branham says Joseph couldn't help that he was spiritual he couldn't help that that God had placed his hand on his life and made him see visions and dreams and what had he done but been loyal to God all his life from his youth because I'm sure you can understand what I say that by day two one of these two guys didn't want to be there anymore but the other one wanted to be right there in prison and he wanted Joseph to be there if he didn't Joseph wouldn't have been there can you say Amen to that the other one wanted to be right there and he wanted Joseph there if it wasn't true Joseph wouldn't have been there listen friend Satan doesn't get to make decisions about you Satan does not get to decide my life my life and my times are in the hands of God Alone who is my father and even when I've strayed away and even if it's my fault I still belong to the Lord Jesus Christ and him alone I have no dealings with Lucifer I don't need a treaty with him I don't need an armist I want to destroy him I want to stand for almighty God if I Stray then my heavenly father will meet out my correction if I'm going the wrong way it will be my heavenly father who chooses the course and the path that brings me back I'm not here today to give credit to Lucifer at all we do not live by the mercies of Lucifer we live by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ David one time was given the choice to roll the dice with men or fall into the hands of God who loved him and might I say who couldn't stop loving him oh my no matter the level of his guilt and may I say that level was pretty Epic come on I was wow but yet God couldn't stop loving him why because David was the seed line of Christ oh and he said I'll fall into the heart into the arms of the Lord and he said because he has often been merciful he wouldn't roll the dice with men he wouldn't roll the dice with his own strength he said let me fall into the hands of God for he has often times been merciful all I want to tell you today fall into the hands of the Lord he's your Redeemer choose Christ choose Christ don't try to fix it yourself choose the Lord and I don't know I can't stand here today if if God is going to put you on a path and you're going to accept it today and say Lord I'm off the path and today I'm hearing this sermon and I today I'm I'm going to decide that I want you to put me back on the path I don't know what all that will entail but I do know you get restored oh my in a world of such uncertainty and so many confusing voices I think that's one thing we can know for sure he knows how to redeem you from sin and failure he knows how to repair your life he knows how to fix all the broken pieces oh thank God thank God by day two one wanted to be out of prison rather desperately but the other one wanted very much to stay right where they were want to guess which one was which little doubt friends that over those 10 long years that was real he didn't go into prison for 30 days over these 10 long years I can tell you that one of these prisoners awoke many a morning and bewilderment and despair so how do you know because I do you do David did Moses did Elijah did Brother Branham did Paul did because remember God's not even telling him what it's about God hasn't explained one thing to him since the day he got thrown in a hole the left did I haven't explained one thing to him so little doubt his little doubt in my mind that one of these one of these Brethren because they're you're his brother you know one of them woke many a morning and bewilderment and despair but I would say to you that for every but also for every one of those 10 years the other was in perfect control of his thoughts perfect control of his feelings at all times he was never rattled by anything you see the same former prisoner later in the Gospels walked on humbly when they spit in his face and pulled his beard smote him in pilate's judgment Hall this same former prisoner would show this same kind of control and faith in his father here in prison with Joseph he's in prison with Joseph and he's he's never he's never out of the way God's not ready to burn anybody up he's how dare you throw my servant in prison no actually God arranged it and God went in with him on day one and you can see that he was with him because of all the blessings and the and the authority that they kept putting on Joseph see so so this same former prisoner walked on humbly as brother Brown said it is your life worthy of the Gospel all just remember Jesus humbled himself to death for you I was sharing this with a good friend the other day we were weeping and rejoicing over it he was not fussy when they spit in his face he didn't spit back when they pulled his beard out he didn't pull it there's when they slapped him on one side of the face the other he never slapped them he prayed for them walked on humbly he was an example of humility he was full of faith why he knowed his words couldn't fail see and so now you can hear Prophet saying that there's there's nothing to give you such prevailing power as a revelation of Who You Are see he was full of Faith why he knowed his words couldn't fail he so lived by the word till he became the word say he became the word yeah he he became the manifestation he was the word made flesh he was always Isaiah's prophecy come to pass that's not the point the prophet is making but Peter even stands up on the day of Pentecost and when they asked him about it he says you with Wicked hands crucified the Lord Of Glory I know you did it you're under misinterpreted theology your leaders told you wrong but don't it's okay don't don't don't don't don't faint because it wasn't possible that the grave could hold him because David had said he'll not suffer his holy one to see corruption he won't leave his soul in Hell neither will he suffer him to seek corruption and he said I'm here to tell you that that same Jesus whom you crucified catch the language God hath made him both Lord and Christ so he so lived by the word every day of his life until he became the word that's the that's your pilgrimage he went ahead of you to show you how to do it to show you how to obey the voice of the father to show you how to stay in prayer to show you how to be a humble life and a humble Christian and God will honor that and you and as you live you're becoming the word you're going to become it so much you're going to leave the Earth gravity will lose its hold on you oh God he says I love this this statement oh God let me hold my I want to raise up mine let me hold my both hands to God before this audience let me live like that how many could say that today well with a prophet raise up both hands say oh God let me live like that listen now let this word so become that me and this word is the same thing Let My Words Be his word let my meditation of my heart let let him be on my heart on my mind Ty's Commandments upon the post of my intelligence tie them upon the post of my heart let me just see him when Temptation Rises let me see Christ when things goes wrong do they do they when things goes wrong let me just see him when I get ready and the enemy try to make me get angry let me see Jesus what would he do he was so much in the word till him in the word became the self-same thing one of these prisoners very often didn't understand the purpose of God and all the suffering and confinement but the other one had a perfect understanding of all things from the beginning he understood everything before they ever went into prison together this one had been perfectly willing to stand aside and watch his loyal servant be double-crossed by his own family and thrown into a pit to die of course God was never going to let them kill him that was the purpose of their heart but God puts a ring in the nose of Emperors and leads them around remember he's not just the god of Good Men he's the God of all men see so their purpose was to kill him of course God was never going to allow them to kill him though that's what they intended God was God was going to keep him alive listen God was going to keep him alive you know why so he could double cross him and let him be put in prison so another Master he steps aside and lets his family throw him in a hole and then he lets him sell him to Israelites and then he he puts him in part of his house and then and then Satan brings in a Temptation which Joseph is triumphant over and it's Victorious and then a lie is told and now he's in question and Lord defend me the Lord just steps aside you're going into prison Joseph but I haven't done anything wrong don't be worried don't worry I'll be with you I have a purpose in this I know what I'm doing your life is in my hands I've got a vision of you I'm working it out oh friends I'm gonna tell you something today I don't know whether I want to cry or whether I want to shout I think I want to do all of the above and I I just say Lord God Reign Over My Life and Reign Over My Heart and take over my everything I don't want nothing I don't want to be in control of nothing my he literally steps aside and lets him get double crossed again and thrown into an Egyptian dungeon my made his his hole in the ground looked like looked like a a nice law a nice resort you say oh I feel so sorry for Joseph um I'd imagine you don't feel half as much sorrow as that brother did we can sit here today in a in our nice clothes and a nice building with air conditioning and public address system and everything working and this was uh and we're we're all just a bunch of stinkers and here comes a young man from his youth who had only ever been loyal to God and Prophet says even in the Bible you can't even find nothing against him one little scratch where he tried to get his daddy to use guile and kind of tell what they call a little white lie to pharaoh and God protected his his father and it when they called him in it ended up being his brother and his daddy didn't really have to say anything and and and the brothers said oh we're we're Shepherds because Joseph hadn't told them not to say that because God wanted pharaoh to know they were shepherds and Joseph told his daddy not his daddy's under pressure and so God says that's easy I'll accept you aside step in the brothers they didn't get the memo what do you do for a living worship we're Shepherds I'm here to tell you something God knows how to direct you God knows how to direct you oh my oh my all this pity but I'm going to tell you something friends all that pity is going to turn to rejoicing one day when Joseph ascends to the throne to the right hand of pharaoh and then and then he say and then he and then he's able to turn around and save those double-crossing Egyptians and save his double-crossing brothers and it all turned out to the glory of God oh my one of these two prisoners often didn't understand the purpose and all the sufferings and confinement as I said to you already but the other one had a perfect understanding before they ever went into you want to guess which one is which why is it important brother Jason because you need to resolve today that wherever you go and whatever happens he's promised to be with you always I want to say to you today you're not alone in that trial you're not alone in that pain he walks beside you during the day he stands by your bedside and watches you sleep you're never alone he said I'll be with you even in you I'll never leave you one of these prisoners had to figure it out day by day as he went along his cellmate knew the end from the beginning 10 long years one couldn't leave no matter how hard he tried and for 10 long years the other could leave any time he wanted to but he never wanted to Hallelujah all those years he could just leave but he never wanted to leave oh Hallelujah now let me give you some evidence James 5 17 Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are brother man comes in this message in numerous places get the people to believe Elijah listen to this now Elijah was not an angel he was a man and he had his ups and downs and his troubles like we do and he had his Passions the Bible said he was a man with like passion subject to like passions as we are he was just as if I hope you take some comfort in this today he was just as apt to make a mistake as you or I am he's just as apt to do something wrong as you or I am and not just Elijah David before him and thinking on our way you know David I'm told at the time of the writing of this psalm that he had been in trouble you see Saul was plotting against him to try to kill him had his house staked out and David was just a man like all of us that he had his ups and downs and his differences and he had been very much in trouble you know ups and downs are the most prevalent when when you're living in the outer Court brother Branham deals with that in the message Supernatural and he's saying where he uses that same term ups and downs he says as long as you're walking around out there and just the outer Court there's where your ups and downs are going to knock you out every day that's what the holy of holy that's what the most holy place was given for so you could come Beyond the Veil into the Shekinah Glory so that you could stay on top of your ups and downs you're going to have them because this body's always going to be sticky it's got to be changed Hallelujah I'm glad it's going to be changed God has not promised to go through life any believer to go through without troubles but he has promised Grace sufficient to take care of these troubles that's what Thrills my heart is to know that his grace is sufficient can you believe that because to know that his grace is sufficient you got to suffer it you might even be in the middle of suffering it to know that and brother Branham is talking about you and I or himself in the middle of of hard hot heavy trials and yet he says here's what Thrills my heart oh I wish I could feel a thrill in my heart the trial I'm in I wish a thrill could come to my heart here's your thrill his grace his sufficient [Applause] Hallelujah all of our depths and troubles and frustrations boy Google hates that word my goodness word hates it Microsoft hates it they want to change it but I like Kentucky he says in frustrations I got them all of our debts and troubles and frustrations are not shallow they're pretty deep yet yet God has promised to see us through that's just as much as we could ask him knowing that he knows the road as Joshua said to Israel you have not traveled this way before we haven't traveled it so he knows the way and can point it out he says I can just see David you still you're good he says I can just see David his house was being watched saw in his army was watching his house to kill him now watch this I can see David nervously wringing his hands David who killed Goliath who killed a lion and a bear yeah now he's walking through the house nervously ringing his hands I'm glad a prophet could see things and walking back and forth and to and fro through his room looking out the windows and watching every little move in the bush for he didn't know here's here's what's here's his anxiety he didn't know what at any time that an arrow might whistle through the air right into his own bosom and you're dead and and and I mean he's he's a man like Paul who confessed in second Corinthians 7 5 for when we were coming to Macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears I'm here to tell you no matter how saintly a person might be there's fightings without and fears within and we might nervously wring our hands but my joy is in the Lord and that I've had a I have a covenant promise upon my life and it was then that these words came to David as I thought on my ways I turned my feet to thy testimony see there's where his anxiety was really coming from there's why it was breaking through because David had his feet hadn't been following the Lord too closely and he had allowed a lot of carnality and a lot of weakness to enter his life and now he wasn't sure if God still had his back anymore God did David was still a seed line of Christ see so so he says it's he says I I as I thought on my ways I turned my feet to thy testimony that's a great remedy friends that's a great remedy for fear and anxiety you're not given the spirit of fear put your hope in the Lord you're going to have a hard time doing that if your life's full of carnality three amens ha you're going to have a hard time trusting God you know say well I'm trusting him fine wait till the temperature goes up wait till it keeps going when you thought you'd have been out of it by now you're going to have a hard time trusting the Lord if your feet are walked away from the Lord or even turned out at the path he says it's usually when a man is in trouble is when he goes to thinking about God it's too bad that we have to wait to get in trouble before we think about him and you know David before Elijah Elijah before Paul David before Elijah Moses before David at Thy word Moses was a prophet God made him a prophet and God trusted Moses because he was born to be a prophet God foreordained that and when he told Abraham he'd he'd bring his people out I believe Moses was ordained in I never saw that because the Bible says he was born a proper child so God had actually already ordained Moses when he gave the promise to Abraham you can see now why friends all you you didn't become a son or daughter of God the day you repented you found out you always had been so he says he he was born a proper child he had his ups and downs now we're we're at Paul where Elijah we're at David where Moses he had his ups and downs but in the wilderness God told Moses go speak to the Rock and it'll bring forth water instead of Moses speaking to the Rock he smote The Rock now catch this and that was one time one time this is a one-off that was one time that God's complete program was broken I've always felt sorry for Moses that he didn't get to cross over with the people you have to understand that what he done I mean you know because he says Christ was only smithing once we don't Smite him anymore we speak to him no servant of God think about this man that seems like a harsh punishment for Moses but understand that there had never been a servant of God who had ever been loved Chosen and trusted with so much who had ever fallen so far no wonder he had to wait to cross over into the promised land this is a one-off time where a man that's more anointed gifted chosen in the presence of God and more Supernatural in his life than anybody and yet he commits the greatest sin he literally what he done was completely break the entire program of God in Redemption so no wonder he had to wait of course he eventually did because he's spotted with Jesus on Mount Transfiguration along with Elijah who also had his ups and downs he says because remember one time that's that God's complete program was broken so Moses so Paul so we got Moses we've got David we got Elijah we got Paul and all of them all of them with their ups and downs but with all of them and with all of their ups and downs yet they were irreversibly chosen by God irreversibly it could never be taken back nothing could ever break that Covenant that God made to Abraham Hallelujah even with all of their weaknesses it could never snap that Covenant oh can you rejoice this morning because a mighty angel came down and he had a rainbow on his head because he was a covenant angel John had seen him as a white wig one because it's the day of the Lord It's not the day of God in the new Heavens it's the day of the Lord It's judgment and John had seen him as a white wigged one because he's coming in judgment but he's also got a rainbow on his head because he's got Grace for his family Hallelujah a time of the day of the Lord the judgments of the world but Grace Grace unto the people let's finish up with our prisoners just like you Elijah David and Moses and all men who ever lived for 10 years one of these convicts had his ups and downs every day of his imprisonment but for every one of those same 10 years the other one was always up he never had up and downs every day one of them had ups and downs and for every one of those days one of them only had up he was always steady he was always faithful you want to guess which one was which you say well brother Jason it's pretty easy because you keep repeating the same order well what if I flip the pattern and reverse the order of the two cellmates it would go something like this for ten years one was always certain and for 10 years the other was certain of him that's me friends for 10 years I'm not on I'm uncertain but he's very certain but I'm very certain of him for all my life I've got my ups and downs but he's got UPS he's only got ups and the more I get in touch with him the upper I go the more the higher the higher until one of these days I'm going to go up and never come back down Hallelujah oh my gosh I can still tell which one is which I'll bet you can too I'll bet you can I'll bet you can't you count which one is always certain Hallelujah Oh I thought about that old song This House of flesh is but a prison bars of bone hold my soul but the doors of clay are gonna burst wide open Hallelujah musicians brother Tony bring your team back hey man everybody just stay seated and stay right where you are come on back musician don't run out on me honey I want to make a few closing comments foreign s with me it's a Truth where he leads me I will follow with all heads bowed and hearts bowed this morning it's not lost on me that this has been a rather unusual sermon wasn't lost on me as I studied it but I I think that I have passed the test to verify to you in the scriptures I think I've certainly given you enough indications in the Bible and I've given you verse after verse and quote after quote this is your life friends sometimes we find ourselves exactly like Joseph we all love the part about Joseph on the throne and Joseph in Redemption but what about what about what it took to make Joseph those things those things I want the world to see a path to life in my life when I meet people on this journey [Music] I'm quite sure they see that I have my ups and downs [Music] but I want to make sure I introduced them to my friend who doesn't have any of that I may not always seem very certain friends but let me introduce you to my fellow prisoner do you know him do you know my fellow prisoner do you know him at this level not just not just know about him listen to this young people keep your heads bowed now not just knowing about him but do you know him I mean I I get that you know about him you were raised to know about him but not just know about him but do you know him do you know him in the power of his resurrection what about it adults what about it single what about it married men women boys and girls do you talk to him in the evening as you lay down to sleep do you greet him in the morning's light [Music] I thought about that as I was making my last and final notes this morning hurriedly in the back and it's the last line I wrote that I said Lord I've known you in the power of your Resurrection I got my ups and downs I'm often frustrated and worried I'm often times finding myself in the weeds because I didn't follow your word exactly but I can see in this story today of Joseph that there were two men in that prison and one of them never had any of these issues if you want to know him today in a real and Living Way maybe you say I've already known him but maybe you'd be like me today and say I'd like to do like brother Brandon raise up both my hands and say I want to know him more if you've never known him raise up a hand if you know if you want to know him more more raise up a hand if you can identify with what you've heard in the scriptures today and what and what you've seen in the quotes of the Prophet if you can identify then say Lord God oh be my companion in this life let me let me speak to you every evening as I close my eyes let me greet you every morning may you be the center of my life oh God father Honest Hearts hands everywhere this sermon dropped out of the heavens on me Lord several mornings ago it was unexpected and I just simply read a prophet saying God was with Joseph and it all just like it's opened up and as I sit there another line and another line and another line and another line and I I sit there for hours as the daylight came up Lord and the house began to stir I was still writing I know father that you love us and you have this word not only those people in this building today but those listening across the airwaves those who might catch it at a later archive it'll still be just as living and alive to them at that moment [Music] I want to have that testimony Lord God of the song that we're playing right now where he leads me I'll follow that's my desire for every day of my life Lord let me walk hand in hand someday someday I'll I'll Ascend to the throne with you and I'll be seated with you on your throne o Lamb of God hasten that day but until then until then until that hour comes for
