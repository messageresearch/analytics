[Music] [Music] [Music] good morning and God bless you we just want to bring greetings to you in the name of Jesus Christ to those here and those listening on the livestream we we love you we miss you appreciate you pray for us we're praying for you if you have prayer requests feel free to send them in through our website or through Facebook or YouTube we're glad to to take those and we're gonna start our half-hour Sunday school now and I'm going to be covering mystery of the Godhead part six and before we do that we're gonna pray gracious father you're the same yesterday today and forever you never change you always remain the same Lord and therefore we understand that you are completely sovereign you are in control of everything that happens and you have a purpose in everything that happens and Lord whether the this this thing is of course that's going around the world is from the devil you do not bring sickness and yet it was your purpose to permit it Lord and it is part of your great program for your church for your bride to produce something in us Lord for your glory and we're confident in that and we just say Lord we submit ourselves to you we ask that you would do with us as you will guide us direct us protect us keep your hand upon us and go before us continually father and and just work those things within our soul out which are necessary Lord nothing happens by chance your hand is upon this whole thing to glorify yourself and to work something out in our lives that we would be more like Jesus Christ so we commit ourselves to you in this time in Jesus name Amen so we're gonna continue on and looking at the last verse that we covered in our last Sunday school 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 verse 6 for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so I just want to encourage everyone if this is your first time listening to this series go back and listen to the other ones although it makes sense now it'll make more sense if you watch the other five so we see here this word face in the Greek espresso pwned and we look at this Pro so pone means front towards the view or face theologians over time during the church early church age period started to change the meaning of this word into the word person but that is not correct the original meaning in the Greek is quite different Jesus Christ is the face that God is hidden behind and revealed through so we are the were given the knowledge of the light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so light and glory are then hidden behind Jesus Christ but not just hidden revealed also so he he hides himself behind the face of Jesus Christ that which is toward the view it's similar to the word image but with a different connotation image is that which is making that which is invisible made visible face is is a similar thing that it's like saying someone has hidden behind this in order to reveal himself through that there's an actor acting through a mask through a face this face is Jesus Christ so it's the the glory of God what's the glory of God the shin in Hebrew its Shekinah what is that that's the logos that supernatural light that began to form in the very beginning that is made visible to the world through Jesus Christ now okay today we don't see Jesus Christ do we he's seated on the throne he's interceding we're unable to see him face to face there'll be a day we do see him face to face we can't wait for that day we're living our life for that day but we don't see him face to face now so how is Paul writing here two Corinthians who never saw Jesus and says you're the light of the knowledge of the glory of God is seen by you in the face of Jesus Christ well we have his name he lived upon this earth he was preached we have his nature what he was like what Jesus is like is not different than what God is like it's the very same nature only made visible but then go further than that what is our what is our hope what is our hope of glory well we're hoping we're looking for something that we don't have the hope of glory what is it it's Christ in you the hope of glory so what is it today how do how is Jesus Christ made visible today how do we see the light of the glory of God Christ in you Christ in his bride so how has he made visible in the bride man so God changed his face he didn't change his nature but he changed his mask he went from that invisible spirit to that logos that supernatural light then he became flesh in Jesus Christ it's not too Pro soap owns it's not multiple persons as they try to say it's two masks actually it's three masks if we want to look at it completely Father Son and Holy Ghost that's three different masks that God took on and there's a bigger picture to go on that as well but and we'll get into that later but let's look at this Alister McGrath theologian and historian pretty tremendous popular scholar in the denominational world he's writing in this about the doctrine of Tertullian one of the early church fathers the first one to use the word Trinity okay so understand he's the first person that used the word Trinity did he mean three persons three separate and distinct and Co eternal persons let's look what he says this is Alister McGrath writing the term person literally means a mask such as that worn by an actor in a Roman drama at this time actors were masked to allow the audience's to understand which of the different characters in the drama they were playing the term persona of us came to have a developed meaning along the lines of the role that someone is playing it is quite possible that Tertullian wanted his readers to understand the idea of one substance substance three persons he says persons 3 personas that's different it's not the same thing one substance three persons to mean that the one God played three distinct yet related roles in the great drama of human Redemption behind the plurality of roles three roles lay a single actor the complexity of the process of creation and redemption did not imply that there were many gods three gods simply that there was one God who acted in a multiplicity of manners within the economy of salvation three roles that God played Father Son and Holy Spirit one person he said there are three persons that's not what Tertullian was saying two trillion was saying three personas which is completely different it's the role that an actor played we're perso pone if we saw that word before that's also been turned into person speaks of the mask so one speaks of the mask the other speaks of the role that's being played so there's a there's see see the distinction there between those two things very close but different so we're gonna go back and we're gonna finish the second part of the Athanasian Creed now this is what is accepted by all major denominations all the Catholic churches etc this is the main Creed it came in about the the fifth century it was put together the the the historian athenais shish who lived in the 300s he did not write it they wrote it and dedicated it to him because he was such a defender of trinitarianism okay so Athanasian wrote that we went through the first part of it which is about the Godhead the second part now is about Christ and you're gonna see in here there are some things in the Athanasian Creed that are very strange there and there's some things that are close to being true and now and I'm I'm gonna read through it and then we're gonna talk about it but its necessary for eternal salvation that one also believe in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ faithfully in other words you have to believe it the way we teach it if they believe it correctly according to our understanding otherwise you can't be saved now this is the true faith that we believe in confess that our Lord Jesus Christ God's Son is both God and human equally no problem he is God from the essence of the Father begotten before time okay so now they're separating they're saying there's two there's there's two persons God the Father and the son their separate button before time so he's he is you and then he says and he's human from the essence of his mother born in time we're gonna address that momentarily completely God completely human find no problem with a rational soul and human flesh no problem equal to the Father as regards divinity some error there less than the father as regards humanity absolutely although he is God in human yet Christ is not two but one he is one however not by his divinity being turned into flesh but by God's taking humanity to himself sure he's one certainly not by the blending of his essence but by the unity of his person for just as one human is both rational soul and flesh so to the one Christ is both God and human so three significant events of Jesus life if we look at that who Jesus is through that lens we'll start to understand the big picture better I would I would say regarding that last portion of the Athanasian Creed is is that what they're what they're doing is they're creating their own pigeonhole and this is that this is exactly how we have to view things and also what we are the points that we argue from so then we're gonna argue from these points and of course everyone logically has to agree with this because we're starting here and what as Christians we're saying is we need to start from here we don't start from the creed and then go from there we start from the scripture itself and go from there and so when when you start to see that you start to see that there's a a worldview that they're putting on top up they put in the early church they put it on top of the Bible okay and they said this is how we have to see things through this see the Bible through this lens and if you don't see it this way you're a heretic and we cast you out now I'm gonna back up a second and say that did you realize that this was politics this was politicians that orchestrated and controlled these councils that's indisputable history they were not holy ghost Christians that felt that did this they weren't this didn't even come as a result of prayer this came because politicians saw Christianity is growing who was behind the politician what spirit Antichrist spirit even even in the year 90 Don is saying the spirit of Antichrist is already working he's already at work and so what about two hundred and fifteen years later 225 years later is he stopped working no he continues to work and we look and see the Nicene council Constantine says Christianity is splitting up into two and this is gonna split up my empire well God split up his empire anyway but this is splitting up I my empire and I've got a unite everyone otherwise this is gonna become a war looking at it from political side we can't have two versions of Christianity going on well what he did created thousands of them they didn't wait on the Holy Ghost they didn't pray they didn't seek the Lord a politician said bishops come here we have to make a decision who has the right doctrine is it Arius or is it the Trinitarians who is correct about this and remember who writes the history the one that wins and who controls who's now the bishops the side that wins and they have politicians behind them to enforce that no and so what happened what happens is slowly any holy ghost pastor is ousted he's arrested and then who comes in his place a Trinitarian bishop what happens to the writings of the previous pastor and the different Holy Ghost men of God during those times in the fire do we have a really reliable history of Christianity I doubt it I very much doubt it we have hints and glimmers of it here and there okay so then we come to that stage where they're where they're bringing this this council they put together what it is and this side wins the other side is cast aside well guess what about a hundred and thirty-five years later a new Emperor arises and guess what he don't like the Trinity so what does he do he does the same thing the Trinitarians did and he'd opposes the bishops he'd opposes everyone that he possibly can and he puts in their place Aryan bishops and pastors that's a whole nother issue I don't want to get into it it's it's that there are none it's a nontrinitarian belief that puts Jesus as begotten before time but he was an angel and not God and they have some aspects that they understand correctly and they have a lot of aspects they understand incorrectly but that's not my purpose here is to show this what spirit was behind that if you say that was the Spirit of God orchestrating those things we under your view of what the church is and what who Christ is is incorrect Christ didn't never moved by politics why did he do what did Jesus do when he came he rebuked politics he rebuked religion he stood outside and he said come to me what did his Bibles do they came behind and they made deals with politics they said we better obey God rather than men you can kill us you could throw us in prison but we're gonna have obeyed God and we're gonna have nothing to do with this politics and they preach the word and they said come to Jesus he's the one that saves they made no deals with politicians they made they made no work to use politics to further the gospel they did not do that that's Antichrist spirit that does that what spirit was working at the Council of Nicaea any Christian should be able to recognize it was the spirit of Antichrist that is not a radical idea if even if you're a Protestant you should realize that you should understand what spirit if you're a Protestant do you believe that a bishop should be in charge of a hundred different churches in a metropolitan area no you don't believe that and yet that's what the Council of Nicaea did and they also made Jesus a second person of the Godhead a second co-equal Co eternal person and then as it continued on we have the Council of Constantinople what did they do there it was run by a pret an elder of the city who was not even a Christian and and you can you can do the research yourself find out what else what other doctrines that they put in place as mandatory for the church at those councils wasn't just Trinitarian doctrine it was many other things that 90% of Christians say that's Antichrist that's against God and yet they want to take the other part of it too come on believers come on Christians are we Bible believers forget you say but I know people that are nice I do too probably nicer than me but I know people that they're good Christians they're solid this they're the they teach the Bible they do this this is between you and God has nothing to do with what your friend believes your pastor believes it is about you and God in this book what is true I'm not asking you to abandon something I'm asking you simply to embrace this and let God lead your path the scripture is the final authority and we have to come back to the scripture and how does God speak to the church and deal with the church through history he does not work through councils he does not work even through pastors per se of course he works through pastors I'm not saying that but the word of the Lord does not come to the pastor says surely the Lord God will do nothing except he reveals his secrets to his servants the prophets through the church ages in all the Bible we only have one place that shows us a prophetic viewpoint of the church age that's in Revelation chapter two and three it speaks of seven different periods of time and each of those periods of time the letter is written to the Angel of the church it's not written to an heavenly angel what need do they have of that it's written to the pastor or the bishop or really the messenger of the age so the messenger to Ephesus the messenger to Sardis the messenger to Thea tyre or the messenger to Philadelphia the messenger to Laodicea and then that messenger is to bring that message to the Church of that age and then he that has an ear to hear let him hear let him hear I'm not trying to decrease chin eyes anybody I'm not trying to tell you turn against this person turn against that person I'm saying turn to Christ Christ is the word boy will never never quite get to this but I'm gonna just speed through a couple things the birth the baptism and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ are three significant event events in his life that reveal who he is if you understand them correctly in the Bible then all the Greek philosophy to Trinity arian box that they want to put you in easily slides away the false doctrine of the Trinity seeks to force us in those into those boxes that were drawn up 400 years after the death of the Jewish apostles so let's look at the birth of Jesus this is something that we know every Sun comes from the genes of his father and mother every son issues forth from his father and mother every son has the has the nature front of their father and mother by genetics we all are born in sin and shaped an iniquity why because her mom and dad was and on to the original progenitors and so that's not just our nature that are the color of our hair the color of our eyes what our face looks like it's that's even to our personality that's even to the things that we like and dislike it accounts for our nature as well Hebrews 7 9 and as many as I may so say Levi also who receive tithe paid tithes in Abraham so Levi was in Abraham his great-grandfather and so that that what Abraham did was accounted to Levi on the on the positive side on the negative side is whatever Adam did is accounted to us as well Hebrews 2 10 and 11 for it was fitting that he for whom and by whom are all all things exist in bringing many sons to glory should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering for he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source that is why is not to shame a shame to call them brothers we come from one source I want to back up and go before I close here and say what was God's original purpose for man and woman that he created them for what were they he said I'm gonna make you in my image and likeness what does that mean it means that God was now gonna have offspring that were a perfect reflection of his nature so we could say and be very scriptural about it is that these were sons of God so what is it it's a it's a god race not race as in color of skin but in other words it's a group of people that are to be the a reflective of the nature of God that are to be God on earth no they're not God but the life of God is to be in them and expressed through them so that when you see them you're seeing God okay so that's you know in a sense we look at that and see and we say even the humanity the human nature of Adam and Eve was what was to be God again not the eternal God not the Creator we're not talking about New Age mysticism we're talking about the life that's coming forth if you're a son you have the life of your father you're a daughter you have the you get what I'm saying and so that life is in you in your to express and manifest the life that's in you which is for Adam and Eve that was God so there to express the life of God they have divine life in them they have divinity within them oh now you're saying they're God they can create no there's the only path to expressing God is not enlightenment its submission and surrender and today it's repentance it's giving your and a continual repentance we're not talking about some mystic viewpoint we're talking about Scripture and the life that's to be expressed so that the life of the sons of God is God himself acts 20:28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood Wow so God purchased the church with his own blood but I thought God was a spirit so here we can understand the birth of Jesus when Jesus was born that Creed said that he was human because of his mother if he was human because of his mother what would he be then he would be a sinner because his mother was sorry Catholics Mary was a sinner she said she had need of a savior and so she would have given that sinful nature to Jesus Christ God had to bypass that completely otherwise it wouldn't be the blood of God it'd be the blood of Mary it's not the blood were not saved by the blood of Mary we're not saved by Jewish blood Gentile blood were saved by the blood of God well you say God doesn't have blood only humans have blood what was the life what was the genetics what was the DNA whose DNA did Jesus have coursing through his veins not Mary's he had the blood of God the life and genetics of God were in him so that from the very time he conceived that was God in the womb at the same time that was a man that was the that was the son of God he he had a time that he began he was the beginning of the creation of God brother Branham says when did he begin in the wombs of a virgin bloom of a woman he God creating himself in human flesh God in the first born but also God in the many sons which come to glory they come to different ways so it's the it's the very life of God that was in Jesus the very genetics the very DNA of the almighty himself was there I feel like that's a terrible place to close there's much more to say but you just be gracious to me and we'll continue this next time and let's pray father we just come to you Lord and we're so thankful for the truth of your scripture we love the word and we ask that you'd shake our hearts and minds by it Lord we know we're saved by the blood of God we also know that you're a spirit that you are the Creator that you're not limited by a body of flesh and yet you pour yourself into a body of flesh that you might be made seen and manifested amongst the world Lord and you were manifested in fullness in the first born and you're manifested in every son which comes to you Lord we we need more of you reveal yourself more and more Lord we understand that this isn't just human teaching Lord but it takes a revelation from the Spirit of God into each heart lord please quicken yourself into us Lord that you know that your the fruits of your spirit would be manifested and displayed within we commit ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you what a resurrection that that was and water resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus but God Quinton house [Music]
