about it we just worship god and then we have victory this morning okay [Applause] so there is a little bit of a method to my you know selection occasionally um it's not just let's see this so i don't have to think about what we're gonna see i do try to get quiet and i'm gonna work on some new ones though okay i got one my wife has been suggesting but the next song is also kind of a place to where

love looking at the faces that i see when i'm sitting here so i want to sing a portion of it is well with my soul because i'm at peace no grudges we have a wonderful church the church is not the

friend when art is oh is jesus is a friend of mine jesus hallelujah hallelujah lauren [Music] sister rosemary will you teach me that so i can lead it as a congregation listen i've got about five more people that want to sing this this morning i'm going to sing one more because the deacons need about no more than 10 minutes and please save them there won't be any less important next week than they are today because all of it is a blessing i'm going to ask brother enoch if he will sing it's been a while and he's here this morning so i want to take advantage of that amen and invite him to come bless our hearts [Applause] god bless your son i am clearly not prepared right behind me you along with everybody thinking this worth in what you do then like a hero who takes the stage when we're on the edge of our seats singing is too late [Music] well let me introduce you to amazing grace no matter the bumps no matter the rules it is no matter the scars still the truth is the cross as me the cross [Music] says no matter [Applause] could it possibly be that we simply can't believe that this unconditional kind of love would be enough to take a like this and wrap it probably righteousness but exactly what it is [Music] still the truth is the cross says [Music] [Music] no matter the pain still the truth [Music] take a breath and smile and stay right here right now i'm okay because [Music] the cross was enough [Music] then like a hero takes the stage when we're on the edge of our seats no matter the cross says [Laughter] no matter the pain still the truth is across the cross hallelujah the cross has made us flawless hallelujah glory we have uh before we before we uh bring the brother robert up we have a about a five minute video that brother greg has brought that we want to um that we want to watch and then we're going to have the deacons come up and then we may sing we may sing something and then we'll bring brother stephen up okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i unborn [Music] [Music] [Music] m so [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] is yes [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] is oh is [Music] is [Music] is [Applause] god bless everyone thank god for being here today amen i know we've had of worship and just expressing our hearts to the lord there's a few words i wanted to share with the church excuse me i was getting nervous but god is good amen praise god so so as we are it's our first day here the lord has done a lot for us um we've been through a lot and we've received a lot we want to be reminded of church order this morning so just want to go over a few reminders just so that we could uh be guided um so as you see we're still under construction a little bit um but those who may be looking for offering and type envelopes there on the counter at the back in the window to the sound room and now before i go into the church order remember the family fun and fellowship day on the 21st um it's really good for family fellowship so we want the families to come we're going to have um things for activities for the young and for the little ones as well as for the adults with mothers fathers children you come you bring a picnic lunch so the church would not be for providing uh lunch at this time you bring your own and maybe something to share so we can just spend some time together things like about from from 10 o'clock in the morning to four in the afternoon and um we are timing it to prepare the children to go back to school on the 25th so we're going to have prayer with the children at the end of the day um so we want to come prepared for that as we commit them into the hands of the lord in this time but um as we focus on where we are now what god has done for us we want to remember that this sanctuary that we sit in here it is prepared for worship and communion with our lord jesus we want to remember that we don't want to have talking among each other we can talk on the outside but when we come in here our focus is our lord amen we want to also at the end of the series when the holy spirit is moving we want to give time for the lord to deal with the heart he's dealing with if someone is here praying whatever we have to do we need to let that be the priority let the holy spirit working be the priority we're in our own place we don't have to be rushed out nobody is waiting to come to use the room and god has given this to us we're gonna give it a hundred percent back to him everything else must take second place if you have any movement to do any fixing to do if the holy spirit is working with a heart just stand back and stay quiet and let the lord look work we want to teach our children to respect the property god has given us we must not have don't allow anyone to run through the building no frolicking we want to remember that the sound room is only for authorized people it's not you don't want to be going back and forth and the sound room in the office that's in the front on the as you're going out to the left you want to just respect the spaces the cry room is still under construction we apologize to precious mothers and babies but um in a couple of weeks time it will be ready um we have provided just a temporary setup there but we will have it um completed in a couple of weeks and this thought has been in my heart as we have been working and getting this space ready we wanted to make it nice for the people of god and god has provided us with a very beautiful place of worship but it reminds me of we don't want to consume the beauty of this place on ourselves and an example of that was when king david was out fighting and he wanted some water from the well in bethlehem and three men expended their lives to go and bring it for him he didn't consume that water he poured it out to the lord we also remember the prophet telling us about when the the lord gives us his word particularly for the young woman or all women that are here the here is given for the covering and the devil will try to make you cut you here and break your vow well if he can't get you that way then you'll be growing in here nice and long and looks beautiful then they will try to make you think well i'm so beautiful and you start using that beauty for yourself we don't want to be caught on either side and the point i'm making is now god has given us a place let us not be out publishing photographs and look at this place we have and let us not go that route there are traps on that road there was a king called hezekiah one time and he was so backslid he invited the king of babylon to see all the beautiful things that he had all the treasures and that was his that was his his demise because the king of babylon came and took everything away what god has given us we praise him for it it's beautiful we want to keep it for him but we don't want to be going out showing off that is the idea we're trying to convey amen as the prophet said the beauty of the church is the character of the people what we want to have by god's grace is a people so in harmony and love as the prophet was speaking in a message humble thyself he said in the old church there was the people loved one another so much they even cried to part they just cared and we don't want to have this self coming in the way the beauty of the church is not the paint and the carpet and all the electronics is the character of the people we want the beauty of jesus christ to be seen in us i just want to read from that um just a reminder here in the message on god hiding himself in simplicity when the prophet was before he pushed the seals and they had just done redone the tabernacle he said now i think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of god to be so grateful to our god that this will just be one beautiful building that will come to [Music] but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of jesus christ in every person that comes may it be a consecrated place to our lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people trust it will always be a house of god of beauty amen praise the lord bless you all [Applause] i don't know if anybody just spent more time working over here than brother robert and i know he believes what he's saying or he wouldn't have said it let's stand we'll sing something after the service we want to invite our pastor out give him his time [Music] praise the lord [Music] yes all they believe [Music] all things are possible oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] things are possible [Applause] [Music] thank you john yes [Music] things are possible lord i believe blessing lord i receive this morning lord i received lord i received all things lord i received [Music] lord i received amen look lord i received all things [Music] amen how many are happy this morning if you are not happy something is wrong amen blessed be the name of the lord you might be sitting [Music] i'm sorry it's a new setting got things left and right but by the grace of god it's moving amen blessed be the name of the lord how many enjoy this building amen blessed be the name of the lord we want to thank everybody again for the work the sacrifice and everything that you have done to make this happen this is not a one-man show it's not a one-man work it is everybody together that work to make this happen so congratulations spoken word tabernacle god richly bless you for everything that you have done amen that would be all the music thank you blessed be the name of the i want to give a special thank an acknowledgement to someone not that everybody else did not work but it would not be right if i'd not at least i'm not saying something about that person it's a person that was here more than anybody else in this building he was here from the morning all the way to evening sometime he stay here till uh nine o'clock and i don't know if it's 10 o'clock almost every day when the constructor are here he's there when there is an appointment he is always there almost every day that person has been here he gave his all he could be working or doing his own business and probably making a lot of money but it seems like he stays here from all this time that person is brother robert robert thank you very much amen amen thank you very much brother robert for everything amen you might be seated i cannot pass without remembering that one the lord have given out such precious brothers and sisters if i go with the list there will be many of them but greg has been here cleaning up the trustees everybody was here but brother robert was something really special so we thank the officer the church and everything if you didn't give the money we would not be here so you obeyed god giving the money and the money turned into the material so we really thank you for everything god richly bless you i promise to read the quote to you you remember on sunday morning and i lost that coat i lost the coat and i began to search for it and instead of one i found four so you're gonna get those four coats you ready for them brother robert there is a picture brother kalima donate to the church from the field of fire i already ordered one of them but he already brought us something that is another one that is framed and everything we're planning on putting that on the hallway there but we have not placed it there it's still in the office for so for today if you can allow me let me put that picture right here let me identify with the pillar of fire and with the one that followed the pillar of fire amen down the road we're gonna put it there but just relax today let me put that picture here amen it's a special day so just chill out amen that's the picture so we gather for free and it's a donation for the church if you don't know this man you see me after church we'll talk to you about it amen do you like that picture amen blessed be the name of the lord so just for today let me have that picture over there there is still a lot of work to be done we're going to we are moving into the second stage so there are things that you can see why you're standing there kovids change a lot of stuff and it's making things in back order so just give us a couple weeks and things like that you will see a lot of things continuing to change in the uh building amen so we appreciate your patience and everything let me go straight ahead to that can everybody see this clear it works good without even a screen yet your projector is not here yet your screen is not here yet but we got something that looks pretty good let me go this way probably amen i'm right in front of the camera amen everybody there can you see that clear move the board can you help me move the board here i need my board [Music] amen that's pretty good right there yeah that will work everybody can see this clear blessed be the name of the lord in the message what here is that elijah brother branham say that i usually think this and i hope that if i'm wrong the lord will forgive me but i feel like you can have a better meeting in a church [Music] because in these big auditoriums and things they are all right to see the people but i hope it's not a superstition but it always seems to be to me there is so much wickedness going on in them places fight and gamble and whiskey and it just became a place where evil spirit hang out and it's amazing how we could be in a hotel with that kind of anointing amen around the church the holy spirit kind of sticks around i like to get around where the holy spirit is i feel more at home you know to be around where the holy spirit is and especially wherever the church is of course they bring the holy spirit with them we are grateful for that amen so if we have what we have there in the hotel our expectation should be amen i told you you have four of them you know i think some of the best meeting we ever have is in water sometime the meeting you know get to a place where crowds are great we can't get into a lot of churches and so forth or big churches but there is something about a church house i hope you won't think that i went off in on some tantrum since i've seen you last but you know i believe that a place a church is where god stays angels dwell among the churches amen it's a place that is dedicated to the service of god out in this auditorium and things hotel we found i'm just putting things i can slide the hotel there we found they have parties dances drinking and everything you feel the spirit that don't seem that don't seem right it just seems like it is uh otherwise the holy spirit always seems to work so much different when you are in a church you know somewhere especially in a good spirit-filled church where the people are filled with the holy spirit and great signs and wonders takes place amen i'm putting you on to this so your expectation goes up there is something about a church that is sacred i like a church don't you you know you go to this auditorium we appreciate them now they are nice and the people that let us have them the trustees and so forth trustees but look what they're the one responsible for it but look what you have there you have all kind of vulgarity brother chimp keep reminding this all the time he said brother stephen this is the hotel this is the hotel this is the water you have all kind of vulgarity entertainment or falcon of the world and demon spirit hang around there and it's just brought in by demon you get to a church the holy spirit is there you see it's just something different about the coming to our church anybody clear last one i didn't pray i didn't make it he gave me four i felt really honored tonight to come into a church like this i always feel better in a church than i do in those auditorium there is nothing against the auditorium but you know it may be a superstition seems to me like a truth you go into this into those auditorium where there is fight to wrestle burlesque everything else going on evil spirit seems to hang around them places now you may immed that may seem a superstition but it's not so but when you come into a church usually certainly a spiritual congregation it seems like you feel more at liberty like there is something the presence of god is there you know it seems to be different i don't know what effect the building has but it's where the people are congregated of course the same people are at the other places but on those evil ground amen so there is something special about church that makes the service of god go a little bit different and the lord has been gracious to us because we were in the transition place like the ark of the covenant was in the house of habitab and yet the lord blessed the house but he was not god's chosen place of worship so if the house of abinadab can be blessed how much more the temple of solomon amen in the temple of solomon the cloud came down so we want to thank god for giving us a building and now we are at home amen let's give him a praise offering again [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let's stand for our reading welcome to spoken word tabernacle amen you bear with me the work with the other microphone this is kinda new amen amen better amen luke chapter 16 verse 19. we read this the last time if you're there you can say amen [Music] there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple you might be seated brother do you have a sharpie it's right there in this scripture here there is if i put it here you won't be able to see it amen there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen this man is clothed in purple and fine linen and we know the end of this man he went into fire if he went into hell that means that his origin [Music] was not from god because the lord will lose none of this amen and we found him his clothes here in purple number one and in fine linen and fair sumptuously every day he was living lavishly clothes in purple fine linen and living lavishly amen the bible says in revelation 18 verse 7 how much she has glorified herself speaking about babylon and leave hell deliciously lavishly amen so much torment and sorrow gave her for she said in her heart i see a queen and i am no widow and shall see no sorrow she was living lavishly deliciously and by living that the lord said give her more torment more sorrow verse 16 and saying alas that great city we know a city this a woman that was clothed in water and in water so you can see the characteristic of the rich young man holder he's a child of babylon even though he knew the word of god because babylon has a religious spirit yet there are clothes in purple fine linen and leave her deliciously that's what happened to this young man now you can see if you have this kind of characteristic you go into torment and where do you expect this young man to go [Music] let's go back now there was a certain rich man that was close in purple and fine lenin and first sumptuously every day now you understand his origin where he's coming from brother david if this is making a lot of noise you want me to use the other one that's fine you tell me what to do we good you want me switch praise the name of the lord yes amen amen give me a little bit more so i blow him up amen blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah and there was a certain beggar named lazarus which was led at his gate full of soul and desiring to be fed with the crimes which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licks his sword and he came to pass that the beggar died if you notice they never say about burying him he's a beggar they can cast him anyway he didn't have that luxurious burial amen and it come to pass that the beggar died and was carried by angel that's the most important thing into abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was water because the burial was so big sumptuous everybody the entire city the mayor of the city the governor everybody was there but the other one was carried by angel didn't look big amen and in hell he lift up his eyes being in turman what i want you to understand is the story of this young man is the story of this rich man is the story of the rich young ruler okay you okay the rich young ruler when he came to jesus christ he proved to jesus that he followed the law everything right in line ever clear and jesus looked at him and loved him because he presented the law there's nothing wrong with the law i am the one who worried who who who created the law but when jesus put his microscope on ebay and begin to go down his life and look at the life he found what was wrong with that boy that prohibited him from receiving eternal life and his problem was what get your money and give it to who he had a problem with poor people [Music] brother branham put those two stories together and brother branham never explained you why those two story goes together if you don't understand this message relax anybody here so the problem with the rich young ruler was the problem with poor people and if you look at this rich man here his problem is there is a poor right there and still he doesn't want to share his money that's why jesus told him get the money share it together then follow me i'm gonna give you eternal life but if you remember last sunday for you to receive eternal life there must be something in you that's going to attract eternal life you must have eternal life in you for eternal life to come through you if you didn't have eternal life in you even though you facing eternal life eternal life will deviate because of where you come from amen and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torment and sees abraham and pharaoh and lazarus in his bosom that's another thing and he cry and say father abraham he also knew abraham in hell who taught him that was abraham he was in a different eophony okay we will get it down the road have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may deep tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in water he was given opportunity to meet eternal life he met eternal life he entertained with eternal life and then he turned his back on eternal life what caused him to reject eternal life at the beginning it seems like he wanted but when they presented to him he went back again and there are some people that seems like they don't want it [Music] but when they're gonna face eternal life you're gonna see their reaction what makes one behave one way and the other behave a different way [Music] the god who is rich in mercy let's go to hebrew chapter 6 blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah for you to get this kind of stuff you need a prophet amen i used to wonder i say why did brother branham put this story together why did brother branham put this story together and one day poverty poverty that's the connection you see the message is always perfectly in line with the scripture hebrew chapter 6 verse 7 for the earth which drinks in the rain that come often upon it and brings forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiving blessings from god what paul is saying here is people cultivate they have a field and they are sowing a certain seed because they are looking to receive something from that seed either for their meat or something that they want to use it so when the sauce seed remember last sunday we talked about the parable in matthew 13. there were two seed to sower everybody clear so when they sow they will receive that which they like if they sow wheat they're going to receive wheat if they sow corn they're going to receive corn and when they receive corn they bless the lord because that's what they were expecting but verse 9 verse 8 but that which bare thorns and briar is water so there is two seed here there is a good seed that is useful but there is another one that comes out we don't know who put it there but matthew 13 told us it's the enemy everybody clear and those thorn and briar are rejected and is near to cursing whose end is to through water there is one seed that needs to be used one seed to be used everybody the other seed is to be cursed and it doesn't stop at the cursing it need to be burned why do you want to burn this one let's go to revelation chapter one amen these are stuff hidden it's the book of esther that is bringing those stuff revelation 1 verse 13. brother can you put this board here because i can't go there just a little bit here you can face this way we need it in certain things you're going to understand the omniscient of god yes sir can you see up there just tilt it a little bit before i get in trouble you go back toward the pack push it toward the back yes sir yep everybody clear there thank you jesus revelation chapter 1 verse 13 if you dare you can say amen and in the midst of the seven candlestick one like the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the breast with a gordon girdle he's a judge anybody clear if you don't know it you read the seven church ages his head and his hair were white like wall oh my god the hair of this judge there is a judge he have hair his hair is white like wall when you take a picture you're going to see it white amen as white as snow and his eyes were as flame of fire like snow but his eyes are like flame of fire so he's not friendly really he's in anger he's a judge in anger anybody clear and his feet like to find brass judgment anybody clear brass represents judgment so this man this man is completely a judge he's not coming here for mercy and he's fit to find brass as if they were burned in a furnace he was in a furnace one time with the hebrew and his voice as the sound of many waters everybody clear let's go to revelation chapter 19. if you dare you can say amen then we will pray hallelujah revelation chapter 19 verse 11. we know in verse 8 we're talking about the bride the marriage of the lamb is in verse 7 and his wife has made herself ready everybody clear verse 9 is talking about being blessed which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb now in verse 11 the bible say i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true we know that person and in righteousness he does what and make water this man when he comes discharged he is coming not only to judge but for war everybody clear verse 12 his eyes were as water so you understand now by the scripture who he is here if his eyes turn like flame of fire then he's coming to judge and to make war if his eyes are natural and they are crying in front of lazarus grave then it's still mercy it is the same person but he can flip he can be a lion and he can also be a lamb it is the same throne the throne of mercy and the throne of judgment are the same throne it depends whether there is blood or not if there is blood it's the throne of mercy if the blood is taken off then it's the turn of judgment behold the lion of the tribe of judah here prevailed when john turned around he saw a lamb yet he was coming like a lion the announcement is a lion [Applause] the coming the coming is a coming of leo it's the lion we already touched the zodiac everybody clear back to john to john who's john who's john so to john to the bride that lion is not lying everybody clear when john look at the lion that lion have to immorphy [Applause] if you take john out of the way then he's a lion if you just present john the lion have to immortal quickly into a lambo and not only a lamb a bleeding lamb [Applause] anybody clear that judge [Laughter] verse 12 his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many clowns and he's and had a name written that no man knew but himself he himself and he was clothed with a vesture deep in blood he still have blood and his name is called the water in the beginning was though and the word was with and the word was and the word was made flesh and dwell on us in the person of who the father judges no man but he committed all the judgment to him anybody clear hallelujah and the army which were in heaven follow him upon white horses clothed in what fine linen white and clean we already know that's the righteousness of the sand so this man coming here is a judge he's coming to judge and to make war but even though he's coming to judge i mean to do judgment it depends on who he sees [Music] anybody clear it depends on who he is seeing [Music] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for giving us an opportunity to be able to worship you in this temple this tabernacle lord father that you have provided for your children lord this church was closed for many years and father you reserve it for your children because you knew the hidden plan of redemption that you had to unfold for your children at the appropriate time and when time came there was no devil in hell that could close or block or lord father block or inhibit your children to be able to gather here today and father to worship you lord if there is anything that we did that we grieve the holy spirit father you know the desire of our heart it is nothing but to serve you lord may you forgive us and may you move us completely away may the holy spirit come and speak to your children may the devil be completely sealed out but may only the holy spirit can come and minister to your children with the holy angels of god father we commit all unto the hand even those that are streaming in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you amen last sunday we were in part three on the second death we were dealing with the origin we finished the origin of the vessels of mercy and there were also vessels of water of wrath origin part two you can call the other one part one we found out that when man is created men have three parts men have the spirit and the soul which makes the spiritual part of man and the body which make the natural part of man everybody clear then we were dealing with death in the natural in the natural we spoke that death effect as the first death or the second death and we explain to you that the first death deal with the body is the destruction of the body that activate the skin worm everybody clear but death in the spiritual is something else it deals with the spiritual aspect of a human being brother branham says that just refreshing he said if there is one death we know about it then there's got to be another death somewhere because one death we died here in the flesh that's the first death the second death we die it in the spirit and the soul and we explained to you on sunday last week that for you to destroy somebody completely you must give him the first death and the second death anybody but the only one that can give both those death is the lord jesus christ satan can give you the first death and he stopped there because he's your his kingdom or his power and it's right there but the lord goes beyond that everybody clear so the second death that affected the spiritual man in isaiah chapter 33 verse 22 the bible said for the lord is our judge america the lord is our law giver so this judge is not only a judge but he's also a lawgiver he's the one that give his own law ever clear that's why when he needed a propitiation for sin he have to fulfill his own law everybody here the lord is our lord give our lord giver the lord is our king amen so to us god is the judge to us god is a lord giver and to us god is also our king but he will save us so even though he is a judge even though he is a law giver even though he's a king our his purpose toward us is salvation ever clear in james chapter 4 verse 12 the bible says there is how many law givers one who is there the lord there is one lord giver who is able to save and to do whatever so this law giver have the power of life and the power of death ever here but when it comes to us he only have one option everybody clear why does he want to destroy why and how does he destroy in deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 24 the bible says for the lord that god is a consuming water so somebody will be born anybody even a jealous god hallelujah first king chapter 18 verse 38 then the fire of the lord fell let's see that consumption and consume consume what the burn sacrifice which is flesh and the wood which is burning the trees and the stone everybody and the dust that's why peter said the element of the earth will melt here and lick up the water that's why in the new jerusalem we won't have water here so this fire of god is a powerful fire it's a fire that can destroy the flesh and consume it it's a fire that can destroy the wood and consume completely make everything vanish it's a fire that can destroy even the stone and the dust and it can also leak water because normally if you put water in the fire the water will kill the fire but this one if you bring water it suck the water out and the water disappear anybody clear it is like the road of moses when moses throws his road down ever clear the road of moses have the ability to swallow the other two serpent and the other two serpents disappear and the only one remain was there ever here in other words another way the broad of moses seems to be the one that can generate the two roads do you follow me do you follow me if you are taking a camera and you are recording moses before pharaoh you're gonna see the two snake of janice and chambers being swallowed up do you follow me if you reward your tape you're going to see those two snakes coming out of one snake everybody so the snake of moses has a power to swallow up and yet it remain itself and if you search the other snake you don't see them anymore that's why moses have the power of creation everybody here the god of moses could bring a plague and he was also able to remove the plague and but here he can generate something and he can suck it out and make it disappear everybody clear this is meat amen matthew 10 say and feel not them which can kill the body but i'm not able to kill the soul we know them but rather feel him which is able to destroy both the soul and the body so if the soul the spiritual part of man everybody which is the soul combined with the spirit and the natural part of man which is the flesh or the body why does god want to destroy the flesh and the ba and the soul why what is the purpose amen because there are certain people where god can allow their body to be destroyed everybody here but the destruction of the soul goes after the destruction of the body amen but instead of those people to be destroyed on the spiritual part god said no i'm going to raise them back up everybody in john chapter 3 verse 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not work but have eternal water can you destroy somebody that have eternal life so there is somebody that wants to contact god you they can never perish everybody they can have their first death but the devil will never push it to the next one hallelujah in john chapter 6 verse 34 and this is the father will what is the father world which has sent me that of all which he has given me i should lose water but you do what again in the last so instead of destroying somebody they are a certain group of people that god cannot destroy them amen god can allow them to be put to sleep under death but god is obligated to raise them back up again about here blessed be the name of the lord this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which sees the son and believe on him may have eternal life ever here and i will raise him up at the last day no man can come to me except the father which sent me joseph and i will raise him up at the water so there is a category even though you die you will never receive the destruction of the soul god will raise you back up but why does god want to destroy somebody else and want to keep the other one up anybody clear john chapter 11 verse 25 jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believes in me though he will work yet shall do what i am the one who decide who to raise up i am the boss everybody here and whosoever liveth and believe in me shall never work believe that peace so if somebody believe on the lord jesus christ and receive eternal life that man will never die that's why christians don't die christians sleep here the resurrection to a christian is an awakening from sleep ever here that's why christians die easily because they are sleeping you don't sleep jumping out and you go to sleep no no no no no a christian goes to sleep peaceful [Music] everybody so whosoever liveth and believe if it means shall never die so there are certain people that will never die [Music] why do you want to destroy the soul revelation 2 11. now baccala pretty good he that has a knee let him hear what the spirit say unto the churches he that of the cometh shall not be heard of the water so there is a category of people in this planet earth that will never experience the second death and the one that will not experience the second death is the one that overcometh hallelujah [Music] blessed and holy is he that part in the first water remember i told you to understand the second death you need to understand resurrection and the origin anybody clear who who wears up in the first resurrection hallelujah on such the second death has no power but there shall be what of god and and shall reign with him and what who's going to reign a thousand year with the lord we already explain it to you it is the bride of jesus christ they are priests because he made us priests and what under the order of melchizedek ever here so whoever is part of the blood will never face the second death in other words your soul and your spirit cannot be destroyed god himself cannot destroy you because you came from god if god destroyed you he's destroying himself ever clear we were in the mind of god the reason why he has mercy on you because you are his son you have a representation in god and if god destroys you he destroys himself but god is eternal and you also you are eternal and eternal cannot be destroyed because you belong to god you shall never see the second death ever clear you don't have to worry about the second death because you are in christ in other words your soul that's why he said fear knows the one who can destroy your body but cannot touch this one ever here not the soul ever clear hallelujah revelation 21 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give him i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life howe put your car in neutral he that overcometh shall inherit how and i will be his and he shall be mine watch verse 8 but the fearful we cannot be afraid that's why brother branham said god cannot use coward they're fearful and the unbelieving and the abominable and the murderers like kane and the whole mongers and their sorcery and idolater and all water shall have their part in the lake which burneth with and brimstone which is the second so the category of people that are destroyed by the second death are those that are bad yet we also did things that were bad we also were in the world we were drinking smoking doing all kinds of stuff why is that one destroying you not destroyed in revelation 20 verse 11 it is the great white throne buckle up and i saw a great one through white throne which is the throne of judgment all right and him that sat on him from whose face the earth and the heaven did what so his face went to heaven look at him they run away everybody here because he's coming as a church he's not playing game ever here and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and water if you notice at the white throne judgment the dead had different edges everybody clear at the rapture everybody have the same age when brother branham went to hell brother branham saw young people and old people but if you die in christ automatically you remain younger ever clear so this white throne judgment is not for you because he that believes on me you have passed from what death and to life you will never be charged again [Applause] everybody clear because your judgment he took it at the cross when he went at the cross he was judging your place here the punishment of you fell upon him and by his trap we are wiper you can never be judged again [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah do you know what you're going to do there do you know what you're gonna be doing there if god is eternal you are eternal everybody if god is god you are a child of god you are god everybody if god is a judge who are you going to be there the bible says there is only one judge but you gonna judge yourself going to be judges at the white throne judgment because the scripture says the saint will do what judge the earth you're not going to be judged but you're going to be the one doing the water [Applause] [Music] you don't know who you are you are the possessor of heaven and nothing you are gods you are deity you can send somebody to hell and you can also tell god not this one hallelujah hallelujah abraham wrestle with god and say not lord and the bible say god remember abraham not a lot hallelujah when the three when the three friend of job sinned god never told them ask me forgiveness he said go to job and let job pray for you and i'm gonna heal job if job don't pray for you i am going to destroy you i'll be malek when abraham lied [Applause] [Music] abraham was in error god he said you know my integrity god said i know but go to that liar if he doesn't pray for you you are demon abraham have to pray to remove the wrath of god [Applause] hallelujah you don't know who you are you underestimate yourself too much because you're looking at the flesh look at the inside man it is god in blessing and blessing our water i will bless you in the water [Applause] everybody if you bless abraham god bless you and if you curse abraham god curse you god will be the enemy of the enemy of abraham [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Laughter] blessed be the name of the lord i don't know what time is it i'm even in i'm just in a quarter i saw the dead small and great stand before who so they were alive and the books were open and another book was open they want you to know particularly is a certain book which is the book of water and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the water according to the water they were judged according to the works but the bible says god save you by grace so that it should not be by work so that nobody will do what so why is god judging by works now he said abraham not by works i am the one i saw by myself not you but in the white stone judgment he's looking at the work the work toward who [Applause] what they did to god what they were doing toward god which work is god looking at them [Music] [Applause] can i jump ahead can i jump ahead and come back when paul meets the pillar of fire he says so why have that do what where did paul persecute jesus christ show me one scripture where jesus and paul met paul saw jesus in a vision but jesus said you are persecuting me when did you see paul whipping jesus christ paul was paul was persecuting somebody but when he touched that person he touched jesus christ in other words that person was jesus when paul was arresting believers he was arresting jesus christ they are judged by their works which works and the sea gave up the dead so some people died in the sea which were in there and the dead and death and hell the grave delivered up the dead everybody is bringing a deposit this is what i have this is what i have everybody which were in them and they will judge every man according to the water [Music] they were not judged like you were judged they were judged according to their works their words toward who because everybody goes to church this morning a lot of people are in churches everybody and being in churches they're going to go in hell the rich young ruler have all the law he was doing everything perfectly and he went to hell [Music] because when god was immortal in flesh [Music] when he contacted god in flesh he gave god in flesh the back [Music] matthew 25 [Music] anybody clear what a place to worship god if you dare you can say amen verse 31 they were judged by water [Music] why christian is faith you ready [Music] verse 31. thank god i was looking at 24. amen blessed be the name of the lord when the son of man the word shall come in his glory and all all the holy angel with him then shall he sit upon though of his water which throne is it he's sitting there as a judge and before him shall we gather all nations everybody why because they see gave up the hell and death gave up because everything will be destroyed [Music] everybody here everything will be destroyed in armageddon it will be only the ashes of the weekend now they're going to resurrect everything back all the nation before him before the white throne so how are you going to judge them amen hallelujah and their all nations gather and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd which he is divide his sheep from the water so in this right judgment there will be two categories god will take the nation and split them who's gonna go to the right who's gonna go to the left everybody verse 33 and he shall say the sheep on his water and but they got underwater so you can see the two end of the zodiac [Music] here it's it's a judge but the same judge the same problem can be the throne of judgment and the throne of water so on the right hand is mercy on the left hand is what on the right lame lamb over here liona [Music] anybody here why is he lamb on the right hand because he islam to jonah [Music] when john look at him i'm lame john disappear i'm a lion but when he's on the white throne judgment john the bride is sitting with him when he look over there he turned his right hand into a lambo and hear a liona why is he turning into a lamb towards somebody who's not the bride [Music] are you ready are you ready is everybody there okay 34 then shot the water remember our judge is our lord he is our king remember now the king said to them on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepare from you from the foundation of the water so the people in the right hand that are not part of the bride they also had a place before the foundation of the world brother kelly [Applause] it is just a different category [Music] make sense [Music] the bread has a place before the foundation of the world these people also have a place before the foundation of the world but they are not the bread because the bread is judging them when jesus went into heaven he sat at the right hand on left hand because the right hand symbolized the power and on the right hand is what [Music] everybody then the king 34 say to them on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepare from you from be from the foundation of the world for hours water who was hungry jesus can you read the scripture with me who was hungry who's talking jesus said i jesus i was hungry okay i was hungry and you gave me what can god lie so these people sat and they said wait a minute but we never seen you [Music] you say me and you met jesus said yes me and you men and you are hungry jesus said yes i was hungry but i never seen you in america i was living in charlotte my address was this i never seen somebody that looked like you i never seen your face you sent me and you meet and you were hungry and i gave you food where is my wife did you ever prepare food for this man and i was not at home did you use my credit card to send him a delivery the wife said i don't know i never seen him but he's saying here that we gave him food jesus said yes you gave me food i even love that food i hate it thank you very much for helping me when i was hungry the man scratched his head hallelujah when i was thirsty and you gave me what he said come on now come on you're going too far number one i don't remember giving you food now you adding that i give you something to drink jesus said yes hallelujah i was a stranger and you took me in which house and when i was in health i have only one house i never lodged somebody in my house when i have guests they go to the hotel so when did that put you in my house everybody naked and you clothed me oh now you you you you are exaggerating so you mean you came to me naked you see now i was sick and you visited me hold on you're one person the first one i never did it with you the second i never did the third you keep adding every year i was in prison and you come to me sir i've never been in prison all my life i was never arrested so when did me and you meet in prison brother kelly where did jesus and that person meet in prison hallelujah then shall the righteous answer him he's a righteous why did he miss the brother if he was watched why didn't he get into the blood what makes him righteous who declared him to be righteous why is god calling him righteous he is standing in judgment but he is not part of the brother who gave him that righteousness because if he took the righteousness of christ paul said the righteousness of christ in romans 1 is revealing the gospel but he is in the judgment who makes him righteous anybody clear lord then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when so were you hungry and fed you so they don't remember they don't have any face of off man ahead feeding them and you're thirsty and gave you drink when so were you a stranger and you took you and took you in or naked and clothed you and one saw you so when you seek and in prison and came to you verse 14 and the king shall answer and say to them verily i say unto you in as much as you have done it to run off the water of my home [Music] [Music] keep your finger right there open everyone [Music] and i had more than this hebrew chapter one verse 8 you there and to the who to the son who's the son he says your true no god so that son is a god am i me and my father we are is forever and heaven a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom you have loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even your how many god do we have o has announced you with the oil of water above your water so jesus is not the only one he has brothers [Music] i'm reading your scripture but jesus is just the top brother the big brother because we are joined here with him everybody here now let's go back to matthew 24 25 verse 40 and the king shall answer and say to them verily i say unto you in as much as you have done it to one of the least of these marijuana you know who the brethren is now [Music] so there is a difference when you say you have done in my brethren who live in charlotte everybody but if brother kalim is sitting with me right here when i'm talking to brother kalima and i'm talking to brother greg i'm saying brother greg i thank you so much for helping brother kalima amen this brother calima so in this white room brother's wedding the bread is there and jesus is telling me what you did to this what you did to my wife you are doing that to who the way you treated my wife the way you treated my child the way you treated my brother and my little sister you were actually treating me and because you treat them right when i was discussing with you they were whispering in my [Applause] ear are you there when i saw you she went to my ear [Music] are you there [Applause] when i went to that department everybody treated me bad that day and this woman came up and said what is wrong come here let me help you sit down what can i do for you ma'am next time when you come call me i will help you this is health are you there they never receive the gospel they never received the message of the hour everybody but they respected the message in flesh and when they were respecting the message in flesh the message began to talk back to god like this one man was nice to me when they wanna fire me that supervisor say no she said i notice you a good young sister there's something special about you they're not gonna fire you i'm gonna talk to the boss [Music] so the way somebody treats you in this life it will determine it is showing up their origin [Applause] here doesn't persecute elect somebody who came from god even though he's not part of the brother he will behave differently [Music] hallelujah and one of the male factors one of the good church member one of the preacher one of the holy sisters in our neighborhood a thief a manufacturer which were water that's why brother branham say judah hanging himself is a cross and saying if that be christ saved us helping us mocking him [Music] but on the other answering rebuke him saying does not that feel who he was talking to who he didn't know god was ready sitting down in the same condemnation there is something about a child or a seed that came from god that recognized error even though they are in arrow something is still just to them hallelujah and we indeed justly for we have received the do what of our water so what work did they have bad works everything they done was bad how can somebody 100 bad sleep to heaven [Music] but this who has done what all he said is we did good i don't even know this man but this man done what but the pharisees were crucifying him but this fifth had enough says to sit down and watch and say the way they're treating this man is now right even though the pharisees are saying he's a bad man but this man did what just saying that in his sin [Applause] and he said unto him lord who told him he was lord who told him jesus was lord [Music] he says this man then he turn around and something flashing him he said lord remember me who told him this man has the power to remember him because the lord remember abraham [Music] remember me when the cameras in their water so who told this man jesus was god a faith receiving a revelation of deity at the cross [Applause] preach him the gospel [Music] who gave him the [Music] scripture and jesus said unto him verily i said unto whom when that shall be with me in water jesus turn around and look and say wait a minute turn on the microphone turn on the microscope the engine bring the lens and put it there jesus look he said give me the dna test quick they brought the dna they gave it to him he said draw his blood when they pulled his blood then look his blood is matching jesus [Applause] [Music] i am in the corner of what i prepared today jesus said i am the one who sent john to say people need to be baptized my disciple also baptized i baptize my disciple but this one he's never here uh what is the requirement he must be baptized and repent remove all of that remove all of that what else [Applause] [Music] am i preaching something strange hallelujah the angel said where a minute he needs to be baptized he said not this one the time is gone give him a free person let him pass that way hallelujah when he got into paradise he opened the door abraham came he said who are you he said i am a thief abraham said what he said a fifth a fifth yes a fifth in this place yes he taught me to come there [Applause] hallelujah who gave him eternal life [Music] what did he do let's finish with this because i can't even move the time is right okay i'm i'm just one a quarter i can't move let's go to first seminar if i continue you're going to stay

finish our united states rocket you finish all russian rocket and none of them will come like this [Music] what a rocket a rocket that matches off my head [Music] let's go to first samuel chapter 30 turn to the right jesus looking at the right first time you're chapter 30 i gotta stop here if not and it came to pass if you dare you can say amen david and his men were come to ziglag on the third day that the amalekite has invaded the surf and ziggler and smith and ziggler and burn it with water verse two and had taken the women captive that were darwin they slew not any nobody was killed either great or small but carried them away and went under so devi then his men came to the city and behold it was what so this city called ziglag david and his men went and their family and the lodge there and david and his men left and they left the women with the children and when they left the women with the children the amaleki the people of heaven [Music] the people of heaven because amen is dealing with the amalekites the last specie that was staying that has to be killed by a woman that was the eighth war of amalek with god it's esther but esther must make sure she consume all the amalekites because saul missed them and they keep going on her back here so the amalekite came and destroyed the city didn't kill anybody pick up the women and say whoa we got so much wealth and all these women for us they begin to go with the women when david came his wife his children they sold your wife everybody gone they see the burn they say they kill everybody david verse 3 and his man came to the city and behold he was born with fire and their wife their son and their daughter were taken captive then david and the people that were with him lift up their voice and did what until they had no more power to what david wept wept wept until there was no more tears why because my children killed my wife killed everybody's gone even what i have is god everybody was weeping verse five and david two wives were taken captive ahinoam the jesuit an abigail the wife of neighbor the carmelite and david was greatly distressed for the people spoke of stoning him they turned around they said you see you took us to an adventure look what happened now we lost everything because the soul of the people was grieved every man for his son and for his daughter but david encouraged himself in the lord he is what in a hard situation his own church turned against him and david pulled back up and change the weapon he said this ordinary weapon let me put it again i'm in emergency case he pulled the bazooka and put it there you ready [Music] and david said to abayata the priest a he malek son i pray you bring me the effort here there is a mystery to the earphone and alberto brought from there the effort to david and david inquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them they want to follow them maybe for vengeance to kill them didn't know nothing was lost now god unfolded to him that i protected everybody because david became more rich than before after this battle if you read it at home i was just doing that so i can bless them all but not only that there is a mystery watch it hey and he answered verse 8 him this is the lord answering pursue for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover what in other word god opened to david that everything is there relax get more strength your children are there your wives are there your daughters are there and all your military servant nobody in your church is lost they are all preserved go you're going to pursue them did god give him the direction why didn't god tell him god this right and they went this white and pursued them did god gave david a gps so how does david know which direction the man went let's look at the gps you ready now brother robert you ready okay watch this maybe he already jumped ahead of me verse nine so david went he and six hundred men

servant of a water so his ownership he belongs to what an amalekite as a servant the servant of himalaya or two in america and my my master did what because three days ago i felt what so something happened in the camp of the amalekite you ready not everybody that was in the amalekite camp was a malachite [Music] he was an egyptian but he found himself in the midst of a malachite but he was not an amalekite [Music] brother kelly he was not a child of disobedience he was among the children of disobedience so whatever their male can't do he's doing it because he belong to a master that is controlling him so for god wanted to destroy amalek because god saw that i'm gonna wipe amalek off when god checked the zone of amalek something said god said what is that they look they say he is not one of them [Music] everybody here they say who there is somebody there that his dna is not amalek amalek you can destroy them and wipe them away but not that one god said who is it an egyptian he's still having a different identity what can we do call hell call hell quickly what is wrong again chief i need somebody to strike him with sickness he'll say boss i'm going to send him are you there a demon flying quickly and hit not amalekite only the stranger [Music] and when the sickness hit him the america to look and say ah i can continue with this kind of guy let's go on his deliverance came by sickness [Applause] sometimes god does things strange in your life it is not to destroy you it is just a way to separate you because he want to rescue you [Applause] your friend drunk they keep drinking but when you get drunk they have to take you to the hospital [Applause] to separate you from that crowd are you there [Music] hallelujah watch we verse 14 we he put himself in the midst of the america we made an invasion upon the staff of the character we went to the nightclub together we were drinking together david look he said look at him he's using the red we we we like he was part of him and upon the coast which belonged to judah and upon the south caleb and we burned ziglag with fire here [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah okay and david said to him can you bring me down to this water i got a gps i have been following these people i can't find them do you know where they went because you were among them if you have a master that you felt sick he left you to die and go was that a good master so a male an egyptian under a bad master but they have to change a master [Music] can i continue hallelujah this church my god and david said to him can you bring me down to this company and he said swear to me by who how did an egyptian know the god of israel he didn't say swam me by the god of egypt david thank god you already show me kindness i'm alive swear me not by the egyptian i found reality serve me by your god amen why do you want david to swear swear for what swear to me by god that you will need a director i want enough i don't want your word off you must swear by yourself [Music] that if i become your servant you're not gonna kill me death will have no more power over me [Music] albert here karma no dude deliver me to the hand of what i hated my master though do me two things to my master we are separated we die i die to my master don't revive me again back to the master in other words david keep me with you and i will bring you down to this water before i become your servant swear to me like ray have the prostitute before you go stop give me a water i already did something good to you i already did something good to you i hide you i heed you don't go who todd did joshua taught despite to save somebody over there who gave the spies power to save somebody [Music] and when they told joshua joshua never argue are you there when they begin to destroy jericho joshua said stop where are the two spies come here you too go get here not me joshua you too you who gave him life oh jericho was destroyed except the house of herrera but she was a prostitute he was an egyptian let's resume and go back and finish stop somewhere amen the man was found sick three days and three nights and they gave him weather and bread hallelujah hallelujah my brother the place he wants to be credited today is in your own being your own heart that he might display from you the waters of water to a perishing people and the bread of water to a starving people he was both perishing and starving somebody needs to be buffed water and he is the bread and the water which is the true water essential thing to remain water so when david rescued that man he begin to give him what is essential first to bring him life what is the holy ghost when was the little one what was the holy ghost given for [Music] the principle of the foundation of dead work but let us go unto he is our bread god's bread and water for us he is the center the only place that you can come and get it is from him god's house in the person of jesus christ our bethlehem bread and waters of eternal water he was the word made flesh he is the word made flesh he is the word the bread and the water that makes him our bethlehem our place of bread and water the only place of water so the first thing david saw this man give him water and bread give him eternal life anybody here but don't stop there he need to go a little further he need the dessert [Music] do you know what the dessert is when you eat and you finish eating the dessert is made of things that are sweet [Music] and the dessert comes at the last place hallelujah brother burnham i have looked around on the map i have been to fresno and iran ram firing it and just got here you know they always say the best is and serve the best for what is that what it is the world give him first eternal life and then when he is reversed then bring him the best that was saved for lust [Music] they gave people wine and a marriage but the best one was kept what [Music] the desert is the meal that closes everything when you eat and you are at the point of finishing to leave the table and go to your home that gives you dessert the dessert is the concluding meal the dessert is the cupping meal the bread the bread will give you this but you need the dessert to cup your food are you there you need the dessert to cup to make your meal perfect if you only take the bread and one you are right here but to bring perfection to the meal you must have dessert and it's always kept at last and dessert is made of something that is sweet when john was invited to take the book and to eat the book the book was sweet as army are you there are you there when they gave him the dessert the man revolved about here and when the man revolved hallelujah god brought him sickness are you there bread brought him sickness to put him there his sickness was not unto death [Music] that's why when they said lazarus is dead jesus said that sickness lazarus is sick jesus said that sickness is not unto what how many days lazarus died when did the day david found this man [Music] that sickness was not untrue the sickness of this egyptian was not unto it was god pulling that seed out to change him from the old master to the new master before he destroyed the amalekite are you there he was a servant to him an amalekite in first samuel chapter 15 and the lord sent it on a journey and said go and not only destroy the weather the water so a malacata water you are servant to sin but god calls something in your life to rescue you from the amalekite [Music] and when they rescue you they gave you the water they gave you the bread and they pulled down their dessert hallelujah know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servant you are to whom you obey whether to water a male cat and to what you were under a male cut it will bring you to death that's why he left to die die there we don't need you anymore but your sickness was not unto all of forbidden unto what but god be think that you were the servant of water this egyptian was a servant to an america but he have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered unto when they gave him bread he begin to eat the bread of david [Music] hallelujah so when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto you but for the glory of what that the son of god might be water hallelujah let me cap here being then made free from water free from the america he become servant of what now she is a servant of david everybody clear i speak after the manner of man because of the infirmity of your flesh as he have yielded your member servant to water and they are malachite and to the iniquity and to what you were working for in america even so now yield your member seven to who to david unto what for when you were the servant of sin amalekite you were free from water but now being made free from the amalekite and become servant to david ye have your fruit and to water and the end everlasting water [Music] hallelujah they rescued him from there and put him there he said wait a minute david saw to me that you won't kill me and don't deliver me back to the my master don't take me no never let me again go back again to the life that i was living and lead us not unto water but deliver us unto water don't kill me i want you to swear there's a soul no death for you and you will never go back to your first master you will never go back to the world again and you will never die because you have been predestinated for life you were among the children of disobedience but you are not a child of disobedience and the god who's reaching mercy jump down come to your life rescue you change ownership so from now on you begin to serve him he became the gps to david to lead him unto the amalekite hallelujah hallelujah the destruction of the amalekite of the wrong seed was upon this man that was part of the amaleki i'm finished the destruction of egypt was in the hand of moses who grew in the palace of pharaoh until when the daughter of gesture saw him when they give report they say an egyptian savers but he was not an egyptian [Music] are you there he was among the egyptians but he was not an egyptian to destroy
