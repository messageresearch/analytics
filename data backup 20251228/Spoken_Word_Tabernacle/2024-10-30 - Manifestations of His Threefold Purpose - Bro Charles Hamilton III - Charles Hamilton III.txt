word ready for the Mana that has no expiration date for the for for the wine the the stimulation of the revelation of Jesus Christ amen amen I want to start with uh brother brother Robert's testimony gave me a scripture and and you know that song only believe you know that's that's all we have to do is just believe you know it's it's it's very simple the Lord doesn't look fulfilling the believe in his word and his word is the obsolete amen amen that's exactly right so that um because of that testimony I want to read a scripture I want to go to if I open your scripture it's going to be 2 Corinthians 4 verse 18 amen when you get there say amen amen all right while we look not at the things which are seen But after the things which are not seen but for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal am amen you may be seated May amen so the things that are not seen are Eternal that's right and we know that before the foundation of the world the lord had us in the back part of his mind and we know that that when the situation may look one way we're not looking at that situation we're looking at the promise that the Lord has made for us you see and and just like you know what did what how did Paul look at the situation when situation came upon him he L at he looked at the promise that the lord gave him see see when something happens see it see if Satan don't hold back I'm not going to hold back okay I'm not if Satan if if Satan is going to try and and and and and stop me from preaching this word I'm going to preach with all that amen amen see I'm going preach I'm going to preach this way with authority because the Lord has given me that Authority before the foundation of the world I was a Son of God and and and in job 38:7 he said where were you when the when when the stars was when the stars gave Praises in the in the in the sons of God singing see that was get that was us right there that was me see because and we know the Stars when when God had Abraham look at the stars he said though those were us that that was a seed see and if we're that seed that Faith seed that means that when when Satan's lie came and took those third part of those Stars see we were the ones who fought against him see we were the ones who kicked him in the mouth and put him down here and and and and uh on the world see see because because the Lord said our feet will be on the neck of our enemies see see see death words thy death wears thy Victory grave death wears thy steam grave wears thy Victory amen amen so um I want to go to a to a to a message that uh brother brandham uh preached um uh on uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed see um see okay U my title is manifestation of his threefold purpose amen we are the manifestations of that okay so so it it reads it reads uh that was his one of his great three-fold purposes which to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ see and we know that see secondly to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that in his bride that he might live in people see first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have preeminence by this in his church which is his body his bride so he could have the preeminence to express himself through them all right and thirdly to restore the kingdom to rly position that fell by sin by the first adom back to where he walked in the cool of the evening evening with him and his people talked with them fellowship with them amen that's what we're Believing on amen amen amen uh I want to go to I want to go to Ephesians 1 four four the five amen amen see Satan is just a tool see he he's just a tool to express what God has in US amen amen because because in in the Garden of Eden we know that that when when when Eve fell see God knew it was going to happen see the whole purpose for the fall was because if everything was perfect how could he Express himself to human how could he Express himself to us if everything was perfect it couldn't happen that way it wouldn't it work amen amen I got to get there myself Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1:4 when you get there say amen amen amen all right it reads according as he hath chosen Us in him yes sir before the foundation of the world see before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ am to himself see according to the good pleasure of his will see it was his will for this to happen it was his will for us to express Christ on Earth amen amen and and and what is what is Christ Christ means anointed one see we are to be Anointed with with with God see because because we are God that's that's amen amen amen amen uh just drop drop to verse n see having made known unto us the mystery of his will the mystery of his will so the mystery of his will to express Christ amen the mystery amen the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purpose in himself see it's him that does it we don't we don't do it because we weren't worthy see the lamb had to take the book because no man was worthy to take the book see in man because because we were born by sex we're not not worthy amen amen um and and then it says in that dispensation of the fullness of times see in the fullness of times which is now that he might gather together in one all things in Christ all things in Christ in one both which are in heaven and both and both which are on earth even in him amen amen amen I want to go to I I want to go to um Ezekiel 4 I mean I sorry Isaiah 14 I'm sorry Isaiah 14 because we know that Christ is the mystery of God revealed and that if Christ see it didn't say Jesus is the mystery of Christ revealed Christ is the mystery of of God revealed because Christ is the anointing and we are to have that anointing to express Christ see so we are the mystery of God revealed because what what what was in in in in Revelations 5 when the book when see it wasn't a literal book God doesn't need a book it wasn't a literal book the book was the revelation of God the book was Christ see that's exactly what it was because no man see when it says no man could open the book see we we always was open the book of pages of the Bible wasn't talking about a little book it was talking about the revelation of what it means to be God Amen and and what does it mean to be God Amen and that's what those seven seals are see because because our Prophet told us that brother Benham told us that that that that that seven seal when it was silent see that was Christ see he said that was Jesus that was Christ amen amen uh let's go I'm Isaiah 14 Isaiah 14 amen amen help me Lord amen Isaiah 14 I want to start at verse four amen it says that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon and say how hath the oppressor ceased the Golden City he ceased the Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked see staff is that the strength the power amen and the scepter of the rulers see that's the law the scepter of the rulers see we're over the law see because of of uh uh uh an Esther and Esther when um King King King King azerus when he said I give I give unto you half of the Kingdom the kingdom is thy kingdom come thy will be done that's the Holy Ghost see and we're over the law because of that amen so um uh six he who smoke the people in Wrath with a continual stroke he exactly he that rued the nations in anger and persecuted none and none hindereth see that's the seal also amen the whole earth is at rest and his quiet they break forth into singing yay the fur trees Rejoice at thee in The Cedars of Lebanon saying since since thou are laid down no fellas has come up against us uh I want to drop down I want to drop down to let's drop down to 12 drop down to 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down on the ground which thou did weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven and I will exalt my throne above the stars of God see that's us see I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high see his whole goal was to was to be above God amen amen and and I want to go to uh Ezekiel 2817 amen amen Ezekiel 287 amen when you get there say amen amen it reads thine heart was lifted up because of thy because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground and I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee we know that we are Kings and Priests in Christ because of the M mesc priesthood we know that with with understanding what it means to be God with understanding with that seven seal being revealed in us because we are are Christ The Mystery of God revealed we know that because because of that we are Kings we are priests so we know that when we rule Satan is going to be cast down amen and and we're going to uh uh uh uh uh What uh help me Lord help me Lord um uh what is it the the the Millen Millennium rule amen thank you in the in the Millennium rule he's going to be B bound up and as Kings and Priests we're going to rule amen amen now I want to I want to read from uh the questions and answers law having a shadow um brother bam says and Michael the Archangel the great one that stands in the presence of God and his angels fought against Satan and his angels the red dragon that was the church that's led by the Holy Spirit and the angels of God fought against the organization and his angels and Ministers of light that was us see seeing how seeing how see how it was perfect if they're speaking of something up into Glory it's thinking of the Spiritual Beings in Rome the red dragon that stood before the woman to devour her children amen I was uh I was reading I've been reading recently the book of Acts and I've I've read it before but I'm I'm reading it again and as I'm reading it I'm the Lord the Lord just shown me that the second book of Acts is supposed to happen because they understood they caught the revelation after after God after Jesus left of what it means to express Christ and with that they worked signs they did wonders and they were able to have boldness see they were so bold to the point to where when the when the the the his when Phillip's no when Steven's persecutors persecuted him in the in the in the uh in the court that instead of answering them he gave him a whole sermon like he preached to them a whole sermon instead of answering the question so he answered the question in the sermon he told them the all the Old Testament up to that point then I was like wow see that's boldness see we ought to have that boldness amen because we have the revelation of who we are see we're being told who we are see if if if we can see the the the five garments of of Joseph in our lives then we must be able to we must be able to apply that and we must be able to see where we are in our own lives and that also means that if we're looking at those Seven Seals that means that if we can see the the five garments of Joseph in our lives those Seven Seals must be brought in our lives as well because it's personal it's it's it's individual God God works with with with Israel as a church he works with the Gentiles as individuals amen amen so I want to go to uh Ephesians 5 uh 8- 18 Ephesians 58-18 we get there say amen for ye for ye were sometimes for ye were sometimes Darkness but now ye are light in the in the Lord walking as children of light amen for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and TR truth that's right proving what is acceptable unto the Lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them amen for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret amen but all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspect not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time see walking circumspectly meaning we're walking carefully see in all things we we we look and see so when something happens Lord why is this happening Lord why why am I in this predicament what are you trying to show me see you go when when something happens to say you don't want to happen or say um something something bad happens um process of process of elimination Lord did I do something wrong if you see that your life lines up Lord what are you trying to show me oh what is the lesson in this amen amen and then then it says uh Redeeming the time because the days are evil amen wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is amen and the will of the Lord amen the whole purpose that I I'm trying to get the whole thought that I want to express tonight is that the we want to get the will of the Lord that that's that's what I want to focus on Amen let's go to um Psalms 3723 because if you have the will of the Lord if you know that still silent voice when all the Thundering is going on just like when when uh when uh Elijah was in the cave all the thunderings all the winds all the hows was was was going on yes we know that's how the Lord speaks but Lord how are you speaking to me personally see that's the still smiling voice amen and that's will personally for you what to Psalms Psalms 37:23 amen yes sir amen amen amen all right I want to are we get there say amen amen all right it reads the step of a good man are ordered by the Lord and He deliver and he delighteth in his way amen so we know that our steps are ordered of the Lord so we know that whatever happens whatever is going on in our in our lives that all things work together for the good of those that love the Lord that walk in the spirit and that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen which are in Christ Jesus amen which are in Christ Jesus see because we know that when you're hearing the word and you hear that deep calling into the deep you feel that pull in your heart see that's you hearing from your theophany amen that's exactly what that is because brother bam said that's exactly what that was you're hearing from your theophany amen because our theophany beholds the father's face amen and when we're hearing from our theophanes that means that our we're becoming one with the word more and more amen because our Theo godfy part of form of our form of God is calling drawing more to us amen amen because that's why we know that theosis is man becoming God and and and what kyos is was God becoming man amen amen now um I want to read I want to read uh greater than Solomon is here um it reads now we notice before we get to our text he referred back to Jonah and a lot of the people has always thought of Jonah as being a man that missed the will of God I don't believe that any man walking in the will of God can miss the will of God I don't believe that any man walking in the spirit can miss the will of God he might think he did but God makes it all work together right he brings everything out right amen let's go to uh Ephesians 2:10 amen want to go to Ephesians 2:10 amen get there saying amen amen okay it reads we for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen now I want to go to uh Romans 4 20 to 2 amen because it says that we were created in Christ Jesus and we know that when the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world when the world was being made and that logos was sweeping over the world that we were part of that logos amen amen amen so uh Romans 4 20 to 25 it reads he stagger not at the promises of God this is talking about Abraham he staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief but were strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform amen see because and I I like this scripture because when you read it we can go back in Genesis we can see two times when naturally we say he staggered at the promise that's right see because because we know we have a natural record we know we have a Divine record amen and we know that our our our divine record our our Prophet says that the Lord sees our finished product he sees our finished work amen see because our theophanies behold the father's face so that's what he sees amen so so if he if he's seeing that so and in this tossing the see of God's for forgetfulness when God goes back and he looks at it he says he staggered not at the promise amen so so even when it may seem at times to when our faith May falter amen we know that we know that when God when God goes back in his roex and looks back at it he sees that we stagger not at his promise amen amen and and it says that in being fully persuaded that what he had promised amen he was also able to perform amen because we know that it's impossible for God to go back on his word we know that God does not change his mind about his word because his word is eternal and when something that Eternal is set in stone it cannot be be erased amen amen now I want to go to uh Isaiah 30 verse 26 amen Isaiah 30 verse 26 yeah when you get there say amen amen all right amen it reads moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light and we know the moon types the bride that's us amen it says moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be Sevenfold as a light of seven days amen see that's the revelation of all the seals in one amen see and that in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people and health The Stroke of their wound amen amen I want to go to uh Revelations 3 20- 22 amen valians 3 20-22 amen it reads behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh see that's the promise with the with the um that that's the promise with the seventh Church age Amen to him that overcometh will I grant to sit in my throne even even as I also overcame and am set down with with my father in his throne amen he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the church unto the churches amen we know that when the Lord is saying this right here we know that Throne is the when we're sitting in his throne we have the power to rule amen so when we overcome and what are we overcoming brother bam said the hardest thing for men to overcome is that human part amen we're trying to overcome this flesh amen and be and the only way we can do that is by Jesus Christ amen and when we overcome this flesh amen that's when we have the right to rule amen help me Lord help me Lord help me Lord and what I want to get to is that yes sir the thought I'm trying to express is that once we see the seals in our lives because we know the first seal was the wife white horse rider we know that's the Catholic church amen we know the and um we know the second horse rider is the the red horse rider you know that's that's that's the Catholic church again because the rider did not change that that's the Catholic church but now is is using has a sword in his hand and it's using war and is killing amen amen that's that was the ox amen and then we know that the the black horse rider that was u i mean yes the black horse rider we know that uh that was the that was using uh the the political power and church power to rule of the people amen and then we know that that the the um the the the fourth horse horse horse rider was given a name under the under the the the eagle a prophet amen you know he was given a name which is death amen that's conglomerate of all of them that's what makes the callor pale of the horse rider amen and we know that once we um we know that that that was you know the maturing of all those horse riders together and then and then then we know that the the fifth seal we know that uh that was the the the Jews amen um with the the Vengeance amen we know that that the six hill we know that that that was um the the tribulation period and then then there was a silence in the seven seal but the prophet tells us that was Christ amen because Amos 3:7 says that nothing is done except first shown through a prophet amen and and that and to see that in our lives see to take it off the book of the pages to make it personal amen that means that from the first seal to the fourth seal that is the religious spirit that be working with you individually amen and then we know that that the that that that fifth seal that's that's your uh your nature of wanting to Vengeance amen we know that that the sick seal that's when things are going wrong in your life when you're sick when you're when when when you're um things of that nature amen and then we know that that um that once you get past all those seals overcome those seals you know that uh you get into that silence that's when you're your you and Christ are with each other um in the holies of holies or the silence you don't know what's going on behind there amen and and that and that's what I want to get that's what that's what that's the thought I want to get across amen that's what was hitting upon my heart greatly amen because that we know that um because Christ's mief got revealed in Revelations 10 uh let's go to Revelations 10 amen amen amen get there say amen amen it reads and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from Heaven clothed with the cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as an anim of fire amen and then uh drop down to eight it says in the voice which I have heard from Heaven spake unto me again saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and and upon the Earth and I went the angel and I said unto him give me the the little book see give me that re Revelation amen and it said and he said unto me take it and eat it up amen and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey amen and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me this is what I'm going to get you he said unto me thou thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen amen amen and we know that when John here I also like this part of the scripture too when John said give me give me the little book amen we know that when we were looking at the prodigal son he did the same thing he said give me my inheritance amen and when the prodical said that you know we know that the father didn't say take it you know that's not what I'm want to highlight on what I'm saying is the boldness that was with knowing what's yours and you taking it amen that's what I want to highlight on Amen what I want to highlight on is that knowing that we were fashioned in Christ amen knowing the promises which are given unto us amen knowing that we were before the foundation of the Earth with Jesus Christ and we and we knock Satan Out of Heaven knowing that I want this is what I want to get to that knowing the will of God is knowing that and having the confidence to when something happens when Satan comes and and tries to challenge your faith and you say no but do you remember before the foundation of the world who I was and what I did amen that's that's what I want to get get get through to you amen amen and and also also that the the scriptures just like the song said only believe amen we know that it says that um in I believe it's a Matthew uh Matthew 45 I believe it is when it says it's how to deceive the very elect if it was possible amen see so knowing that and if you if you have a fear of say of say um oh am I one of those amen am am I uh am I actually U do I actually have have what I say I have amen see God can't do anything with that God can't God cannot do anything God cannot do nothing with someone who can't take him at his word and believe it amen amen see God God can't do any nothing with anybody who every time something happens they fret and they and and and they falter and and they're they can't see because Satan's God's Army cannot have cowards amen see see we're supposed to have a boldness amen see we're supposed to believe in whom he sent amen and and and and if if if if we know that if we have that boldness then that's when if we have the mechanics God will come and bring the Dynamics amen if if we have the word and we're believing in the word in which in which he said that and we know that once once the word comes the spirit follows the word because the the word kill the Spirit giveth life you know that know that the spirit will come behind it and give life to it so that's that's what I want to get through amen that that's that's the thought I'm trying to get through to you amen amen amen and and um and to that's that's the thought that's the thought I I want I want to get through amen amen so um I want to I want to go back I want to go back to um Ezekiel no I'm sorry Isaiah 14 I want to go back to that amen Isaiah 14 for let's not pick up let's let's pick up at 12 amen amen Isaiah 14 12 yes sir amen it reads it reads um how art thou fallen from Heaven on Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which this weaken the Nations amen so Satan does not have spiritual Amnesia Satan knows what happened before the foundation of the earth we were the ones who had spiritual Amnesia amen and because we miss our theophanies amen Satan plays on that amen he he plays he plays on the fact that we may not uh uh um um um how how that um the man's thought of like how Jesus was be a high and mighty and and super humble and always doing the right thing at every given moment amen Satan plays on that see he plays on that natural amen but we know that but but we know that because we have a Divine record we know that because see and in this when when when our sins are toss and toce God's for forgetfulness we know that in the New Jerusalem that there's no water so on top of it being toss in the sea god forgetfulness that sea that sea of God forgetfulness is is gone after that too so so so so amen I don't know where that came from amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen it says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning yes sir how art thou cut down to the ground which is weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God amen see so he was looking at us too he wanted to be exalted above us as well he was jealous of us he he was jealous of what of of of the of the authority that we had he was jealous of the relationship we had with with Christ he was jealous of that amen amen amen so that's why he wanted that's why he wanted to be above us because remember Throne is is throne is the authority to rule amen so he wanted that Authority that we had but he wanted more on top of that amen and then and then he says I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation see so he wanted to be that one brother that everybody knew of in the church amen amen uh in the Sid of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds amen and I will be like the most high amen so this makes a lot of sense because right after right after when when Satan was cast out of Heaven he started making the Tower of Babel because he wanted to go back above the clouds amen and and and and Jesus Jesus shut that guy shut that down and he made him uh speak different languages amen amen amen it says yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the side of the pit see they see and also also in um we know that he's casting Lake of Fire the Lake of Fire is gone as well amen and then it says yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth Earth to tremble see so so in the Millennium when we're walking past we're going to say this was Satan this small thing right here was Satan this Bluff was Satan right here see see amen amen see see it says they that uh they that shall see they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms amen see how kingdoms are shaking right now amen that made the world as a Wilderness amen and destroy the cities thereof and open not the house of his prisoners amen it says and all the kings of the Nations even all of them lie in glory everyone amen okay amen um let's go I want to go I want to go to um I want to I want to I want to go back to uh Ephesians 1 amen amen amen help me little Ephesians 1 4 amen say according according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to praise the glory of his grace where he hath made us accepted in the beloved in the Beloved amen so we know that the Beloved is the bride when when uh I believe he this this starts out with the Beloved when we're addressed to as a beloved that's not talking to anybody that's reading the Bible That's speaking to his elect bride that's reading the Bible amen amen that speaking to the ones that know who they are amen amen and it says it says in whom we have Redemption through his blood amen because the lamb was the only one that could take the book amen for the Forgiveness of sins amen according to the riches of his grace amen because it was only by grace that we were saved amen we're no different than the person next to us only by Grace amen where he have abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence amen having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he may gather together in one all things in Christ amen both which are in heaven amen and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained in an inheritance amen see that that that's that uh uh that's that prodical son he obtain his inheritance amen and and once you obtain your inheritance you see um I lik how the Lord had Brothers even say there was a power in asking amen and we know ask you shall find seek you shall seek seek ye no ask it shall be given unto you seek you shall find and knock and it shall be open amen amen and and the and that's what Jesus said he he said it and then he gave the acronym for it amen amen of what asking means what prayer is amen amen so so and we know that there's a power in that and we know that when we're praying to when we're praying to God we're not praying in a in a old higher higher the now sense of prayer amen we're praying in a sense of a son talking to his father amen of a daughter talking to their father amen because we know the relationship relationship we have with Christ because because of uh of of of of of of his of his grace amen and now uh it reads continues it continues to read it says that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom he also trusted after whom he also trusted after that ye have heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise amen amen so so after you believe the word that's when you're sealed with Christ amen till the day of your Redemption amen it says which is the earnest oh says right here which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen amen amen amen now I want to read this also uh uh this Queen of Sheba it reads well if the Holy Spirit done that in the book of Acts it'll do the same thing today because the book of Acts is not the Acts of the Apostles it's the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles amen amen it's supposed to be the act of of the holy spirit in US amen and it's the same Holy Spirit in the church today he's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen it's it's it's the same Holy Spirit in the church today it will act the same way and give the same results why accept a substitute when the skies are full of the real real Pentecostal power amen we don't have a substitute we have we we don't have to have a substitute we can have the real amen I know it's the truth my brother my sister it's true it's true now the acts of the holy spirit amen see why why not what why not when um um when you want to debate within yourself whether you're um the elected or not why not just believe that you are amen because because I would rather believe that I'm the elect amen and and and listen listen what I'm saying I would rather I would rather um believe I'm the elect fulfill my purpose and save Souls yes and and and the Lord take me home before the Rapture then then continually then continually uh doubting myself and not knowing and and and not knowing what my purpose is until I find out right before the Rapture happens then I go I don't want to live like that amen I want to know who I am as soon as possible and I want to and I want to express the manifestation of his third of his third fold purpose amen I want to express God unto others because what was the expression of God when Jesus was on the scene see cuz Jesus was the expression of God he was the example he was the example expression that's why he said he was a brother a little higher than the other brothers amen he was he was the big fellow amen see because he was the example of this is this is see that's why in on the six day he rested amen because his plan was that we would we would have dominion and we would and we would Express God we will be God cuz we are God on Earth Amen to where he doesn't have to worry about Earth no more because he knows who he left on Earth amen he he left part of himself on Earth he left God on Earth amen but when we we forfeited that that that's why we're in the predicament we're in now we're trying to get back to that amen amen amen amen amen amen see we want to we want to get back to that and to get back to that is we have to we have to take that book and we have to take the revelation of what it means to be God Amen amen amen amen amen amen I um I'll be I'll be wrapping up I um I'll be wrapping up I I apologize for the short service um I apologize for the short service um amen amen that that would be it I want to pray I have to pray Lord God we come unto you humbly Lord God

praise God that is how the battlefield is amen amen amen me I preach with amen amen glory to God let's go to Ephesians 1 verse4 the one he was reading glory to God can you hear me okay praise God Ephesians 1 verse4 he finish a little bit earlier so let me get a little bit a minute amen am glory to God if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible says that according as he has chosen us where so you were chosen where glory to God amen amen amen all right this is Christ amen am you are chosen where in him outside of him or in him in so if they need to find find you they need to find you where yes sir amen amen so if this is you in Christ amen what kind of material are you so God chose Christ in Christ are we together are we together are we together in other word god Christ carries you and chose you in Christ amen am amen I have a question uh brother Robert back there did you ever chose sister adasa let's let's go please put your seat belt okay this is an F35 I was already in the air okay brother Robert did you ever choose sister adasa sir did you choose brother Isaiah did you choose sister jerusha no who in your life did you choose your mother no hey did you choose your father there is only one person that you [Applause] chose say Amen say Amen did you choose sister adasa because she's your daughter did you choose sister jerusha she's your daughter did you choose brother Isaiah he's your son did you choose your father did you choose your mother but there was one person that you chose that is your wife that is sister are we together and God chose you in him say Amen are we together are we together because Eve was in Adam so the wife of Adam was in Adam so you chose your wife in you [Applause] are we together so God chose His brde in [Applause] him the bride was choosing God are we together you want to go home okay let's continue verse one verse four according as he has what when did he chosen ad today when so God was waiting for you to be born you kept God single for a long time and it was not good for God to be single because his bride is not completed without you so as long as you not part of the bride God remains single the second Adam remains single and as he was not good for the first Adam to be alone it is not good for the second Adam to be [Applause] [Music] alone are we together together oh glory to God are we together I'm just refueling on the air brother brother John let's go he say according as he has chosen us where when before the foundation of the water in other words you were chosen before your natural record God chose you before you existed God chose you before you lied God chose you before you still God chose you before you commit a crime when you were blameless God chose [Applause] you are we together are we together the Bible say he chose you when before the foundation of what that we should be how God chose you to be holy God wants you to be how holy holy let me ask you a question God chose you where in Christ how is Christ is Christ holy or not holy H how can God chose you in Christ to be holy when you are already holy are we together Christ is Holy because that's what the Bible says amen it's spoken in the book of Peter if I'm not mistaken the Bible said that we should be how holy and without what blame without what blame we should be blameless amen God chose you to be holy and to be without blame he did this before the foundation of the world amen amen you cannot choose somebody who's already Without Blame to be without blame means that person will have [Applause] blame if God want you to be without blame it's saying that you will have blame that's the reason why he want you without blame in other word God knew that when you come in this world you will get dirty that's why he prepare a plan to redeem you back again to his holiness so your trouble your record doesn't impress God God already knew what you're going to do that's why he chose Jacob knowing that Jacob is going to be a [Music] supplanter are we together are we together are we together why do you say that I want you not to fall so you already have fall in your mind God knew something is going to happen but beside that because of of that God already chose you amen the bible say that according as he has chose us where in him before what the foundation of the world that we should be how and Without Blame before who how the title of this sermon tonight is the manifestation is the manifestation amen amen of his what three threefold purpose are we together we know that the three-fold purpose of God was expressed first in Jesus Christ where Christ get the preeminence because he's our example amen he's the standard product and God have to start with him so that every other product that will be manufacture in this manufacturer must match the standard we cannot have something less than a standard everybody that come out must match the standard the formula of One Coca-Cola is not different than the second one if you test them they test together they test alike my Coca-Cola and Jesus Coca-Cola is still the same because we are God we came from the F from the same Source are we together the second purpose was for God to have preeminence where in the bread in you amen and the third one is to express to restore back Eden so that we can go back to the Millennium amen so to manifest means that something was first hidden something was first covered something was first unknown something was first ignoring and that thing need now to be displayed you were ignore you were hidden you were buried in your first nature and they thought you were bad in your family but you had another record and because of the record it is time that the Son of God be manifested again so that Christ can have a preeminence in you are we together are we together let's go to the Book of Romans chapter 8 glory to God glory to God the book of Romans chapter 8 if you thereare you can say Amen I'm going to start backward with Romans chapter 8 I'm going to go to the back and then begin to come back again are we together Roman 8 chapter 29 if you dare you can say Amen the bible say that for whom he did what for none he also did what to be what conformed to the image of what if you want somebody let their on in the future to be conformed to the image of Christ it mean that person will not come out in the image of Christ that person will first come in a different image and then you going to take make that person to be conformed to the image you wanted to are we together because we got two parent we got our natural parent and a spiritual parent and a spiritual parent knew that he want you to be like him so he predestinated you to be conformed to His Image but when we are born we are conformed into the image of our parent we looks like our parent we looks like Daddy and Mommy but in you there are material that have been placed to make sure you can be in morth you can be changed you can be Tren from the kingdom of your family from the curses of your family from the glaucoma of your family to another family where we don't have gloma in are we together are we together God already wired you for that transformation for that translation he was done you were predestinated for then before the foundation of the world Amen to be ConEd in the image of what his who so at the finished product you will look like who you will look like who you will look like his son he say at the image of his son that he might be the what the firstborn the standard product remember the beginning product the example amen that he might be the firstborn among only one brother among how many brother so Jesus is not the only PE on the beach say amen that's why we and Jesus will sit on the same throne and that Throne only one person sit right there so that's why the Bible say he will gather everything in heaven and on the earth into one on the earth It Is Us in the heaven it is him and all of us will gather together and become one and qualify for one person on one Throne that's why the Bible say One S the Oneness of God is different than the Oneness of man according to Man 1 plus one equal 2 but according to God 1 + 1 equal 1 so when they say one will sit it doesn't mean one person it means it's Christ and his PR Adam and AD and Eve back again on the scene are we together are we together let's go to now Roman 8 chapter 12 if you thereare you can say amen glory to God let's go to verse uh uh 19 actually the Bible say for the Earnest expectation of the what Waited For What the manifestation of the son son s o n the how many sons plural so this doesn't belong to Jesus Christ say Amen this scripture is not for Jesus Christ Jesus Christ already manifested the Son of God because God who was the father Bec son in Jesus Christ Jesus already manifested the Son of God but this is no longer Jesus Christ he already finish his ministry but there are other sons of God that are not yet manifested yet amen so the manifestation is for you and me when we say son it doesn't mean women are not there because Eve was in Adam and God call Eve the same name as [Applause] Adam are we together are we together jop down to this next verse verse 20 for the creature was made what subject to vanity the creation not willingly amen the trees I mean did not do anything the the elephant didn't do anything he was men so because they were under men they automatically by default fell amen the Bible say not willingly but by reason of him that has what subject the same how in Hope because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of what corruption into the Glorious Liberty of what children of God now they don't call it the sons of God they call them the what children of God ye are God and all of you are children of the most high so God is expecting God to be on display a child of God is a God and a child of God means equal with god oh don't worry it makes the devil angry when you say me and my father we are one tell him I was chosen in my father before the foundation of the world and when I was chosen you was you were not even there devil Hallelujah job to verse 22 for we know that the whole creation does a what gr Groth and travelleth in what together in in birth in uh in pain together until and not only they but ourself also which have the first fruit of what even we ourself gr within ourself waiting for the what to we Redemption of our body let's go to Isaiah 14 let's go to Isaiah 14 Hallelujah glory to God wonderful brother Charles I'm just standing as a big brother shooting that devil behind you so you can keep moving forward I have that machine gun going and I say keep pressing he didn't know you had the [Applause] [Laughter] backup I am not the backup it's God who's the backup the present help in the time of [Applause] trouble let's go to Isaiah 14 my friend if you dare you can say Amen verse three this is where he read amen amen uhhuh amen is he started from verse four I'm sorry amen the bible say that thou shall take up his this proverb against who the king ofon we know who that King is the king of Babylon amen and say how has the oppressor ceased and the Golden City ceased this is Babylon the Lord has broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of the rulers amen amen he who smoke the people in Wrath with a what so the devil struck people how with A continuous what a continual that's what he says continual what stroke so the devil doesn't get tired of attacking amen amen that's what the Bible says he struck the people with A continuous stroke are we together he that ruleth the nation how is persecuted and none does what so we understand here clearly that the devil is the one who attack with a continous stroke that's why every day we have a fight we have a battle every single morning because he doesn't get tired his attack is continual but I have a message for him tonight are we together are we together jump to verse 12 how are that fallen from heaven we are not fallen from heaven we came down from heaven that's why we can go back to heaven when we were coming from De I mean uh from heaven we were not falling no no so the devil from his from from his first journey done was already falling my journey was not a fall it was actually a purpose Journey so that God can be manifested in me that's why in heaven he was already defeated are we together jum to verse 12 how are thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to what which did weaken the nation for thou has said in thy heart I will Ascend into what heaven I will exalt my throne above who the stars of Who are the stars of God sons of God so go the devil already want to exalt his throne above you that means from the beginning you were above the devil are we together so your first record you were already above the devil because you were chosen in [Applause] Christ are we together he says above the star of God and will sit upon the Mount of the congregation the devil cannot judge me because that congregation is the congregation of the m in the S of the north verse 14 I will Ascend above the heights of the water and I will be like who the devil wanted to be like the most high he wanted to be like my husband so that I can marry him but I cannot get married to the devil he cannot be the most high because our DNA is different than his DNA amen a chicken marry a chicken devil marry devil go Mary [Applause] go you need to go to the Vatican to find a jezebel I'm not part of that Jezebel amen the devil attack with A continuous stroke let's look at this stroke let's go to Isaiah 30 26 and I'm going to let you go home glory to God amen amen amen amen amen Isaiah 30: 26 your prayer will be soon answered for some who wanted to amen Isaiah 30 verse 26 if you dare you can say amen amen moreover the light of the Moon which is is the church shall be as the light of what so the light of this Moon won't be lesser than the son say Amen because you trying to think you are lower than Jesus Christ I already preach and I'm going to push this again harder amen the bible say that the light the intensity of the sun will be equal to the light of what will be equal to the light of what amen amen amen okay if this light is 1,000 kilow what do you expect the moon to be what do you expect the moon to be 1,000 kilowatt so if you look at the Sun and you look at the Moon which one is sun which one is sun which one is Moon because both of them look alike so the moon will be exactly like the sun that's why the sun can be out the sun can be resting on the seventh day and there is a moon that will be a sun on the Earth are we together are we together are we together so what we are trying this manifestation of these sons of God are going to be exact L Crist that's why they ask you to swallow the book because the book is Christ are we together are we together glory to God let's go back my friend and the light of the Sun the moon shall be as the light of what Hallelujah okay the light of this Moon moon is exactly like the sun it means other moons have different light the Moon that were previous to this moon were different from their Sun Church all right let me just pick up how many moons do you want me to pick let me p i mean pick seven there is a first moon a second one a third a fourth a fifth uh I mean a six and a seven amen all these moons have light but you can tell the difference between the lights and the light of the Sun but there is a moon that when you look at that Moon you get confused between the Sun and the Moon you can swap one to the other and you still have the same effect are we together there amen verse 26 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of what and the light of the Sun that sun shall be how this light this light of the sun amen that will look like the Moon is Sevenfold it's the intensity of Sevenfold so the Moon is also Sevenfold amen it's one moon but Sevenfold are we together are we together so if you got one fold you cannot reach that Moon if you got the second fold you cannot reach that Moon you need seven lights seven lights to make that sun and an angel in the Bible appears as a light are we together and we have a picture right here amen that was made by seven angels it was seven lights that were put together and he produces the image of Christ so the light of this Moon must be the last of the constellation the constellation was made out of seven angels seven lights and when the seven lights were made together he produces Christ it is a Christ with seven lights the Christ with seven lights will produce a bride with seven lights are we together this light never came in Paul time never came in arus time never came in colba time it came only in laisha time at the end time when it promised to the Overcomer to sit on the throne of God so if a light if a sun is coming as a constellation of seven light they got to be a moon they got to be a moon that will look like that light so that the head and the body can be United [Applause] together are we together our flight attendant prepare for

intensity of the light of all of them in other word the last day will gather all the light of the other [Applause] ages are we together are we together the Bible say as the light of seven days in the
