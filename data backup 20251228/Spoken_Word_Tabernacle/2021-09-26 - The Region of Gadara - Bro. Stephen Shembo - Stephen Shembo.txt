way and now we are heading to beulahlam amen you got everything put together blessed be the name of the lord just a reminder we have water baptism at the end of the service so i know brother kelly and brother robert are handling it we had a wonderful fellowship yesterday if you miss it i don't know how to tell you it was just good and yummy amen i gotta say it that way so next time you strive to be there amen that was wonderful we appreciate brother hamilton and cesar keller for opening the door it was tremendously a great blessing and a good anointing amen so let's go to our scripture this morning as you're standing be the name of the lord your boss or our boss to give me a different direction it's still connected or linked to the theme we're working on but it's just like a little parenthesis that we're going to go through and then come back again and keep moving amen so in other words we exit a little bit by way biking by we going back again to the highway you know 85 exit you go right up in the ramp and you can go back up again and get on amen so we just arrived at the ramp and before you know it we go back up again amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to genesis chapter 13. it is not me it is your boss the bible called him the great shepherd so i'm just a shepherd under him so i must follow his instruction amen genesis chapter 13 if you're there you can say amen verse 5 very familiar scripture for those who read their bible and lot also which went with abraham abraham had flock and herds and tent and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together so abraham has his substance flocked heard cuddle and lot have flocks heard cuddle now it was so great until the land could not provide for both so a separation must happen you might be seated verse 7 and there was a strife between the herdsmen of abram's cattle so the problem was based on cattle they heard their cattle anybody clear that's where this trough start amen so probably this one say we're going to be using this part here we will feed our cattle somebody said no that belonged to us and then before you know it the cattle the caddo razor the caddo razor start the strap the problem started here amen and there was a strap between the herdsmen of abraham's cattle and the herdsmen of lord's cattle and the canaanite and the parasite dwelt then in the land and abram say to lot let there be no strife i pray you between me and you and between my hurts man and your hurts man for we be brethren we're related we don't want to trouble is not the whole land before you do water okay separate yourself i pray you from me if you will take the left hand then i will go to the right or if you depart to the right hand then i will go to the left so the choice was given to lot just as much as to abraham amen the free will if you were not there yesterday you won't understand what we're talking about the free will was given to both of abraham had to take the second choice in other words if lord choose right then abraham is in trouble because abraham never said if you go to the right i'm going to go to the left no abraham gave lord both the right and the left but one was right and one side was wrong and if lord choose the right path then abraham is going to fall on the wrong slot but abraham was not afraid he gave both choices [Music] and the choice was based upon what was in the heart where are you going the place you're going to live the church you are going to it's only an expression of what is in your heart hallelujah amen verse 10 and lord lift up his eyes and beheld all the plant of water jordan jordan river the plan of jordan in other words the valley of jordan amen jordan when you go to israel jordan started from the north then he get into what they call the sea of galilee america then he continues all the way and he ends on the dead sea on the dead sea ever clear so when you look at the map like this the promised land was on this side this is the promised land everybody clear so israel leaving egypt should go straight this way and go to the promised land but israel wasted time and went around this way so the direction of the jews they were coming this way about here and they came from this side so this is east and the promised land was on the west based on jordan you need that amen so lord lift up his eyes and beheld all the plane of jordan that the valley of jordan so we on that side there the valley or the plain of jordan that it was well water everywhere when you look it's a very fertile land and that fertility comes from the river jordan very fertile well water everywhere amen everywhere praise be the name of the lord before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of water so that land that was close to jordan look like a garden of eden that's where a lot look amen like the land of egypt as you come to water the garden of eden looked like the land of egypt where the jews came out because abraham was in egypt amen we float and they came out of egypt and they dwell into the south america so the land a lot looked at that at was the land that resembled the land of egypt it was a fertility or a blessing that looks like the land of egypt a blessing that looked like the world [Music] yet he look also like the garden of eden he looked like the garden of eden and he also looked like egypt who made the garden of eden good and who built egypt the tree of good and evil we okay did i lose anybody okay let me go back again and lord lift up his eyes and beheld all the plan of jordan jordan means what we okay now okay the plan of death amen that he was well watered everywhere before the lord destroys sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as you come to zorro then lord choose him or the plane of water so abraham is doomed to the other side and lord journey where do you say where east is the promised land was where make sense now and lord choose all the plains of jordan and lot journey east and they separated themselves the one from the other abram dwell in the land of water why didn't lord choose the promised land he had the choice why he didn't choose it abraham gave him the chance go ahead and choose it but he went the other way amen and abraham dwell in the land of canaan and lord dwell in the cities of the plan and pitch his tent toward water do you see where he took him it looks very good but it's a way towards sodom but the man of sodom where lot went looks very good a good opportunity great to prosper oh that's where i'm gonna go i have a lot of cattle that's that's a land i have a lot of water there is a lot of grass and i'm gonna take care of my substance but he never knew the man of sodom the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord how abraham spared completely let's go to mark chapter 10. two options given lot has as much right to go to the promised land as abraham had but god knew where lot is going to go and abraham was not afraid like if i give him this way he might take the canaan land give it to him it depends on it depends on where you came from amen that will show up mark 10 verse 17. if you're there you can say amen very familiar scripture and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running somebody was under desperation indeed water nailed to him a humility finally i got here finally i was looking for him what are you looking for and ask him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life finally i got the opportunity they told me he's going this way before he take his next flight let me rush and get him now i got him he's lord on the floor master i want eternal life do you really want it and jesus said to him why call you me good there is none good but who that is who deity so this man had a revelation of deity you know the commandment do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false wiltness defraud not honor your father and mother and he answer and say to him master all these have i observed from my water is it a bad person very good fellow amen so when you look at him he qualified for eternal life never smoke never went to the nightclub never done something wrong you can tell him story about your life before you you were converted he doesn't have any clue he grew up a good boy he even recognized jesus to be a good master and when he approached him he's nailed down you say oh my god this one is a candidate to eternal life [Music] amen jesus put him to test this is the word this is the word this is the word everything you're telling me is just a routine that has been my life all over jesus give him the seal pull the seal and pulled your approval he already qualified jesus said wait a minute you're too quick let me check something really amen amen then jesus beholding him loved him by the word wow he saw very good worker the father loved him amen loved him and said to him one thing you like just one now it's changing he put the microscope and he pulls something one thing you like go your way sell whatsoever you have and give to the water and you shall have treasure in water heaven was given to this man eternal life was given to him so he cannot condemn god for not giving him the same opportunity he gave to everybody free will amen and you shall have treasure in heaven and come take up water and do whatever when jesus looked at him he loved him and jesus saw something in him that he wanted to use amen and he told him your cargo is too heavy take away your cargo there is something in you you don't know i'm gonna pick that and use it and the only way you can use it you must be in the correct place and follow me if you don't follow me you cannot use that i know i am the one who put it in you and the only way he can work properly you must follow me he wanted eternal life and continue his life back thank you i got eternal life god bless you we see you go back to my life jesus said when i give eternal life you cannot go back there you need to stick with me amen and from now on you gotta follow me if i go to the right you go to the right if i go to the left you go to the left where i sleep that's where you sleep where i die that's where you're gonna die he turned around he said my god all these prestige all my body all my friend i'm gonna leave it [Music] verse 22 and he was sad i thought he was looking for eternal life i thought he was running i thought he fell down he said good master good master i want eternal life this is eternal life now the conversation is sad what are you looking for what do you want what do you want from god do you really want a god do you really really really really want a god are you ready and he was sad at that saying and went away how [Music] eternal life is grieving you for he had water lot had water is somebody sleeping i can't preach to a quiet church lord had great possession and the rich young ruler had also water lot chose the land of sodom based on his possession not by revelation everybody clear verse 23 and jesus look round about and say to his disciple how hardly in other words what a difficulty should they have water enter into the kingdom of water and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus answered again and said to them children how hard is it for them duh trust in water so the heart really of the young man was not really on eternal life because where your treasure is that's where you are that trust enriches to enter into the kingdom of water the possession of this young man took him away from the promised land [Music] the possession of lot took him away from the promised land let's go to luke chapter 16. what i have i got to go slowly amen we only have one service we don't have two services if you have two services you're going to be murmuring probably some of you we got service again he took too long i can come back you don't have to come back you go home and he'll relax okay so we're good amen somebody told me i'm good i'm glad you're keeping one service i say yes because what you get when you go home you're gonna sit and keep talking about it keep talking about it keep talking about it keep talking about it amen luke chapter 16 you're chewing on your steak you're talking about the word look 16 25 verse 25 but abram you know the story the continuation of the story but abram said son remember that you in your lifetime receive your good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and you are tormented i will come back to this because we left you with a question is hell burning or not i'm not going to touch on that because your boss sent me in the different territory then we're going to come back amen and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf the bridge is broken no bridge is there so that day which will pass from here to you cannot neither day pass to us neither can they pass to us that would come from here in other words nobody can live here go there nobody can come from here and go down on the other side then he said i pray you therefore father that you would send him to my father's house to do what now you start caring about what jesus was trying to make you do you see now jesus was trying to use that that's why jesus said come and follow me in other words come and be my disciple because every disciple of jesus christ was a preacher all the 12 disciples of jesus christ were preachers even judah was a preacher in other words when jesus looked he saw a gift in him amen he said the only way you can operate that gift properly you need to be with me he rejected it because of his great possession now when he's in hell the gift begins to work because in hell his possession is all gone there is no more possession they stay in the earth now he is in the fifth dimension there is no more possession now the gift begin to torment him hallelujah amen he said then i say then he say i pray you therefore father that you would send him to my father's house verse 28 for i have five brethren why you didn't worry about them to begin with you were worried about to make how much to make so much money like amazon amen like basil the boss if you work on amazon that's fine i'm just talking about the boss don't want to say all the pastors say working on amazon amen for i have five brethren that he may testify to them lest they also come into this place of water now he doesn't want anybody to do what he did [Music] go tell them don't come this route how did you came to this route how did you made it to hell because you rejected the word made flesh you rejected the message of the hour [Music] everybody clear when the message was presented you rejected it ticket visa straight amen to the fifth dimension let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace your love your mercy and for giving us an opportunity to be able to gather together this morning lord in your house to hear from thee and not from a man lord we have done what any men can do here on planet earth if you have given them the ability to do so they can read the scripture lord but when it comes to feeding your sheep interpreting the spirit the the scripture being the inside teacher that only take the holy spirit that's why lord i'm surrendering myself in this church if there is anything that we've done that might below the hinges to our blessing this morning maybe the way we behave at home or debate the way we behave throughout the week lord father may your blood cover us and may you forgive us lord may you move us completely out of the way lord and may you grant unto us a special service lord that you can come down lord and minister to your children according to their need we commit everything unto the hand be the alpha and the omega the beginning and the ending of this service lord as we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you whoever is over there you got a punch on this today we're going to talk about the region of gadaria ouch i'm saying gatorade because that's how brother branham said it if you need this uh the message you go listen to the magniac of gallery the subject today is the region of gaddaria anybody clear last time we talk about hell last sunday and we found out that hell number one was a prison anybody clear and not only was hell a prison he was a prison of chains of darkness everybody clear and not only was was it a prison of chance of darkness we spoke again last time that hell was a place of disorder you remember that because everybody that got in here originally was in heaven they had position and habitation in heaven but they all sin with lucifer and they all lost their position and they found themselves in the prison of everlasting chains of darkness called the prison of hell and because they lost their position when they got to hell everybody have a different position they don't know where they belong hell became now a place of disorder everybody clear a man who brings disorder in a church is usually a man who is not in his right position let's keep moving amen hell also we found last sunday that hell was a horrible place hell was a horrible place to the lost souls and hell was a horrible place to demonstrate amen the lord saw that's the reason why the rich young ruler didn't want anybody to come where he was because he was a lost soul he didn't want anybody to come to hell he have enough sense even though he was in here to make sure nobody has come where he is at everybody here that was the gift that god placed in his life amen and the demons themselves do not want to be in hell because last sunday we found out that they begged jesus christ you can cast us out but do not send us back to hell so hell is a very very horrible place amen then when we dealt with those demons we found out that those demons were dwelling in tombs amen and the tombs is a place where you have dead things at a cemetery everything is dead there is no life there and we talk from there about the atmosphere everybody clear everybody here the atmosphere is very important we are getting closer and sooner you can see people are getting ready to celebrate halloween and when you watch what they are putting in their houses they're bringing tombs in their houses they're bringing skeletons in the houses they're bringing dead stuff in their houses to decorate their houses like cemetery making it an air conditioning for the devil halloween is of the devil it is a party that prepare your home for devils trigger tree is of the devil if you get something that pretend to halloween in your house get it out because you are creating a dead atmosphere in your home and the devil loves dead atmosphere you are the one buying that with your money and bringing that to your house and you think you are worshiping the dead you are actually making a comfortable place for the demon of hell to come to your house blessed be the name of the lord brother branham say did you ever get around anybody you have seen nice people that you could not hardly stand to be around them yeah now you know that's right isn't it and i have seen people that maybe that you just love to be in their presence haven't you seen people like that when you start fellowshipping you don't want to go home you can start one hour two hours three hours four hours you gotta stop somewhere because if not you're not gonna go back to sleep everybody clear so there is something about those people that keep their fellowship going on do you realize that you are sons of god the atmosphere the water the air that you live in you create water around you that either or water so if demon keep following you what are you doing in your life [Music] if that spirit keeps hanging on you what are you doing in your life you can create a circumstance that can make that devil uncomfortable or you can create a circumstance that can make that devil comfortable it depends on what you are creating that's the reason why that devil keeps hanging around you hallelujah i better leave that subject alone i read what i was going to because i'm afraid you are not getting that that is water don't preach the deepest thing that is deeper thing that the church has yet got to preach [Laughter] that the church has got to learn that is right deeper things we are taught in this ritualistic and so forth and it sat down and cut and drive for us that's what you want motivational speaking but when you come into the real it is not something way off you can't understand it's just as close as your hand is to you you just look over to the top of it it is so simple till you overlook it you complicate your life for nothing overthinking and reasoning on the word of god the word of god is simple just create an atmosphere and it's going to take care of the devils brother david give me a little bit more so i won't lose my my voice everybody clear so far then this region here called the region of galleria it's a region that was made really that the fame of this region came because of this man this maniac this man that was filled with devils that's the reason why we begin to know more about this region what is going on with this region of gallery everybody clear so far hallelujah amen brother branham say i gave you that key that god gave first an initial revelation a first revelation then god does not change the revelation but what god does he add more to that revelation to make the revelation more what clear so that his children can get it everybody here according to mark 5 verse 1 the bible says that they came over onto the other side of the sea into the country of water into the country of the gathering that's the region we're talking about according to mark came into the country of gathering everybody clear so far according to luke chapter 8 verse 26 and they arrive at the country of water which is over against what the sea of galilee because jesus have to cross the sea and he was buffeted with devils and he have to speak to the sea peace be still if you read your scripture so according to luke luke is talking about the same thing the country of gatherings everybody so far we're growing up first two and when he was come out of the ship immediately they met him out of the tomb of water how many men according to mark one man hey with an unclean spirit and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the water you understand now crying and cutting himself with water so when you see the people cutting themselves out you know what is going on with those people everybody here they're under demonic spirit you go to the east saying institution you see people cutting themselves up it's a demon according to luke chapter 8 verse 27 and when he went forth to land they met him out of the city a water how many men one anybody clear one man which had devils long time same story and we're not close now we got more detail amen neither a board in any house but in the water so according to mark according to luke we found out that the man that was there seems to be the only one that was present in the tombs everybody here so far when you go to the book of matthew chapter 8 verse 28 matthew is talking about the same story anybody clear matthew says that when he was come on the other side in the country of the water gergeson and gatherings is the same name everybody here in the country of the gergeson amen they met him how many who's telling the truth who's lying both of them are telling the truth amen they met him how many to possess with the devil coming out of water the same story everybody here so far coming out of there of the tomb exceeding fears so that no man might pass by that way so according to matthew we need to upgrade our story are we there instead of looking at one man out of the tomb from today now we understand that there were how many people there were two people so we can drop that picture now and we can pull a second picture why was that two men all from eternity we spoke and we found out that there is always two kingdoms anybody here we have the kingdom of god and we have the kingdom of the devil and brother branham said every revolver have always watered he have twins everybody here and those twins started all the way from eden when you have a can automatically you're going to have an able when you have the crow in the arkham you're going to have the dove in the orc when you have isaac you're going to have ishmael when you have esau you're gonna have jacob when you have the battler you're gonna have the backhand when you have one fifth at the cross that is going to paradise you're going to have another fifa the cross that is going to hell when you have jesus christ you're also going to have judah all around the scripture there is always two but mark and luke focus on the one that was saved [Music] ever here because those two always shows which origin they came from esau and jacob came out from the same womb these two evil men came out from the same place but one was saved and the other one nothing was spoken about him everybody here ever here who told these people that jesus was coming they didn't have internet they didn't have newspaper they didn't have flyer that jesus sent ahead of time saying that i'm coming to the city they didn't have a tv they didn't have telephone but somehow instead of jesus being there and the people of the city ready to welcome jesus the one that welcomed jesus was a man filled with devils who told that man that jesus was coming everybody here there will be there is a time that the devil will destroy your life there is a time that the devil will make you suffer there is a time that the devil will take you to drinking there is a time that the devil will take you to the nightclub there is a time that the devil will make you smoke pipe there is a time that the devil will take you here and there but when the time of god comes are you there are you there you don't need no news on the television the devil that was benefiting you now no longer strong to block you from accessing your making the devil that drove him in the tomb when his time of deliverance came the same devil drove him to church [Applause] are you there how did you get saved you got saved when you were a sinner why you didn't run away from church but that day you ended up in church because it was time for the predestinated seed to be quickened and when the big madness began to come as jesus christ is approaching the predestinated seed begin to move and when the predestination begin to move there is no devil in hell how many deaths you have even if you have religion even if you have the whole hell it won't stop you from getting your deliverance [Applause] hallelujah it is just a matter of time and you who are praying for your daughter you who are praying for your son i don't care how bad they are [Applause] i don't care how many pictures somebody sent you your daughter is at the beach your daughter is at the nightclub your daughter is doing this it is just a matter of time when time will come there won't be any devil there won't be any legion there won't be anybody that's gonna block your daughter your daughter will be home your son won't be home your husband will be home keep claiming the blood of the lamb hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord if god be for you who can be against you [Applause] hallelujah never lose hope because your child is in prison that's no problem keep holding on to the faith keep holding on to the faith keep holding on to the faith like the prodigal son one of this day you gonna see them come back i don't care how bad the situation is my daughter did this my son did this he doesn't matter they saw him naked at the nightclub legion was naked but when time come christ came down blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] hallelujah never lose hope keep praying keep holding on keep confessing this man was in a bad character he cut himself up naked what hope can you give it to him what happened who would have thought this man could be delivered it's just a matter of time it's just a matter of time just wait and keep waiting in faith those that wait on the lord they shall renew their water hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if the demon could not hold this man they're not going to hold your husband they're not going to hold your child they're not going to hurt you [Applause] hallelujah so from today if somebody bring you news your son did this your daughter did this don't even worry about it tell them it's just a matter of time i don't care where they are even if they are in hell god is going to pull them up because i claim them [Applause] i'm not going to lose one of them hallelujah oh let's give him a clap this morning [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord two of them he pick up one and he leaves another one the bible says that i tell you of the truth many widows were in israel in the day of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when a great famine was throughout the land but unto water was a liarson save who and to surrepta a city of saturn and to a woman that was a water there was many widows but only one anybody here and many lepers were in israel in the time of elizabeth elisha the prophet and none of them was queen saving who many were in the tombs with devil only one in the pool of bethesda he got he only got one he's after his seed amen and the rapture is the same thing i tell you in that match there shall be two men in one bed the bible didn't say two men having sexual relationships two men can be in one bed doesn't mean they're doing that as stupidity amen in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be water and the other water two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other water two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other one two in the tomb one taken out and they are the armor everybody here so far everybody clear so far as we look at this region of gallery brother branham said in the maniac of gadoia he said i see him in his work as he was tossed there in the little old sea and one soul out of the entire region god only save [Music] one soul was in need of it we never have a record of anyone else being water in that land of the gatherings but this one maniac poor fellow i think of him being out there in that condition perhaps one time a good citizen a good man where does brother branham knows that that nobody else was saved beside him how did he know it in the book of luke chapter 8 then the whole multitude of the country of the gatherings round about besott him to the water everybody say get out of this place for they were taken with great field and went up into the ship and returned back again so this man begged jesus he said father can i go with you i don't want to stay again here jesus turn around and say no you don't go with me you're going to stay here to witness return to their own house and show how great things god has done unto thee and he went his way and did what published throughout the world how great things jesus has done unto whom the whole city cast out jesus christ jesus had to preach himself in prison because they rejected him jesus took that part of ministry and left him he said you go testify to those souls in prison i have certain things to do you the only one i have to save but the word must be preached to them so i can condemn them at the next time the men begin to be a preacher of souls in prison everybody clear so far so that region a whole region filled with other people only one person saved what's going on with this region of the gallery the bible says we saw this last week that the they demons him that he would not command them to go out into water number one when the devil came to jesus christ they fell down and worshiped him i will show you that down the road number two debate jesus christ we don't want to go into the deep usually we have a tendency to think that number one they just told jesus we want to go into the pig but that was not the case the first thing they told jesus do not send us to hell you must think that after that they told jesus christ let's go to the pig but that was not the case again watch it clearly amen in mark chapter 5 verse 6 the bible says but when he saw jesus afar pharaoh he run and did what why did the devil block him from worshiping christ why the devil are not strong as you think it's just a matter of time amen why they didn't bring this man to jesus and he began to cast jesus why they didn't bring this man to jesus so that he can get the stone and begin to bid on jesus but when they brought him to jesus he began to worship the power of your predestinated seed when it starts working there is no devil in hell there is no power it comes automatically hallelujah he said and he asked him what is the name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are water one voice and he besought him much that he will not send them a way of water they say we don't want to go to hell you hear me but we asking you one thing we love this country what was in that country that the devil requested jesus christ that don't send us to hell but leave us in this country this is a beautiful air-conditioning place for us the country the region of the galleria a region requested by the devil what was in that region because that region was in israel anybody here israel was like this ever here and that region was over here about here this is the region of jewish people people that worship god people that worship jehovah are the true god but the devil claiming to jesus christ don't send us to hell we rather stay in this country what is in that region that attracted the devil hallelujah number one we don't want to go to the deep number two we want to stay in this country number three now there was the night unto the mountain a great head of water anybody clear so far hallelujah give me time let's go number one we don't want to go to hell go to hell we don't want to do it number two we want to stay here in this country or in this region of galleria number three in the same region we found out that they were water the bible didn't say they were lamps the bible never says they were goats the bible says they were sworn or peak day hallelujah amen and all the devil besought him turn the request and you think jesus is tired of hearing you when he can heal the devil three times the devil praying if a devil has a right to bring the request to christ before the blood of jesus was shed how much more do you have boldness to bring your request to god after the blood has been shed [Music] you who came from god this didn't come from god but they have a right to ask god and god answered them and gave them what they wanted hallelujah and all therefore besought him saying send us into the water that we may do whatever why did he want to go to the lamps the devil want to enter the shrine hallelujah the region of the gallery and fourth with jesus gave them leave he granted their desire and the unclean spirit went out and entered into the swan and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about water so if you were in a bird not eating pigs because the devil got into pigs the devil got into two thousand pigs and those two thousand people died so you ready and free to eat your pork chop there is a religion that said do not eat pigs because the devil got into them and they never understood that it was only two thousand devil not all the pigs in the world and those that got the devil all of them died you need a prophet hallelujah they were about two thousand and one chuck into the water number one they don't want to go to hell number two they want to stay in the country and jesus is still looking they say wait a minute look over there the demon themself show jesus the pig what was pig doing in the country of israel are we okay is everybody awake hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother bonham says that you know jesus said to those demons come out and they say sufferers to go into them swan see a devil is water if he doesn't have a water don't be the playground of the devil when we say stop wearing your high heel stop wearing your head here because when you put your heart here you are bringing a devil on you [Music] devil cannot work devil cannot work unless they are in the water amen he is just a spirit in the world until he is in the body then he can do water you battling spirit what are you doing in your life how do you dress you dress tight you show in your shape you pulling somebody hallelujah brother of adam saying in the message testimony jesus cast out some demons out of a man from gatorade and they went into the herd of swan is that right demons are powerless unless they are water so they beg for mercy even to go into swan because jesus would not permit them in human water hallelujah brother branham continuing the living christ if you are skeptic i would not stay in while this is going on i want to pray for the sick if you somebody who had doubt i prefer that you leave her because if that person is freed you are certainly a good subject to him next it shall take place you know now he comes right from one to another in other words when a devil leaves somebody they want to go somewhere else those demons must have water not only do they need a body they also need water don't make your house a place for devils [Music] young people you're struggling look at what you're doing look at what you're posting your picture is showing a last spirit [Music] why do you have to post everything every time you must change your posting and you see this even in married women who are you impressing your husband are you impressing your congregation that you have online that you have to change picture and they keep liking liking liking liking and before you know it you battling a spirit amen hallelujah if you want to block me so i won't see your whatsapp i will see through your friends i don't have a facebook somebody pulled their facebook and said brother stephen look and i begin to see that through other people and i was amazed what i was looking at it's going to catch you one day sometime i take even snapshot so when you doubt i say look me do it quickly whatever you have to do like judah go ahead and do it those demons must have a place must have a body on their water helpless they want to go into a bunch of hogs one day when they came out of the mania canada remember in the bible when a spirit was cast out of a man they said let us go over and get in them hugs they are powerless until they have a placed water a spirit need a place or a body and the appropriate place is hell but they don't want to go to hell they want to stay on this world because they're looking for who is inviting them you invite them by the atmosphere you creating iran everybody here so what have the jew to do with peace hallelujah because they begged to go into the pig brother i'm saying the message the prodigal he had to get himself a job so he went to a citizen of the country a water a pig raiser or a swan raiser look where he dropped from now a jew not even supposed to put his hands on the water not only a natural not only a living pig even if you found a pig that is dead a jew was not supposed to touch it [Music] but these jews had two thousand pigs they were raising hallelujah he was in need he was starving and he had to take a job and they gave him the worst thing that is the way the devil does just as soon as he get he can get you started down the hill he shall trample you with everything he's got begin to backslide you're going to find yourself working in a nightclub selling whiskey leviticus 11 7. where did brother branham get this the bible say underwater the swan though he divided the rule the hoof and be clothed and folded yet he choose not the card he is water of their flesh the pig shall you not eat and do carcass shall he not water they are water so the pig is unclean the flesh of a piggies and cream even the carcass of a pig is unclean but this region called the region of galeria was raising unclean thing to god and the devil have enough sense to tell jesus there is an unclean thing there you taught them through moses do not eat pig you tell them to moses do not even have pig you taught them through moses do not even touch the cutters of a pig look what they're doing there is a bunch of pigs there so if you don't want to you don't have any option we got option we can go into the pig because pig are unclean to them and jesus said you are right go ahead and enter a region that have legions of region that was raising swan a region that the devil requested to stay there why a jewish region can be a place that the devil requested are we okay are we okay the devil begin to show jesus christ there is absurdy send me there i will be all right because you told them not to do this everybody so when jesus look jesus saw that something that is unclean was in the land of israel and the word when it came have to bring sanctification do you follow me so jesus gave the devil permission to go into the pig to wipe that on cleansing [Music] you follow me that's why when the devil entered they drove the pig into the sea and destroy their business jesus the word begin to clean the land of the gallery jesus understood that the devil are claiming this land this is the promised land that i send my children so let me begin to clean the land remove everything that is unclean from the rain the land of the galleria what happened when jesus began to bring sanctification the people got mad we don't want him again here we don't want this kind of religion here this religion is taking off my high heel this religion is taking off my makeup this world is taking up my fornication life this world is taking off all my tat dresses all my paint we don't want this word here [Music] in other words the people of this region were more comfortable with devils then with the world meditation they don't want a ministry that's going to challenge their life they don't want a ministry that's going to clean up their life they want a ministry that will house devil a ministry that will pet your demons hallelujah how did the hug get there buckle up are you tired the bible says in the book of deuteronomy the bible says that it shall be when the lord that god shall brought thee into the land which he swore unto the father to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give thee great and goodly water which that when god was talking to the jew about the land of israel the promised land canaan anybody clear god begin to give them the description of canaan he said cannon when i'm gonna bring you there i'm gonna bring you there and give you a house that you're not going to pay for you didn't build it you didn't feel it you didn't work for it when you get there i just give it to you anybody clear a house full of water good thing which that fearless not you didn't go to value city to buy for you i let somebody else work hard and you're gonna kill them and take over everything everybody clear a world digs and well digs which that dig is not you didn't work on those well in other words god took the serpent seed and put them there because the serpent seed is hard at work and he used their energy to build their kingdom for these children he saw have to go work jacob was not working jacob went just behind and pull up two kids you need scripture you see me venue vineyard and olive tree which that plant is not that's why when jesus came he told the jews look at the bird do you see them working i'm taking care of them why do you worry too much i want you to work but i want you to depend on me so whatever leader you work i can multiply it and you're going to understand it's me working but you want to brag you want to show people i work three jobs and i add to this house keep working keep working keep working are you there deuteronomy 8 verse 7 for the lord that god bringing thee into a good land a land of water why did lot didn't go there lord thought the other land was well watered a land of fountain and depth that spring out of valleys in here a land of wheat and barley and vine and fig tree and pomegranate a land of olive oil no heart problem you eat this no no cholesterol a land of honey a land wearing that shall eat bread without water you won't lock any bread that shall not lack anything what a promise in it a land whose stone our water and out of who's here there may dig water i gave you even the minerals hallelujah the bible continuing deuteronomy for the land with the dark esteem to possess it is not as the land of water from once he came out where that source the seed and deed water water it with the food as a garden of water you were working in egypt you have to work work work and when you sow your seed you have to always take care of it and make sure the water is there that is not where i'm bringing you i'm bringing you into a place where you must put your car in neutral i am tired of your working i want to be responsible i want to do the work hallelujah but the land with the ego to possess it is a land of water and water and drinking water of the rain of water a land which the lord that god cared for the eyes of the lord that god are water 24 hours always upon them from the water even unto the water who don't want to go to a land like that 24 hour 366 days god is watching on the land hallelujah hallelujah that i will give you the reign of your land in his due season the first rain and the water the mayors gather in the corn and that wine and dan oil and i will send water in that water for that water i will send water grass in that field for that water [Applause] the promised land was built to take care of the cattle lord didn't see this the rich young ruler didn't see that amen hallelujah that that means eat and be water are we okay buckle up everybody clear so now we understand the description of the promised land amen the place where abraham went and that's the place that lot refused he wanted to go to the other side on the east why did the region of gathering got demons you ready you ready all right here it is in number 32 verse 1 the bible says now the children of ruben and the children of god had a very great multitude of water as israel was coming out of egypt you okay now follow me very carefully among the 14 tribes there were two tribes that looked strange it was the tribe of reuben and the tribe of god when the tribe of joseph got into the business of caddo they were not prospering good follow me very carefully when the tribe of judah worked on caddo they were not prospering good but when the tribe of rubin got into caddo their cattle were always multiplying when you go to the tribe of god their cuddle will also multiply it seems like those two tribes have a special gift to handle cattle and they were prospering on caddo more than any other trouble follow me carefully these two tribes had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of water jezer and the land of water that behold the place was a place for water israel was supposed to leave egypt and go straight to the promised land do you follow me because of their sin god took them to a detour everybody here instead of going straight 35 they got them on 485 everybody clear and they begin to go in a circle to get to the exit are you there does it make sense so when they begin to go they're reaching to this place you okay the land of jezebel everybody here but the promised land they have to cross the river water with joshua to enter into the promised land everybody here but when they got here they found this region again this region that sharp lot here that the region was again fatal very good for what for carol they demanded and god already told them that in the promised land i would take care of caddo we okay now but they found another region outside of the promised land that is good also for caddo [Music] are we okay so the children of god and the children of reuben came and spoke unto moses and to eliezer the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying atheros and dibon and jezer and nimra and heshborne and elilah and shibam and nebo and beyond even the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land of water and that servant have water moses and the answer everything that we see here it looks good for carol and we have cara so what is your decision moses look okay so what we're going to the promised land what is wrong he said and where for satay if we have found water in let this land be given unto the servant for possession and bring us over water a country of honey and milk a country where the lord is dead 360 today a country that received where a country that have iron a country that had brass a country where you're going to have houses you didn't build a country that you're gonna have houses that god filled for you a country that you're gonna have well that you didn't dig this that they saw here made them reject the whole land of israel they say this is better for us please we don't want the promised land the region of the gallery hey the bible continued and they came near unto him and say we will build water did they say we will build peak fold so they were raising water are we okay at that time they were raising good thing four here our cattle we will build shift here for alcado and cities for our little one but we ourself will go ready army before the children of israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little one shall dwell in defence cities because of the inhabitant of the land moses was angry he says you want to discourage the people we're almost there and you want to stay out so you cross against the congregation to sin they say no moses you don't understand we're going to build city here we're going to build everything our wife our children are going to stay out of the promised land we're going to go with you with our weapon and help our brother to find their position when they find their position in the promised land then we're going to come back out and we're going to stay here hey we will not return on to our houses until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance they become helpers they can start with you to build you up unto a certain place and after a while they will pull off because they don't want to go with what you have [Music] come on we will not inherit with them on the underside jordan all forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of jordan where who taught them that was their inheritance and moses said unto them if the children of god and the children of reuben will pass over with you over jordan every man armed to battle because moses have a different ministry he have to even give them the letter of divorce because he knew as much i can preach preach preach they still want to get married to that woman just let them go are you there before the lord and their land shall be subdued before you then you shall give them the land of guilt for possession everybody here but if they will not pass over with you arm they shall have possession among you into the land of what moses say if they help you you can let them leave the promised land and go back but if they don't help you they're going to have their possession where in other words these two tribes have their property in canaan they had their predestination property in canaan but they didn't want that property they say we stay out moses say if you don't help them you're going to go automatically by force you're going to go there you know what they did they made sure they went and they help everybody and they pull back i don't want to go through much scripture but you can read it later everybody clear brother branham said in the message as i was with moses and when this great thing taken place when each one of these hebrew mothers in the travailing in the childbirth call out like water so brother branham say when the hebrew mother were giving birth to their children as they're pushing the child out you want to hear the mother goes robin and when that word come out something is in that word somebody who's in the promised land heard an earthquake what is going on a mother thundered somewhere they were traveling in childbirth call out like robin that placed him positionally in water so the name of the tribe was automatically connected to the position in the promised land are you there exactly the way that mother said and call his name said it i don't have it all written down here wrote down here but say rubens means water do you understand why those tribes have a lot of sheep [Music] so their gift came by birth amen everybody predestinated by god to flourish god means water do you understand why those three tribes were prospering you can work work work you won't work like them they don't work too much they work a little bit and they keep flowing about here and ephraim means water that's why ephraim could not raise caddo about here and by spiritual discernment joshua the new leader by spiritual discernment placed each one where he belongs divided the land just water god gave this tribe a gift to prosper with the cuddle but those gifts in order to prosper right must be placed in the promised land [Music] that's why gift and calling are without repentance you are born with it but for your gift to work right you must be in the world in a message adoption brother branham say the church positionally before the foundation of the world when god in water you remember that in eternity when that pillar of fire came out and he won a breath because when he go he's carrying his children when he go he's carrying his children god says they're praying too much over there let me give them more space and god begin to buff you when god in his labor pain was bringing forth you knowing what she would do he positionally pledged you into his own water so when you come in this world there is something in your life that is already built in you oh my god i wish i have time hallelujah to be a water a housewife is a position [Applause] [Music] oh i am not serving the lord i am not serving the lord because i don't sing because i don't play piano you don't understand god the housewife that you have that you are taking care of your children it is your position [Applause] hallelujah to be a water to be a water to be a water to be out to be he pledged you positionally then when he then when we have come from the garlic land of egypt through sanctification he's pulling you out and he's baptized into water for the promise of god is the water ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of your then god having predestinated the church he said and all the people there will be million times a million that will walk very religiously and be deceived the only one that will not be deceived will be those that have come over into the water those that have come where into the water [Music] take your gift take your talent bring it into the promised land you're going to find your position ready are you there he says whoa before the foundation of the world have the name put on the lamps book of life and it's come over into the water and the water so your gift if you want that to operate very good you must bring it to jesus christ [Music] are you there and the rich young ruler brought his gift to the land and met the promised land and the promised land open up and say come follow me so that you can do what i sent you to do here on earth he retracted from the promised land he want to use his gift elsewhere and he use it in hell hallelujah gift and calling our water they came from there when they were birthing you are you there he want to be an evangelist then he called that jesus has given him the call that jesus has given him to follow him he had to be a soul winner as a young man returned to him again he remembered that he had five brothers on back on earth and he didn't want them in that place he got a gift god gave it to him but instead of bringing the gift correctly he brought it in the wrong spot how that god trying to place his people and when god placed one then oh oh oh the whole congregation want to be like that one have the same kind of thing do the same thing we are quite different [Music] you might be a singer i might be a singer but we are cut different don't copy one another stay the way god built you somebody do something you do it somebody do something you do it somebody do this you do it who are you following me they got a blue skirt you got a blue skirt [Music] hallelujah we are made different we are natured and we are positionally placed each one for a different work maybe one for just a little kind of work another for a water there should not be competition in this church hallelujah i believe he was david or one of the prophets i forget now say i would rather be a water a leader position god give it to you be happy with it sometimes you want the big position do you know the the the the headache that goes with it do you want to sleep at 2am like me do you know what time i went to bed [Music] hallelujah the bible says there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the water plural for one star differ from another star in water we are not alike [Music] oh my god abraham don't want to stay one of them go over here we found man i say get over here oh my the lord give me a good cornfield then he comes over here god say well now wait a minute i'm supposed to raise oats but i'm going to get corn too hallelujah you ain't got nothing to do with corn get oats ought is your part to raise you ain't supposed to hurt sheep when you are supposed to hurt cattle god want to place the church but every one of them want to do the same thing and you can't tell them and think about it no they still got that god in nature don't do this but always in defense hallelujah the church is supposed to be predestinated unto the adoption of children god can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something first try that and see if it's right the bible said try the spirit this man claims certain things try it and see if it's right if it's right move right with it then say lord send some send us something else in other words we must be flexible if what you're doing don't work don't bite your head against the wall be humble enough you say i see that i'm not working good at this instrument maybe i need to work on this instrument i am not working good in this position maybe i need to go this way until you're gonna feel like a position click click that's you and over there you won't strive automatically it begin to work hallelujah then you are going to see a church of god begin to get its place then when the philistine will go to backing up the short will go off hell will grow down faces will be washed cigars will be missing that's right when the church begin to get into its mighty power when we have the ananias and sapphira and few of them yes sir you shall see when the holy church stand together in his power positionally placed as sons and god sons of god adopted into the family of god powerful church standing there in what in glory so when these two tribes were going to the promised land god bless them with true gift they miss it instead of bringing the gift in the promised land they stay outside of the promised land on the east side everybody clear what is going on brother branham look what israel was dividing up the land the land there was i believe he was god was one of them you there now and perhaps they have trouble they didn't go over into the water reuben and god anybody clear now they stay on this side borderline jesus visited the same people [Music] are you there when they stay outside at the promised land at the beginning they had sheep but the longer they stay out of the promised land they got so low until they begin to raise pigs why was the devil requesting jesus we want to stay here we got a lot here we got two tribes and a half of here this is our land hallelujah and look at the result of staying out of the full benefit of god's love when jesus visited them he went over in water you see where it comes from that is where they dwell and where they made that is where they come from right there and their attitude was still the water those demons were still on that country are you there because it cost them a bunch of hug to have the meeting they asked jesus to leave their land they didn't want nothing to do with it they had their own way they had their own churches they didn't want nothing to do with jesus so they asked him to leave their land their country the region of galleria was the region of tribe that stayed outside of the promised land rejecting the promised land and the devil stay right there he said leave us here this is where we do our work don't send us to hell there is an air conditioning here these people never like you to begin with when you brought them out of egypt they refuse they want to stay here so we have right to stay there everybody clear everybody clear the region of galileo became a habitation of devils in revelation 18 the bible say i saw another angel came down from heaven having a great power and the earth was lightened up with glory i'm good a lot of because i'm a little bit over and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is water is water it's become a habitation of water that's why the voice say come out of hell my people [Music] that angel brother branham said come out of here god sent the mighty angel or a messenger and his light was not in a corner it's cut all over the world the earth come out of her what her and her sister denomination to lighten the earth and call the people out of her now you know that's truth a messenger was sent from heaven to call god's people out of babylon and his light lightened the earth great water everybody here so far let me head now to the airport the region of guadalajara ever created so far so now you understand where that region came from brother branham says this the man was
