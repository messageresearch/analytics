Exodus when Moses was scared and doubted himself when God told him to go save his people and the thing is God did not give Moses a pep talk oh yes you can do it you're strong because he didn't like we as men cannot we're not strong enough to do that Moses Our God told Moses that he's The Great I Am and when we're identified in Jesus Christ that's when we have the power and authority to do all things and the thing that's different about us and Moses we have the sacrifice God died for us we were born after that and I like and those song says uh when I left my voice and Shout every Wall comes

God I remember two weeks ago two years ago all kind of stuff amen glory glory hallelujah sister Amy that was wonderful amen finally somebody broke into the channel of an inspiration after all the sermons somebody began to catch it and put it in lyrics congratulations sister foreign glory to God we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience amen so welcome to spoken word Tabernacle in this morning of Easter we really really really appreciate the Lord for everything I'm just going to go straight to my announcement since you're standing if you don't mind but uh on April the 15th we have which is this coming Saturday we have question and answer that will be here in the church amen the young sisters that are responsible for I believe brother John probably announced it you need to see the Deacon so you can orchestrate everything Amen on April 19th which is on Wednesday that will be the first time we will have a 30-minute exhortation and we go straight to prayer amen I'm sorry for those that are going to be online we got to cut it off but if you hear we will pray pray pray pray pray until God come down amen amen so don't miss it it's gonna be very important may God richly open the windows of heaven and we can live here Victorious amen another one is April the 30th you already know brother abrahamara will be with us here amen if you thought that I forgot I didn't forget how many are up to date with the sermon Glory Glory how many are reading the Cod book okay if you finish the church ages please we got the 70 weeks of Daniel go ahead and start on it so by the time I land down there you will be soaring pretty good if you don't show up in church and you behind your sermon please I'm really worried about your spiritual health amen if you didn't show up on Wednesday maybe you were work make sure by Thursday or Friday you catch up on the sermon and you stay up because the way the Holy Spirit move in this church every sermon follow Idol tell every time and if if you miss five six seven you are completely lost amen when you're gonna look they say part 64 then you will be like okay how am I going to start from part one so make sure you keep up with it amen yesterday we finished music part two it was two hour 47 minutes and 17 seconds amen so the first time it was three hours 33 minutes so 333 so if you put them together it's complete six hours a little bit more than six hours if you say that's too much Jesus preached on the road of imayas for six hours I didn't preach six hours I splitted in three hours and 33 and 2 hours and 47 minutes amen so everything you have need of in music has been presented with Bible scripture and with the court of the prophet he has nothing to do with my country with my uh whatever ethnicity or whatever you want to call it or my race or whatever I have nothing I didn't even touch anything on that all I have touched was the word of God and the message of the hour so even though you don't sing in the church we found out yesterday that the music you're listening at home the Christian music you're listening are opening door for Spirit amen and sometimes you are struggling you don't know why you can't get Spirit off it's because of the religious music that you're listening for you don't know that it's loaded with spirit and you opening the door and before you know it the home are struggling especially sisters because Mama love music more than Daddy and most of the time mom is the one playing the music and Mom is the one opening the door on YouTube and before you know it you got Spirit at home amen the the the music I'm looking at I'm seeing among message Believers are horrible what they're looking at what they're posting online the way the making brother Brown and we saw yesterday Elvis Presley didn't learn his dancing on the world brother Branham said he learned that in the church amen so they are dancing and moving things that young kids are doing and they're just learning it from religious people and it's Mama putting that and say go ahead and dance and before you know it the kids already caught up into that thing and later on kids are in trouble amen I've seen message Believers sisters posting stuff that uh you just look you say I wonder if they even were born again amen because a born-again woman could not even put something like this but it's all over across the board and that's what the devil is using so strong now among the young people the devil is using music to get into the young people in the message because it's an area in the message that was never covered properly that's why the devil is entering there to destroy life the young people rise for tomorrow fall tomorrow fall watch the music you're looking at amen amen watch what you're watching on your YouTube you are opening door to Spirit everybody okay so my job was done for two part one part two so your blood is not in my hand if you didn't show up that is up to you you pray for God to put it in my heart to release the tip at this point I'm still cautious about it there is somebody who asked for it on YouTube my brother wherever you are pray God very hard amen so that he put a conviction on me to release those tips amen but it was open to the church the music is already set the order of the music is set here before you come up with the music it's going to be filters not by Brother John Porter but by the word that was preached here and brother John Porter was there in part one and part two brother said was there in part one in part two so that's the filter they will be using so if you say no I don't see why they don't have to play my music the first question I will ask you were you there in part one and two if you say you are not there I say now I understand why are you struggling with this amen if you were there you didn't know then we can go over and talk about it amen everybody good you should be stronger than me do you know what time I went to bed let's go to second king we don't have visitors in this church okay we got family members amen so all our family members welcome to spoken word Tabernacle glory to God this sermon was so loaded and I have to chop it and pull another part for the next session because I cannot unload everything that I have this morning because it's Easter morning amen but let's see even the part that we chopped if we can be able to reach where we supposed to depending on the poor amen oh my what's going on everything is okay amen second king chapter 2 very familiar scripture we went through this about the seal evidence and the open evidence if you remember about the 24 stones that were in Jordan there were 12 that were buried and there were 12 that were put outside amen praise God finally we got our third camera for the church it's a big one right there behind if you look you look bigger than the other one the one that was there Lord's willing you will see it coming this way so all area are covered amen thank you for all your offering and thank you for all your building fun and all your tithing with that that's why we make things happen in this church so take over there I'm expecting to have a high quality image from the beginning to the end I put them on fire amen second king chapter 2 verse 6. if you dare you can say amen amen and Elijah said to him Terry I pray you here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan you might be seated We Know by the message of the hour that Jordan tap water everybody okay as a musician yesterday we taught you clearly the life and the consecration of a musician amen so you know that the first one to get the bullet are the musician we demonstrated that yesterday the first one in Nevada to start getting the bullet a musician so make sure as a musician consecrate your life because you're exposing yourself to war amen Hallelujah don't worry it will be okay I already I know you how you started and I know how you pull and I know how we end up amen and Elijah said to him Terry I pray you here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan this is the last station which symbol AS death amen I'm gonna use a different angle because we already touched the seal and the open evidence and he says as the Lord liveth thank you brother David now it's coming and as your soul leave us I will not leave you and day two went on everybody okay if you notice when Elijah and Elisha are Crossing Jordan the first time they are going to people Elijah Elisha is not alone Elisha is connected or is accompanied by Elijah and the one who's tracking that water first is not even Elisha no it is Elijah doing it right around them tap it as the church in Jesus Christ so the first Crossing you Crossing with Jordan somebody's doing the work we okay praise God Amen verse 7 and 50 men which are Pentecostal of the sons of the Prophet went and stood to view a far off they don't want to go all the way to the deep end they stay afar to just watch to see what's going on and day two stood by Jordan and Elijah the type of Christ took his mentor and wrap it together and smoke the waters and they were divided here and there so that day two went over on dry ground everybody okay so the first time Jordan was overcome overcome he was by Elijah striking the water opening and both of them are going amen there was no difference in the anointing of Elijah the anointing that Elijah have until he crossed Jordan was still the same there is no different right everybody okay thank you uh verse 9 and he came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said to Elisha ask what I shall do for you before I be taken away from you and Elijah say I pray you let a water double portion a double portion of your water so across Jordan the anointing increases [Music] are we okay so if the Cross Jordan with one portion when you're coming back again to Jordan you gotta have a double portion everybody okay you cross Jordan with one portion but when you're coming in to face Jordan the second time you must have the double portion amen amen glory to God let you must have the second oil everybody okay now okay let a double portion of your spirit be upon me and he said you have asked a hard thing nevertheless if you see me when I'm taken from you it shall be so to you but if not it shall not be so to see means to understand amen and he come to pass as they still went on and took that behold there appear a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried this is naturalized but our eyes are spiritual amen he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and read them in two pieces there is a lot of stuff loaded there he took up also the mentor of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan at this time Elijah is no longer there it's Elisha with the mentor of Elijah but not with one portion now it is with a double portion everybody okay what is going to happen and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and say where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had Smit in the water they parted here and there and Elisha went out so if you look in Elijah's perspective not Elijah Elijah's perspective Elisha crossed the Jordan twice elasha the top of the church must cross the Jordan twice glory to God Elisha which is a type of the church amen will face Jordan twice amen the first time you go with one portion amen but it's not finished yet the second time you must come with a double portion amen then your situation with Jordan is over everybody okay but if you already Cross Jordan with one person you already in preparation everybody okay when the revelation of the Rapture open up a cross Jordan with that revelation you construct Jordan the second time in other words death must be overcome we okay now we okay now so you got death in you in two places there it is praise God let's go to Roman 8. how many times do you overcome Jordan twice you got death in two places the first time one portion the second one you need a double portion everybody okay Glory Glory sincerely my burden down Romans 8. chapter 10 uh verse 10. if you dare you can say amen amen amen and this Crush be in you the body is how how can Christ be in you and your body still dead amen amen how can cross be in you and you still have death what Paul is saying here is even if Christ is in you something is still dead Glory Glory Hallelujah see sadly a burning down Glory Glory sincerely then down down amen any question amen any question now let's read verse 10. and if Christ be in you which picture is it everybody okay if Class B in you the body is half dead or maybe somebody might ask a question body spirit soul predestinated seed body spirit soul and then the seed let me put something like this we okay now you make my life easy right now let's read verse 10. and if Christ be in you what is dead the body everybody okay now we okay the body is dead because of water so this body still have sin everybody okay from here to here amen something struck your soul and remove one portion of death but there's still another death we okay now is cross being you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of what righteousness everybody okay but that's what finishes everything if the spirit of him that raise up the resurrection the spirit of Resurrection if the spirit of him in other words if they're anointing that pulled Jesus from the grave everybody okay if the spirit of him that raise up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you we okay he that raise up Christ from the dead shall also do water so whatever happened inside your soul will impact your body amen he that raise up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in water so for you to be quick and in the body the spirit must be in you everybody okay verse 12 therefore brethren we are adapter not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the water spirit do water modify how are you gonna mortify your body if the spirit is not in you you're going to struggle amen if you through the spirit do mortify in other words you put to death the deed of the body you shall do what live so for you to overcome your body to put him into a proper place you must have the spirit of God any question so far let's go to Revelation one then we will pray we're moving pretty quick praise God Elijah and Elisha Elisha have to face death Jordan twice first time with one portion second with another portion Paul is saying that even though Christ is in you amen the body is still dead that's why according to Romans 7 Paul say that in me in my flesh I see that there is something there is a law there there is a law of sin and death amen who can deliver me from this body from this Temple that I'm trapped on Revelation 1 verse 17. if you dare you can say amen amen and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me that had seven stars saying to me fear not I am the first and the last so if he already start something in you who's going to finish it himself amen because he's our father and he is also Omega Verse 18 I am he that lives and was dead in other words I came out of the grave and behold I'm in love forevermore in other words I would never die anymore they resurrected Jesus Christ don't die anymore we will get that down the road amen I am a love forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of water death let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father on this Easter morning Lord remembering the greatest victory that you have accomplished in the history of Christianity Lord which is the resurrection from the dead Lord what a celebration when Lord father we can be gathering together as an expression of the power of Resurrection father yesterday he reigned all day and we ask you Lord father to stop the rain Lord you heard our prayer and you have given us a beautiful day where the sun is shining Lord and not only is the sun shining but Lord father we are in your presence in your house Lord may you move us completely out of the way may you come and speak to our soul may you be the Alpha and the Omega of this service Lord father bless your children and minister to those that are here and those that are streaming online Lord may this sermon be a blessing to the soul and may you touch their body as well in the name of Jesus Christ amen glory to God I'm going to read one more scripture you don't have to turn there but it's just to lay a foundation the Bible says in the Book of Matthew 27 verse 62 now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priest and Pharisee came together unto palate saying sir we remember that that is silver said while he was yet alive after three days I will rise again so even though Jesus was dead he was still a threat to the enemy because before his death he already made some powerful statement and the statement he made was about his resurrection amen and the Pharisee remember that this man here what we have here is not something to play around even though he's dead is still dangerous and the danger lies in the power of Resurrection [Applause] everybody okay they say command therefore that the separate can be made house sure until the water Third Day bless his disciple come by not and daughter steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the water dead why because the last error [Music] come on shall be how worse than the water first I got the news from the devil that error happened amen that's why we are here this morning because Jesus Christ Rose from the grave amen and because of that we don't have one Jesus you have many jesuses that's why the era was very wasted everybody okay everybody okay so what the devil is afraid of is a resurrected Jesus Christ he knew that Jesus had the beginning he's going to have an end but Jesus after he said he said no no no no no no no let me check this guy right here because if we come back again in life everybody okay everybody okay if he crossed Jordan one time if we come the second time toward Jordan he's gonna come with a different anointing it's gonna be greater than before and we are the proof of the Resurrection that's why we are in love that's why we can sing for him that's why we can praise him that's why we can breathe that's why we have power over everything because Jesus is Alive [Music] [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay oh my God my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the power of Easter everybody okay the power of Easter right now we are completely in roof chapter four amen and in roof

amen the spirit is already good but your body have a Kingsman Redeemer everybody okay because of this guy there is no way you and him can meet together in the body everybody okay in order to meet with him in the body you must be like him everybody okay because the Bible say when we will see him we will be like him and to be like him we must remove the death that is still in our body everybody okay that's why Bo has taught the roof you rest here you go home take the seven seal go sit down let me hold gender that Rascal back there everybody okay and brother Branham said that first Kings made me demand to as is the devil the Bible says this in Hebrew chapter 2 for as much then as the children are partaker of Flesh and Blood we become human being he Jesus Christ also himself likewise took part

Jesus brought happiness he brought Joy this is what I must see in my house look at that everybody okay everybody okay brother random say when roof was resting he was a top of the church doing water in the promises of water we have the water now of our Salvation we have it right there we are not worried whether we are going over there on we are going that's right God said God promised it and we got the water Earnest amen don't be in water do you see Christ has accepted us no way to get away from it now we are dead amen all we have to do is just to do whatever wait he's done doing the water King's Men redeem your ship we have the earnest of it right now waiting for the time when he comes out and then what next thing roof was roof was water rewarding everybody okay glory to God what does he mean to the church that is what the church did he entered into justification under Luther he went into sanctification and the Wesley went into the baptism of the Holy Ghost in This last days and now resting with the earnest of our inheritance that we know that something has happened in us right there we have passed from death and water life waiting groaning with nature for that time when we will receive a water immoral life any motor fullness our body will be how redeemed everything is water we are just waiting from him to return back from the water gate and when he returned from the grave that's when he he's coming will trigger the rapture the coming down of Jesus Christ will trigger your going up when he come he stopped Midway when you go up you stop Midway and we meet him in the middle of the field like Rebecca and Isaac then he'll take you to his home everybody okay everybody okay last Sunday we saw that Paul had a prayer and the prayer of Paul was in Thessalonians chapter 5. Paul says that and the Very God of Peace Sanctified you how holy not partially and I pray God that's your water whole spirit and your water and your water body be preserved how blameless everybody okay when you are born again in Jesus Christ your soul is already blameless everybody okay everybody okay your spirit is already blameless everybody okay but your body is not blameless because your body is still growing old your body is making your hair change it's giving you Rico which is telling you death is still working in you everybody okay so Paul is prayer is that I want your soul I want your spirit I want also your but in other words I want your whole thing to be blameless when Jesus Christ return in other words when Jesus Christ come to meet his blood his blood Master his blood must be blameless how are you going to get blameless the Bible said to preserve blameless unto the coming of water so Jesus Christ won't come until these three elements are blameless am I reading another question amen if your if our body have now reached Perfection yet Jesus Christ cannot come everybody okay don't worry we're flowing this says Faithful Is He that is water cause you the one who called you is faithful and it's important for you to know that he's faithful in other words he will never disappoint you everybody okay in other words when he starts something on you he won't let it go until he reached where he was going everybody okay Paul is saying that remember that the one who called you is faithful and who also will water do it in other words the one that they live for your soul the one that they live for your spirit and the one they will also deliver your body is all done by God [Applause] everybody okay there is nothing you have to do your full salvation is completed complete complete everything is made by God Amen when he start right here just know he's going to finish somewhere amen you won't be able to give yourself the Holy Spirit God gave to give it to you and to get the body checked it is not your responsibility [Music] amen it is the responsibility of ours to God deal with the King's Men He was not the responsibility of roof everything that you have need of is under the responsibility of God if it's under the responsibility of God how are we going to get there let's go to First Corinthians chapter 15. glory to God everybody okay we stop somewhere let's pick it up Glory Glory the power of Easter are we there yes First Corinthians chapter 15 let's start by verse 17. you remember last Sunday about the resurrection of the dead so we clear verse 17. if Christ be not raised your faith is how vain no Easter no faith everybody okay you are yet in your water sins because it's Easter that opened your deliverance from sin everybody okay the dying of Jesus Christ no problem because the Pharisees say that say we dealt with him amen he's dead this man is over the disciple discourage everybody went to their own place but they say wait a minute the problem is if this man amen that's the problem everybody okay dying no problem he can die and stay right there then we finish with him but if he comes back again then it's a bladder problem everybody okay Verse 18 then they also which are falling asleep the Christian increase our water perished so if Jesus Christ never rose again every believer that die is gone you're not gonna come back again amen let's continue verse 19 19 if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men must have in other words if your life in Jesus Christ is only now when you die it's over Paul said we are most miserable because they are the ones are mad effective and enjoying everybody okay you are the most miserable amen let's get it now verse 20. but now is crossed on water we know that Paul are so crushed Peter saw him you remember that Sunday James saw him more than 500 people saw him we know that Jesus is Alive the apostles saw him the disciples saw him watch carefully but now is Christ's reason from the dead we know that he's alive Karma and become the water how is the first fruit written the way it's written in my Bible it is written first amen and there is a hyphen I don't know if that's the same way man it's like that because one man cannot be plural everybody okay everybody okay the way it's written is say first fruit Amen in other words the fruit are many everybody okay but he is the first one everybody okay meaning they are the ones that are coming but he is the first one to pop up and when you see the first one coming up it is telling you the grand is okay and it gives you hope that the other one I also come up so the first fruit of your field is very important everybody okay if you got seven daughters and the first one get married everybody okay he give you hope that the remaining let me leave it alone that's okay everybody okay let's go back to the first fruit everybody okay everybody okay somebody would have caught it and become the first fruit of them that did whatever slept so sleeping is for the Christian amen if you notice here Jesus is not the first fruit of the living [Music] everybody okay because the first fruit of the living was Enoch everybody okay Enoch didn't die but the Bible said he was translated he was changed amen without seeing death but Jesus Christ died everybody okay and he become the first fruit of them that were dead what does the first fruit mean amen amen because Jesus was not the first one to resurrect everybody okay everybody okay Moses died he rose they saw him on Mount Transfiguration that's why the devil was looking for him he could not find it amen Elijah has a resurrection Elisha has a resurrection when the berry uh Elijah they were bringing a man that was dead they put him down and uh he hit the bones and he came back to life so Jesus was not the first one matter of fact Jesus resurrected people Jesus resurrected Lazarus what makes Jesus to be the first one are they already resurrected before him everybody okay everybody that died and rose again before Jesus Christ died again all right everybody okay Moses will be killed in Israel Lazarus Rose and die everybody that was dead and rose again died again but Jesus Christ is the first one that when he died and rise again he can no longer no more in other words the resurrection of Jesus Christ brought a new species [Applause] am I reading a different Bible the resurrection of Jesus Christ bought a new species of human being we talked about two bodies we got a theophany everybody okay and we got our natural body amen ities don't eat our Natural Body eat Amen to your funny can appear and disappear the natural body cannot disappear but after the resurrection of Jesus Christ we find Jesus appearing disappearing Crossing wall and yet he can eat a hamburger everybody okay so Jesus brought a specie that is Godly God and human mixed together are we okay I'm going slowly my friend everybody good let's continue reading the Bible say and he become the first fruit of them that slept so the first specie that came up from the grave with another category of human being was Jesus Christ he became the first fruit what does the fresh fruit mean to us William Marion Branham brother Branham says that he was the first corn of God to it that has been raised from the water Dead God's first corn of what by God's quickening power God had quickened his life raise him up from the dead and he was the first fruit of those that the first fruit he was Dash we okay that is why they had to have that shift for he was the first one that came to water maturity brother brought him his friend here according to Leviticus 23 that when you have a field in the Old Testament when you go and you grow a field things will begin to come up then for some reason among everything that is growing one of them will be a chief amen and the chief is very important because the chief give you the direction everybody okay the chief is born Chief just like that let me leave the guide alone everybody okay so when the first one which maturity in the Old Testament brother Branham said what they were doing they were going they take it and they plug it they say praise the lord we will take this and give it an offering unto God Amen when they give it to the priest the priest will take it and begin to wave over the field and say praise the Lord all of you guys yes yes you see this this is the way all of you will be this is the final product even though you are not there even though you are still struggling even though you are unjustified somebody is under sanctification somebody is already in the baptism of the Holy Ghost just know that at the end all of you will look like this everybody okay everybody okay so brother Branham say and he was with as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the water rest will come it was a son and today because he was the first Son of God to come to full maturity to be in God he was planned up from the earth and he was willing for the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had been many times he had been tapped and many times and as we shall see later that he will stop but this was really the first fruit of them that slept he was wave over the water the promise see that I had the promise of water why is he wave William Mayon Branham he said he was wave at the day of water Pentecost and the day of Pentecost when they came a sound from heaven like a water a waving muddy Rushing Water and was wayful for the people depend because the people that was up there at Pentecost waiting for the water blessings to come in other words when they pick up the first shift and the bracket everybody okay and they wave it offered the congregation they are telling you that everybody will reach their maturity everybody okay and when Jesus Christ was plucked up from the earth brother Branham say on the day of Pentecost what he was doing he was waving he has been waved off at the people and buy their wave in your Pentecost he brought the baptism of the Holy Spirit what are you trying to say that the first fruit of the dead or the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead is what made way to the new birth everybody okay without the resurrection of Jesus Christ without a mystery there is no new person everybody okay he took the power of Easter so that the children of God can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit it is Easter that opened the way that God can enter human being [Applause] everybody good Lord help me the Bible say in First Peter here that blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant water Mercy has done water he has brought us again meaning you were already born because Jesus taught Nicodemus you must be born how again because he was already born the first birth is from your mom and daddy but the second birth is from God amen and Peter is saying he has begotten us again unto a lovely water how did he birth Us by the water resurrection of water Jesus Christ from the water so no Resurrection no breath yeah that's it everybody okay and when the Resurrection come to give you birth what does he do you there first four brother Robin he breath the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the water then to enter a water inheritance that is how Incorruptible and how undefiled faith is not away and daddy already tells his way reserved in heaven for you you have an inheritance from heaven you have one I have one but that inheritance your inheritance is different than mine there is a reservation everybody okay everybody okay in other words you have a room reserve for you and I have mine reserved for me what is that inheritance that is reserved in heaven everybody okay that inherits us how undefiled and faith is not cannot continue can I continue you already gather The Inheritance is how Incorruptible and it's how undefiled not away in other words he doesn't die so they inheritance is eternal and its way where is that in heaven in what heaven so in heaven we got something that is eternal that doesn't have sin and default and that is uncorruptable but Peter says that we are born by the word The Incorruptible word of God so what is Incorruptible is the word everybody okay so you're in reality test that is in heaven is a word that is undefiled and that is eternal it is reserved in heaven your inheritance is your theophany amen yeah everybody okay everybody okay so when you are born again am I reading a different Bible amen Peter is saying when you are born again by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from there dead he birth you also to any water inheritance Incorruptible and defile that fed if not the way that is reserved for her in heaven and it's reserved for water for me in my father's house there are many water they are reserved for thank you everybody okay imagine the world when you are born again your theophany has something [Applause] your new breath connects you back to your theophany he activated yet your funny knows that my body now is why you're right [Applause] and now your theophany begin to come everybody okay is calling come up a little higher into the perfect word come up a little higher into the eternal the power of Easter the power of Easter opened the way to two breaths can I continue can I continue they're begotten from the dead New Birth deal with your Inside Man or your inner men which is your soul and your spirit amen that's what happened but once he quickened your seed everybody okay it doesn't stop there he begin to activate your theophany so that your body begin to get prepared amen so that your body and the theophany must lead together in other words when the Redemption started here your body is already included in the process don't worry don't worry my friend we will get there what happened who does it it's the Easter it is the resurrection without the resurrection there is no new birth with that Resurrection there is no change of the body first scripture second one glory to God in the Book of John chapter 7 verse 37 the Bible say in the last day it was the day of the Feast of Tabernacle and the fix of Tabernacle have eight days it's in Leviticus you go to the Book of Leviticus if you look you want to see me see me after church you have eight days so the last day was the eighth day which eight times what eternity you got two rings you put right here marriage number eight everybody okay everybody okay everybody good everybody okay in the Eighth Day that's when Jesus spoke not on the first day not on the second day not even on the seventh day because the seven days in our audition but on the earth day is the bread Edge [Applause] yeah man everybody okay on their branded Jesus stood and he cried saying if any man do water first let him come unto me and do what to drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said I can challenge people that leave the message right here go search me the scripture in the Old Testament go find the description in the Old Testament this is Jesus himself speaking and God doesn't lie chase the scripture in the Old Testament and find it everybody okay I hear that belief on me as the scripture has said out of his own water shall flow water rivers of water living water but he speak he of the water spirit which day that we live on should what we see in the future for the Holy Ghost was not yet what given why because that Jesus was not yet glorified with our glorification no Holy Ghost is [Applause] but Jesus was glorified when he rose from the dead it is Easter it is the power of translation the power of glorification that opened the way for the Holy Ghost to come in the church that's why when he rose again now he can be waved in the day of Pentecost over the people because now he is a glorified Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit can come in the church [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay we were on verse 20. let's go to verse 21. God everybody okay huh you there for sis by Man Came water that's Adam you there my friend by man also came the water off the water because Jesus Christ said I am the so the resurrection is a person amen through Adam death enter but Jesus Christ was the resurrection so the resurrection came from Jesus Christ you got the first Adam and you got the second Adam the first Adam brought you death the second one brought you the power of Resurrection everybody okay everybody okay pay attention because I'm gonna hit some hard water here everybody okay verse 22 for us in Adam all did what yeah everybody is represented in Adam whether you sinner or not everybody okay Karma even Somewhere In Christ shall all be made how alive the Bible doesn't say that everybody will be alive the Bible says in everybody okay so to be made alive you must be in Christ how do you get in Christ everybody okay the Bible said in First Corinthians 12 as the body is well and has many water members and all the member of the body are what one body being many or one body so also is who Christ for by water one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jew or Gentile whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink in water one spirit so to be in class is where you are sure for the resurrection they say will they babe will they be in Christ they didn't say will a baby go to heaven but baby in Christ everybody okay will a babe in class go up in there absolutely if he is a babe he's how born again no matter how young he is he's shall do water if you receive the Holy Spirit at 12 years old all right 13 years old I am 90 years old it doesn't matter your age you will go amen those that will be made they love are only those that are in Christ everybody okay so far not everybody we okay job to verse 23. this is where we hate it amen you there you there watch this now but every man in his water on order cross the water first fruit because he must be the leader everybody okay cross the first fruit he already did afterwards they data crust and water Paul is saying there won't be a resurrection everybody okay the first one that resurrected was Jesus Christ he is the first fruit no problem and now there is a second resurrection that is coming up but the one that will be resurrected are gonna be resurrected at the coming of Christ which coming which coming amen which coming because Jesus Christ come from the East and the West everybody okay everybody okay remember Christ is the word everybody okay and Christ is also flesh everybody okay cross the word come on the west on Sunset Mountain Christ on the flesh we saw that he's gonna come away amen if Christ the word that came on Sunset Mountain was the coming of God everybody should have been risen from the dead I'm going slowly it is the coming of Christ but the coming of Christ as the word because Jesus Christ said before I come as a flesh shall I found faith everybody okay so to find Faith he must come first as the world to restore the first according to Malachi's Hall Luke 17 30 to bring the rapturing first when the faith is established then the physical Jesus Christ can come back to pick you up everybody okay if not brother Branham saw him on says Advantage but after that brother Branham died and brother Branham is still on the grave [Music] which coming is bringing the Dead not this one because in 63 the dead are still there after 63 William Byron Madam died we have our loved one that died none of them Resurrected amen but there is a coming of Christ that will bring the resurrection [Applause] [Music] I'll let you soak a little bit everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay glory to God amen amen are we okay are we okay now this coming here on the West amen brought a resurrection amen [Music] but it's not the resurrection that we're talking about everybody okay everybody okay every coming of Christ will always bring a resurrection [Applause] everybody okay whether he come on the west oh he come on the East he will always bring your Resurrection [Applause] thank you everybody okay on the west side he came as the water it's a spiritual coming and they took his picture right there amen and the spiritual coming will bring a spiritual Resurrection [Applause] everybody okay and the natural coming will also bring the natural Resurrection [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay what kind of Resurrection comes here everybody good everybody good everybody okay We Found Jesus Christ the word amen he comes as a theophany amen According to second Thessalonians the Lord will be revealed in the sky amen they took his picture they turned it to the right they say that looks like the man of Earth but that one was not the physical Jesus Christ he was the word he have to be revealed by Mighty Angel Second Thessalonians we went through that now there is another Jesus that come from the flesh this one come in the West amen this one come from the East everybody okay every coming have a resurrection everybody okay everybody okay this one will bring a spiritual Resurrection amen amen and this one will bring a natural Resurrection I'm saving you 40 years in the message 40 Years of trouble in the message and you don't understand brother Branham everybody okay this spiritual Resurrection have two sides have I lost anyone when that Resurrection comes imma finds you in two spots everybody okay the first part imagine you completely as a sinner in the world you don't even know God you are smoking party you are drinking you are doing all kind of stuff you don't know God at all you're a complete sinner you are a prostitute you are a drug addict but that Resurrection will find you there [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay the second place he might find you imma finds you under a denomination [Applause] oh in a religious setting when you go to church and you think that you are Christian but you are still dead maybe you are a Baptist maybe you are Methodist maybe you are a Catholic and you thought you know how to serve God but you are still dead [Applause] the power of Easter everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay because the predestinated seed that is in you is picky [Applause] everybody okay they predestinated seed only wake up according to its time I thought I'm going to preach this quickly and go everybody okay brother Branham say I'm going to refresh this if I taught you a water it would take water he was the word of God in the time of flute of Love of Wesley this is how so you must know what the time is you must know the day and the hour you're living in why because if Moses taught the message of who the timing is wrong it will take out because the timing is wrong if it is Jesus thought the message of water Moses in other words if Jesus would have come and said I'm gonna take you all out of Israel to the promised land people will look at him like which Promised Land are you taking as we already in the promised land it is still the word of God but it's Out Of Tune everybody okay it will take how why because the water predestinated that will only be how by that type of water water that is given for water it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition the water in other words the predestinated seed recognize the time there is a reason why you are not born in the time of power

never done anything for you sometimes even in the message [Applause] everybody okay you are born in the message but you still on the denomination [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay going to the message church is like a religion it doesn't change your life you are trapped under denomination everybody okay so God will send the word and when the world is coming is to Quicken everybody okay it's

he was waiting forever the people that were waiting for the promise that was for them you must know the age but brother Branham says is that and to be worth how again we will ask in the last water okay according to water Luke 17 30. in the Sunday again in the day that the water s-o-n will be how revealed or wait again over the water so the revealing of the son of man is actually the son of man being waved after the people [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay brother brought them say as Christ was the first one to do water to rest from water the prophets and so forth although tap in many places he was the first fruit of those that is coming of water coming of who Christ coming out of the water they shall have to be a water that is how words again in the last oh my the working of them what was the chief everybody good the first one that comes water the first one that proved he was water that proof he was water Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about yes brother Branham we know what you're talking about he was wet after the water and the first time they will come forth for the water for a water out of water the resurrection out of water out of dark denominationalism will be a water that's the full maturity of the water has turned back again in its full water and being water wave Over The Water by the same and one day as he did how to bring what a resurrection [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay that's why the power that raised Jesus from the dead went and broke the seals right that's right brother brought him say look what we have seen in this day the quickening power has come to to open the water what was that the intelligence of a man no the water quickening power of God why breaking the seals everybody okay when we talk about the breaking of the seals it doesn't mean me coming here and preaching the first seal the second seal the third seal the fourth seal the sixth Hill the seventh seal and then that's it that's not the breaking of this year you ready they're breaking off the seals is a release of an anointing [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay because when you are in the world in the world when you are a sinner it is easy to catch you foreign we can catch you quickly if you go to the prison you don't have to preach the seals just preach Calvary when you open Calvary you show somebody you get him he's out the hardest catch is the denominational culture [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay because you are burning the message it doesn't mean you already met the god of the message you might be born in the message camp [Applause] that believes a certain Doctrine and you grow up with that Doctrine but your life doesn't change we heard the return Ministry Doctrine we read the Thunder Doctrine we heard the second coming Doctrine we heard perusa Doctrine where the life of the young people [Applause] no changing in life message believer that's why you need the seals seals are meant to break denomination [Applause] the seals is wired to destroy denomination [Applause] everybody okay the seals is an anointing.com and when they begin to open the word even if you were born in the messages you look you say my God now the message is real to me [Applause] steals [Applause] shot church is all along I was not understanding now I can find child labor [Applause] when he preaches it feels like the Bible is changing like the temp is changing it is not a man it is The Shield that are breaking you before you know it going to a Mercy Church become a joy beginning you were born you don't want to go to the church but when the anointing of the seal come in the church [Applause] [Music] if Mama is taking too long the children will leave you they get in the car they're going to church it is no longer a

water they have some water too many of his children are still in those water false churches they are those of whom he speak in Ephesians he says daughter awake meaning you are doing water water and arise from the water yes a resurrection and Christ shall give the water to be asleep is not to be dead they are sleeping among them they are out there in the Dead they are floating along with water God cries and the water wake up and do water here they are lending the influence giving their time their money actually their very life to this water Antichrist organization and all the wife thinking is water they need to do water they must do water repent they need to have the water change of mind and turn to add water that's what happened to Apostle Paul foreign not the scripture left and right but crucifying the message of the earth until Jesus Christ met him when he met him Paul change Paul didn't say I was drinking beer the people on the day of Pentecost that came to repent they were not sinners go check in the book of Acts chapter 2. They Came To Worship in the temple amen they were Sinner by denomination but they were not living in sin so when the message come it depends where you are when they coming come either he comes to

when you live the life of sin the life of denomination when you live their life remember what you got in there let me close it remember the god that is in you God didn't die and Rose for nothing amen when God Quicken you when God rolls you up it is telling you that that God is no longer somewhere [Applause] that God is in you now in the baptism of the Holy Ghost remember what you got inside your

remember in you there is another being have faith in dabbing that being that tell you don't go there don't answer that no no no leave it alone Let It Go Remember Have Faith from that person he knows what he's doing what is the importance of that person that person is going to help that person that you got your hands on if you did if it dwells in you brother Branham is telling the church when you take your hand and you lay on somebody before you start have faith on what you got in your body amen that hand is not wasting time Dahan has been rubbing shoulder with the supernatural so when you put it on your son will have faith on you say son you are suffering with something but I remember where I was I remember what God did to me the god that is in me I have faith in him if he changed me he's

person the one that quickened you we lost so quick and that person have faith on what you got in your body that is the power of Islam he opened the power of the Holy Ghost to be in you so you can be a blessing for your family God richly bless you let's say my friend thank you [Applause] the power of Easter Easter is a beautiful thing without Easter no Holy Spirit without Easter no resurrection of the Dead amen but if he already started then automatically he's going to take care of you Hallelujah amen expect Hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah Heavenly Father Lord once again we have been brought in remembrance what you did in Easter father being born on the religion we heard so much about Easter and probably what we knew was about the Easter Bunny it was about the gift it was about the clothing it was about the time that we can exchange gift the term that we can wish one another happy Easter his reason he is risen yes that's the father we could go but father today you have unfolded to us that Easter is not just about bringing you out from the dead because you didn't come alone you also took the Old Testament Center so he was a greater history a greater Victory than any victory that the Pharisee even taught father they were afraid that you alone will be brought back today to go to life but it was more than you all the Old Testament said were released and because you Rose everyone that died in you will rise again when you coming for the physical Resurrection and father you already started a resurrection as the scripture says that when we were dead in sin you have quickened us according to Ephesians 2 whether we were under denomination or whether we were in the market scene of the world father you came and you Quicken our souls you change our destination and you open the way that the very spirit of God can come down and dwell in Mortal beings because now you are already glorified and by being glorified you made a way to the Holy Spirit and father you didn't stop there not only did you Quicken our body our soul and our spirit but father you want also our body to be quickened and to be like you and potentially you begin to work because the theophany how's it coming down it is searching for something it is our eternal inheritance that has been reserved for us it is crying up that we can come up to a higher life and father if there is someone tonight or somebody this morning or this afternoon or wherever they are on the other side of the world they might be nighting that has not been quickened by this power that we're talking about that are still under the bounds of denomination where the denomination outside the message or within the message rank they don't know really what they are believing they cannot claim onto something they don't have something really sure that they can determine and say yes I got it father today is Easter may this day be a memorial for them that father you can Quicken them from whatever situation they are they are parents here that have children that are still under sin their family member that are not here this morning because the devil took a grip of him but Lord you told us to have confidence to have faith in what we got in our body if today we are standing is because something has not been done for us and if you did it for us you can do it for a loved one father wherever they are stop them turn them around Quicken them deliver them from the power of Darkness May the feathers of Darkness of laodicea of denomination be broken down so that Lord they can be exposed no more to a religion no more to a camper but to a living Christ to something genuine something authentic a real life which is a true Thunder for the devil lord father I pray that you granted because you Resurrected and you release that power to be available for the church Lord if someone is sick this morning and those that are in a hospital father streaming May the power of Easter touch the motor body those that have been under the weather with nice or congestion coughing coffee the pneumonia all kind of symptoms father quickened them Lord if somebody is dead box leading in the Christian walk until Church doesn't interest them anymore they become tall to the things of God church is something where they miss or not it doesn't matter it doesn't bother them again father they're going in the deaf walk may you be merciful to them may you Kindle the fire again may you Quicken them so that Lord you can revive that soul and a burning desire can rise up again that would show them back again to the things of God so that whenever the house of God is open whether it's for question answer whether it is for whatever it is may they put everything aside yes but may they give you preeminence because religion have killed a lot of people in this message but just thinking they are good they never been in a nightclub they never drink they never did this they are still virgin in the body but don't know that they are completely lost they're under the bounds of denomination they don't have any life father break that and free your children free this church freedoms that are streaming father bring them a true history bring Easter to each family of this church each person under my voice bring them the true Easter so that Christianity can be a life so that if one can go by the grave they will know for sure that they will rise again we thank you Lord and we commit it unto their hand in Jesus precious name come on brother Kalima let's pray for the polycar brother Kelly come let's pray for him I believe they prayed already but it just came to call amen let's pray for him colonoscopy tomorrow let's the Easter power track it so that we have a report to glorify God go ahead brother [Music] yes it is
