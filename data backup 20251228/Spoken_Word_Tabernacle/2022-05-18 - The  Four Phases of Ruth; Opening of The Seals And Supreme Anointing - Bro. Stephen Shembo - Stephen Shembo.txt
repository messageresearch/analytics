cod book and your church ages you finish it not yet oh my god it's taking a long time i'm ready to buy you the 70 weeks amen don't forget the house meeting this coming saturday brother robert at 2 30 right 2 30. so you already got the address lord's willing probably i'm not sure how the deacon will feel late maybe they might need to remind you again 2 30. so okay they will remind you lords willing so 2 30 be there sharp the question i believe already picked up the question so the late comers will see what we can do amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go straight to our scriptures go to the book of ruth you should love this book but this time ruth chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen blessed be the name of the lord good to see you brother abel amen ruth chapter 2 verse 15 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah this is after roof worked in the morning amen she went she was invited to the table she ate now this is the second round of one day everybody okay and when she was raised enough to glean so boaz never stopped the labor he only took the law away but the labor was still there amen you would have thought maybe the first time he met root don't work anymore because i have intent on you i will get you married i'll marry you so you need to sit down and just enjoy everything that's not the way you work amen he needs to see some character and when she was raising up to glean boaz commanded his young man saying let her glean even among the sheaves she was not permitted to do this before now she got more access something is open and reapproach her not you might be seated and let fall also some of the handfuls you should understand this now of purpose for her so roof is laboring picking up food and boas also is laboring through the reapers everybody okay boaz is working through the reapers and roof is working so there is two people working boaz is working even though he's not present he's working through the reapers through the preachers amen and then roof also is working so when roof is working boaz is working so roof is picking up food and boas is adding up food so when roof goes back home there is there is two category of food there is a food that she picked up her own by the law everybody okay because the law told her to do that and there is another food that she has not by the law but by bowers both of them make one food it's hard to separate the two everybody okay don't worry i know how to warm your engine and crank it everybody care amen so there is two food here one from roof coming from the law or from the commandments of god makes sense now and the second rule and the second food is coming from water from boaz this is an expression of his love towards her or his intention anybody care verse 16 and let fall also some of the handful of purpose for her and leave them so that she may glean them and rebuke her not so intentionally amen so if you don't work in the field of boaz you're not gonna get that food [Music] i wish the whole church was here amen that's why i'm missing service except if you have a legitimate order uh reason it's not good amen so roof if she stays at home she's not gonna get that food you get the food only when you labor in other words that's why paul said you don't work you don't eat anybody care so when you work as you're working god is also working so there is your work right here and god's work amen when you do your part everybody okay now when you do your part he does his part but you got to do your part you got initiated if you stay home it's not going to work you got to do something then he does something then at the end you got a double potion [Applause] [Music] everything double everybody care blessed be the name of the lord verse 17 so she gleaned in the field until what until evening that's the end at the evening time it's finished and beat out that she had green so somebody is really working how can you make a woman work like that you want to marry her amen see the love of god is different amen and she beat that she had gleaned and it was about a water so the quantity of food of one day one day produced enifa one e5 i hope i've spelled it pretty good h one e five of barley what does it mean why only one one day everybody okay and she took it up verse 18 and went into the city and her mother-in-law saw what she had cleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was surfaced so she's eating there if you stay home you're not eating at the table of the show bread so every time she goes to the field she has a right to eat and to clean and when she's cleaning she's getting a double potion and when she's leaving home she's leaving home with a nifa of barley one day and nifa of barley so actually the working that she was doing was not in vain amen everybody okay the working that you are doing have some fruit at the end you got food amen be the name of the lord job to verse 22. and naomi said to ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that you go out with his maiden in other words stay with his commandment do what the man told you to do that they meet you not in any other field it's going to be a problem so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwell with her mother-in-law in other words she completed her full cycle of work anybody care until they were nothing they were no more anything to clean the harvest is finished why do you make a woman work until the harvest is finished if you have an intent order let's go to matthew chapter 3. thank you jesus matthew chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen verse five few people hallelujah everybody okay dan went out in other words came to him to john the baptist just giving you a background then went out to him jerusalem and all judea and all the region round about jordan everybody was coming to john the baptist and they were baptized of him in jordan doing water so there is two things that happened in jordan one there was a confession of their sin you know what it means now and then the second one it was followed by baptism in water h2o anybody okay verse seven but when he john the baptist so many of the pharisees you remember paul was one when the senior were coming no problem when he saw the pharisee something alarming matter of fact he should be happy saying oh the religious people now are coming to receive the lord jesus christ amen when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees depending on their doctrine anybody okay come to his baptism he said to them oh generation of vipers can you imagine somebody coming to get baptized and you look at him and you say he's a viper amen who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come their dna was different amen bring forth therefore fruit meat for water i want you to listen closely when they were coming you had to confess your sin everybody clear and after confessing your sin you have to be baptized everybody okay if you look between the line you're gonna see the brazen altar here you saw it and what follows you're going to see the level right here anybody care then john is telling them it is okay to meet the brazen altar it is good to get baptized but you don't stop there everybody okay you must bring fruit everybody here fruit meat to your repentance anybody care we want to see some work we want to have some evidence some work that proved to us everybody here that you really repented anybody care in other words repentance is followed by work all by fruits anybody okay so far are we okay hallelujah verse eight bring forth therefore fruits plural meet for repentance in other words somebody was repenting you are pharisee i know you already you are good they're preaching to others you remember the pharisee you know all the quotes everybody okay you know about the law of moses that's okay now you came to me you are confessing your sin you're doing good and you are getting baptized you're doing good but do not stop there we want to see really if your confession was true anybody here we want to see something that is telling us that you really repented if we don't see work following your repentance something is wrong everybody okay so far verse nine and think not to say within yourself you see everybody here we have abraham to our father in other words when they come they have a proud spirit in their own they're coming like armenians anybody care they already have we are we are the people of abraham we are the children of abraham john say that doesn't matter i know what you're talking about i know what you're thinking you're thinking because you are jews you already got salvation that's not true anybody here for i say to you that god is able of these stones to raise up children to abraham ever here and now also the axes laid to the root of the trees plural people therefore every tree you okay now which brings not forth water anybody okay every tree which brings forth not good fruit is undone and cast into the water so if you are a tree and you have been planted you cannot just be a tree and stay right there we must see fruits if no fruit one day the master will curse you do you know jesus went to a fig tree looking for what and there was no fruit what happened to the tree anybody okay so far is two food in the field of boas you labor for some part he does his part at the end of the day one effort of barley but she have to complete the full circle of the harvest everybody care and john the baptist is saying you're coming you need to meet god at the praise and altar confess your sin you gotta repent that's fine you need to get baptized but these repentance and water baptism doesn't stop there you must have fruit you must have work that is showing that you truly repented everybody okay let's go to john chapter 6 and then we'll pray or maybe i'm going to read couple again [Music] if you dare you can say amen hallelujah wednesday wednesday and time john chapter 6 verse 25 if you're there you can say amen and when they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him rubber when came you here jesus look at them it looks like they were looking for jesus they came they say when did you come here if you look at that it seems like they were really searching for jesus verse 26 jesus answered them and say verily verily i say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles anybody care but because you did eat the loaves and were filled you are looking for me for food natural food anybody here verse 27 lab or not so there is a label that you must do everybody okay there is a work that roof must do there is a labor everybody okay work labor labor not for the meat which perishes all the effort everything you doing to search for me you are doing that for something that is perishing some natural something do not label for those kind of stuff there is an end to it ever here because according to the law of god you will seek first the kingdom of god then everything else will be added unto you you don't seek those things first then the kingdom led it's backward anybody okay so labor not for the meat which perishes but for that meat or the food which endureth to everlasting life in other words you need to do some work anybody here you need to do some labor but you are laboring for something that does not perish something that will bring you to eternal life something that will unite you with borders [Music] into the marriage anybody care so your label is not a label in vain just to go get food and eating if that was the case the roof could go to any field and get food and eat and remain roof amen but boaz told her you remain in this field because this field is more than natural food this food have natural food and redemption you stay right here and work right here but while you're working you're not working for something that perishing because at the lineage of jesus christ's roof was inserted eternal amen to be inserted in that lineage you know to do some work anybody okay label not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which endure to everlasting life which the who so not any kind of meat you gotta get it from the son of man amen the son of man shall give you there is a specific ministry amen for him the son of man has god the father sealed everybody the son of man is the one that have the approval seal of the father you work for him you work for boaz amen get the food of boas get the seed the barley from the field of boas because the field of boas is the field that have been approved to bring redemption not any other field you must stay on the field of boaz the seal of god is on the field of board the scepter of judah is laying right there not anywhere anybody okay verse 28 then say dead to him the one that were looking for natural food what shall we do that we might work or do the water the works of god so now when they told them labor they're ready okay what what can we do and jesus is answering them look at the work of god you ready [Laughter] jesus answered and said to them so they were expecting jesus to tell them go do something like this go do something like this go do something go go go over there and start working from 8 o'clock till 5 pm watch the work of god verse 29 jesus answered and said to them this is the work of god everybody okay if you notice they ask jesus christ how can you do the works plural can you check your bible i don't want you to say brother stephen saying how can we do the works plural did you see that but if you notice jesus is not answering what's plural anybody here we want to be able to do the miracle and everything we want to do the healing we want to see the demonstration jesus leave all of that and he goes to one thing every year so jesus is moving from work from works plural anybody care to work singular anybody care why why nicodemus came he said master we know everybody okay that nobody can do everything that you do healing the leper healing opening the blind doing all of this nobody can do this if he doesn't come from god amen jesus took him from here and pulled him back up he said dicodemus leave this thing alone anybody okay the main thing is except you be then you cannot see the water jesus never rejected the miracle he said you're going after the wrong thing first there is something that you must do first once you do that you won't worry about the remaining they automatically takes place anybody okay so when they come they say how can we do the works of god jesus said uh-uh i'm not gonna answer you the works of god because you'll be after works if they do a little miracle you leave the church you go over there if they pray for the sick and the sick is here you leave the work you go over there you will be changing churches all over that's not what is going on how can you do the work of god one work but this one work have everything and back here this is a hamburger he have tomatoes he has pickles he has mayonnaise everything is in it but you want to know how can i get the salad oh how can i get the pickles oh how can i get a ham jesus said no no no no one will go after the salad the next one will go after the pickle the other one will go after the bread this one will go after maya i don't want you to go like that how can you get a hamburger when you taste the hamburger you have a mixture of all of them i'm trying to help you catch it amen verse 29 jesus answered and said to them this is their work singular not the work of men this is their work of god what is the work of god jesus that you do water [Music] oh jesus we want to do the work you're telling me believe when you believe okay i believe jesus christ is god where is the work everybody okay anybody okay anybody okay i believe that jesus is god where is the work everybody jesus is telling them that the work of god is for you to believe everybody here believe what [Music] oh god help me anybody care is for you to believe believe what ever here the work of god that you believe on him who he has water so if god sent someone [Applause] brother kalima should be screaming at home amen amen if god sent someone amen and god vindicates that person to be his servant when you believe on that person you are already doing the work of god [Music] [Applause] everybody here so far so if you believe only why believe is always followed by works anybody care because what [Music] by first definition works is what faith what everybody here so works are we okay faith is invisible you have faith where is your faith can you see faith if you see you say faith is there faith is death is there where is faith here faith is invisible that's why brother branham said when abraham was justified by faith this is this was something that only god can see that anybody care but what is visible when james say justify by words brother branham said this is what man can see because it's visible anybody care so faith works once you see somebody doing something ever here they gotta be a faith somewhere anybody here so jesus is telling them don't go afterwards because you can have words without faith [Applause] are we catching it you can be in the message for a long time dressing like a message believer acting like a message believer doing things like a message believer but you never believe the message all it takes is after a while just a matter of time you see people falling off the message but they were doing the work of the message they were preaching the message they were dressing like a message believer where are they today they had works but they didn't have faith on the message that they were working anybody here that's why jesus said to do the work of god first you must believe on him that he sent if you believe don't worry about the words ever here the words are a result of your faith [Music] everybody okay so far let's pray now heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly tonight lord father thanking you once again for your grace for your love and your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us lord we are committing again this service unto the hand lord we have done what any man that you give ability to do can do but when it comes to interpret the scripture and to minister to the precious bread of jesus christ he only take a supernatural action of the holy spirit that's why i pray father that you move me completely out of the way may you come tonight lord and speak to your children bless them and move them to a higher level than they came in here lord if they came sick father may you heal them if they came struggling or having something a concern in their heart father may you do something or speak to them a specific lord for the instruction that will free them completely for the struggle that they're having we commit and ask everything lord and rebuke every demonic spirit away from this place in the name of jesus christ amen my subject tonight is roof let me read the scriptures so we can blend them together psalm 103 verse 2 says bless the lord oh my soul and forget not all his water what are those benefits david david is going to tell us the benefit which benefit there are many benefits david which are those benefits david said forget not all his benefit who forgive all that iniquities everybody clear who here or the water so the benefit david is speaking here is the forgiveness of sin of the body anybody care in isaiah 53 verse 5 the bible say but he jesus christ he was wounded for our transgression anybody okay transgression he was bruised for our water iniquities the whole package everybody care your sins your transgression your iniquities all of them are bundled up everybody the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his trap we are water so we see two things pointed by david and by isaiah the forgiveness of sin transgression and iniquities something that you knew better and you did it and then the healing of the body in other words the atonement the propitiation of your sin have two major benefit i'm going slowly lord help me your atonement is for forgiveness of sin speak of your salvation amen so when jesus christ died at the cross amen two pipes open up anybody one pipe is for your healing one pipe is for you that's why he is el shaddai do you know what he means he is the breasted one but here he has two breasts it depends on where you want a nurse here you can get nurse for your salvation or you can be nurse for your healing everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord my subject is the four faces of roof roof laboring hallelujah brother branham say what roof under justification do you see say amen my brother stay tight on the computer roof under sanctification doing water laboring as water brother branham is saying that roof under sanctification which is on the westlake you remember that amen means roof is laboring and this laboring is a legalistic work and the legalistic speaks of the law amen which law amen roof resting waiting for boaz to return from the finish work we're not there yet let's get to the laboring of roof tonight we talked about the tabernacle ever here and the three step of the tabernacle which is the other court the holy place and the holiest amen then we took the tabernacle and we blended with the story of roof amen because both the tabernacle and the story of hoof house the plan of redemption for human beings amen and those plan could never be unfolded except after the opening of the seals you heard me many times saying at the opening of the seals the bible became a new what does it really mean the opening of the seals everybody here everybody okay so far the whole bible that you see here was locked with the seals everybody here and this whole bible is crushed here every verse of the bible is jesus christ everybody cares so far but when you read the bible you will not see jesus christ in every verse if you read it intellectually you following me lord help me this is heavy amen when i opened the story of joseph where is jesus christ all i see is a child that is born and the child that has a gift and the child that dream and his dream come to pass and his brother hated him and they sent him to egypt and finally he became the right hand man of pharaoh where is jesus christ there did you see the name jesus written there everybody here everybody here so far so now when we always preach about joseph in this church in the denomination in the message churches do we project joseph to you who do we project but we cannot project jesus christ without mentioning joseph amen i hope you're getting what i'm saying amen amen so when we talk about abraham we are not projecting abraham to you we are projecting jesus christ in the life of abraham everybody here so far when we say daniel said isaiah said jeremiah say are we projecting jeremiah to you are we projecting daniel to you are we projecting isaiah to you we are not projecting prophet to you we are projecting the word of god that came through the prophet to you everybody okay so far so when we say brother branham say we are projecting brother branham we are projecting jesus christ through the ministry of brother branham everybody here when you read the bible do you have a problem reading joseph because he was a man [Music] when you read the bible do you have a problem with daniel because he was a man do you have a problem reading jeremiah because he was a man do you have a problem reading isaiah because he was a man do you ever open your bible and you begin to look which part was abraham a man and which part was abraham a prophet everybody here so why is it a problem for you with the message of brandon branham [Applause] here until preacher always struggled to move brother branham the man from the prophet brother branham how can you separate abraham from abraham [Applause] can i shake you a little bit even where abraham lied [Applause] [Music] everybody okay everybody okay i challenge anybody come and remove that scripture from the bible [Applause] ever here that scripture is the word of god but it doesn't tell you to lie it shows you amazing grace that abraham was like you [Music] everybody cares so far so when i read off the weakness of abraham i am not there saying because abraham lie i'm not going to take this bible scripture i'm going to take the bible scripture when abraham believed in god the lies of abraham the strength of abraham and the weakness of abraham all of them are the word of god [Applause] everybody okay because god didn't send your times and in diverse manner spoke to our father by their prophet everybody so just give me brother pranam the way it is [Applause] what you think is expired that's you [Applause] everybody so far i don't have time to defend to to sit down and try to split brother branham the man and brother brown of the prophet because abraham was a man isaac was a man jacob was a man isaiah was a man daniel was a man jesus was a man brother branham was a man remove this idea [Applause] [Music] everybody killed so far everybody far so let's stop playing around no this is the main part this is the we already know he's a man we already know abraham is a man we already know joseph was a man paul was a man arenas was a man what's the problem [Music] when we repeat here jeremiah jeremiah are we talking about the man jeremiah you need to understand christ everybody so far so this whole bible here was sealed by the seal and every scripture in the bible take a certain level of anointing to unlock it everybody okay so far you can take that scripture and you can read and you can read and you can read for two years you don't understand what it means all it takes is a brother to step here and take the same scripture and begin to read it then that scripture is different the bible says live by faith how many people read that everybody read that the people in the time of paul read that the people in the time of arenas read that but that scripture was never quitting unto them but when luther came a certain anointing was delivered ever here to unlock that scripture do you follow me when the scripture is unlocked that scripture becomes light [Applause] [Laughter] a virgin shall conceive how many people read that in the temple how many women read that for how many years in israel nothing if you ask them a virgin shall conceive a virgin circumcision but when mary came on the scene but here a certain anointing was delivered that only mary can receive it [Applause] everybody clear so abraham delivered god according to the level of his anointing isaac expressed god according to the lever of his anointing joseph expressed god according to the level of his anointing daniel expressed god according to the level of his understanding but when jesus christ came he took all that was in joseph oh that was in isaiah oh that was in jeremiah oh that was in daniel oh that was in all the prophets and he mixed it together and he put it on himself that's why he was the fullness of the godhead [Applause] [Music] cares so far nobody had the right to take this call to open it and say this day this scripture is fulfilled nobody could do that isaiah could not do it jeremiah could not do it zechariah could not do that s dress could not do it nobody can do it it takes the fullness of god [Music] ever here he takes the supreme anointing the top anointing to unlock that scripture everybody okay if that anointing have not come yet you can play all you want nobody will open that door everybody cares so far so when that anointing came on matthew 24 that anointing touched the seals and opened the seals and nobody sees it the people heard it they didn't see it because it was not time for the seals to be open to human being yet everybody cares so far paul came paul preached and passed up he said everything i preached is in part in other words there were certain things paul was not able to unlock it everybody here ever here when daniel heard the thunders then you said what does that mean god said is not your level you already got your portion go to sleep this anointing is for the end time but here i have an appointment in the end time that's when i can unlock this anointing everybody here so far so when it's time to open the seals because in revelation 5 the book was there i'm not even i have not even started my subject i don't know who's blocking that everybody here in revelation 5 ever here the book was there the call who is what bring your anointing [Applause] abraham come and try this one who is what to be worthy you must have a certain anointing and not and that anointing it's not only to take the book do you follow me just to touch that book you need an anointing and to break the seals you need an anointing and to look in the book [Applause] so it's an anointing it is an anointing that gives somebody the right [Applause] the right to touch the book or to take the book [Applause] everybody here and it gives you the right to break this hero and he gives you the right to look into that book and to read it ever here and he gives you the right to do whatever you want to do with that book [Applause] [Music] so they say who is worthy [Music] john search of heaven gabriel gabriel said one wood seraphim caribbean not that one that's too hot that's not emma level [Applause] everybody here they went from one engine to the other next can you do this can you do this can you do this john said no problem let's drop on the earth abraham can you do this who is on the earth job can you do this nobody on the earth let's go underneath the earth [Music] the entire underneath the earth they found the devil the devil said don't even tell me about this telephone because to begin with i'm a devil [Applause] so no one was worthy in heaven on the earth oh what and do you know what happened john begin to cry [Applause] [Music] john put his hand like this he said my god we are finished amen and the theophany of john move on and said john hatch weep not john i know somebody that is worthy to take the book to break the seal and to look around john turn around and look behold the lion of the tribe of judah he is ready to take the book and to break the seals [Music] [Applause] nobody can break the seal only jesus christ [Music] so far in other words the breaking of the seals require the supreme anointing [Applause] [Music] everybody here in other words you can never break the seal without the highest anointing of god [Applause] [Music] everybody here so far ever care so far so the seals pull jesus christ out [Applause] do you follow me [Music] brother branham said he is the one who opened those seals you okay and he is just here [Music] when you talk about the seal you are talking about himself [Applause] hallelujah for the whole word of god is who and christ is water that was what what is the opening of the seal then revealing water [Music] [Applause] so when we say the seals are open we are telling you that the supreme anointing the top level anointing have now come that's why your pastor can read the tabernacle like this it is not brother stephen it is jesus christ [Music] [Applause] everybody here because that anointing open up the whole bible you need a pastor that is connected with that anointing [Applause] that's why when you look you say no no no no no this is not a man there is no way this man can bring out stuff like this it is not me [Music] he is here he is the seal he is the one that does everything his name is jesus christ he is higher than the highest stronger than the madison he is powerful the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord everybody clear so far everybody cares so far everybody cares so far so when he came he touched the book nothing happened because it's the supreme anointing the book recognized that this is my honor the bar code open up click click he pulled the book he broke the seals everybody here so far everybody cares so far and he looked into the seals everybody okay so far and the only person on earth that is equal to him [Music] [Applause] [Music] because in the loud this church age in the last two churches he said to him the offer come i will do what i will make him sit with me on mine [Music] but here the only one equal to him is his bride [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everybody cares so far because when adam was created he was created doubled [Music] adam and eve have the same age in eternity [Applause] you cannot create adam without creating evil when god created man he created men male and female created he them ever here so far so instead of creating eve from another dirt they have to take the same dirt [Applause] [Music] that was the first adam but he is the second adam [Applause] over here and he also has his bride that's why on calvary they have to push him on the side to pull his bride out [Applause] [Music] everybody cares so far so he is not the only one worthy to touch the book [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah that's why in revelation 10 he took the book and he sent it down everybody cared so far everybody cared so far he took the book and he sent it down but him and the book are so when he sent the book down the book took him you cannot send the book without him coming that's why in revelation 10 he came down he put one foot on the land one foot on the right ever here he said john come now [Music] [Applause] john in heaven over there it was my time on the earth it is no more me you come take that book [Applause] the only person the only person that have the right to touch the book after jesus christ was john [Applause] everybody here jesus took the book he broke the seal but he didn't eat the book [Applause] but when it's john john said give me the book he said no no no no no no [Music] you are my wife [Applause] you have to do the same thing i did in heaven in heaven that was my show on the earth it belongs to you you come [Applause] can i continue in heaven the book was in the hand of somebody i did that part on the earth the book was also in the head of somebody you must do what i did over there [Music] another word john now is worthy [Music] everybody here so far he said go get the book and don't stop that tech deadpool can do whatever so where is the book now [Applause] [Music] over here [Applause] the book is in the pride that's why we have the devil answer [Applause] that's why we have the opening of the seal when we move god move when we move god moves when we move forward god moves when we speak god speak speak and move forward [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah that's why brother branham saying everything that was in god he poured that in who and everything that was in christ he poured that word [Applause] in the bride that's why when they touch the believer he says son so why do you did so persecute jesus christ [Music] so when we say the opening of the seals it's the very person of jesus christ [Applause] it is the supreme anointing when you read your bible you need that man when you listening to the tape you need the person he is the author of the message [Applause] he can unlock every scripture in the bible that's why we don't have limitation in the bible he keep unfolding unfolding unfolding unfolding unfolding unfolding until you reach a conclusion that i don't think we will finish this bible [Applause] look at how many sermons from roof because you touch the unlimited [Music] ever here ever here you touch the unlimited the opening of the seal release jesus christ he released the anointing of jesus christ that's what makes you completely different it is because of that anointing [Applause] [Music] everybody that's the anointing when you sit somebody come and say do you remember this do you remember this and then you leave everything and you put your hand up you say wow i never seen that before that's him [Applause] that's him amen he's not really a book he's a person everybody here have a back here i have only few minutes amen [Applause] so when we say the opening of the seal that's why when you look at the level you will see level when he comes he opened the level it's something different now when you say the level is crushed no problem take christ match him with christ he unlock it the president is crushed you take him when he touched the president he's going to tell you three means these five this look at the height look at this look at this because he's the one that wrote to that israel did not understand what it was because everything was here until the appointment at the end time so when he comes now he's unfolding every planet so his bride will never be ignorant anymore and you will recognize the devil in every trick because it's the supreme anointing it's the supreme power it's the supreme person it is the person himself [Music] it is the author himself that's why you heard brother brother say a man know my scripture but i know that also [Applause] everybody here and brother branham said the preacher challenged him do you know what brother branham did he took the bible and he put it on the pulpit and he stepped aside he said everybody that think they know more than me come and take the bible and disprove me do you know what happened nobody moved do you know why they didn't move not because of brother branham not because of the bible brother branham said he was standing right there and they knew he was ready and they knew which camp he identified with he identified with the message with the messenger that i am vindicated this man come and dare open that scripture [Applause] ever here so the one who opened this message is not brady branham it is jesus christ [Music] that's why brother branham keep telling you you don't understand me do you remember genesis 18 do you remember who was discerning abraham he said look look look look you you you you in other words i'm just a i'm an envelope it's already now on the compass hallelujah hallelujah so when we speak about the opening of the seals in this church this is what we meant this is what we mean we mean the very person of jesus christ the supreme anointing amen and when he start opening the bible you usually feel your heart like a little joy like wow why is him everybody here until you hold it you hold it you hold it and after a while you begin to smile and before you know you raise up and you begin to clap your hand and you begin to shout because it's him it is not brother stephen he is the one doing that [Applause] [Music] what should i enter this the opening of the seals [Applause] everybody here so far oh my god oh my god 908 amen so when they talk about abraham forget about brother branham forget about brother branham when we say brother branham say we know what it means when we say oh abraham say esther say esther was a woman we know that but when i'm reading yesterday i'm not leading a woman so don't come to me and say you see you're reading a woman you need to make sure you know when it's a woman and when it's not a woman when it's the bride of christ you're bringing confusion [Music] ever here why should i read the bible with confusion every time i read this is abraham this is not abraham this is a daniel oh right here it's not daniel no no this one is paul this one he was paul speaking as a man this one is paul speaking as uh the bible say every scripture is inspired [Music] [Applause] do you know that do you know that even when moses killed somebody he was inspired [Music] [Applause] can i help you again when david kill uriah it's the word of god [Applause] [Music] ever here he showed you that david was a human being he can make mistake and he knows how to correct [Music] [Applause] [Music] so that when jesus christ come he will be the only one with that mistake so god had to make sure all of them fell in some part [Applause] that's one angle if you change the angle but sheba is a top of the brother her first husband must die and david christ must kill your first husband so you can get married to him [Applause] [Music] you see now now it's no more the way you look at it it is now at a different level [Music] the wife of brother branham asked a question say when we go to heaven between me and hope who's going to be your wife brother adam luke he said no problem i understand what you're talking about but what i'm saying let me rephrase this way if you see a woman that is unclean come and hug me are you going to be happy she said good check no problem he said let me recalibrate again if that same woman hugged jesus [Applause] i thought jesus was 100 men the bible said demand jesus christ why you don't worry about jesus having feelings because it's a different it takes you to a different a different level when you go to that level the feeling is gone you are going to a different height [Applause] everybody cares so far so you're not going to sit here and try to see this is moses this is moses knew exactly what he was doing everything oh joseph was hated for his brother yes he has to be hated because they have to hate jesus christ here they have to reject joseph they have to take him and put him on a pit and take his court and put a g uh i mean a blood and send it back to his father when jesus went to hell into the pit see spirit have to go back to the father father i return my spirit unto you have you thought about that [Applause] have you thought about that you see what i'm saying so when you read the bible about joseph it's now more joseph you are looking at jesus christ in every scripture when you listen to the message brother branham said no i was going and then i saw hope and hope did this and then my two kids and one jump on me and one did you think brother branham is talking about his family everybody okay the ministry of the son of man is a ministry that is combined with parable [Applause] everybody here jesus always spoke in riddles in parable but those parables has mysteries [Applause] [Music] everybody cares so far everybody cares so far so one brother brought up even the family of bradley branham even the name of his children amen why his first child has to be the poor why paul [Applause] why why have to start with paul ever hear why one of his child is sharon and sharon have to die because the church throughout when he starts with paul in the middle of the ages death struck because the pair because the the white horse already changed to a red horse he's killing the bride so sharon must die but she's resurrected under the sixth dimension and then rebecca pick up ending up with joseph perfection i'm not talking about joseph in jeffersonville i'm talking about joseph in the parable you see now so his move is not really a move just like david was saying my father my father why has that forsaken me who forsook david [Music] somebody came he said king king what is going on who forsaken you and they look at david raising him you have forsaken me they look nobody there so when you're reading you say no this is david getting excited in his house but down the road we found somebody at the cross saying my father my father why are you what who was speaking in david now god separate david and his prophecy you must say david saying but here that's why the bible says as he was written by jeremiah they have to use the reference vessel plus what god did through that vessel that's why we say brother branham saying it is saying as a reference hey but here because knowing your vessel is very important for your redemption you must know who your husband is you don't want to be like jacob you're sleeping with a woman you woke up in the morning he was not your brother he thought he was richer but he was clear everybody cares of all but all of that he looks bad but guess what the churches were locked right there but here you cannot have rachel before leah leah is the law because as a custom you must give as a caster as a law you must get the first one the first one will produce the patriarch and then rachel have to come later to produce only two children joseph perfection and then benjamin the hundred and forty four thousand only two they are kept toward the end why did god lock those womb so now go ahead and separate rachel and separately again and show me that they were just women do you see the scripture now do you see the scripture now so when we say the opening of the seals we're talking about the very person of jesus christ those people were not living their own life why do we use your testimony in church why you went through something and then you suffer and you give your testimony here and your suffering becomes a scripture to brought to somebody and that person will pick up and say the god that work for sister jerusha is gonna do the same for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] are we projecting sister jerusalem we are projecting the goodness of god in the life of sister jerusalem now he became a scripture to help somebody i am sorry i can't preach roof lawboring i have to stop here we need to pick up on sunday let's stand [Applause] bear with me i need to find a different title for this and then roof laboring will be on sunday this is beyond me i prepare everything i have the court is loaded but somebody needed this [Music] everybody here to understand the ministry of the son of man so now when you read brother branham you don't skip anything even the story he's telling you you don't skip anything but here there is always something locked up in the story i showed you the law and then the law under the under levitical priesthood and i showed you the law on the melchizedek priesthood and if you read brother branham you will see brother branham say if i go overseas and i tell me that i say if you stay here you spoke to another woman do you think brother branham is just telling you a story brother brother she was showing you armenianism and calvinism in the light in the parable he was saying have you caught that some people say yes some people say no brother branham says that if i'm going overseas and i call my wife and i say i am traveling and because i'm traveling if i hear you with another man that's it i divorce you and by the bottom say if his wife also say if you go over there and i hear you overseas that you hug another woman there when you come here you're a divorce man brother branham say that's a armenianism because now brother branham is going he's reframing to do something bad in fear of divorce so if you take divorce off guess what he will do it armenianism wrong legalistic way in other words you're going to create an adulterer man in the heart because jesus came he said who looked at a woman and lasted after her that was already adultery before you consume it so you have a doctor in the in the mind but they have not manifested in the flesh yet because they are scared they're going to be brought to the church and repent in front of everybody armenianism everybody here but brother brandon say what is the balance but what i'm saying but if i go and my wife said don't worry if he hug another woman that's no problem brother branham said that's wrong that's calvinist my wife doesn't care he says something is wrong your wife must care hey but here by the brand i'm saying but the true balance is right in the middle not liberal not tight in the middle what is the middle brother branham say it is because of love i love my wife i know if i fall she will forgive me but i know the pain it's gonna do to her even if she's gonna forgive me i don't wanna do something that will hurt her a woman that loves me so much in appreciation to the love i cannot do something like this now it's love balancing you you don't go one extreme you don't go the other extreme you step in the middle you know more on the calvinism you know more and armenianism in your marriage now your marriage is barely stopped now you don't worry about your husband even if it's past time if somebody say are you sure your husband is coming up you say don't worry look at the clock when it's two o'clock you're gonna see him right here how do you know it's two o'clock he's right there why because of love he can't wait to go back home that is the true love but brother branham was telling those two doctrine under a story because it's the ministry of the son of man it's a ministry that uses parable and riddles and things like that and all those parables and readers are things that the lord is telling you something here something here something here something here something here if you miss it you're going to miss the very purpose that brother branham is telling you everything was correct brother branham wanted to go to the west but if you look brother branham stay on the uh on the east he stay in jeffersonville and brad brown made even a promise that i cannot preach a new message until i start that message in jeffersonville if not brother branham would have preached the seals on the west but why did brother brother make that statement why they still have to be preached only on the east side and not on the west side take the dollar bill flip it and see where is the ego with the scroll in the mouth it's on the east side check your one dollar view and if you look the pyramid and the constellation coming down it's on the west coast in other words brother brother must go to the west to meet the angel but the preaching the ego with a scroll in his mouth must be on the east side the dollar sign put that on the east side and brother branham never talk about that ego with something over there so the seal must be preached only on the east brother madame thought he made it was him that did that it was not him it's the ministry of the son of man that's why we need that person that's why you heard when we say the message is crushed we're not talking about the paper we're talking about the very person of the message when you meet him he will explain you what brother branham is saying even if brother branham says something you don't understand he have two ways sometimes he look he tells you what it is sometimes he wait he touched brother stephen he said cause preacher so-and-so because i delivered something to him and brother stephen called that preacher and that preacher come here on wednesday and when that preacher begin to preach and all your answers are coming up it is him that is orchestrating all these things [Applause] and to show you that it's him most of the time or all the time a preacher comes here why do we dovetail why do they have to say something we already preach here and all of you are like to show you that it's the same being that is moving up and orchestrating everything that's the person you need for your life amen let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy

service it will be testimonies after testimony after testimony of the miracle and the goodness of god father we commit them unto the hand may you protect them and give them travel mercy as we humbly ask it father in jesus precious name amen god bless you church we love you [Applause] [Music] thou art worthy [Music] loud worthy thou art worthy oh lord to receive glory glory [Music] for thou hast
