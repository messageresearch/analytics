would like to bring to the attention yes I do have one I have a major one as a matter of fact I need everybody to pray hard on this one as mentioned in the past sister Carol Masaccio from Living Word has has cancer and I believe it is it's : cancer is that right well they they she's at stage three I looked up the different stages and if I'm correct there's only is there only four I think there's only four Wow well good chemo Wow so they put out emergency prayer about of a week ago and I meant to text somebody to you know for brother April to announce a 20 but um apparently according to brother Christmas not as bad as some initially thought so that's really good the Lord has asked for prayer already amen [Applause] she's very nervous about it and that's understandable so let's continue not just to keep her in prayer keep the family in prayer because you got a support system behind you know everything there my young daughter still visits them and and with Sam and all and and she kind of keeps us updated but she helps she goes over and helps does anybody else have a prayer request that no okay come on up here and pray brother brother deny come pray over the service the remainder of it I want to encourage as he's coming I've never considered myself a very very good song leader okay and with the congregation you know I want everyone to have an opportunity to sing I

song on your heart we want the joy the joy rejoice is beginning to return to this congregation two services ago and I wanted to increase and just magnify and just exceed anything that we've ever known

all this morning good to have everybody in the house of the Lord and we appreciate and greet our visitor this morning God who each Li bless you and we trust this service will be a blessing for you and God bless everybody that is on a virtual platform Sharon if you would you need to say my mom my link forgot to do that let's go to the Bible first Kings chapter 17 but David could you please help him move this or everybody to be able to see the board up there if we can go that way appreciate it thank you very much brother David has been a tremendous help to us amen [Applause] first Kings chapter 17 verse 8 we are still on our subject dealing with Malachi 4 we are taking our time because we want to lay a strong solid foundation one time for all and we don't have to come back if you have any question like brother branham usually refer go back and listen to the tape because we lay out material there to remove all doubt all questions or problem why we are believing the message we are believing today first Kings chapter 17 verse 8 the Bible says that and the word of the Lord came to him speaking about Elijah saying you might be seated arise get you to Zarafa which belongeth to Sodom and do out there we know those cities cities array is not a Jewish City it's a Gentile City Elijah was sent to a gentle woman behold I have commanded this woman was already ordained she was under the anointing of the Holy Spirit without even knowing that she has been under that anointing so God was already moving on this woman before she was even aware of it she was not aware that God has a hold in her life but God express it to his prophet Elijah that I have an ordained woman somewhere and I'm going to send you to that woman because according to Malachi 4 I will send you Elijah the prophet a widow woman and the point that the Holy Spirit wanted me to deal with it today is that when that woman was a widow you see we went through many description but we forgot that she was a widow why was this woman a widow why did God have to send Elijah not to a married woman but to a woman who is a widow and we don't speak about the death of the husband hallelujah praise God the anointing is so strong the Lord spoke to me early this morning and I know what he told me praise the Lord so he arose and went to zurafa and when he came to the gate of the city if you notice the woman was not inside the city but the woman was at the gate of the city and the gate of the city is usually a part of the city that is connected to demson because in the Book of Ruth when he was time to redeem Ruth they have to take her case to the gate of the city and it appeared that this woman was at the gate of the city in other words she was ready for redemption everybody there behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks we know it's two sticks if you read down and he called to her and say bring me a prayer a little water in a vessel that I may drink we saw that with Eliezer and Rebecca asking for water we saw that also in John chapter 4 when Jesus was asking to the when he was approaching the woman ed well he also asked for water and here also Elijah approaching the woman spoke and asked about water now let's jot down on verse 17 and he came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so small that there was no breath left in him and she said to Elijah what have I to do with you all you men of God are you come to me to call my sin to remembrance in other words the scene of this widow woman was already forgotten everybody clear she had seen in the past but her sin was already forgotten he was already forgiven he was already in a sea of God forgetfulness also the woman said wait a minute I'm not supposed to be going through what I'm going now because my sins are already forgotten are you trying to fish them again are you trying to bring them back again to remembrance while you saw me carrying the two sticks you saw me carrying the cross machine were already forgiven praise God my sins are forgiven so there is no way you can bring my sins again to remembrance and Elijah turn around and he went to God and pleaded and God restored back the child to life everybody clear so far let's go back let's go to Luke chapter 4 praise God Alleluia remember those two things it's a widowed woman and her sin were already forgotten so there is no judgment that can stand against this woman in the eyes of God she was clear but because the Ministry of Elijah I have a resurrection power something must have happened to show that Elijah when he goes to the Gentile there will be a resurrection everybody clear we lay a foundation on Wednesday and I will strongly encourage you if you miss a sermon because your cow fell into the ditch in other word because you have work because you have to be there a word make sure before Sunday go on YouTube those links are there refresh yourself update yourself be on the same page so nobody is left behind so we don't want to be saying something and then we have people here that have not listened to 5 6 7 sermon down the road and you are completely lost when we are continuing to progress in other words we are building top after the other so make sure you stay connected if you at work we understand but on your own leisure on Thursday or Friday sit down refresh yourself put yourself on the same page that we move together as a family everybody clear Luke chapter 4 verse 25 but I tell you a truth many widows were in Israel so Israel had many widows in the days of Elijah when the heaven will shut up three years and six month we spoke about this on Wednesday when great fun we spoke about the famine on Wednesday was throughout all the land in other word famine affected every other country but - none of them opposed Elijah sent Elijah sent Elijah was sent I will send you Elijah the Prophet the Elijah was not sent to the widow's at the Jewish nation in Israel but Elijah was sent to a widow into the Gentile nation everybody there and saved - Sarepta a city of Zion - a woman there was a widow in other word there were several widows but this woman was chosen one out of all those Widow to be the one to entertain or to receive the ministry of Elijah and she was a widow woman and he happened that Elijah went to that woman where make sure your Bible thoroughly at home brother Branham say a Christian should read one chapter II morning one chapter at night if you need that coat you see me so we do Bubba whether you understand that or not read your Bible listen to the message so when we are soaring it's going to be easy for you to pick it up because you already know the concept of Bobby - chapter 7 verse 2 if you do can see man for the woman which has a husband he is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives so as long as husband is alive there is no way for that woman to be remarried the Bible says that but if their husband be dead so it is important for the husband to be dead not your husband sister you need to keep your husband but we're going to talk about a different husband here important for the husband to die death also mean a separation everybody there praise the Lord it is important for the husband to die the Bible says that but is the husband bid husband so then if while her husband leaves she be married to another man she shall be called an adulterous but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren you also are becoming dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him so the marriage now is going to be a married unto Jesus Christ you're going to be married to Christ but your first husband must be dead for you to be married even when Eleazar was sent to Rebekah Eleazar was not the one to marry a Rebekah Eleazar was a message that was sent to Rebekah but we better have to be married to Isaac everybody clear even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit to God praise the Lord now we can pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy for giving us an opportunity to be gathered together around the reveal world of the our Lord father your word stated that word carcasses Lord there they're eager opening but the carcass of the unfurling body word of the son of men father if there is anything that we did that the Holy Spirit in our behavior in Our Lives Lord father you know the depth of our heart that we love you Lord we don't want to do anything that is contrary to your spirit Lord but Lord father we are caught up in this flesh that is waiting for redemption Lord and if we did something that Lord father did not please you may you forgive us Lord may you cleanse us under the blood of the Lamb Lord father may you take completely this service unto the hand may you be the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end Lord made the Holy Spirit to drop down this morning Lord may it teaches your word is strengthened Lord father those that are feeble Allah will heal those that have sickness Lord and maybe blessing Lord father to your children as we commit all unto the hand and claim the blood of beauty King every work of the devil Lord away from this place father in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you we are continuing on our subject the unchanging pattern of God our theme is Malachi 4 we are on part 12 part 12 means we start from 1 all the way to 12 so we're going to do a short summary to combine everything together before we built into what we are trying to build this morning when we started this series we went with the three bubbles that God we took this Ministry of Malachi 4 and we took that ministry all the way to the zodiac bubble when we finished at zodiac Bravo we drop down into the pyramid when we finish the pyramid now we are dealing with the written word and when we enter into the written word we are dealing specifically with the spirit of Elijah so we draw a character in the Bible by the name of Elijah and throughout this series we took time to give you description of the Ministry of Elijah Elijah this allegedly did that Elijah went to more Orab he had an experience and there was a whirlwind that came down struck the mountain and the rock split over and you all know about it now we spoke about Elijah restoring the heart of the children back into God so we expressed that ministry in detail to help you identify what God has been doing in this age because God is identified by his characteristic so when we dealt with this with Pan Am expansion that Elijah is a prophet not only confined to the Jewish nation but Elijah is a prophet that deals both with the Jews and also with the Gentile in other where the spirit of Elijah will have Tom that is going to be dealing with the Jewish nation but that spirit also will have a time when it's going to be dealing with the Gentile nation and we find out that that spirit appear five times in the Bible the first time the spirit appear was in the man Elijah and the second time we found our spirit coming down in the man by the name of Russia and the third time we found that same spirit coming down in John the Baptist and in the fifth time we found Elijah according to revelation 11 going back to the Jewish with Moses and Elijah himself so we found out that all the four appearing of Elijah that I have just described all of them were connected to the Jewish nation Elijah himself was a Jew Elijah was a Jew John the Baptist was a Jew and then when you go to the book of Revelation Elijah and Moses both of them will be again Jewish nation Jewish people but we found out that at the forthcoming of Elijah that coming of Elijah was connected not with the Jews but Elijah was connected to the Gentile but before we just speak about it like that there must be a connection somewhere in the scripture because when God started a ministry somewhere God will always have a reference in the Bible to support them ministry that's the reason why when the people went to John the Baptist they asked John the Baptist they say who are you John the Baptist gave them the scripture he said I am the voice of the one crying into the wilderness in other word there was a foundation there was a based there was some scripture in the Bible to always support a ministry even when Jesus Christ if you look at the life of Jesus Christ you will find out that when Christ was going from place to place the Bible always refer that he was sweet'n he was spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah he was spoken by the prophet Isaiah he was spoken by the prophet Daniel so somewhere somehow in the Bible there must be a connection there must be a reference and when brother Branham came here in this end time with his ministry brother Branham began to refer to Malachi for brother Branham begins to refer to Genesis 18 brother Branham begins to refer to revelation 8:10 all those scripture are bases that have been laid in Scripture as a reference to make sure the children of God understand that thou which was professor here in the Bible this is the fulfillment of it so to get the basis of Elijah the spirit of Elijah dealing with the Gentile we found out that Elijah was given experience with the crow and we found out that the Jewish people were people that were very strict about the religion it didn't have any dealing with the people from Assad and we took also Peter in the book of art and we found out that God have to give Peter and experience before sending him to the house of Cornelius because Peter spoke to the people of the house of Cornelius he says that the you know for sure that there is no dealing between the Jewish and the Gentile so in order for God to prepare his messenger in order for God to prepare his man God have to use an experienced God have to give them an experience with something low looks unclean but God was just telling them not I'm going to go to that nation that looks like it's an unclean nation so after dealing with the crew or the Riven we found out that Elijah now moving to a different stop of his ministry where the widow woman came into view but we know this widow woman was a gentle woman and according to the teaching of the message a woman in the Bible speak of a church and we know according to the book of fact that when the Jewish people reject that Jesus Christ God move into the Gentile because we have to take magenta for his namesake and that people from the jente was called the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ but the problem is when you look at the dispensation of the jente you will find out that the Gentile dispensation was divided into seven churches and those seven churches have seven messenger and those messenger of the seven churches are the pastor of the churches in other words we have seven man's in the churches we have seven pastors in the churches but the spirit of Elijah is going to move to the Gentile now which pastor is going to be the one to be anointed with the spirit of Elijah is that going to be Paul is that going to be Iranians is that gonna be Columba is that going to be Martin he's not going to be looter is that going to be wesley or is that going to be brother branham so we need to find out who is this man because every church always or must have a pastor and as it changes the messenger to the church ages were also pastor to those Church ages brother Branham said this in the revelation of Jesus Christ he said the letter to the seven churches were written prophetically to the future age Paul both of the life and glory of the self ages present in his day John wrote of the life and glory of the seven churches in the future that John was addressing the seven pastors so the messenger is a pastor to the age everybody there pastors or messenger as directly or questioned under these seven different angels and brother Branham in the revelation book of symbols he says that your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the Word of God he is God's angel to the church so the messenger when they were giving their message to the church ages the messenger were God's angel the specific churches but there is a messenger to the church therefore a pastor should never leave the world but stay straight with the because he's feeding the Shepherd places that's why I always refer you those who say brother Stephen say always say the Bible say and brother Branham say because I must say strict to the Word of God because the word is what's gonna prepare you to meet your husband because the word pastor means a shepherd lucida and on a pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost hath made him overseer over a certain flock to feed them we art with the Word of God a manner so the passenger here were pastor to every single church age and we must say under our pastor if we are living in the Ephesian Church you must make sure your message or your preaching stays under power that's why Paul say if someone come down if another angel come down if another messenger come down if another pastor comes down if we preach a message different and what we preach to you that man is the cursed and under the seventh messenger we need to make sure all the minister here stay with the Word of God we must stay under the pastor of the LG because he's the one that receives the revelation from God everybody clear so now we have seven churches we have seven pastor but which pastor is going to be the one to receive that anointing of Elijah so when we went back to our scripture in the book of 1st Kings chapter 17 we found out that they were characteristic about this woman that also helped us to identify who that specific messenger who does specific pastor is going to be so we found out that thank God to the opening of the seventh year because it took the seal to direct to us where or which age the specific anointing of Elijah will be coming down and we know that even though there is seven church ages the dispensation of the jente have been divided into four seals we know the first seal the second seal the third seal and the folks here if you were under my teaching a long time you should be familiar we the seals we know that at the first seal when he happened the spirit of the Antichrist enter into the churches and begin to destroy the work of God or destroy the churches of God then had brought the horse rider that was their switch holes from a white horse into a red horse and in the hurdles we found out that dowel rod was given a sword and he begin to kill people and he kills 68 million people throughout the ages then the riders changed and went to the black horse rider and over there he was having some element which we dealt with on Wednesday and then on the last arriving of this horse rider we found out that his name was revealed because that anointing I have to fight him was the ego anointing and the ego was able to look at a horse rider and decode his name and told us that his name was death so when we look in the life of this widow woman we found out that Elijah described truth to things Elijah says that Israel number one have forsaken your commandment if you recall on wisdom number two Elijah said they have forsaken your commandment and they have destroy your altars and then Elijah continued to explain his complaint to God he said number two Israel killed your prophet with the soul so there was a killing by the sword and we found later on that God put a curse upon the rain and when God put a curse upon the rain as we described that on Wednesday will find that the rain in the scripture effect usually 3-phase is going to affect the call when it affects the corn it affect the wheat corn and he also affect the barley corn and the rain also not only it's affected the corner the rain affected the liner and the rain also affected the oiler if you miss one there you need to review that because it's very important for you to catch what I'm saying and we found out that when the seal broke on the first church ages when the world when the white horse rod was riding in well when the message to the first church age is coming god had a complain to the edge of Ephesus not say that there is something in Ephesus that I don't like and what happened was that big church have left their first love the church had forsaken their first love and the Antichrist spirit was getting in destroying the altars because we found out that the altar in the sculpture means the place of worship or a church so we found out that when Elijah was telling God that Israel forsaken your covenant Elijah was already giving us a clue that the first seal was already running into the land and then we found out that when the second seal open up the Antichrist begin to kill the children of God and Elijah spoke to God he says that the children or the prophets of God were killed by the soul in other word second seal also was running its course and then the third time we found out that when the rain was affected those three element were affected the valley was affected the village was affected the one who's affected and the oil also was affected so when he was affected that spoke of the third seal because the third seal when he was open up we found out that the O's Iran the host man that came out one penny and a measure of Valor for one penny but a voice spoke to him and said do not touch the wine and the oil if that voice didn't come up there the Antichrist will have messed up everything else so in other world when the rain was stricken he was the time that the third seal was already running into the land but when Elijah went to the woman and Elijah asked that woman and say I need for you to give me water and also to give me bread the woman told Elijah that I only have a handful of mill and a handful of oil and I'm trying to ma'am Allah here and as soon as I finish cooking my meal me and my son will do water will die so we can see that death was speaking of the phosphorus harder right there in other word the time that Elijah went and meet that woman was the time that the parish rather will be riding into the land everybody clear so far or did I lose someone let's read a little bit brother Branham brother Branham said this in be certain of God he says she was with a woman and we don't know what she what she with a woman would have went through with her husband dead and a young boy to race and in the Lance there they depended on their crops they didn't have project as we have today the on defense plant they depended on their crops and because the iniquity of the people and the moral decaying had brought a draught on the land here they was all starving and dying in other world the third seal was already hitting because the third seal alls famine and then we found that no doubt she had pray night after night all night as she begin to see the mihrab arrow going down down down and he must get to a place till there was not even another cup full of meal in the barrel our she had was just a little and full death the parallels rather death was coming right into the gate at her door so we understand here that when Elijah reached the want to meet that woman that gentle woman was at the time when death was already into the land so Elijah going to the Gentile Elijah will not come under the vessel Elijah would not come under the first seal is telling you that Paul does not qualify to have the spirit of Elijah erroneous does not qualify to have the spirit of Elijah Columba Mazda Martin does not qualify to have the spirit of Elijah because of those three are already eliminated and we found that when Elijah spoke about Jezebel killing nature deputy servant of God by the soul if you study your title in church age you found out that God mentioned the woman Jezebel in the Tartarian church ages but we found out that those time Elijah went to the gentlewoman in other word Martin or Coloma you've claimed the third seal also hits the land Elijah did not go in Batam in other world looter and Wesley are completely disqualified to receive the spirit of Elijah and we found out that the edge that received the per horse rider is the Lao decent Church age in other word the only messenger that's going to be qualified to receive the spirit of Elijah he is going to be the messenger to the seventh church age which is called the age of loud isha and we found out on Wednesday according to Emma's the Bible said that there will be famine in the land and brother Branham said that scripture when Emma was speaking about the scripture he is so America he's so spirit of Elijah the anointing of Elijah will be coming in the last church age when the pair horse is running and it's going to be in the land of America which automatically brother brother to be the one to receive the spirit of a larger everybody clear so far praise the Lord and we found out that when Elijah went to this widow woman this Widow men have food the a food that have been provided by the divine blessings of God because the food that she had she had food of she had mill in her house and she also have all in a house and we found out on Wednesday that the Land of Israel was a land that was blessed by God through the rain and the rain in the Land of Israel was the one that was responsible for bringing the meal and also bringing also the old she had food that she was eating but that food was not enough to keep her from death because she told Elijah that I'm going to mix this food and as soon as I've finished eating this food the food I'm gonna die so she had the Bible with her already she had the Word of God already but for told us that the letter killeth in other words the Bible we got the revelation killers that's why Elijah have to come down and Imagi gave her a second food and the second food of Elijah was not different to the first food he was not contradictory to the first food but he was a spoken word food and with the spoken word food when the woman begin to eat the food because before the logic aims that woman lost weight the woman had cheek bones sticking out that woman did not even have strength but the food that came from the spoken word of Elijah begin to bring the vitamin into the body and to bring a body change to that woman are you there so you don't need to have only natural food you need the Bible with the spoken word and the spoken word will never contradict the scripture because it's the same food but just one is love and one was just the originator everybody so far good and if you notice when Elijah spoke the food he was a creative anointing that happened only to the gentle woman and we know the creating anointing is the turn to anointing and if you notice Elijah created the food before he went to already that's the reason why the creation of squirrel happened in 1959 before the opening of the seals everybody clear so everything is line up by the scripture are we clear so we need Elijah's food but the problem we're going to be dealing with today is this woman is a widow so why is this woman a widow we understand that when we spoke about we don't we don't automatically speak about a death of a face husband in other word this woman was married this woman had a husband and something happened to the husband and this woman ending up losing her husband so before Elijah meets the woman that woman have to lose her first husband because the Ministry of Elijah is a ministry that takes a nation that takes Israel and unite Israel back again to God in other world when Elijah pop up onto the scene there are women or Israel was already under spirit of Jezebel but Elijah have to come down and make sure the spirit is completely destroyed and that the woman and unite that woman but again together because as long as the woman is still connected with the system of Jezebel there is no way that you can be married to another husband if you do that it's going to be against the law that's the reason why if you notice in the scripture there was a woman by the name of Abigail Abigail was married by the name by a man by the name of neighbor and brother Brian and the barber also explained to us that neighbor means Foley the Bible say that he was a rude man he was a bad man but before David get married to this woman this woman husband must die God killed Abel God killed the first husband then a bigger death was given a right to marry David but when David went and tried to take you riders wiser God struck that completely because Uriah was still alive their husband must be dead before the woman be united to another one everybody clear so far now let's dig into this a little more and before I go there I'm going to remind you this that brother Branham say that this little woman must have been of the caliber of Elisha and insisting there in other words Elisha and this woman have the same nature because usually action shows what you are and again she had been chosen it's grace to entertain God's prophet remember she was a gentle nor a Jew and the land was burning up the third seal was hearing and no doubt that this little woman being of that caliber being of the believer how can brother Branham call this woman a believer where is he written in the Bible that this woman was a believer but we found this woman claiming that her in was already did brother branham ever give you the scripture no they denied know everybody there for we see that God would not have caught her if she had not been worthy want to entertain God's prophet when God sends you Elijah the prophet automatically know that you are worthy in the eyes of God in the book of Revelation chapter father there was a book in the hand of God and the king and the angel asked he said who is worthy to take the book to break the seal and to lose it no one the Bible said no one in heaven no one on the earth and no one even in Hell under the heaven and then the king's men we dealer came and he took the book and he brought the seals but if you go in the book of Revelation chapter 10 when the mighty angel came down a voice to John and say John go to the angel and take Bobby are you there and John knew that no one was worthy to take the book so when John approached the angel John was a little bit scared John had a little complex I am not worthy I am not worthy I am not worthy and John went to the elder and he said angel can you please give me the book do you know what the angel say the angel said you take it in other words you are worthy to touch the book just like the man touch the book you also are worthy to touch them in other words lose your complex use your trouble remove all your conflicts you have the right to touch the book observe Jesus Christ you are not anybody you are an electrician you have been found worthy to go to the hand of the angel first touching that book was death but after the king said Lila the angel could have taken the book and say taken the angel said if I give it to him he's not going to learn I want him to exercise his right you come yourself put your hand in my hand and take the book from my hand are you clear when a large I sent to you God have declared you worry everybody clear everybody clear so far now when we are dealing with this let's dig down in the book of action as we're looking at this widow woman praise the name of the Lord if you dare you can say a manner up to chapter 7 we can't rush you with this stuff if we get this done then on Wednesday Lord willing we're gonna take that safe first and the second poll because we already touched the third cool we need to see that in the scripture in the Ministry of Elijah everybody there add to chapter 7 verse 6 the Bible says that and God spoke on this why's that his seed should surgeon in a strange land and that there should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil 400 years talking about the children of Israel and the nation to him - our beam bonded wooja will our judge say God and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place Israel went into Egypt and when they went into Egypt there was a that was there in Egypt and Pharaoh was dealing with a man called Joseph are you there and under the ministry of Joseph Joseph was able to take the entire nation of Egypt and hook them under fill in sold their land look at your scriptures they even sold themselves and to Pharaoh so not only was Egypt put under the bondage or the connection or the relationship with Pharaoh but the nation of Israel also moving to Egypt and they landed in the land of Goshen and go Joseph took the Jewish people and put them in marriage will Pharaoh everybody there and when we put them in marriage with Pharaoh everything was good are you following me no problem praise God now let's drop down to verse 17 but when the time of the promised journey everybody clear this fellow was good all this time there was a good pastor augustana until the time that the promise of exodus comes then something happened to Philip Alleluia let's go to verse 17 but when the time of the promised journey which God has shown to Abraham the people grew and multiplied in Egypt a big church are you there until another king arose which knew not Joseph now the tarot Pharaoh is not a men fellow is like a president fellow is like Caesar we are President Obama President Trump but president is not their name it is a tarot reader fellow is like a pastor either but Joseph had a great ministry in Egypt and the Ministry of Joseph was known all around the world it is and every fellow that came always acknowledged the ministry of Joseph and traded is their food because of Joseph everybody there but something happened when the time of deliverance joke near another Pharaoh rose another spirit enter into the pastorship and the spirit begin to reject the message of Joseph the first Pharaoh must die hallelujah they all the fellow who raised up who did not know chosen how can a fellow be in Egypt not knowing Joseph in other word that Pharaoh willing fully rejected the message of Joseph the fellow that was guru the fellow that was a good manner suddenly something happen in the life of the Pharaoh where a new fellow writer and to destroy the message of Joseph the message that they claim the message that they uphold the message that they cherish but something happened and suddenly a pharaoh begin to attack the very thing that they were honoring why the time of deliverance is near everybody clear there was the beginning of the beginning that was the beginning of Exodus and when that thing begin to form under political power beginning begin to form God begin to get so this church you must be ready because God also is ready the iniquity of the Amorite was fulfilled the time that he promised Abraham was fulfilled and the time of deliverance was at hand so when you see a good pharaoh a good pastor suddenly changing and began to reject the message it is the signal that's that of going in handle God permitted a fellow to raise up who do not Joseph and Remus's was born and right after City come Remus's so in other word the one anointing now is la Sadie Sadie recognized the message Sadie honored the message Sadie loved the message man now you are dealing with Francis everybody and ramasees was the one who knew not the blessings of Joseph he didn't know what the spiritual side walls that's why you look at somebody you say I'm not dealing with the same man this man used this man used to be fun but he looks like when I'm talking to him he's not the first man that I knew it is a different unknown think I have moving and that nothing reject the message of the land he was only a political genius that he could take it Gopa he is worrying about a worldwide ministry and all the rest of the country and military might now it's the power of men remember Moses did that and he was killing people okay everybody and that's all he knew was the military might and Moses in this message he was born this prophet but he was raised in an intellectual school and Pharaoh's Palace they fell setting the good one died he was raised under was a man that still had honor and believed Joseph being the prophet of them so your first Pharaoh believed the message your first Pharaoh loved the message your first Pharaoh are not the message but now rhombuses moving but there are compromises after city and Rama says did not care about Joseph and therefore there is one day trouble started when they raised up a pharaoh who did not know Joseph but why is he that we had said II save you all the good men say the owner Joseph study believed message Sarah treated as good because of Joseph why did God permits Eddie to die why did God permit the first husband to die why did God permit this first husband to be separated from the message why what is the purpose brother branham men are not infallible but God is man you get your mind on a man he shall make a mistake maybe not willfully but he is a dude God permits him to do it so that he can shake yourself away from men I mean Israel got comfortable with city it Israel got caught up ready and God permit a pharaoh to Rosa in order to break Israel completely from Pharaoh because Moses is coming God permit him to do it so that he can shake your faith away from men our faith is not in the wisdom of men but in the power of the resurrection of Jesus trust that is where the true seed of Abraham helps their promise because they can only be the seed of Abram and they receive the Holy Spirit without the Holy Spirit they are not the seed of Abram the same faith that was in Abraham comes into the believer no matter what takes place and how can we delete the believer marches right on so the first Pharaoh the first husband must die are you there Israel must be a widow before Moses comes in in Israel must be separated from the fleshly laws of the first husband until the second husband comes in are we clear let's go to the book of Exodus chapter 19 why a widow why a widow everybody there Exodus chapter 19 verse 3 if you dare you can end alone at the mountain saying to the Egyptian I'm sorry and how I bore you on eagle's wings who saw Eagle in Egypt carrying Israel blood what I'm saying the Bible speaks of her prophet in the world as sexual prophet Moses and the Ministry of Moses were carrying Israel everybody and brought you to myself so the purpose of sending Moses ministry was to pull Israel from Egypt and bring Israel unto God in other words said it must die Israel must be a widow to Pharaoh in order for me to come and to join Israel to go Oh if you and it mark above all people for all the on the world in the world I'm sorry us Israel there were many widows in Israel but God only chose the one that was in service with a city must die everybody clear six and you shall be to me a kingdom of what so the purpose of bringing Israel of Israel to be not only the pictures but the entire nation please that's why the well ship when he comes out it is a son that the entire field the same level a weekly he say a kingdom of priests a holy nation these are the world which is you shall speak to the children of what Israel selling you ours Roger the prophet bring you to myself so that you all of you women and men become rich stop daddy why a widow brother branham Sade's I was seeing on the video when I was just a timing my first group in the Baptist Church have hanji ternoon and a devil in closing now it is not because of you is referring to the pillar of fire everybody there that because one a worth-ship just you one of the prophets you see that pleura among the children of Israel brother Branham is the prophet but brother Branham is not the bride a leader he was just one of them everybody clear see the pillar of fire never just follow Moses you have access to the Sun God that work with brother Branham if he lives in brother Branham he must also heal in your life honor the life that's why Jesus said the works that I do you shall doing also you have access to the self power everybody there the pillar of fire never just follow Moses although he said I shall send my angel before - if d in the way but he was not just for Moses only he was for all Israel your transfer must die then God sent you a prophet to unite him to him so that you also as a high priest have a right to the pillar of fire let's see brother branham's talk but what I'm say that speaking about the widow he said that her man had died we're talking about a widow now you know she was a widow when Elijah came back from his wilderness journey he was a widow Elijah was sent to her she was glad to hear the Prophet dead after her man had died after Sadie died a new Pharaoh arose and begin to do things not pleasing unto you anymore when the sand Moses the massive losses will be sweet to your ears in touch bitterness for you to appreciate sweetness that's why rates in the message come you want to cherish those message you wanna love the message Lord an organization so that woman was under men that men rock-bottom said he was organization her organization was put into the Confederation of churches in other word fellow city that love Joseph died reverses rejected Joseph and enter into the Confederation of churches he went back to the Baptist he want to do this he went back to the denominational fence just like so he killed the witches and he ended up going to the witch her organization was put in a confederation of churches she sin well she was it that woman realized hey I have been mistreated I have been taken advantage of I have been mistreated I put my trust in fellow now look at this fellow it is not your first fellow you are dealing with romances are you here and what the prophet has said come to pass she was willing God still loved her and the Prophet went down there and kept her alive why the Death Angel is circulating until he crossed Jordan the rupture and the famine was / what a beautiful picture of the coming of the Lord they're in Elijah you see now perfect and remember this message in the last day is to be given by Elijah and with omen the Prophet he spilt upon the church everybody clear so far so what about brother Branham himself not for one moment remember when Israel was brought from Egypt he was to be united with who God when the spirit of Elijah comes is to bring your heart but to God brother Branham said not for the moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do it that would not do that now I have no interest in those things at ramesses but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see establish a true spiritual relationship between God and learn essential Moses to bring you unto myself either where we men become new creation across film within spirit and live according to his word I will invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him god bless you and may he is coming rejoiced no heart so brother Branham also purpose in to restore you back to your husband but your first husband said he must die everybody clear if the pillar of fire was not for Moses only and we see the returning of the pillar of fire nowadays what about in our day a lot clearer brother Branham the angel of the covenant now that was the pillar of fire made manifest here on earth following the will of God now tonight after 1900 years we have that same pillar of fire in our leads now watch closely if you slip in wake up you want a picture of it a while ago I say it with reverence scientifically-proven if I would die this very night now that pillar of fire has nothing to do with me I am just a man the pillar of fire is in the church not only with me it is with every one of you it is the pillar of fire never just follow Moses all Israel have access to the pillar of fire the pillar of fire that came in brother Branham say it is not only for me it is for all of you everybody clear let's go to first Peter chapter 2 why a widow first Peter chapter 2 if you dare you can say Amen remember the woman have the cross everybody they're few people first Peter chapter 2 everybody there but you are remember God told Israel that he want to make them a kingdom of what a kingdom of what Chris watch Peter but you are a chosen generation just like Israel was chosen among all the nation just like the widow woman was chosen and all the widow now Peter is saying yours are they chosen what generation why but you are a chosen generation a royal what royal priesthood just large God wanting to take Israel and to bring them to the promised land so that Israel can be a kingdom of priests Israel means that God turned that blessing because of the crossing of the hands of the children of Jacob and brought through the cross that blessing to the Gentile and say you gentle now I'm approaching you under the Ministry of Elijah I want you jente to be also a kingdom of word fresh not natural but loyal everybody here a royal priesthood a holy nation they sound blessings that was given to Israel Israel rejected God take it and bring it to the Jetta a with a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar discern world God told Moses for easier epithelia people that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of what darkness your first husband darkness he kill your first husband he kill your first nature and he brought you out so that you can become a kingdom of foolish everybody clear into his marvelous light I want you to live darkness your first husband and I want you to be united with light recognizing your day and his message in the book of Genesis chapter one God called the day want light the evening light be united with the word be united with Christ first and which in turn passed before I came you America in time past were not a people you are not even authorized to the Commonwealth of Israel that's what sufficient to cease but there are now a people of God which had not obtained mercy but now has obtained what mercy that's why I'm selling you Elijah the Prophet to bring you an to my self so that the blessings that was supposed to go through Israel comes to you and you become a kingdom of priests you say that could have been happening in Paul's time or what what are we going to do with that what Stephen let's go to the book of Revelation chapter one everybody okay so far nobody tired okay praise God we are dropping one point here why a widow and then on Wednesday Lords willing then we pick up the first and the second pool everybody there revelation 1 verse father are you there and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the crease of the kings of the earth to him that loved us there is a love day your new husband the loved us and washed us from our from our first husband brother Branham say that word washed means loose he's the one that loves you from your husband is the one that separated you from City idea that washed us from our sins in his own blood verse 6 and has made us kings and everybody clear and preached to God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever so the purpose of Elijah was to do it to bring you to God so that you can be a king and offer spiritual sacrifice to God go to Revelation chapter father watch now when the seals break and we know the opening of the seals is for the jente into to lay into the last egg the ministry of brother Branham watch again Revelation chapter 5 everybody there let's go to verse 8 and when he had taken the book we talked about the angel taking the book and bringing that to John and Jordan was scared to touch the book over here and he said you go ahead pick up the book go exercise your right but why do you have to take the book what is that book to do with you everybody and the when he had taken the book there Farb is your anointing of this church ages right and that four and twenty four elders we're going to see this when are we going to pick up on the mystery of the three heaven because we stopped before the confinement when we finish this series we pick it up and we see what is the third heaven everybody there fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden Val full of orders which are the players of the same watch verse nine then they sang a new song saying you are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for you were slain and have redeemed us to your first husband was dead we deem us to God by your blood out of every and tongue and people and it's showing you that the blood of Jesus Christ comes from different nations but from definition your husband in which information you are born must die if your husband was in Africa your African tradition must die if your husband was in America the American tradition must die if your husband was in Europe your European tradition must die you must be married to Jesus Christ that's why when we get to a church like this we're family there is no African here there is no American here there is no European here we are all children of God by our own blood by your blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation verse 10 we talking about the opening of the book and have led us to our God what and everybody and please and we shall reign on the earth so when the books comes when you get the book you in it it is giving you right to be a priest unto God so you can intercede for your family that doesn't believe the message you can intercede for your children that are still struggling you have right to go in the presence of God and you say God that we the woman when her child died she claims she said my since we're already been forgiven I have a son who's struggling in a message I have a daughter who's struggling in the message I am also claiming under the blood of the Lamb you also need to resurrect quick and my son and separate him from his first husband wicked my daughter and separate him from her first husband quickened my family week and my mother weekend my aunt we've got my grandpa we get my uncle week and my friend at work you say my friend when the vision was given to Cornelius Cornelius didn't call his family on me I'm gonna see that secondly Cornelius also call his friend and when his friend came both his family and his friend received the Holy Ghost why a priesthood a priesthood why a widow there is a mystery to the widow everybody there and now let's enter Cornelius got to chapter 10 we just dropping one point today and that's it I'll pick up a pen everybody there we're getting close to finish yes sir yes sir we getting closer everybody there up to chapter 10 verse 1 and there was a certain man accessory called Cornelius a Centurion of the band called the Italian band devout men and one that filled God with all his house which cared much armed to the people and prayed to God always he saw in a vision evidently about the 9:00 hour of the day an angel of the God of God coming to him and saying to him Cornelius and when he looked to him he was afraid and say what is he Lord and he said to him you pure prayer and your arm are come up for a memorial before God he even recognized the angel just like Paul recognized the pillar of fire Lord so this man was a believer he knew he was trained well job 2 verse 22 and they say Cornelius they Santilli on air just men remember that we the woman was a believer Cornelius was not a sinner a just man and wonderful God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you into his own and to heal the world of you job 2 verse 25 and as Peter was coming in Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worship Him remember the book of Revelation the same answer that was showing John John fell at his feet you remember Peter and Cornelius same caliber the angel and the messenger and John same caliber watch clearly Peter but Peter took him up saying stand up I myself also I am what a man everybody there and as he talked with him he went and found many dauer come together there were many people there are you there verse 28 and he said to them you know how that is a lawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come to earth to one of another nation but God has me that I should not call any man common or unclean let's jump to verse 34 verse 34 then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of her because he's pulling three people from every nation every day verse 34 but in every nation the jetta HIDA fear him and work righteousness is accepted with him job 2 verse 44 while Peter yet spoke this word the Holy Ghost fell and all or on all of them which heard the word and there were they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that their holy because that on the Gentiles pour out the gift of the Holy Spirit for their heard them speak with in other word what happened in the day of Pentecost to Peter happen exactly to Cornelius but there he was not a different example experienced but a different pillar of fire the same pillar of fire that was with Moses Israel had access to it the same pillar of fire with brother Branham you have access to it same baptismal appear about past you have access to it that one God Jesus said you shall be baptized with the same baptism that I am baptized off let's go to up to chapter 11 the second chapter then we head to the airport if you dare you can say Amen and there and the Apostle and brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentile had also received the Word of God and when Peter was come up to Jerusalem they or that were of the circumcision contended with them saying you went into men and circumcised and did eat with them everybody there they begins to condemn him let's go to verse 17 15 that's where we're going to stop as far as the scripture and as I began to speak Peter is explaining them the Holy Ghost fell on them as on on us and ER in other words this Gentile received the same experience like all of us in the upper room 16 then I remember I then we memorize the word of the Lord how that he said John indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost for as much then as God gave them gave them they like the exact same gift as he did to us who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I could withstand God in other words the same experience that Peter has is the same express that was given to Cornelius everybody there but the first husband of Cornelius has to die Cornelius was in Italian he separated from this nation Italy and he was now a proselyte to the Jewish nation when the first husband died then God sent him leader your first husband must die Romans 7 trusting in God trusting that you have your Bible open everywhere now across the country we want to read closely now it seems like it's on marriage and divorce the Roman we read but he really is not to me it's a prophecy for the church in the last everybody there so the church in the last day so to be married to the second Adam Christ the word you must separate yourself by death from your first denominational husband everybody now I'm not speaking to this local assembly I'm speaking out together across the nation you must be bad to your first husband if you are united to Christ and still married to a denomination you are in adulterous you are around Asia we are following Jesus cross the world to be in the brand you have to be we married to the Word of God which is cross everybody there now it was nature associated with death your first husband died had war over you your Pharaoh was your nature by your natural birth natural lulav the word because you are of the world you are the world and part of the world your desire by nature to love the word which you are part of you are a part of nature that's the reason you must you have to be born again you have to be separated you have to die to that first husband you can live with it you just can we are well I'll divorce him and hang him up there till occasion in other words a spare tire no sir no writing of divorcement he dies pharaoh dies are you
