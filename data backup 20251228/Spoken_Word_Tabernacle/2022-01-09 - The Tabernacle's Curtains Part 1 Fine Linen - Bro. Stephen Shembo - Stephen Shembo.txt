lord father at this time when we know lord that everything that you orchestrate will always work for the goodness of your children lord father you gave this baby and we are bringing this baby back again unto you lord you spoke in your word father that that which is in your hand there is no one that can plug it out of your hand father we are committing baby noah kabasele unto the hand lord made the angel that was ordained to watch over this child father may the angel always be careful to lord father stay close to this child lord father you the god that gave john the baptist the holy spirit in the wombs of his mother lord before even he can receive the breath of life but father this one is already born if you can do it for the baby in the womb of a mother how much more under the blood of

unto the hand lord in the name of jesus christ we dedicate him unto the hand in jesus precious name amen shall reach the blessing i'm glad to be here god bless you thank you very much let's give the lord's hand that will be all with the music amen he was looking wide at me i say go ahead and look at papa samantha grew up with me so much that she's like my daughter that's why i call baby no like my grandchild i say papa so you feel that that would be okay let's stand we will really really really need your undivided attention because this is a territory you have not traveled yet amen so if you have a tendency to sleep in a church don't do it but kaleem is not here he would have backed me up on that one amen he's streaming though he's online blessed be the name of the lord yeah that one we already got let's go to exodus chapter 25. whoever is working on the computer just be really tight with the screen because we need everything to be lined up somebody told me say make sure you have enough fuel stay up there in the air so if i can't see the airport you need to blame that person amen i won't tell you his name but it's beautiful when everybody is thinking about the word and this one is picking up something this one is sending me a text this one doesn't understand anything all of that makes it beautiful amen exodus chapter 25 and the lord spoke to moses everything we're going on now is building from the liver amen we're still connected to the liver the liver send us into the good samaritan and we we seen the priesthood in the level and then we move on into the good samaritan to see the high priest there now we're back again and it's the lever that is keep opening all of this stuff here so if you miss what we have been teaching all this time you're going to get in trouble amen and the lord spoke to moses saying speak to the children of israel that they bring me an offering of every man that give it willingly with his heart you shall take my offering you might be seated brother david can you boost me up a little bit can you imagine god is asking you for an offering i thought god own everything he even own you whether you like it or not whether you realize it or not he is your creator the bible said the heaven and earth everything belonged to him and that great being is coming down and say i need an offering what do you want this offering is coming from the children of god amen verse three and this is the offering which you shall take of them so not any kind of offering because at the beginning cain went and did his own thing everybody and brought the wrong offering able went and brought the offering with revelation so now god is playing he's speaking clearly this is the kind the only problem god is requiring here is make sure you're giving the offering willingly not like somebody's forcing you but you need to come out of your heart that's the way you should give your offering that's the way you should give your building fund that's the way you should be giving your tithing with a willing heart then god will bless you if you don't do it that way and you are doing it because of duty or because you are afraid god will whoop you then you don't have a revelation yet anybody care verse 3 and this is the offering which you shall take of them gold now you understand chapter 26 now right if you read it you will understand and silver and brass you can understand chapter 26 and blue is it clicking now did you read your bible on 26 karma and what you remember chapter 26 and purple and what you remember chapter 26 amen and water you remember chapter 26 everybody clear now if you didn't read it you're going to get lost amen and goat's hair you remember chapter 26 and rem skin die red you remember chapter 26 and bad your skin you remember chapter 26 about here oil for the light spices for the anointing oil and for sweet incense onyx town my god onixton and stone to be set in the effort and in the breastplate this is what god asked for what are you going to do with this god what are you going to do with this offering verse 8 and let them make me a sanctuary so the offering god was looking for was for the building of the sanctuary he said let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them so there is something in god here that he was not satisfied to be the way he was amen because he was the pillar of fire and after a while he was not satisfied to stay in the state he wasn't in so god long to dwell among his people but he doesn't want to dwell any kind of way and back here god wanted to dwell in a certain type of a house not any kind of house it have to be a specific house built with specific material not any kind of material do i m that material have to be a certain kind of material hallelujah verse 8 9 verse 9 according to all that i showed you you remember this now after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it so he went into the mountain god gave him a movie he looked at the movie he seen something in heaven god said this is my habitation in heaven i want you to copy that and to bring it back down here but when you do it here on the earth i don't want you to build it any kind of way everybody here even though you have the plan if and though you have everything that has been set up in heaven i want you to build it with a certain type of material not just going and pick up concrete and begin to build it no i don't need concrete the concrete will go with solomon not you hallelujah let's go to acts chapter 7. lord help us just be calm you'll be all right amen amen hallelujah act chapter 7 verse 44. if you're there you can say amen [Music] our father had the tabernacle of witness the first dwelling place of god was a tabernacle hey in the wilderness in exodus our father had a tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he has appointed speaking to who this tabernacle was built by moses hallelujah amen that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen everybody clear now we're coming from 20 uh exodus 25 you can see it here verse 45 which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus that name jesus is joshua everybody in other words moses built the tabernacle in the wilderness and then moses died and we know the mystery about his death his resurrection and god took him everybody but the tabernacle remained and joshua picked up that tabernacle and entered with that tabernacle into the promised land that's what stephen is explaining here he said verse 45 which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus meaning joshua into the possession of the gentile whom god drove out before the face of our father to the days of david in other words we stay with this tabernacle from the time of moses all the way to david you know why david right we went through this verse 46 david who found favor before god and desire to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob so that if it was not pleased with that tabernacle he want to build a temple anybody care but solomon built him a house so we moved right here from the tabernacle into the house or the temple the temple was built by solomon so the first dwelling place of god is a tabernacle built by moses then from the tabernacle god moves into a temple which is a more a stronger structure everybody clears so far verse 47 but solomon built him a temple a house however who built this tabernacle was moses a human being who built this tabernacle was solomon a human being who asked the people to build the tabernacle who gave david the inspiration to build the temple who did it it's god hallelujah however verse 48 the most high america the most high who dwell in the tabernacle the most high who dwell in the temple the most high who requested to have a house and they built the house for him however even though the inspiration came from him everybody however the most high dwells not in temple made with water that's why you need a prophet anybody here anybody here did god dwell in the tabernacle yes did god dwell in the temple but god is saying he doesn't dwell in the tabernacle made with him you see now he said here he said here it's a contradiction what are you going to do with this amen however the most high dual not in tempo made with hand as says the prophet why heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me what house who gave the instruction about the material god what house will you build god amen says the lord oh what is the place of my water so by house god was looking for a rest i thought god rested on the seventh day when he when he made the heaven and earth he was not resting god was trouble amen what is the place of my rest verse 50 has not my hand made all these things i am the one who created all of this i am the one who told you to build me a temple you built me a temple i lived there however that is not my perfect will is it clear now that is not really my perfect way however amen this is a permissive will let's go to romans 1 then we pray hallelujah if you dare you can say amen genesis exodus 26 we got the material of the temple here we found from the tabernacle to the temple but still god is not satisfied in other words god need another temple this is temple number one this is temple number two and back here i need another temple but make sure this temple we don't have input from human beings i don't want a human being to bring anything back here i don't need your concrete i don't need your offering i don't need anything from you that's the temple i want to do early ever here roman 1 verse 20. if you dare you can say amen for the invisible things of who the invisible thinks of god the invalid the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen how do you see it things are invisible how do you see it karma being understood by the things that are water so god in himself have things that are invisible and god himself is invisible everybody and paul is saying that the invisible things of god are seen through the things that are visible everybody so not only do you see them everybody care but you also understand them anybody here so if you don't have a clue what is god you need to look at some material amen we okay that material is telling you god are we okay i'm just helping you everybody here so if this is a material if you look at this you should see god and you should understand god just by looking at nature in other words when you look at the tree the tree is talking the tree have a message the tree is reflecting something that was originally invisible and if you get the revelation of the tree you will see god anybody here so the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal what how can you understand the power of god how god said to understand my power look in nature you're going to see my power amen even his eternal power and water in other words the attributes of god are we okay are also displaying material we okay so if you look at the material clearly you can see god being expressed through that i hope you understanding where i'm going anybody even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse so even if you never read the bible before if you look at nature you will see god anybody that's why people wanted to worship god and they didn't have the revelation and they begin to come up with ideas one say maybe he looks like this maybe he looks like a bear maybe he looks like an iron because they knew somehow they got to be a power that is orchestrating everything here but how to decode the material and to see god through a material that's the problem let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly again father this morning thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father i have done what any man that you give ability to do can do by your grace and this is where i can stop but where when it comes to interpreting your word and to bring a revelation to your children it is only an action of the holy spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you speak to your children this morning may you neutralize and destroy every kind of sickness every virus whether they call it kovid or or macron or whatever father in your presence those things cannot stand if somebody came that has been exposed or something father may you heal them by the power of the holy spirit may the devil and his entire army be completely out of this place and may only the holy spirit come down and further shower the blessings of redemption upon your children in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you hope you're staying awake when we were dealing with the mystery of deliver we were in exodus chapter 40. devil really at this time wasting time we were in exodus chapter 40 and the bible say and that shall anoint the letter and his foot and sanctify it and that shall bring aaron you understand this language now because we went through this and his son unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and wash them with water this water was not just regular water anybody care it was a water from an anointed level and right here in other words it was an anointed water anybody care so far john 3 verse 5 jesus said and jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water everybody here there and off the water everybody there he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that's why the lever must be anointed first to represent the holy ghost and then the water is there so now it's the water and the holy ghost mixing together that's the water you wash the high priest and his children anybody care so far and then dasha put upon aaron the holy garment we already talked about aaron we already found out our high priest that our high priest is the lord jesus christ and aaron we found out that he was washed by moses but we have not gotten into who washed jesus christ about here now you shall put upon the air on the holy garment what is a holy garment it's very easy to read and to pass through say okay they watch aaron and then they put a holy garment what is that holy garment anybody care and anoint him and sanctify him in other words consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest office and that shall bring his sons remember now the high priest and his son melchizedek our high priest and his son and clothe them with coat right here it says the high priest have holy garment plural and the sounds which are plural have coats what is the difference between a holy garment and a coat about here because i can tell you your high priest you already know him it's the lord jesus christ that is clear no problem amen so what is the garment that they're going to put on jesus christ before they anoint him because the first high priest they pull him they wash him after finishing washing him they put a garment on him and they anointed him and they brought his children they washed them put a garment on them and anointed them and the anointing represented the holy ghost everybody know that anybody here so when we brought jesus christ who wash him what kind of garment did they put on jesus christ and what kind of anointing did jesus receive everybody if the high priest is having a holy garment his son are not having holy garment but they have in courts what is the difference between a holy garment and a court to understand this we need to go back in the temple amen now buckle up as we begin to clamber everybody here i need your undivided attention anybody here so far so when we look at the tabernacle here everything in the tabernacle doesn't have life everything that made the tabernacle was just material without life everybody here we got clothing we got wood we got gold we got brass and everything there is no life if i bring gold here and i put it here that gold will stay here without moving anybody the only thing that had life in the tabernacle was the pillar of fire everybody here and the priest that were entering in everybody here to do the service of the tabernacle the tabernacle itself was made out of material physical material and the tabernacle have to be carried by somebody and move and pitched and organized everybody but the only living thing that was living in the tabernacle was the pillar of fire or the priest that entered every day and the high priest that were moving left and right they were the only living people everybody so we also knew when we look at the priesthood that the priest himself was a tabernacle you remember that because the tabernacle have how many portals three parts what is it the court the holy place and the holiest anybody care and as human beings how many parts do we have the body their the spirit and the soul so we are all temples we are all tabernacle anybody here but when you look at the human tabernacle the human tab and alcohol wear clothes the high priest have clothing everybody the sons of the high priest have also clothing everybody and the tabernacle itself have clothing are we okay are we okay hallelujah and if you notice the clothing of the high priest this is a physical material no life this is human the clothing of the high priest look like the clothing of the tabernacle because when we are born we are born with our clothing somebody must take clothing and put on us here and the tabernacle when you examine the tabernacle you look at the material of the tabernacle it looks like the clothing that the priests are wearing anybody okay so to understand the clothing of the high priest to understand the clothing of the priest or the sons of the high priest you must understand the clothing of the tabernacle first anybody okay god our subject is the tabernacle's curtains not one curtain but many curtains if you read exodus 26 you'll find this curtain of fine liner you find the goat hair you find the rem skin and you find the badger skin all of that covered the tabernacle anybody okay all right brother branham said god can't give a first revelation then a second revelation if he did he will be changing his mind he can give a revelation then do whatever add to it as he did in the garden of eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had to come through abraham and then later said it will come to a blood line in water so the more information god gives you the more specific what he's telling you is clearly seen if they say a virgin shall conceive which virgin many people are virgins here but if he said bethlehem now it's not in every city we need to go back in bethlehem about here so it's more it brings everything to a convergence so that you can see exactly what he's talking about brother branham said when he added to it he said it was the same revelation but he only gave the people more water to help them do water and water so when god gives more revelation of when god gives more instruction it is not to worry with you anybody care when god gives more detail the details of god are not to make you tired the detail of god are to help you understand what he's saying and recognize what he's trying to do anybody care so when god say four qubit five cubit he's saying something and but here the problem is we do not we do not understand how to decode that but behind the numbers behind the material behind the people behind everything that is in the scripture there is a message everybody okay so far where are we going my brother we found that in eternity eternity was filled with the spirit of god god filled the spirit completely because what branham said he was this fountain of seven colors of the rainbow anybody care so far then we already explained it to you that god immorphy or changed from this and god shrank himself into a light that was called the pillar of fire anybody care what is this light the pillar of fire stay awake please in psalm chapter 104 verse 1 and 2 the bible say bless the lord o my soul o lord my god they are very great they are clothed with water and water can you see honor can you see majesty if i tell you show me majesty what is majesty what is honor is still invisible everybody but the invisible attribute of god are understood by the things that are visible did that lose anybody did that lose anybody hallelujah defeat continue he said who conferenced that self with what can you see light there is a light here can you see light there is a light right here if you go outside the sun is shining you can see the light now it's a little bit more clear anybody here who covered that self with light as a garment so the first government god used was the pillar of fire everybody okay anybody okay so god veiled himself oh the spirit of god fell itself in a light because god is a spirit and nobody can see a spirit when you say god where is god now god there himself in a light so when you see the light moving you know that inside the light god is there anybody here that's why when paul was going on the road to damascus the pillar of fire met him and that pillar of fire was talking there was somebody inside the pillar of fire that could talk to paul everybody okay so the first garment of god was a pillar of fire which we already know we went through many times was the logos or the theophany everybody okay in daniel chapter 2 verse 22 he revealed the deep and secret things he know if what is in the darkness and delight dwell with him that's the first garment of god anybody care in the garden of eden we found god living there when he lived there he was still in the pillar of fire at the end of the day he comes and talked to adam and he continued all adam and eve can tell you if you say where's your god they say wait in the evening how is it he's like a light that is moving you will see the light that him if you stay with adam after a while adam would say come come come look at that light that's him he's coming and he comes adam adam how are you doing how was your day today when you look it's a light blazing everybody here then he called abraham when he met abraham at least through abraham this light here in more fair into a man anybody care but the material of that man was still a light and that man was called melchizedek america so when abraham saw him he saw a man walking he said oh that's finally god so bring food you want to give mercy that food he said i don't eat this i can give you food you cannot give me food everybody it's only in genesis 18 when melchizedek came he fabricated a human being are you following me and mercy zedek entered the human being and went to abraham when abraham cooked he said give it to me i can eat now because i have a body on top of my body anybody okay we found out that this right called the pillar of fire paul says in festivity he said that that keep this commandment with that spot unrebukable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ because when paul spoke to the light he said who are you and the light answer and say this is jehovah no the light says this is oh so jesus was speaking in the light everybody and until the appearing of our lord jesus christ which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and the only potent the king of kings and the lord of lord who only has immortality that melchizedek everybody care dwelling in the water we already seen that in the light which no man can approach even though god veil himself in the garment when you try to approach him he says stay away amen i'm going slowly it's a light but it's a light that you cannot touch are we okay it's a light that you cannot approach when you talk to him you must stay away i thought he was my friend i thought he wanted fellowship you need fellowship i come to your house you say thank you for your fellowship but stay there how are you doing i'm doing okay how was your day do you like the fellowship that was the fellowship god long to have a family god long to have friends god loves to have children his children are up and he fill himself with a light that when you approach say stand back stay there go ahead and talk what do you want you say i taught you my father he said yes i'm your father but you stay away there hallelujah he dwell in a light which no man can approach whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting amen we found out that when his children were in egypt and he came to rescue the children he met moses the bible said in exodus 3 and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in the flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and he look and behold the bush was burning with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i would turn aside and see this great sign why the bush is not burned it's a fire but when it gets into the bush it doesn't burn the bush what kind of fire is this one moses turned he said i never seen this before there is no smoke the fire is there and the bush is intact let me approach and see who is this fire embark here and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see he begin to get interested in the things of god god call unto him out of the midst of the bush and say moses moses and he say here am i and he said draw water stay away i'm coming down to talk to moses you did the supernatural and moses so moses said okay he want to talk to me say stay away what kind of light is this amen joe not nigh he'd put off that shoe from off that feed for the press wear on that standard is holy ground because i came down in this mountain i already changed this mountain here anybody here matter of fact take your shoes away and stay away from there i just want to talk to you but you cannot approach me cares so far even when he met israel at mount sana god gave the instruction because he lives in a garment in the light that no man can approach i hope you follow him amen in exodus 19 verse 11 the bible say and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon monsanto god told moses i want to talk to my children consecrate them clean them up in three days i want to meet them in the mountain so everybody came they want to talk to god because they are the people of god they belong to god god want to talk to them and that shall set bound unto the people round about saying take heed to yourself that you go not up into the water how do you call the people to come to you and you say stay away i thought god want to talk to us but god is saying i'm coming in the mountain because i'm coming in the mountain i don't want any of you to touch the mountain walk on the light is this pillar of fire amen take it to yourself that you go not up into the mount oh do what i don't even want you to touch not me the mountain don't touch it anybody here touch the border of it whosoever touched the mount shall be surely put to death there shall not a hand touching but he shall surely be stoned or shut through whether he be beast or water he shall not work so even if your puppy your dog goes there and touch the mountain they kill him it's a god i love you amen exodus 19 24 and the lord say unto moses god down charge the people lest they break through unto the lord to gaze in other words moses god began to talk to moses and he stopped he said moses go down stays there those people are curious go tell them remind them again that i don't want them to come closer because some of them are curious they are approaching they're trying to gauge to see really who is moses talking to everybody okay he said and many of them perish and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come upon the mountain the mount sauna for that charger that is saying setband i bow to the mountain and sanctify it in other words moses is telling god you already gave me the instruction i spoke to them i set bound nobody's gonna do it god said hey stop talking and the lord said unto him away get this down and that shall come up da and who number one moses was the only one who can approach god a little closer then god called to aaron the high priest anybody okay come with aaron with thee but let not the priest and the people break through to come up upon to the lord lest he break forth upon them aaron only the high priest but the priest i don't want to see anybody everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord in exodus 24 and he said unto moses come up unto the lord da in other words you and aaron and nadab and ebaahu and the seventy of the elders of israel and worshiped me near i thought he called aaron aaron say oh praise the lord i'm going to see the god of israel when he want to go they say no they just call you to move a little bit but you skip staying far off don't come closer to him anybody care aaron and his children and the 70 of the elder stay away and moses alone everybody okay shall come near to the lord near the lord but they shall not come nigh neither shall the people go up with him the only one i'm giving permission to at least come closer it's only moses he dwell in the light that no man can approach anybody okay so far but in exodus 24 8 moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and say behold the blood of the covenant which the lord has made with you concerning all this word then went up moses and who and who and who and who when moses took a sacrifice and killed it do you follow me and took the blood and put it on the people the blockage is removed amen in other words the gate god put moses took a calf kill it took the blood and spread it on the people as soon as he spread it on aaron and the 70 the gate open you follow me all of them enter into the presence of god to see god amen amen so to see god you require blood [Music] is everybody okay hallelujah then moses then went up moses and aaron and madam and abu and the seventy of the elders of israel and they saw the god of israel under the blood of goat and back here and there was under his feet as he were a paved work of sapphire stone and as he wear the body of heaven in his clearness and upon the noble of the children of israel he laid not his hand also they saw god and did it and did water they got there they said wow this is how god is look look and god is quiet it's a light that no man can approach but to approach that light you have to approach it only if something is dead and you take the blood of that sacrifice and you put it on you then you can approach and see him amen everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord now in acts in acts 7 the bible say i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning and i am come down to deliver them and now come i will send you into egypt this is the moses which said unto the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto who he him shall you heal and this is he that was in the church in the wilderness what i want you to see here is when israel was in egypt god called them my people are we okay when they came in the wilderness god called them my water everybody care and when they became church god told moses i want to dwell among you anybody care i see you having skin i see you with hair because moses spoke to god many times in the pillar of fire he got tired he said wait a minute can i at least see you god say you want to see me okay go in the cliff of the rock when he shows himself it looks like the back of a man moses said i saw him he looks like a back of a man but you cannot approach him the man moses saw was melchizedek everybody cares so far so now god is tired of staying in the light he said i am among my children but they cannot approach me i am too supernatural i'm living in the light when god look this is brother caliber he have clothing i don't have a clothes beside this light i wanna be clothed [Music] and god gave a promise through moses he said one day the lord your god will send you a prophet do you follow me that prophet is god but it's gonna be a prophet that look like you it's gonna be a god that you can talk to a god that can eat a god that can cry a god that can run a god that is 100 percent human [Music] everybody okay but before that god come let me already start dwelling just like you i see you l are wearing clothing your clothing is material this is silk this is what let me see this this is wool i don't have wool can you please make me a a a tent do you follow me can you make me a body can you people fabricate me a body that i'm gonna step in i know it's not time for me to be manifested in flesh yet anybody okay but at least i can't wait till that time it is taking too long please give me something now that i can feel a little bit comfortable everyone here so when you touch that thing you touch me are you following me are you following me if god dwell in a human being if you touch that human being you touch god but that promise was way down in the future and god said it is taking too long please fabricate me something that i can get in and when i'm dwelling in that thing if you touch that you touch me because when god dwells in the burning bush he told moses take your shoes off everything here change and back here when he dwell in the mountain he said not everybody touch this mountain now is charged differently anybody here i don't want to dwell in the mountain anymore i don't want to dwell again into a light anymore fabricate me a temporary body now that at least i can enjoy myself to be among you everybody okay so far hallelujah that happened when israel became the church brother branham said god has always in every age has hid behind the air all ages but he's been god all the time but he's kept himself hid from the world and reveal himself to his elect like the apostle and that day now that was god speaking in christ now man has always it's been the nature of a man he sought to see physically the god amen god want to dwell with human being human being is trying to see how god look like hey but here he always wanted to see it man has made creatures that look like him they think the indian worshiped the sun the african different form of animals they told them paul in alaska and different from that they think this god is as paul spoke there at athens that time on mars here and told them that they were superstitious concerning this unknown god they know he was there but yet they didn't know him everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord then being the church of god not the people of god god ordained a certain place for these people to meet in where they will be fellowship because god longs to fellowship with his people and among his people then god took moses up in the mountain of fire where the lightning was flashing and the thunder roaring and he showed him what kind of a dwelling place he desire to dwell in on earth for moses pattern the earthly tabernacle after what he has seen in heaven a sanctuary of the lord oh i think that is so beautiful to think that god before he would let a church building be built that that building had to be pardoned of his heavenly abode moses made all things after the pattern of the heavenly everybody okay now we're gonna drop there when moses made first he made the tabernacle anybody care then later on moses move on and we found that solomon built the temple everybody okay in exodus chapter 40 the bible says this in verse 33 so moses finished the work of the tabernacle then a cloud cover the tent of the congregation and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle if you look on the first tabernacle everything was single i'm going down deeper they only had one altar everybody okay one eleven anybody okay one candlestick everybody okay one ark everything was one one one one one and they finished the tabernacle everybody care and when they dedicated that tabernacle the only person that was ministering at the dedication was one man his name was moses amen are we okay everything in the tabernacle involves one person even for the atonement in the year only one high priest have to enter that's a not too high priest everything in the tabernacle was won everything in the tabernacle spoke about number one everybody okay so far hallelujah and then moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud above their own and the glory of the lord filled their tabernacle the one who was prevented to enter was only one man because the only one who can approach god was moses everything in the tabernacle won we clear now what is going on when we move into the temple of solomon in the time and i call each only moses we found that the tabernacle the temple involved many people hallelujah in fact in ii chronicle chapter 5 the bible says on the day of the dedication of the temple that delivered which were single all of them are self of assaf of heaven of genitum with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen we get that later having symbols and sultry and harp stood at the east of the end of the altar and with them a water and water sanding the water in the dedication of the tabernacle we only have one man moses at the dedication of the temple how many priests did we have are you there in the tabernacle one candlestick if you go in the scripture in the temple they had ten candidates in the top and ankle they have one level in the temple of solomon they have ten it looks like the temple of solomon is multiplying the tabernacle amen everybody okay hallelujah the bible says it came even to pass as the trumpeter and the singer whereas one in unity to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lift up their voice with the trumpet and symbol an instrument of music and praise the lord saying for his good for his mercy endure forever then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of dog in other words the same scenario that happened in the tabernacle happened now in the temple but in the tabernacle when it happened the bible say moses could not minister one man anybody okay but when it happened in the temple the bible says that the priest no more one man could not stand to minister by reason of the water for the glory of the lord has filled the water in the tabernacle everything was worn but in the temple it was 120 people and on the day of pentecost everybody okay when the holy ghost came and filled the temple how many people were there in other words the temple of solomon represent the bride [Applause] [Music] and the tabernacle of moses represented christ did i lose anybody in the tabernacle everything is single it is christ himself we okay in the temple the christ is multiplied it is no more one priest moses but now it is 120 priests [Music] everybody okay everybody okay the material of the tabernacle came from one nation from the jews only but the material of the temple came from many nations [Applause] hallelujah the bible said the house when he was building was built of stone made already before he was brought to the so that there was needed water no no any tool of iron heard in the house while he was let in water so when they were building the temple of solomon they didn't use a hammer everything was precise but everything came from different nations when they bring it from africa when they bring it from america when they bring it from asia when they put it together it fits perfectly in one church [Applause] in one church you have people from america people from africa people from jamaica people from trinidad people from zimbabwe in one church and they all fit together and no problem among them [Applause] that is the bride of jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah brother branham say we can all drink from this fountain we can all drink together and i'm so happy for this and believing that someday that god will bring us all together all people of our denomination god's work in one great ransom church you know solomon temple when he was cut out it was cut out in different parts of the world the trees the cedar of lebanon flooded down to joppa and from there to oxgarde to jerusalem and so forth and the stonemason in the years of cutting the different stone they shaped different way but when they come together there was not a freakstone among them every stone laid right to each water and i think that is what god is doing he's just cutting us out of the methodist out of the baptist out of the presbyterian and the pentecostal but when jesus come we shall all go stone to stone cemented with the water and god will take up his water the point i'm driving the temple of solomon is the bride of jesus christ it is god multiplied in many members and those members are coming from different countries but yet they fit together as one house of god but the tabernacle is one person and the material came from one nation and fit only one person everybody okay praise be the name of the lord did i lose somebody hallelujah but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and the heaven cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have built the question of solomon i built a house can god really dwell in this house and brother branham say stephen spoke of solomon temple and the most high don't dwell in temple made with hands for heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool a body has that prepared me god dwell in the stature of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect worship god in us being his tabernacle god manifesting notice that god has always at all time reflected himself in who hallelujah let's just take a look at this what moses must have saw he made it first out of earthly material which was made of water and sheepskin we call it tabernacle or tent meaning air dwelling place and in this tabernacle tent there was three separate compartment that surely is the way it is in glowing all these pointed to her and even the furniture that was inside its wall everything spoke of who that's the reason that cross in christ dwelt the fullness of god because all things led to him and christ was god manifest made flesh god tabernacle on water if this temple this tabernacle represented christ and this represented the the brother in this tabernacle we see that god told moses to get some clothing anybody care take exodus chapter 26 upon this upon everything that we have spoken let's enter exodus 26 god who dwell in the light that no man can approach now he's tired of it he want to dwell into a place but that place have to be built out of certain material normally he should dwell in jesus christ but it was not time for jesus christ yet do you follow me so he look in jesus christ you follow me god look at the body of jesus christ and begin to pull stuff from the body of jesus christ let me help you up again our body comes from water from the earth anybody care and the body of jesus christ was made from the earth god already have that body program in his mind and that's the perfect temple that god wanted to dwell but god could not wait for jesus christ he said build me a temple anybody care but don't build it to any kind of way i'm gonna give you instruction on what earthly material you will use everybody here so god opened the dead afar of the body of jesus christ you follow me then he begin to look and say moses taught the children of israel i need the color pink let me see again tell them get the color green you follow me tell them get the color purple wait a minute oh there is scarlet tell them get scolded so what moses is building there everybody here it is expressing the invisible things anybody okay let's go to exodus 26 moreover yao shall make the tabernacle with how many curtain is 10 a good number you remember that right that's why i keep telling you how many missed the sermon did you keep up with the sermon because if you don't you get lost anybody okay meg tan curtain of fine twin learning he's looking at the database he's giving moses instruction and blue and purple and scarlet with caribbeans of canning work shall that make them what are we making the tabernacle everybody okay the laugh of one curtain shall be eight and twenty eight just go slow with me and the breath of one curtain four queen bit every one of the curtains shall have one measure the five curtains shall be coupled together one to another and the other five curtains shall be coupled one to another and you shall make loops of blue upon the edge of one curtain from the sleeve edge in the coupling and likewise you make the outermost edge of one curtain in the coupling of the second 50 loops by the rabbit so you make in one curtain and 50 loops should you make in the edge of one curt of the ad of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second that the loop may take hold one to another and you shall make 50 touches of gold and couple the curtain together with touches everybody okay and it shall be two tabernacles everybody okay everybody awake put your seatbelt everybody okay everybody awake god said make 10 curtains anybody care split those 10 curtains in two you put five and five but even though those curtains are split put them back again together because they are not too curtained but they are one water no let's read it one water one tabernacle we are calling that curtain but god is calling them you okay now now look at the at the entrance screen here we are dealing with the first layer it's made of fan learning everybody okay god told moses he said make 10 curtain everybody okay those 10 curtain must be made from this material everybody okay number one fine linen everybody okay if it's okay you say a man because you read it yourself number two blue number three purple number four scarlett and put also caribbeans everybody okay so far all this curtain match the tabernacle everybody okay so far let me help you up go into verse seven and you shall make the curtain of water to be a water upon the water so the first curtain is not really a curtain hallelujah are you understanding god is calling the second curtain a covering of the he didn't say cover the first curtain he said comfort there tabernacle so the first curtain here is what they call the tabernacle itself anybody care in other words if you want to get to the last section of this tabernacle this is the curtain you found after this that's it this curtain is the tabernacle every other curtain that is given is a covering upon the tabernacle do you follow me do you follow me god told israel make the first tabernacle then get out the curtain and add them to the first curtain to give you more information to understand the first curtain amen let me repeat it again god give the first revelation you remember my quote but he doesn't change it then every other thing that is coming it is more information to understand the first revelation that's why the first curtain is the tabernacle everything else is just covering it did you get it did i lost someone thank you jesus when this tabernacle in other words this is the tabernacle this one is just covering this covering discovering but if they ask you what is really the tabernacle it's the first layer anybody care but to understand the first layer better you need the other layer so when god spoke to moses to get this material god said take this material and mix them together everybody when they mix it together it gives a curtain with many colors like this anybody okay so when you look at this curtain he has fine lennon he has blue he have purple he have scarlet you have carabins they mix them together and it's one curtain anybody okay hallelujah the dimension of this curtain is 28 by four everybody okay so god look at number 10 he said i don't want you to keep number 10 i want you to split 10 in 2. do you follow me in order to split 10 into everybody here you need to bring a half anybody care anybody care anybody care you okay i told you to buckle up everybody okay when you split ten in two it brings you five and five and god say take this curtain take five of them and put them together one two three four and one side i'm just making this easy for you anybody okay then you take the other one two three four and water my brother over there stay on the computer because you're gonna go home and review this everybody okay and god say at the edge i want you to follow when you look at this curtain you have five layers one two three four five do you follow me at the end of this curtain put blue everybody here who's there do you follow me do you follow me and on one curtain you put 50. everybody and the other curtain you put 50. everybody care the 50 on the first curtain is at the end of the curtain everybody okay but what finish one curtain is what stopped the second curtain ever here so the second curtain starts with 50 loops but the first curtain doesn't start with 50 loops he end with 50 loops hallelujah now we got two curtains separated god said remember those two content are two but they are not really two they are just but splitting anybody okay to remind you that this curtains are one make golden patches made out of gold anybody okay and makes them how many so in between the two curtains there is 50 loops of gold that are pulling the curtain together and those 50 loops of gold is what reminds you that it is still the same tabernacle everybody okay so far everybody okay pastor what is going on you ready now all right let's go brother branham says that notice that natural man have counted backward i said he did finish backward he can't backward watch this gun 10 9 8 seven six five four three two one zero ten is a bad number anybody okay god say how many curtains ten 10 is a bad number that's right to start with 10 it's a bad number they had 10 tribes brother robert of israel and them was all water so can express a carnal nature everybody okay anybody okay anybody okay so to bless israel and he had to take joseph two sons how many sons ephraim and manasseh the prophet children and did water when he did what when he closed his hand so to bring a blessing out of a tenor you must insert the number two are we okay everybody okay when you insert number two by crossing the hand everybody here by inversing because two is really this this is two and back here but when you cross it it gives you a half do you follow me when you insert a half in pretty 10 in the two half was the price of redemption in the old testament half a shekel go slowly i thought you have not traveled this before anybody okay anybody okay so to bless them you put the two sons of joseph but ten is a bad number ten express the carnal nature of a man everybody here so when god is giving moses distraction and he said moses make me a tabernacle take 10 curtains in other words moses i am bringing a tabernacle that's going to deal with the carnal nature romans 7 verse 14 for we know that the law is spiritual but i am what sold unto us number 10 number 10 we are all carnal anybody here born in sin shaping iniquity coming into the world roman 8 for to be carnally minded is water so 10 not only is he dealing with the count of nature it is dealing with death everybody okay but to be spiritually minded is life and cast because the kind of mind is water time is a memory between you and god anybody care so bring a tabernacle that's gonna remove the enmity bring a tabernacle that's going to remove the canon nature bring a tab and alcohol that's going to remove death out of my people anybody here for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can it be that's why he was a light that you cannot approach because your nature cannot approach him anybody care you are corner but bring me a tabernacle when that tab and alcohol come the carnal people can enter james ford yeah adulterer and adulteress knowing not that friendship of the world is enmity with god we were enemy with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinning from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the worker moses make 10 curtains i want to deal with the carnal nature of israel i want to remove the carnality out of israel i want to remove death from israel i want to remove enmity i'm not pleased with my people being away from me and they cannot approach me there is a nimity between me and them i don't like it i want to be a god that they can approach i want to be a god they can put their hand on i want to be a god that can understand them i want to talk to them but there is a nimity there is a death there is a counter nature that is blocking me god to approach them make me a tabernacle make me a body that's gonna take care of this problem anybody okay did i lose anybody hallelujah when you make this body when you bring in the tent curtain don't keep 10 because 10 is a bad number split it in two and marquis use the number of redemption and go split the ten and two and make five and when 10 is split into it brings to grace and back here you bring your first grace and the second grace you need both grace to deal with number 10 you need first grace and second grace but the first grace and the second grace is the same person [Music] it is the same tabernacle are we following hallelujah joshua here is a book a book of redemption of the old testament joshua we would have to consider it to be that the book of redemption because we dabs and had how many parts split into split the curtain into anybody here this curtain is the body that god wants to enter and live on take that body split into everybody here because redemption has two parts redemption anywhere has worked that's why they have to split into grace here that is out of and into so one grace will take you out of something do you follow me but the second grace will put you into something hallelujah he said it takes two parts to make redemption out of into moses represented the law which brought them out of egypt whereas joshua represented grace that took them into the water in other words the law and grace were two different aspects of god's command the law brought them out and joshua took them water he also represented something for water for our day for our day he represents as they were in germany coming from egypt into the promised land so have we come out of the water of water chaos on our road to the water in my father's house our many mentioned if he was not i would have water coming out and going water in other words the grass take you out from the world anybody here it is a grace that takes you out from a canadian out from the death out from the enmity and there is the grace that will put you in the promised land [Applause] everybody okay anybody okay i hope i didn't lose somebody redemption has two different parts come out of and entering into him first you have to come out some people want to bring the world in with them but you got to come out of the world you got to stop that cigarette you gotta stop that whiskey you gotta stop that fornication you gotta stop that adultery you gotta come out it take a grace to pull you out but when you are out you need the second grace [Music] anybody care anybody here you have to come out of unbelief to enter into faith there cannot be one thing in your way to you to really have genuine faith you must absolutely leave everything that is contrary to water behind to enter into water now we found out that we have to come to another vision in other emphasis now anybody here in our intellectual denomination and so forth all our education program has come to its jordan in other words its death then we must have an efficient again we must have a message coming out and going into further so one grace one five must deliver you from a sin from unbelief about here but the second grace must put you in the rapture are we okay did i lose anybody [Music] it's strange that some of you are sleeping david says this in psalm 63 epsom absorbed david when he was in the wilderness of jose of judah oh god die out my god early will i seek you my water taste for thee my water longer for the in the dry and thirsty land with no water if you remember when we talked about the black dogger we found that man was made by the other man and in a man anybody care you have a black dog here and you have a black dog there anybody care the first grace.com do you follow me remove the black dog from the inside do you follow me but the black dog is staying on the outside you need the second grace ever here the second grace is coming not to kick the black dog on the inside because you already have a white dog there is to kick the black dog from the other man or from your body david says this that's why he said my soul is testing for thee and my flesh also you remember that my soul longeth yeah even fainted for the court of god my heart and my flesh cries out for the living god paul said in romans 7 for are delighting the law of god after the water because the inward man already received the first grace now i'm born again but still i have trouble in my body redemption is not done yet you need the second grace the second grace he comes to redeem you on your body everybody here battle scene another law in my member not on the inside man the law of sin now is on my body worrying against the law of my mind it's a war and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my member oh righteous man that i am who shall deliver my soul because the soul is already redeemed who shall deliver am i of this water so paul is saying when you are born again on the inside you are a new creation but the outside you still have struggles still have the corner nature because you have the corner nature on the inside and on the outside the first grace take the corner nature out on the inside but the outside remain you need the second grace to remove that that's why the two grace have to be split everybody okay matthew 21 jesus said unto them did you never read in the scripture the stone which the builder rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes therefore say unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to uh not many nation one the bride bringing forth the fruit water and paul explained it he said that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostle and the prophet and jesus christ himself being the water so the ministry of jesus christ that he came first on earth was a cornerstone ministry hallelujah where are we going and the world was made fresh dwell among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of water so the ministry of jesus christ which was the ministry of the cornerstone that ministry came with grace everybody but that grace could only deliver you from sin anybody here john bear witness of him and cry this is he of whom i speak that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness the fullness of christ have we all receive receive water for what for the law was given by moses but what and truth came by who so when jesus christ came he brought you grace everybody okay blessed be the name of the lord but we need two grace okay first peter chapter one verse 10 of which salvation the prophet have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you anybody okay peter is saying that the old testament prophet was prophesying that there was a grace that is coming up everybody here a virgin shall conceive this one said that shall i call him emmanuel uh uh i mean a prince of peace mighty god they were all prophesying of a grace that will come and that grace when he came he was expressed on jesus christ as a ministry of the cornerstone okay searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when he testified beforehand of the suffering of christ and the glory that he should follow the prophet spoke about christ and the glory that would follow jesus christ after his death something will follow jesus christ everybody here unto whom he was revealed to those prophets that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister defense which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which thing the angel desire to look on so peter is saying there was a grace that was prophesied even the angel themselves wanted to see their grace and when digress came we already know about it it came in the man called jesus christ and if you remember jesus took that grace and gave it to paul to continue ever here but paul died and paul is still on the grave today all the apostles died all the apostles are still on the grave arenas died columbus died luther died we found out that the grace saved them but death can still operate in them and put them in the grave we need the second grace everybody okay anybody okay wherefore guide up the launch of your mind be sober and hope to the end peter is saying keep your hope because at the end over there everybody here there is another grace that is coming everybody okay we already received grace we are saved but don't worry keep your hope at the end time everybody okay hope to the end for the water that should be brought to you at the water i thought jesus christ already came i thought jesus already came what revelation again do you need of jesus christ jesus christ came he lived his life he paid the price he died what revelation again do we need everybody okay jesus came and brought grace that was the first coming that's the cornerstone but peter is saying hold on at the end time there is another revelation of jesus christ it's another question that is coming up that grace he's gonna finish everything everybody okay wait for the revelation of water anybody okay it's the temple complicated it becomes easy right he says the revelation of who which god gave unto him to show unto his servant the things which must shortly come to pass and he send it and signify it by a water [Music] that revelation will come by a prophet it is a different grace it is another question that grace is gonna finish everything [Applause] this message is christ this message was written in the tabernacle [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everybody okay that's why split number ten put five and put five everybody here everybody the first five is gonna knock the first part but wait for the second grace you want to go home everybody okay everybody okay let's look if the first grace was the cornerstone what is the second grace it must be a stone the first was the cornerstone the second must be a stone which stone [Music] [Applause] say unto zero pepper [Applause] talk to the robber everybody care not by mud not by power but by my water says what who are there oh great mountain before the robber who are you before this message who are you [Applause] who are you before this message who are you you gonna become a plane care everybody care because he shall bring the water no more the cornerstone but the water they had son with water crying water and water the second gracie [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay now so number five the first grace to christ under the cornerstone by the second grace through zero babel my time is up but let me chill out everybody okay everybody okay brother brown i'm saying sorry have laid the foundation with his hand he also shall bring forth the water i want you to notice he never said he shall bring the cornerstone that was jesus christ but he shall bring forth the water you ready we know that the scripture says that jesus is the chief water and he is also the water hey but here it is five and five but those five are not two fives [Music] it is one tabernacle [Applause] the same path here is the same five days but it's two ministries that i split together hallelujah we know brother bonham said now if we will think for a minute the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the father in other words we build the church again [Applause] under the water of the water not by power not by might but by my water not by organization not by denomination but by the water god will bring forth his church in the water everybody okay everybody okay the first five and the second five are not too separated it is the same man it is one tabernacle anybody care anybody care everybody here he promised so set in the bible just exactly to this day and the sodom of gomorrah there was elijah elijah was not that was not elijah that was the spirit of god in who elijah was just a water we heard elijah a larger scout an adjustment mentor elijah's everything but the elijah of this day [Applause] you okay is who is the lord jesus christ it is the same father it is the lord jesus christ he is to come according to luke 17 30 the son of man is to reveal himself among his water not a man but what but he shall come through a water [Applause] are you there he was the son of man jesus christ but in between the son of god the church ages remember last sunday and the son of david he slipped back up again as the son of man not jesus christ but through a prophet [Music] let me help you up chill out in there in the very day that the son of man is revealed revelation 10 1 to 7 read it when you get home the seven angel messenger opening the seven water what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing there can you get it separated now anybody here that is where it seems so hard for you because you're looking at william ryan branham it is difficult to separate him from christ it is not brother branham it is jesus christ here do you remember mordechai the king stay in the palace but mordecai used the garment of the king he used the mantle of the kingdom and the mantle of god is the pillar of fire somebody will use the pillar of fire he looks like god but he is not god [Applause] hallelujah not the son of man himself but the seven angel the seven messenger is revealing to the water the water mordecai is on the horse of the king with the garment of the king if you look far off you think it's the king but it's not the king it's mordeca but the anointing is the king [Music] i was not the one that appeared down in the river i was only standing there when he appeared i am not the one that performed this thing and foretell these things that happened as perfectly i'm not the one i was only that's near when he doesn't i was only a water that he did water it was not what i knew it's what i just water that he did water it is not me it was not the seven engine oh no it was the manifestation of the water it he was not the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded not a man but who the angel was not the son of god he was the messenger from the water the son of man is who five and five are the same he's only borrowing a different body everybody here he is the one you're feeding on you are not feeding on a man his word will fail but you are feeding upon the water off the water this message is crushed [Applause] everybody okay this message is jesus christ everybody okay if you have not fed fully on every word to give yourself water to fly above this water that's why you need to feed on a message so you can get more strength and stay away from denomination [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay and we found out can you give me a few minutes i'm gonna stop somewhere can you give me a minute you okay hallelujah the curtain five grace under the cornerstone five grace under the headstone it is not two different person it is the same jesus christ son of man son of man but here he is borrowing somebody because in revelation 10 there is a heavenly angel and every messenger two of them ever care he is the one that is revealing the son of man everybody okay five five but in between five we found there are 50. you okay you okay is everybody awake what is wrong with 50. in the old testament the bible says that there was to be 50 years of water [Music] at the opening of the seventh year the bible becoming you you see now hallelujah shake somebody's hand check yourself make sure you got your seat belt you ready you ready there are 50. jubilee that was seven times seven in the 49 years daddy was to be made ready the 25th year was the year of jubilee 50 means water [Music] hallelujah everybody okay 50 means what number 50 means jubilee everybody okay 50 is god's number it's god's jubilee number the word pentecost means water 50 means also water hallelujah he was the outpouring of the holy spirit at the end of the water he was also at the end of the year so 50 is jubilee jubilee means somebody was in bondage everybody and the priest must give the atonement and when he come out he's going to send the trumpet and free you out but 50 also means pentecost pentecost speak of the outpouring of the holy ghost are you okay are you ready look forward verse 18 the spirit of the lord is upon me under the cornerstone after the first five remember there is five and there is five the first five was jesus christ himself when he went into the temple they gave him the scroll and jesus began to speak he said the spirit of the lord is upon me amen because he has anointed me to do water preach the gospel to the poor he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captain and the recovering of sight to the blind to set at water so somebody was in bondage certain liberty them that i wanted to preach the word what is the acceptable year the year of what so jesus christ under the cornerstone had a jubilee ever here in the old testament they were sending the trumpet everybody here but jesus was the first one that changed the trumpet from an instrument into a gospel trumpet do you follow me so the first five comes with a jubilee anybody here but 50 means also pentecost are we okay are we okay blessed be the name of the lord if you notice let me read this so we good moses god told him make these 50 loops of blue everybody korea white blue give me some time then i learned there they all white blue brother bonham say the first great spirit of god which is love god like the great rainbow we would not imagine what he looks like but just say he looks like the rainbow damn spirit the perfect spirit of love is water keep that in mind blue is the perfect spirit of water the blue color hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord where did i put blue according to brother branham is the spirit of fellowship the spirit of fellowship which is the holy ghost everybody okay because the holy ghost when he gets into you then you become back again in reconciliation with god you start fellowship with god because nobody can call himself a child of god without the spirit of god that's what paul said anybody okay brother branham said this great foreigner has gone before us making a way he become from the spirit the great fountain of the rainbow of god who had no beginning no end it was the ray of love that is the main one which color the next color follow which is water blue is water color blue is chillness everybody okay john 8 32 the bible said ye shall not death and the troops are water you shall know the truth and if you make a contact with the truth the truth has a gospel of jubilee if you are captive that truth will set you free and jesus said i am the way the water [Music] everybody care that's why who the son has said to us is water friendly because the sun has a jubilee the lord has anointed me to preach the acceptable year when you meet jesus christ he will free you lord have mercy everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay watch this brother branham say the world coming at the jubilee year we had that about this time 1961. if you notice pentecost has been falling in america about water in 1906 right somewhere on that time about 50 years ago pentecost began to fall now what is happening the church is receiving the seventh seal book of the revelation of jesus christ and not one tenth of them can receive it you okay now watch very carefully as i'm zeroing the airport watch carefully everybody the first five is the ministry of the cornerstone which is the mystery the ministry of jesus christ anybody okay the second five is the ministry of the headstone which is the ministry of jesus christ everybody those two are not separated they are one care what joined them is the 50 golden god means deity everybody both ministry have a jubilee a golden jubilee in luke chapter 4 jesus came and said the spirit of the lord is upon me everybody he sent me to preach the acceptable year oh to preach the jubilee america and what happened jesus stopped at the middle of the sentence he never finished the whole prophecy anybody okay do you remember that if you go to isaiah 51 61 isaiah said the spirit of the lord is upon me he sent me to preach the acceptable year and the day of vengeance and everything jesus read a portion of that and stop and back here and he left the other portion and when brother branham came brother branham took the second portion the scripture has been split in two one has a jubilee and that jubilee is not a jubilee of a priest here it is the jubilee of god himself the high priest himself melchizedek himself deity himself came with 50. [Music] ever here that's why brother branham said it is not me i am just standing there it is god you are not feeding on my word you're feeding on god there is a divine element a 50 golden element that makes the ministry of bodhibranam and the ministry of jesus christ one what makes them one is the deity element the golden ring that bring the two jubilee together [Music] did i lose somebody [Music] everybody okay watch this at the end you okay blue represents the what which color the the color of trueness and the spirit of water jesus said the hour comes when the true worshiper shall worship me in water in spirit and in water the true worshiper will worship me in blue color anybody here anybody but that blue color will not be at the beginning of my ministry that 50 of pentecost will not be at the beginning it will be at the end everybody okay so when jesus finished his ministry america and jesus died and is resurrected then come 50 in the day of pentecost outpouring the holy ghost that's why the 50 is at the end of the slive age anybody care but the second ministry of jesus christ is start with the outpouring in azusa street first the 50s start first with jesus christ the 50 pentacles follow him with brother branham pentecost start first in azusa street 150 at the end 150 at the beginning [Music] did you get it did you get it with jesus christ the 50 blue loops are at the end when he finish his ministry he said it is expedient for me to go so when i go i can send the holy ghost if i go up i can send you 50 blue color i can send you the holy ghost of pentecost here but when the ministry of brother branham is coming pentecost come first 51st then the ministry after pentecost and pentecost but the two pentecost what makes them together is the golden jubilee they both have a divine jubilee that's what pulled them together and make them one ministry anybody okay anybody okay and if you notice what is this dimension and what is this dimension what is the number four then i stop here okay brother branham say four is the number of water did you know that four is an earthly number hey it is a number of earth a number of what four is a number of earth and water deliveries hallelujah delivers now there was three hebrew children in the fiery furnace but the fourth one come it was water lazarus was in the cave how many days and the fourth day one come he was water four is the number of water everybody okay so the curtain whoever is doing something there need to put the light back up so the curtain right here everybody okay so the curtain right here if you look at this curtain the measurement is full four by what by 28 what does 28 represent you okay you ready you ready i don't know who's playing up there somebody there it's the devil he knows what is coming up he doesn't want you to hear that everybody care let me drop it before he comes again number 28 is a number of a woman reproductive circle [Music] everybody okay everybody okay number 828 is a woman reproductive sucker which speak of life everybody okay hang tight because you're gonna heal the airplane dropping anybody care anybody okay so god told moses that the measurement of this thing must be fall by 28. anybody care because sin in the garden of eden entered by a woman everybody here he was if that sin everybody care and the devil brought sin by destroying the three virtues of a woman but here he destroys womanhood by teaching eve sex he destroys virginity of evil and he destroys the motherwood of eve by bringing a a who cane into his womba into a womb all three virtually devour and then isaiah prophesied that a virgin shall conceive death entered the human race through the woman life must enter the human race through the woman [Applause] everybody okay but that life is coming to the earth to bring deliverance everybody ever here when jesus entered mary he was without sensation he preserved womanhood mary never lost her virginity when jesus entering he preserved virginity the womb was pure and virgin he preserved motherhood he preserved the tree virtue [Applause] everybody okay so god by 28 he's coming through a woman ever here to bring deliverance through the woman amen because the devil destroyed her circle god is coming with number four god becoming earth god becoming man through a woman number 28. everybody here everybody okay and the same number 28 here never change over here everybody here that's why on february the 28th on sunset mountain on sunset mountain on february the 28th another woman was there the bride of jesus christ february the

and review this let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love and for your mercy father who can unfold this kind of stuff but only you never and will never have anything to do with me father it is you the almighty god that heed these things in the scripture and because of the opening of the seals father you drop an anointing that is making the bible a new book and it's bringing us to fall more and more in love with you because without you we can do nothing father thank you for sending us this second grace lord thank you for opening these numbers lord whoever was in struggle now they can see perfectly the mathematics of god father you came with a second jubilee lord no wonder your prophet could come and preach the year of jubilee because that

weakness maybe to women maybe it's proud maybe it's stubbornness maybe it's ignorance maybe father it's a dominating spirit maybe it's a sickness somewhere maybe it's not a female trouble maybe it's a complex or a depression father but whatever it is even those that have been exposed to kovid father there is no mountain that can stand between before is a robber they all will become a plane father praying and sending the jubilee lord of this message under the name of jesus christ that you free your children this morning from every demonic bondage that the devil have brought upon them father may you bring deliverance not a man deliverance but a divine deliverance because who that you set free father shall be free indeed lord we thank you for the grace you have given us lord to even reach this point we are committing one another unto the hand may look god do you continue to unfold your word to your children and bless us out together as we commit everything unto the hand in jesus precious
