room everybody okay so don't think like other people have to fix so they can get them quickly Revelation chapter five ah it's amazing how the Holy Spirit works if you dare you can say Amen very familiar scripture verse 8. this is We are continuing uh from last time I wanted to bring it to question and answer your boss didn't agree with it so we gotta zero that back here and go through Ezekiel and see Lord's willing if we would cross Zechariah quickly and land then we go back to the seed of the woman and we start going back to surface okay yeah man all right verse 8 the Bible says and when he had taken the book you know what it means right amen the four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the land having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of others which are the prayers of the saint you might be seated when this happened verse 9 and this song a new song your name amen how can you sing a new song If the book is not taken [Music] huh and the sung a new song yes so it's a song that was not there before [Music] everybody okay so the opening of this hill we bring stuff even song that were never there before [Music] everybody okay is everybody good did you sleep good brother said already told you on Wednesday that I'm expecting you to say Amen [Music] glory to God he said saying you are worthy to take the book and to open this Hills thereof for you were slain and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of what every kindred my friend here you go away with microphone please he need his microphone I got one here we need to preach together he became a partner in sermon [Laughter] amen Hallelujah glory to God praise God when I sit at home I review the sermon I can hear it moving move I say okay and now it's working praise God Amen and sometimes he say hallelujah God I say oh my God that's my God so keep on that Firing Line you're doing very good amen he said you were slain and have redeemers to God by your blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and Nation verse 10 and has made us to our god what and water because your Melchizedek himself is a king and a priest so in other words this opening of the book this breaking of the seals amen open something that is pulling Kings everybody here but we are not just King we are like our father because our father he's a king and he's a priest so I cannot be just a king I am a king and I am also a priest everybody okay everybody okay throughout the seven churches the lamb was a priest everybody okay but at the end he comes as the King as a lion so we are also lamb and lion you are also a Lambert and sometimes you both like a lion amen especially when it comes to sin amen [Laughter] if you just slam blam blam blam blame blame blame that don't work there is a time that we get to a boldness of a lion when we talk to the devil face to face when he wrote like a lion and a roar also [Laughter] say who you're talking to do you know who I am I know who I am you don't talk to me like that and this is the last time you ever talk to me like that [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] amen so when the book is open it's pulling Kings out the Bible say he has made us water Kings and water why do you are why why are you supposed to be a king remember he is the king of foreign right it's just the top King so this breaking of the seals amen brings Kings out and these kings are Kings and Priests glory to God Amen and then we shall water Rain On The Water who Reign is it a prehistoric King it's a king that rain so the book will pull Kings out because the time of the rain is coming up so they need to bring the king out prepare them for them to begin to reign the opening of the seals let's go to revelation 13. Oh Glory to God Lord help me once the time goes quickly Sunday is trying to flies again amen Revelation 13 verse 1. you know what it means now and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast to rise up everybody clear of the sea having seven heads you know now what it means and ten horns and upon his head and his horns ten crowns we understand that they are crying because they're kings amen and upon his head the same uh upon his head the name of blasphemy and the Beast I'm trying to go quickly which I saw was like to a leopard when his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and the great Authority in other words this beasts become the devil because he's operating with the power of the Devil with the authority of the devil and he's taking the seat the place of the devil on this Earth amen and I saw one of his head as he were wounded to death you know what he means and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wander after the Beast if you notice here there is not a woman here it is only the Beast because the combination is a woman and a beast but here it's only the Beast everybody okay verse 4 and they worship the Dragon which gave power to the Beast you're worshiping the devil everybody okay because the dragon is the old serpent which is sitting on the devil amen which gave power to the Beast and they worship the Beast saying who is like the Beast who is able to make water it's a beast that can make war this Beast can make war Hallelujah and then verse 5 and there was they were and there was given to him a mouth the Beast remember already have a mouth amen but they gave him a bath everybody okay so this beasts become have now a month okay can a dog speak can a leopard speak no can a bear speak no but if you give him a human mouth he can speak amen so this Beast become a man everybody okay amen because you already have a mouth but that mouth was not speaking that man falls only to destroy Mana they give him a mouth that he can speak in other words the beasts have now a spokesman he have a prophet he have somebody that speak for him everybody okay a beast have now a month he have a person he have a a prophet he have a representative amen glory to God hallelujah and he says that the the amount of speaking water great things Lord help me to reach that point this month is speaking great things I'm writing this because you need to be very careful when you read the scripture even the way scripture are placed they are placed with the mathematics one of this day you will see do you remember do you know why Revelation 6 must be before Revelation 7 must be before Revelation 8 and that must be before revelation at 10 and then 11. do you know why they followed himself like that I don't want you to go there okay Revelation chapter six Revelation chapter seven Revelation chapter eight okay okay Revelation chapter 9. Revelation chapter 10 Revelation chapter one six plus one equal seven plus one equal eight plus one equal nine plus one equal and ten plus one equal eleven so when you go horizontal it's going by one one one one one everybody okay six plus three equal nine seven plus three equal and eight plus three equal when you go vertical it's following up that's why brother Branham said the scripture are mathematically everybody okay there are things that goes with this thing hey everybody okay Revelation chapter 6 finishes with the Sixth Seal do you know that the seven seal is not in Revelation 6. amen the six seal finishes here the sixth amen but the seven seal goes to revelation 8. everybody okay everybody okay if you go to uh Revelation chapter 9 you will see how the other trumpets are blowing and what is the last trumpet you will find out that the last do you have time so don't push me when it comes to 10 o'clock 12 O'Clock you start pushing me okay okay go to revelation 9. where is revelation 9. go to verse 14. you there saying to the water which had the water which Angel is standing here the sixth angel with the sixth trumpet so Revelation chapter 9 finish with the sixth trumpet if you read down you won't see the seven trumpet everybody okay so Revelation 9 finished with the sixth trumpet everybody okay this finish with the Sixth Seal this one finish with the sixth trumpet anybody here but the seventh seal is here by mathematics if the sixth series here the sixth trumpet is here if the seventh seal is here what do you think might be in Revelation 11. what do you think should be there let me put seven trumpet let me stop let's verify let's go to revelation 11. you see how you you see the love for the messages the message is not the skim milk when it takes you up you don't even feel like staying in this world time everybody okay this one Pentecostal don't get here that's why we are different from denomination our sermon are different everybody okay job to verse 15. everybody okay and the seventh angel sanded water they and the what the seven water sanded and there was great water in the water Heaven saying the kingdom of this world have become the kingdom of water our Lord this Angel never sanded in Revelation 10. that's another seven so the last trumpet is sanded in Revelation 11. everybody okay so Revelation 6 finish this Revelation 9 finish this Revelation 11 blow the seventh seal Revelation 8 blow the seventh seal Revelation 11 blows this one what happened here what happened here in Revelation 10. and and then and then go home because I need to go back to my subject and see what happened in here everybody okay everybody okay I leave this you feel in the blood but watch what happened here they are calling the hundred and forty four thousand which is the elect of the Jews everybody okay what do you think happened in Revelation 10 he's calling who [Applause] [Music] let's erase that quickly okay so we go back to our subject make sense so when you read the reason why I'm saying this when you read the Bible be careful even a Karma means something everybody okay oh what a lovely book is the Bible I can give you quote that goes there boom boom boom but if I start right now before you know you're looking at the clock where were we yet 13. amen verse 5 and there was given to him a man speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given him to continue for water 40 and two months you remember that Sunday now you understand 42 amen and he opened his mouth when that mouth that was given to him when he opened his mouth the Bible says that and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against who God to blaspheme his name his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven so this is a dirty mouth completely against God everybody okay verse 7 he was given to him to make war with water so when he makes War he makes War also with descent man no wonder the woman is drunk with blood amen with the scent and overcome them that's why he overcome Moses and Elijah after the prophecy you remember last Sunday and power was giving him over all Kindred and tongue and Nation so he can kill anybody he wanted this is a beast a job to verse 18. who is this Beast again refreshing quickly father help me amen and here is wisdom let him that has understanding count the number of the so we're talking about the Beast there is no woman here if you're sleeping you need a wake up amen Shake somebody behind you like besides you say shake shake everybody okay for it is the number of a man everybody okay so the Beast is a man it's a prophet he has a mouth a person a prophet a representative and that representative is not a woman everybody okay it is a man and the man have how many numbers he have a trinity of six everybody okay let's go to Revelation 17 then we can pray glory to God verse seven it will be the reading there Lord help me and the angel said to me wherefore did that Maryville did you marry did you Marvel I will tell you the mystery of the woman and the Beast that carry her now it is not just the Beast there is a woman that is associated with this beast that's sad so the system of the devil like we went through operate with the woman and with the Beast so if you want to really destroy the Devil clearly you have to destroy the woman and the Beast because they are a unit everybody okay so now we have a woman that is on top of her and the woman is a church which is also a city on Seven Hills because churches are also City Ephesus was a city pergamos was a city tatarian was a city it was also a church Jerusalem is a city but Jerusalem is the church because Paul said the Heavenly Jerusalem who is our mother so the city doesn't give birth to people okay okay yeah man it's a language on the Bible and the Beast I carry here which have seven heads and ten horns we went through this Beast and the Beast that you saw remember not the woman the Beast that you saw was and is not and shall ascend from the bottomless feet and go into Perdition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wander the same thing that happened in Revelation 13. whose name were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the word when they behold the Beast not the woman that was and is not and yet is amen so this Beast here we seen that was that was not that it was a succession of her Pope that's why we say the Beast is giving a mouth person a prophet which is a false prophet a representative a man with three six everybody clear so far praise God now job to verse 9 and here is the mind which has the wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains we went to that which on which the woman sits which is a city but there are also seven Kings this is where we were last Sunday remember and father Fallen that history and one is history and the other one is not yet come there's still natural king of Rome and when he come he must continue a short space we went through this verse 11 and the Beast that was and is not even he is the eighth everybody okay now we have seven Kings you remember last Sunday amen this beast when John gave his description John bring the description as having ten horns everybody care and at seven heads when we go to Revelation 17 we see a woman associated with the Beast 10 horns seven heads and the seven heads here we found out that they are natural King but they say that the Beast himself is also a king but he is not a natural King remember last Sunday he is a spiritual king that's why he's number eight everybody care he's number eight of the seven so when you count one two three four five six seven you move from Pagan room and you change into paper room now the kingdom is not naturally it becomes spiritually the pope take over Rome Rome is no longer a natural Kingdom now it is a spiritual Kingdom it is no longer the nation of Italy now we become the Vatican everybody okay everybody okay praise God now go uh job to verse uh 12 and the tenthorne everybody okay which you saw are Ten Kings so we found out that we have the Beast we have the woman and the Bible also said that we have ten horns and we know the horns are dictator we went through this which is the power of communism everybody care so there is a connection between the Beast and communism everybody okay everybody okay not the realm of Russia by the Bay everybody okay because the beasts himself have a part that look like a bear his feet was like a bear anybody okay so there is a mixture of that bear into the Beast we okay now okay a job now job valve to verse uh 12 and the ten horns which you saw are Ten Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet but we see Power as king one hour with the Beast they have one man and shall give their power and strength to the Beast watch these shall make war with the lamb the one making War here with the lamb is not the Beast I want I want I want us to be clear these the business one the one brother Branham said not let this be known scripture does not play with water all right whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eyes to water see it is therefore a water you need to be very careful when you're reading the Bible this is a holy book this is our foundation you don't read it like newspaper you don't just read it because brother Branham say read it then you go again you won't get nothing everybody okay let's go now they say that these the ten Kingdom or the 10 King make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings everybody okay now and they that are with him are called Chosen and water faithful so the lamb when he goes to battle with sin he doesn't go himself he's coming together with his brother amen but right here the one who's making war with the lamb is only the Ten Kings everybody okay so according to Revelation 17 according to Revelation 17 amen the war happened between the ten king or between communism everybody care and the lamb with his brother everybody okay it is not the Beast that is fighting the land everybody okay it is not the woman that is fighting the name everybody okay we got the Beast we got the woman we got the horns the one making War right here is the bed everybody care amen glory to God job to verse 15 and he says to me the water Waters they watered us that sounds really good the god the water which you sow where the horse sit our people remember this remember this I'm telling you to remember this our people and multitude and nation and songs watch now again the ten horn not the Beast the ten horn which you saw upon the Beast these shall head to who they don't hurt the Beast I'm going slowly it's a surgery my friend amen the Beast is a man but upon the Beast there is a woman it's a husband with his wife everybody okay the ten horns are heading the woman the wife everybody okay did that the scripture didn't say they hate the Beast they hate the whole the woman everybody okay they had the war the whole and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her with water so these communism here the communism not only is he gonna make war with the lamb but he will also destroy the woman everybody okay the woman which we know is a church and a city everybody here that's why brother Branham said the Vatican will be burned with an atomic bomb because remember last Sunday the Third World War the third world it says whoa whoa whoa the third one is an atomic war you remember that Sunday because the whole world is brewing slowly going toward it anybody okay now verse 17 for God has put in the heart to fulfill his will and to agree and give their Kingdom to death not to the woman are we okay are you opening your scripture they're giving their Kingdom to the Beast not to the woman but the beasts and the woman are one everybody okay everybody okay praise God until the word of the Lord shall be fulfilled and the woman which you sow is the greatest city which went over the kings of the remember this woman ran over water the Kings of the Earth scripture don't play with word she doesn't rain only upon Kings these kings are the kings of what they are the kings of water but what when the seals are broken they are calling the king from where this King are from where this King their King our father is for money melchiza the king of water with Salem that is in Palestine which element because Abraham was looking for a city that God has built did you see God building Jerusalem so we got Kings somewhere there and we got kings that are somewhere but the woman rule over the king that are not the king from there because from there the Neymar written in the Lamb's Book of water everybody okay everybody okay okay let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto their hand father may you move me aside may you come down and speak to your children be the Alpha and the Omega of this service may you move completely destruction away every spirit that has been battling or bothering your children whether it's a flu or a cough or something under the water or a fever or something that makes them tired until they cannot focus father we rebuke them back to Hell In The Name of Jesus Christ father May healing take place this morning and may you give strength Lord father and open up a window of Revelation this morning in the name of Jesus Christ amen glory to God you buckle up we're going to be living amen my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the second Trinity and the second order the four phases of roof the second Trinity and the second oil everybody okay when we're dealing with the all we know that there was two oil there was a no that went with the virgin everybody okay but there was another all that was reserved until a certain time according to the parable of Matthew 25 we found out that the Virgin all of them went and they were going toward the budget now toward the bread room and as they were making their way to the bridegroom some of them have oil and because of that oil they were called wise virgins everybody here that oil existed all along everybody okay as they were still using the first oil the second oil was there all the time he was just not used yet everybody okay everybody okay so the second oil is not something that is just new it is something that was there but it was still dormant it was an oil that was still dormant he was a no that was not used before amen he was and all that was still in the package everybody here as we go through at the edges the first oil was going running running running until a certain time where the Midnight Cry came everybody okay it was the Midnight Cry that a walking the virgin everybody here and we know that a cry was speaking of a message and that shout happened because somebody was speaking so the voice that was crying was a person and that person was a foreigner he was an introducer he was a messenger everybody okay and he was that person everybody okay there are unfolded the second order it was the Cry of the shout of that person that activated I'll put to use or unfolded are revealed or open or initiated or introduced the second oil everybody okay so far everybody good so far glory to God the Bible says that what they want to buy the bridegroom came and they that were water ready went in with his with him to water they were ready because they had the second oil so the second oil is an oil of marriage everybody okay the second oil is an oil of union or an oil of marriage in other words you cannot get married everybody here if you don't have the second oil everybody okay but they want Daddy in this year that this oil is the voice that spoke and that said behold the bridegroom and that voice we know he was a person that was not the bridegroom but he was a person that was introducing the bridegroom everybody okay so far why are you saying that what is going on brother Branham says this very familiar he said now this messenger we went through this of Malachi fall and revelation 10. we talk about man of Cry 4 we reviewed them last Sunday is going to do how many things yes my brother how many fingers two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the heart of the children to water the father so this voice here this man this person this Foreigner anybody care we'll do two things the first thing he's gonna do everybody care he will return everybody care the heart of the children everybody care unto their father yeah everybody Kia the church is far gone the church is far progress but as the church was progressing the church was moving away from the apostolic faith everybody here that was once delivered to the center until by the time we reached out this year we are under a bunch of confusion everybody okay so when the voice comes everybody okay the voice is gonna take the church follow me carefully everybody okay and return to church by in other words that voice turned the church back to its origin everybody okay which is Pentecost everybody okay but that voice does something else according to brother Branham II he will reveal the water this is of the water that gave you your Jubilee in Revelation which are the civilization contained in the seven The Seven Seals were not new everybody okay the Seven Seals were there seized since Genesis all this time they were just sealed everybody here but this Messenger will open the seventh year actually he's not the one opening that person it is the Lamb that opened the book and give it to the messenger so that he can blow the trumpet everybody okay everybody okay so the second thing he does he opened the seven Thunders which are the Revelation contained in the seven water everybody care so the anointing that comes here do two things everybody okay number one he bring you back from your origin everybody okay and number two it will unfold the book but the book here the seventh seal where the seals that were blocking a book because in Revelations 5 we found a man that was sitting with a book in his hand everybody okay and the book will not clearly by the scripture that the book contained Nema if you have a problem you see me everybody okay so when people are at the edges everybody that was in that book was still everybody okay nobody know who he is but when the book is open if I bring you this Bible here everybody okay and I sealed the Bible and I give it to you I say read it are you going to be able to read it everybody okay if I close this Bible I seal it I say brother Benjamin get the book go ahead and read it are you going to be able to read you don't know who is there you don't know which name is there the only way you can read the name you must break the seal you must break your Amazon box so it makes sense we can go home quickly everybody okay when you open your boxer then you can pull your new Bible that you brought on Amazon everybody okay you cannot read your Bible with the Amazon Prime on me I'm making that so we can go quickly you gotta open the box you remove the Box you pull your Bible out then you can open the Bible everybody care and you can see them and you can begin to read the name that is in the book everybody here in other words the opening of the sevenths here all is opening so that God can call the name of his children [Music] everybody Kia hi everybody Kia everybody Kia if you're a soldier my brother-in-law is there if there is no word do they call you did they call you when do you hear people begin to get text messages and say brother so and so then you say here call so and so call so and so cause so and so why do they call military men quickly because of what or because of War anybody okay so if the book is open everybody okay everybody okay and they provide the book to the general everybody here and they said begin to call the name in other words begin to do recruitment everybody here science sir in Georgia I'm here so in Africa I'm here so and so in South America I'm here so and so in North Carolina I'm here what are you recruiting the people for foreign [Applause] why are you here this morning because you had your name what are you doing this morning with long dresses with your uniform honor what are you doing this morning because you heard your name you heard somebody calling you everybody okay everybody okay you say brother Stephen my parents give me a name that is not in the Bible some of you are fortunate Benjamin is in the Bible everybody here if I look brother Charles your name is not in the Bible so what are we going to do but Academia said his name is not in the Bible so let's solve the issue when we speak name how are those names written [Music] everybody okay glory to God brother Branham says this nothing will be saved only those whose water were written on the Lamb's Book of water life when before the foundation of the world you are water gentle see that's all the book hold that water and the book is only water now now each one's name but what the mystery of the book not each one's name not your name as Kalima or Charles that is not your name but here even if your name is Abraham the book won't call you Abraham everybody okay not the name like that but what the water of the book is which is the water you finally understand that now the book does not say water is to be served in the time of these churches or water so it is now your mother's name because the name you after your end and your aunt might be a very difficult woman they give you the name of your grandpa maybe a mean person that is not your name because that is not even your family this is right there is another family that is the family of Heaven and the entire family have one name and the Bible said that the family of Heaven the name of their family is water so if you come from your family what is your name Jesus stage is terrible glory to God everybody okay listen to this brother I'm saying no no no no he don't say that he just shows the Water mystery he afford the mystery or whatever but we ourselves by what we do water you said brother Stephen I'm not sure really if I ever heard my name I am not sure really if I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm just saying that by faith but I'm not really sure buckle up this morning everybody okay everybody okay brother Branham says Satan came to me he said now will you serve him now what do you think about him your daddy did what about how many two weeks in your water arms a doctor kill him with a dose of Medicine say your brother less than a month ago was killed up there on the road and you pick him up and his blood running at his body while we're drunk ran over him then lay your water down in the water and now he's taking your water maybe out of your water say do you still love him how do you know you are an elective everybody okay brother Branham say I say don't he water [Music] I love him despite the trouble you went to amen why do you see serving why do you still love him do you think you just love him like that you can't help it okay foreign [Applause] how are you gonna love him in hell everybody okay brother Brandon says something will happen one day done in my heart he put water and it is water part of me and it's more than I am myself you won't control it there is no height There Is No Death there is no principalities no trial no trouble nothing can ever separate you from the love of God which is in who said brother Stephen has to be alone brother Branham say I know that he is here right now and no water his presence I thought how could that be a water and love the Lord Jesus Christ the way I do let me read it again brother Branham said how could that be a water because they told Brother Branham what is going with you is the devil brother random stop he say enough of this in my heart I still love him how can I be a devil and still love Jesus Christ everybody okay he said how could he be a devil could I be a devil and love the Lord Jesus Christ the way I do how could my heart bleed for him and knows my heart and he came and told me water different if you love Jesus Christ from your heart you are not the stud of a devil everybody here [Applause] open second thessalonia I didn't want to read it oh God let's go quickly I'm following the wind everybody okay everybody okay Oh Glory to God amen amen you there verse eight second called Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 8. let's go quickly there Lord help me Oh Glory to God Lord help me are you there and then shall that Wicked one we know that Wicked one we preach on the seed of the wicked one he revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth you know what he means now and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him that Wicked one who's coming is after the working of who Satan because it's Satan himself incarnated with all power and sun and lying wonders everybody okay with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that do water perish why do they perish because everybody okay they receive not water the love of Truth who is the truth Jesus say I am the way I am the truth and water life so somebody is born with the love of Jesus amen when Peter disappointed him three times he died everybody okay Peter discouraged completely say I am off I don't see how I'm gonna be saved when he appeared maybe Peter was can't avoiding his eyes good morning Master good morning because he knew what he did he said Peter I'm gonna teach you something I don't look at you the way you look in yourself that's it you don't even understand yourself before you did what I did I prayed for you everybody clear when I went to one to thinking about you when I was picking up Abraham and the other one in Paradise I was thinking about you Peter that's the reason why as soon as I resurrected I say go tell my disciple and pity I want to make sure you die everybody okay this is my test do you love me that's it that's what I'm asking you do you love me Peter but here as long as you love me that's all let's go he said because they receive not the love of the that there might be water so for you to be safe you must receive water so how did you get saved how did you get saved what saved you yourself the Bible said it is not of yourself because you're gonna boast it is a gift of God everybody okay verse 11 he said for this cause God shall send them a strong delusion that they should believe a water alive why you don't believe lies you are not meant to believe life everybody here that's why even if something looks very good they give you the story look at this look at this look at this and you are convinced by you when he's done in you something saying that it's like it's fish here that is you [Music] they want that they convince is your brain because that one was built with truth and when nothing is true that's why they brought 400 prophet and the professor and the professor and Jehoshaphat City said you don't have another one in other words something even though the prophet keep preaching he doesn't ring the bell with me everybody okay when they brought Makaya and Makaya to bring that begin to prophesy I assume Jehoshaphat could not hold his chair something begin to Bible like that sounds like the truth that is the truth that is that how do you know it I don't know about something he's telling me this water the truth everybody okay he says this Hallelujah verse 13 he says verse 12 that they may all be them condemned who believe not in what the truth but had pleasure in water but we are do you know that word what it means we are obliged we are under obligation everybody okay we are bound to give thanks to God always for you brethren beloved of the Lord why because God am I reading a different Bible heads from the water beginning shall send you to what through the water of the spirit and belief of water the truth so from the beginning you were wired to receive this message amen come on you don't even understand why you stealing the message you don't even understand why you believe in the message everybody here so when the book comes and the book is open the book is recruiting the Kings everybody okay everybody okay so the message of the hour comes to turn you back to the original and then to recruit the Kings because there is a world that is coming up God needs his army he cannot go to one without you everybody okay when he went to war on Calvary you were in him he was fighting alone now he pull you out of him he said I cannot be myself when I'm saying you saying foreign [Music] [Applause] oh my god let's get moving my friend we found out that God used the spirit of the bear to destroy Babylon everybody okay and if you notice the bear as we explain to you destroy completely the power of America and Destroy also the power of the woman we okay you can remove your seatbelt the altitude is this week if you notice my my cross here you the cross is on the head because that's where the woman sit everybody okay because the bear make war with the and he destroyed the water woman but not the Beast amen everybody okay everybody okay so the woman will be destroyed and America is destroyed because America made the platform for the woman by both America is number 13. we went through that amen and the woman always sits where there is a beast everybody okay but in America the Beast that was there was not the Beast of Rome everybody okay so the Beast of America have to make an image are you following me I'm to the Beast in other words the Beast of America have to raise a platform so that the woman can come and sit brother Branham says this glory to God he says if anything if something was made in my image he had to look like water if something is made in the image of this church he had to look like water the church something was my dead Beast made an image unto this Beast so that he might have to look like water so if the woman look in America and he seen something that look exactly like the Beast guess what everybody okay because somebody already prepared a platform for her everybody okay brother Branham saying which was water methodism baptism Pentecostalism Holiness all the hymns form up into water and made an image just like ant water because the Beast himself is a mixture everybody okay so when America made the platform he opened the door and the woman look he said hey I'm sitting on the Beast the Beast is also there the woman can step in and step on the Beast now America begin to speak like a dragon everybody okay so God raised this power to come and to do what and to destroy the Beast but there is something strange about Russia brother Branham say Russia only received her place in the world in science no more than about 40 years ago everybody okay praise God you take 1964 you remove 40. you want to sit down where you're going toward the first world war you know when the first world war come on they ignore Russia it was just a bunch of water big old Siberian they burned all over the face didn't know they did all over the face and didn't know right and left that's right Russia but she recognized her place she had to do it to fulfill the scripture you know my Prophecies of what I said would happen how all of them will gather into water communism now she led the world in water science who's leading the word in science you think it's America you will be surprised we are way back behind her all the rest of the world is behind her she's lead her place she just recognized she had some brain too brother Branham continue just like Russia did when he went into water and there is where they got the atomic bomb so when the rights are invited Germany they went there and they pick up the scientists that were there all right everybody okay brother random said they got those German scientists because Italy was so strong he got the Jews working for him everybody okay that is why they are so far Advanced today they captured them and took them back up there themselves they did in heaven but they went and got those things just like Nebuchadnezzar did the water just like Nebuchadnezzar went and picked up Daniel and then you begin to work for the kingdom of Babylon the right shall also went to Germany pick up the scientists get there put them in laboratory start working for me can I continue remember there is going to be millions of America meet their Doom what would hinder tonight for this whole nation to be destroyed within five minutes what did PSY say the other night this nation Nationwide broadcast on that we are five years behind what Russia who said that America themselves they got Sputnik and they can put a man into it dozen of them send them up there in sky and move right over this United States and say surrender or go up to power in a few minutes because we will surrender to save our life you say brother Stephen this is hard I can't believe it you believe too much your media one day you will know the truth when God stopped Noah God prophesied it's gonna rain [Music] nobody believed Noah the scientists looking up over there they said there is no water over there but one day when Noah enter into the ark the water begin to fall and destroy the people you hearing one ear you only have one TV with many channels but it's one TV brother up everybody okay you need to change your channel get into Malachi 4 TV tune in to Malachi 4 and you will see the real TV that will show you the true reality of what is happening in the world everybody okay brother random say God has put a son on the wall of her great Rock and Roll Party there is a Sputnik flying to the sky or we thought we had it all didn't we we thought we know it all but Russia according to our own science is five years behind us I mean sorry ahead of us and we were caught up and we are caught up in five years when we are caught up in five years there shall be ten years further the other way God is living an ungodly Nation letting an ungodly people they bear not the realm that took those Jewish scientists up there in Germany and they are far ahead of us we are putting our time to wine is to casinos to women watching naked women in the nightclub and big time and they are working day and night I had to do water there is one thing that could keep them from doing it right now there is only there is not one thing that could keep them from doing it right now but why are they not doing it [Music] Eve was pregnant with Ken and apple amen come on if God destroys the pregnancy he can hurt ever he have to wait for both of them to be born and separated then God can separate can and deal with cancer separately glory to God brother Stephen where are you heading but now when but now the end of the gentle dispensation is here and Russia the communistic has a bomb pointed right towards you to end it don't worry it is coming the Bible said so it shall be there with your name wrote on it my name is not wrote on the bomb my name is wrought on the book of life amen [Music] everybody here he said that it shall go in paddle in one second time the whole nation it will be complete in higher in our lesson notice that is God doing that and no they are a liberty Monarch they are a bunch of hidden but didn't God raise up hidden Nation to straighten up Israel in the days gone by the Bible claims that Russia and communism is playing right into the hand of what God to absolutely read the Earth of water the people which people are we going into it amen this Russia brother Branham say that like Russia trying to unite everybody under one great head communism well communism is right but not forced like that management communism Russia is only a Revival of the devil [Music] like water in other words the correct the communism is the communism that happened on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit come down nobody taught anybody to sell the house they are automatically saw their property and they put everything together so that's all they believe they can share but communism of Russia is not coming from the Holy Ghost it is a man-made communism a perverted communism which is enter God Abraham said Pentecost had a real communism everybody thought everything freely and divided among them and now the government is trying to make everybody in Russia Force everybody and being dominated under a head that is who Russia so Russia even though God is using him to destroy the prostitute and to destroy America God help us get rid of that spirit when it's finished and the way God destroyed Russia he destroyed Russia in conjunction in combo with the Beast together open Daniel 7. we're good in time my friend it's just the way we're riding so if you see an asteroid something you know we're not in the Earth we are somewhere in the universe plus the Milky Way and everything so we pass the cloud are you there let's go to Daniel chapter 7. you there job to verse uh seven listen now carefully Lord help me navigate this quick you there and after this I saw in the night vision and behold the four beasts you remember that Beast is the Beast of Revelation 13. everybody clear with me Daniel could not see how the beach should look like he just said it's a terrible Beast it is John that showed to us that it is the three beasts combined together because the first Beast was a lion the second a bear the third was a leopard all of them combined together which is revelation 13. after this I saw in the night vision and Beyond the forbest Dreadful and terrible we don't know how you look strong exceedingly and had great horns they're great uh eye on teeth which is iron who is the fourth Kingdom which is wrong he devoured and broken pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse different from all the beasts that were before it and he had water according to Daniel this Beast this fourth Beast only have 10 horns follow me carefully according to John he have ten horns and how many heads seven heads but Daniel doesn't speak about the heads brother Branham said God give a revelation and then he add another Revelation not a new revelation but he had more information you remember the code to help you understand and receive it better everybody okay so when they just saw this Beast he saw ten horns when John Luke he saw 10 horns and seven heads we need to put these two together the problem is you don't know how to put them together and it's all over the scripture this Beast and the Beast of John is the same beast but for some reason Daniel didn't see the seven heads how are you going to put them together you need a prophet everybody okay job two verse 8 I consider the horns how many horns do we have and behold there came up among them another leader born how many horns do we have now now we have ten plus one equal eleven holes everybody okay this book is very tactical you say before whom there were three of the first one do what plugged up by the water stop follow me carefully there are ten horns there is another horn that is coming up are you following me but before the horn take place they pulled three rounds out somebody's going quickly everybody okay so before number 11 comes up everybody okay we did 10 minus three equal water seven now we have a pen everybody okay everybody okay now we have a tan and a water seven so this horn when he comes is number one so quick I love this set that was so quick I thought it's gonna be complicated and in the Book of Revelation the Bible said there is seven Kings you remember that and the eighth is the Beast which is part of the seven and Daniel said there is ten horns but if you notice to replace one they're taking how many seven how many six do we have three all right do it in one this Beast is six men six men six three men in one they pull three to put him because he's a trinity everybody okay did I lose somebody if I lost you raise your hand that's how I preach here if I if I let you raise your hand somebody is a little bit shy let me help you up everybody okay there is 10 horns there is another one coming up but before this one take place they took three out in other words this one hunts take the place of three holes because that horn is a trinity of horn everybody okay he's a trinity he needs a space for three so when you take three out you remaining with seven seven plus one you get eight so this horns which is a trinity once is number eight which is a beast in Revelation everybody okay everybody okay I just did this you're not gonna fall okay so I'm back this way let's continue he says everybody okay blood that from the root and behold in this horn where what like the eyes of a water so this horn is water do you see how quick how easy the thing is follow me carefully now Daniel is saying that there is a beast everybody okay everybody okay and this Beast has a man on him can I go back to our reading this morning there is a beast everybody okay and this Beast was giving a water and a person which is a false prophet which is there everybody okay let's go back again any question let's continue and my mouth mouth do you see how Daniel and John are saying the same thing you gotta know how to navigate everybody okay and they're giving him a map remembering Revelation they give the best they give him him and mouth speaking water great things let me go back again here you remember I told you in Revelation they give him a mouth-speaking water so what are we looking at everybody okay speaking great things job to verse 11. no yes job to verse 11. yes and I beheld then because of the voice of the great word which the water because the Ron is a person I behaved even till the Beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning water flame so they didn't see you don't see a woman here everybody okay the Bible said this Beast that carried the horned everybody okay this one which is a man the Beast was destroyed when they destroyed that Beast they put him where they were his flaming burning family or fire everybody okay job to verse 14 then we hurry quickly you there and there was giving him dominion and glory and the kingdom to all the people nation and language should serve him his Dominion is Everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed everybody okay jump to verse uh [Music] job to verse 19 so I can go quickly and I will know that you say I want to know a little bit about this Beast the truth about the phobias which he was diverse from the other one exceeding Dreadful whose teeth were iron and he's now out of brass which devour broken pieces stamped the residue with his feet listen carefully now and of the ten horns that were in his head and of the one which came up before whom three fell even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that speak very great things whose look was more Stout than his what fellow so that horn is a person it's a fellow everybody okay he's a king number eight he's part of the seven everybody okay everybody okay I beheld look at this horn number eight made one with the same let's go back again to our reading this morning watch he makes war with the in Revelation 13. everybody okay scripture don't play with word makes one with the scent and Prevail against them in Revelation they say he will overcome them anybody okay until the Ancients of thee came and judgment was given to the water to descent you there my brother to the scent of the most high and the time that they sent and the time came that the same possessed the Water Kingdom so the Judgment the Ancient of Days coming not himself he's coming with the sand the beasts are against the lamb and his everybody okay job to verse 24 3. and he said the fourth Beast shall be the fourth Kingdom upon the Earth which shall be diverse from all Kingdom and shall Devour the whole earth and shall tread it and break it in pieces and the ten horns watch now not the Beast not the Beast not the Beast I'm gonna about to go back again we have the Beast we have the woman and the horns now we're talking about the ten horns no more the seven horns and the tenons out of the king and then out of his kingdom are Ten Kings that shall IRAs and another shall arise after them he shall be diverse from the first and shall subdue Three Kings and he shall speak great words against the most high that is the eighth horns amen and shall wear out to the scent of the most high and think to change time it's a demonic Spirit my friend things to change times and the laws and this shall be given into his hand until a time and times and a divided a time but judgment shall sit and he and they shall take away his Dominion the Dominion of that horn to consume and to destroy it to the water and so this horn amen we got the Beast everybody okay the beasts have a horn and this horn also which is a man will be also destroyed to the end Amen to destroy something to the end you need the Lake of Fire let's go to Revelation 19 now we're riding out pretty good now quickly so we go let's go to revelation 19. what we saw in Kenya is that the Beast by the flame and also the horn he is the Beast the Beast and the horn which is the first prophet you don't see the woman there everybody okay Revelation chapter 19 if you dare you can say Amen now follow me carefully job to verse 11. and I saw heaven open and Beyond the white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and do what so the Lamb of so make world when he makes War he's a lion everybody okay I'm going slowly jump to verse 14. and the armies so he's not alone which were we in heaven the Army were aware Heaven the Army was away remember the other beasts get the Beast the king of the Earth but we are not the king of the earth we comes from Heaven and the Army which were in heaven follow him upon one horses white horses cloth in Finland and white and water we know which is the bread we already went through this everybody okay and out of his mouth goes up a sharp Soul if his mouth is speaking shop soon walk on the weapon would his army have the spoken word oh nobody okay and that he should Smite the nation and he shall rule them with a road of iron and thread the one press of the fairness of the wrath of almighty God everybody okay and he has on his vesture on his thigh and name written what king of water so who are following him and we are not only Kings but if he is Lord we are also Lord everybody okay now watch carefully verse 17 and I saw an angel standing in the Sun and he cried we fill out voice sending invitation saying to all the fows that fly in the midst of Heaven Come and gather yourself together to the supper of the greater in other words we're going to give you some food that you may eat the it's an evening time it's a supper it is not a dinner it's an evening time we okay now that you may eat the Flesh of water yes the Flesh of Kings remember that and the Flesh of Captain and the Flesh of Mighty Men and the Flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the Flesh of men that free and born both small and great and are so the Beast follow me carefully and the king of the water Earth the beast when he makes War he makes war with the king of the Earth everybody okay the beast when he makes War he makes war with the Kings of the Earth because you're gonna see it sooner amen the kings of the earth and the Army gathered together everybody okay to make war with him that sat on a horse and against his water at the beginning in Revelation 17 we found that communism makes war with the lamb and the bread everybody okay now we found that the king the Beast makes us a war with the lamb and his brother so the Beast and the bear both of them will attack you and our King that's why buff this power are destroyed together because they unite to attack the lamb and the brother everybody okay 20 and the Beast was taken and with him the water false prophet that wrote Miracle before him which deceived them that deceived the mark of the beast and them that worship the image they were both casts alive into the lake burning with water remember in the river there in Daniel 7 they took both of them and they put them into the not the woman the woman is destroyed by the bear but the one who destroyed the Beast and the bear and the false prophet that is Christ and me and you everybody okay where are you heading brother Stephen this is where we're heading let's go to Revelation 16 now glory to God so brother Branham saying come Satan with all four corners of the Earth and he's Catholic and all together marching right up to the Battle of water Armageddon so the battle of Armageddon is not only Russia coming no it is Russia and the Beast buff are coming against Jerusalem everybody okay let's go now to revelation 16. when we look at Revelation 19 we don't see Russia we see the Beast so where is Russian Armageddon Revelation 16 if you dare you can say Amen okay let's hurry verse 12 and the sixth Angel pull out this vow upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof were dried up that the way of the king of the Earth somebody's not sleeping the way of the king of the water if you notice the Euphrates the Euphrates is opening the way to the king of the East not the king of the Earth scripture don't play with word can I erase this can I erase this now we found out that the Euphrates the Beast the Beast uses the Beast uses the Kings of the Earth that is not clear everybody okay but one day you Freight is dried up amen he opened the way to the Kings off the east everybody okay so we got two group here I'm going slowly we got the Eastern King everybody clear and another group that work with the Beast this both of them are attacking together and they are attacking the lamb and his brother we okay now when we say the king of the East what do we mean brother Branham says this before I go forward let me clarify this there is a battle called The Battle of go get Magog in Revelation 20. that battle we saw that it happened after the millennium and the Prisoner there is the devil they take the devil and put him in the flake of fire where the Beast and the false prophet are but the name of that battle is called Gog and Magog in Revelation I want you to clarify that everybody okay now the king of the East brother Branham say we found out that the angel poured out his vowel upon the Euphrates even and he dried up and the King of the North might come down and I think what that will actually be will be at the end time when they come into water and they have to come right through water and get into it right down through them countries they shall have to cross the Euphrates to get in there brother Branham say see making way for the king of the noise to come down there Kings so brother Brown I'm saying the king of the East God Russia in plus other kings why is China teaming up with Russia everybody okay the king of the East everybody okay brother Branham said they shall die shall be take place during the time of the battle of water Armageddon now we found out that when the Euphrates is drying up amen he opened the way to the king of the East the Bible says this that when the Great river Euphrates when the poor Deva they were the thereof did water what is water in the Bible let's go slowly now what is water in the Bible tongues and Nation everybody okay so if you are waiting for one day maybe it might happen naturally that the Euphrates will dry completely and open the way and then you begin to see the king begin to March good luck because Revelation is the book of symbols everybody okay Wonder in the scripture represent what people and when they pour the vowel on Euphrates the people dried up what is Euphrates William Marion brother Branham speaking about the sixth trumpet he says it was spiritual horses spiritual devils charges that had been bound in water all these years Supernatural water these are the Devils that were killing people here through Hitler and Mussolini and the other one everybody okay brother Brian I'm saying why was it the old Roman water empire being what revived the persecution of water there has been bound for nearly two thousand years at the river water can't cross to the water a religious water so Euphrates this is not the river you think there it is a church everybody okay and that was trying to get to the other side you freighted you know they come through Eden but they were born there 2 200 000 devil of water persecution brother Branham says that the euphrate this river is the Catholic Church I know everybody okay but when the poor deviled on the Catholic Church the Catholic Church began to lose people you're following me to make way for the king of the north Russia to move in where did the Catholic people lost to people brother Branham says this but the churches themselves has become rich pretty near the wealth of the world says the Bible lays in the Water Catholic Church that is why Russia run her out sure did yes right that's exactly why Russia excommunicated that is why what that was the very grassroot of water because the church thought to be something there was no more from the rest of the water so what happened is the Catholic Church grew in Russia everybody okay and something happened to the Catholic church in Russia and for some reason they ran them out the water of Euphrates begin to dry it out everybody okay when the Catholic Church left Russia the communism begin to rise in Russia that was the King of the North now rising up and taking the whole nation of Russia under control because they pushed the Beast out everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay the king of the earth and of the East drop down to verse 13. and I saw three unclean Spirit like frog came out of the mouth of water the dragon you tired out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the Beast out of the mouth of the first water a trinity of spirit daily for their Spirit of water you okay brother it's cutting off yeah you can change his microphone they are Spirit of the devil working water which God forth to the king of the water [Music] everybody will say okay this unclean Spirit don't go to the king of the East can I read it again can I read it again I'm trying to situate you in Prophecy the three unclean spirit that you Freight is dried without the frogs it's The Vow that dried the Euphrates River making way for the king of the East everybody okay but the Frog are now responsible for the king of the East they are responsible for the king of the Earth messed up everybody okay everybody okay so now we have two the world is divided into right right you're gonna understand your word what happened amen I don't know where I put it amen let me go this and then I get it for their Spirit of devils working Miracle which go forth to the king of the earth and the whole earth world to gather them to water the Battle of that great day of God water Almighty so the tree unclean spirits are going recruiting the army of the Beast because the tree unclean Spirit comes from the Beast from the first prophet and from the dragon amen so they are recruiting the Army for the Beast and the king of the East are working with Russia everybody okay because it's Russia and the Beast coming to the battle Russia doesn't come himself he have to pack his bodies the Beast also have to pack his body everybody okay but in order for the Beast to recruit his people the Beast must open a new Trinity in order for God to recruit his people God have to open a new oil everybody okay that oil was there all along he was waiting for the right time the the Frog also where they are all along we are heading towards something brother Branham says this he says notice the three unclean spirits come out of the mouth of the Beast do you know that the unclean Spirit like frogs did you ever notice how a frog looks a frog is always looking what backwards he never look water forward looking water back always back look bad but the four beasts that have the four different heads in Ezekiel yeah the four creature when they're moving they always go out forward what are you trying to say about Stephen brother Branham saying notice it's three unclean Spirit he said Trinity of spirit a trinity of frog a frog is an animal that always look backwards he never looks where he's going he looks where he comes from I'm going slowly the second Trinity and the second all the second Trinity the new Trinity that comes does also two things the second oil does two things number one is that's water [Music] oh wow are you okay are we okay are we okay they are turning you away and then they do what they open the seventh seal to do water recruitment the new Trinity also when he opened he have to look first way [Music] we have the devil answer everybody okay and then he looks back it's also returning the people back just like Malachi 4 is returning everybody okay don't you see where was Trinity uh where was uh trinitarianism Bonnet remember these three unclean Spirit individual spirit let me Rush quickly so we can go they look back to the nursing Council where the Trinity Doctrine was born there is no such a thing they look back to the nursing Council in Asia Rome where the Trinity were born we also look back to Pentecost where the church was born and the Trinity of frog came out of the earth Trinity giving birth to a water you Trinity the mother amen he said there was there when all the time but he was not manifested until between the six and the water just before the water seals opened everybody okay the second oil was there all the time but that whole could not be unfolded because God knew what the devil would do at the end so God preserved that all until at the certain time when the devil opened up God also open up that's why brother Branham said that when hell poor Down Heaven also poured down [Music] is coming up to return the heart back to the origin and to open the thunder so that he can read the name and recruit the Army the other one is coming back also recruiting his children bringing them back where they came from to go back to their mother and also preparing the king of the earth to go into the battle while the Thunder are preparing the king of Heaven to God so in the battle everybody okay glory to God Lord help me see if I can skip some of them come on man we already got this let me skip some of them so we can go quickly brother Branham said notice now they are right now United you say brother Branham is that true they are coming to the Battle of water I'm beginning exactly what they will do they are united for the right now for that right now that is why we got the U.N and everything we have the water Western World United against the water Eastern world the Western world is United under the Beast and the Eastern word is United under Russia that's why you see the war in Ukraine the Western world is with Ukraine and the NATO and China and the other one are patting themselves up they are preparing for the Buddha but God also is recruiting everybody okay brother Brandon said the Wilson World Unite against the Eastern World communism and so forth It's all United together the church has also our water United again everything seems to be water United uniting uniting themselves we see that somebody is backing up somebody's packing up God also is packing up so we're gonna go to the funnel testing everybody okay and we know that in Daniel chapter 11 we found that Russia came right there and Russia came as a whirlwind we saw that to the battle of Armageddon I'm trying to rush because of my time I don't know if I can get go get my God Amen now brother Branham says this he said now this is not the Lord speaking this is your brother brother Brian I mean the best of my knowledge we already know this Paul say I'm not the one to the Lord speaking just remember this and watch it close we are for we are in for the enter what's geographically where your war is coming out watch the GOG up there coming down down in water turkey the battle will not settle in Korea but over there in water Palestine therefore we found out its communism is gathering together God said that who and my god there will gather together and bring about the water that is exactly true because it's going to bring these forces together he has to come the Bible said he will how is God get my God again going to Armageddon if God and Magog is a different battle you have 15 minutes open Ezekiel 38. if we can go quick so we wind up Ezekiel 38 if you dare you can say Amen I skipped something in Revelation 16 you will see that after the king of after the Beast is recruiting the people the next verse the Bible says behold I come as a thief in Revelation 16. in other words and then the Bible goes after that and say they're bringing them to the battle of Armageddon did you see that keep your finger here let's go to Revelation 16. I rather you have that and you will see something you there go to revelation 16.

won't meet you here we will first go up do you see that he said be all that come answer see blessed is he that does water watch him and keep if his government lest he walk water which Edge is walking naked in other words be when the beasts begin to recruit we are in laodicea I will come first to pick up my blood to take her home and to have some dinner with her for three and a half years when we dance so much until we are drunk with new wine then we wake up from there and we're coming back again everybody okay everybody okay what's now verse 16 and he gathered them together into air so they won't Gather in that place before the rapture so no matter what is going on with Russian Ukraine nothing will happen it is just setting the things in Emotion but nothing will happen because we are still here everybody here we must go out first then when we are out they're gonna gather together in the place called what Armageddon when they gather together we must make sure all of them are there

jump on our horses what to do buckle up and hit the airport I got inspired now many of them the lion of Babylon it was a lion with the wings of an eagle and we found out that the wings of the ego was the one blocking the Incarnation everybody here what are the wings of the ego the Bible say in Exodus 19 I carry you away on the on the ego Wings brought you unto myself carried them on Eagle wings and brought you onto water myself brother Branham say but what he carried them on ego now God always liking his Prophet toward so the Eagle wings are a prophet everybody care Moses was his messenger and they were following Moses and that was eager water and that they were carrying on because he was packing God water so the Eagle wings at the wings God used to pack his people with everybody okay brother Branham says this I'm heading to the airport now brother Branham says this he says as he was in the day of Noah so shall he be in the coming of the son of man they were eating they were doing what my brother drinking and doing water giving to marriage as he was in the day of love so shall he be in the hour when the son of man shall be watered not the son of God no more but the water son of

used to touch it the guy used to clicks the eagle anointing when he comes he will rock the boat amen hey everybody here and then he worked the eagle up and what he does he uses his wings to flatter he takes a big wind [Music] and blow into the nest and the reason why it's blowing brother Branham said it's to take the loose feather out everybody here so when you going through a ladder blowing another trial a lot of difficulty don't worry the Eagle wings are just removing your crybaby feather everybody here something happened you cry something happened you cry something happened oh my God

like a water so we have a lion and an eagle combined together Revelation 10 is a lion roaring but with ego Wings in other words we got the answer to Babylon we can fight him as a lion and we can fight him as an eagle we will fight him as a lion with the Thunder and when times comes on WE flop the wings of a eagle and we out of this world let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father once again thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for the safety that is in this message that now we understand that we don't have to be troubled nothing will happen as long as we hear we have to leave this earth than the war and whatever need to be started even the tribulation can never set as long as we are in this world father that's why you send the wings of the ego so that we can be packed and be removed and the dragon will make war to the remnant of the seed of the woman which is the foolish virgin but Lord father it's only for a time until Moses and Elijah finish the ministry then father we will come back with you again now to meet both the bear and the peace together in the battle of Armageddon to settle the deal father thank you for opening this and if anybody doesn't have their life line up so that they are in this Tabernacle in this holiest time connected with this oil that they know for sure that all it takes is for you to move and then we will be meeting you into the air May Lord father they found a way this morning coming Lord father into the cross and making sure that their life are in order and they're ready any times before anything trouble that we will go May the church Focus on what belongs to them and you because there is nothing that will trouble us all that is taking place is the setting of the things but it won't happen Armageddon won't start because Moses and Elijah are not here they can start a war they can continue with the world they just putting things in place showing the separation of the Eastern world and the Western world but until we hear we are now the blood that is all protecting and blocking the Wrath of the night until we live here then there is no more Blood On The Mercy Seat then whoever is staying will be staying traumatized into the tribulation period but we know that we are not called for the tribulation period we heard our name in the Lamb's Book of Life that's why we heard father came back when we heard the wrong calling father will raise their hand we say here we are Lord prepare us father over our lives flooding over our homes take everything that is loose that can be a trouble or a hindrance to our wings Lord so that we can be totally free and ready for the flight we thank you and commit everything
