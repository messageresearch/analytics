might be seated we have a baby dedication so welcome to spoken word tabernacle we need more babies it's a blessing praise the lord the father is not here he's still back home in the congo lord's willing down the road he will be coming and joining his wife here but the baby is born he is an american and mama is here i have to communicate back and forth with daddy to make sure i got a written permission to dedicate the baby and to make sure everything is lined up in the world if you would for those who are interested mark chapter 10 before the dedication you might be wondering why are we doing this thank you very much you can you know what we're gonna sing bring them in you okay with that okay didn't know i was under training a living word tabernacle mark chapter 10 verse 13 and they brought young children to him how many listen to the sermon on wednesday okay praise the lord so you will understand this and they brought the young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said to them hello the little children remember elijah john the baptist have to bring the faith of the father to the children and that faith we found out that it was jesus christ and in the teaching of jesus christ when he's teaching he's referring to the children he's pointing them to the children everybody there i love the little children to come to me and forbid them not for us of such is the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whatsoe whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a leader child the faith to the children he shall not enter therein verse 16 and he took the map in his arm put his hands upon them and blessed them so that's the reason why we're going to take ludo lemuel and we will be blessing him this morning the lord give us this gift and we're going to take it and we turn it back into the hand of god because the bible say that whoever is in the hand of god no one can plug them off so we want to place our children in the hand of god knowing in the promise that nobody can go there and plug them off even though the devil must seems like he's benefiting them but the one who is in control is jesus christ so sister benita you can bring the baby [Music] here [Music] me bring the little [Music] amen praise the lord that's my first time to see him and carry him hey buddy he's doing great so if you would this is not a one-man work remember we are in this together so you all need to pray with me amen i sent daddy the link so probably he should be online watching what's going on if somebody can god bless your sister you can take a picture so we can send it to that let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you this morning father thanking you for giving us a gift a bundle of love lord father because we know that life cometh from the lord father you have given this child in a difficult time when the pandemic was healing left and right lord father but you didn't stop your blessing you send this baby lord to be a blessing for this family and for the church lord father as you give it to us lord father this family and our pastor and the pastor and this congregation lord we are returning this baby unto the hand lord we pray in the name of jesus christ that the blood of the lamb covered this child completely lord father may the holy spirit be always lord father watching and guiding the life of this baby father we commit lemuel i am to the hand lord father may you bless him lord then anoint him lord father we remember in your word that you failed john the baptist with the holy spirit from his mother's womb lord father if you did it in the womb of a man the lord how much more when a baby is born lord father that's why we ask lord because of the blood that was shared on calvary that lord father you the god that filled your temple lord here is another temple this morning lord may you feel this baby lord may the angel that you have ordained lord to watch over the life of this baby be always lord father mindful lord and be with this baby wherever he's going whether to the doctor where the lord father somewhere or my may be lord father go into a different place may the holy spirit always overshadow this baby we rebuke every demonic spirit lord made the pillar of fire that stood between the camp of israel and lord father the camp of egypt lord may that same pillar of fire with the bride today lord step in between every sickness lord every trouble lord every juvenile delinquency lord and this the lord may this be a talk and an example lord that you don't always lord father lose everybody but you always have a witness lord father may you give wisdom to mama may you give wisdom to daddy lord may he bring this child lord father into the fear and admonition of the lord father we will commit this child unto the hand knowing lord father that whoever is in your hand lord no one can pluck them up lord father we claim it lord in the name of jesus christ in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen god bless you thank you very much sister he's a quiet baby praise the lord if you would now let's turn to the preaching of the word in deuteronomy chapter 18. on wednesday i hope all the young people here because the devil has been targeting the young people with this computer and this website and all kinds of things this age of reasoning i hope the young people were able to look at the sermon on wednesday on wednesday the heart of the father to the children normally i was supposed to take the heart of the children today to the father but we might do that next sunday there is something we need to make sure we log we we put it pretty good so when we go with the heart of the father or the children to the father it will be clear deuteronomy chapter 18 verse 15. if you dare you can say amen praise the lord the lord your god will raise up to you this is moses giving to israel a prophet from the midst of you of your brethren you might be seated so moses is talking to israel that there is a promise for them and we saw on wednesday that according to the promise of god god promised them to send them the messiah and in the book of uh genesis the messiah was the seed of the woman then isaiah down the road came down he said it's going to be a man it's going to be a son it's going to be a child a man child and he gave us his title counselor prince of peace mighty god and all these tithes that we know together but here in deuteronomy chapter 18 which will be our main focus today before we go to the heart of the children back to the father this is this will be our main focus today the lord told me to go with one point at a time and i want to acknowledge brother caillou he's with us this morning [Applause] good to see you brother kyle i didn't know you were coming so i told him we need to work together so to have him here to preach for us because we believe in a 5-4 ministry lord's willing if everything goes well on wednesday we will have brother aaron mcgeary to preach for us here on wednesday then i will pick it up on sunday amen so if you can let's make sure we're in the house of god i know everybody is in fear of coronavirus but we are going to work we spend more time at work than a church so if you put a mask going over there also you can come here and put a mask are you there somebody might say brother stephen but if your faith is not there yet you can stay at home and continue to streaming i am not condemning anyone but i'm encouraging if you can just make it to church so it will be a support for our brother amen now uh deuteronomy 18 he said the lord your god will raise up to you a prophet so moses is giving us a description here that this man this messiah that will be coming will be a prophet everybody clear and he saved from the midst of you of your brethren so that prophet will be a jew by nature right from the tribe of judah but there is a mystery connected to that of your brethren like unto me this is the key we're going to be dealing with it today a prophet like unto me unto me who is me so this prophet will be in a caliber of moses are you there if you miss this you're gonna have a trouble down the road are you there so a prophet like unto me to him you shall hearken so this prophet will be like moses what does it mean to be like moses and when he comes everybody must hear him you must harken unto him everybody there verse 16 according to all that you desire of the lord your god in horeb we already explained this that's why in malachi 4 the bible say remember the law of moses him because in arab israel say we don't want god to talk to us from now on we want god to talk to us through a prophet so god say according to what you desired in arab i'm gonna send you a prophet but that prophet will be in the caliber of moses and we know that prophet is jesus christ which is higher than moses but his caliber is like unto moses so you need to look what is in moses are you there and make sure whatever was in moses was in christ we clear now in horeb the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god neither let's let me see this great fire anymore so there was a fire there there was the voice of the lord in horup there and something happened israel say we don't want to hear it anymore so in malachi 4 when they say remember the law they're not telling you that moses is coming moses is coming to the jewish people but god is reminding you like go back to oreb and remember what happened in aurib behold i will send you elijah prophet i'm sending you a prophet why because you requested that if i want to speak to you i must talk to you through a prophet are we clear okay praise the lord uh verse 17 and the lord said to him they have well spoken that which they have spoken i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like to you why is this prophet like moses and will put my word in his mouth and he shall speak to them all that i have i shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken so you must heal the prophet that's why in mont transfiguration the voice came he said behold behold who might hear what hear ye him because you must hear this prophet everybody clear okay hearken to my word which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him in other words if you don't listen to this prophet you're going to be dealing with god everybody clear okay so we our theme what we are dealing with is a prophet like unto moses you must understand this then when we take returning the heart of the children to the father everything is clear everybody there so today we are dealing now we are entering into brother brother we finished john the baptist part one two three now it's brother branham let's go to luke chapter 18. so young people go back and look at part 15 16 17 it's clearing john the baptist but we found out the spirit of john the baptist preached marriage and divorce the spirit in john the baptist have questioned and answered the spirit in john the baptist preached the serpenty are you there we prove to you all of that let's go to luke 18. sometimes the devil thinks he's doing something he just triggered a different anointing luke 18 chapter 7 and shall not god avenge his own elect he's talking about the elect remember people are saying malachi 4 is for the jewish the 144 000 that's wrong you go to revelation seven the hundred and forty four thousand are servant they are not children are we there and shall not avenge his own elect so this is the elect if he was not positive he should deceive the e let if he was not you see that we're talking about the elect the elect which cried there and not to him do he bear long with them verse 8 i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh so there is a coming of the son of man shall he find faith on earth it is telling you that faith will be destroyed so the son of man is worrying not to help his children but his worrying is when i come should i find faith so somebody must be there to restore faith back are we there praise the lord let's go to galatians 3. this is a refreshing for wednesday and then we will be praying you need your bible with you galatians 3 if you dare you can say amen verse 23 but before faith comes faith was not there faith came we explained this on wednesday are you there before faith came we were kept under the law so when jesus christ came jesus was faith that's why john the baptist has to take the father and point them to jesus christ which was the theft praise the lord we were kept shut up uh verse 23 under the law shut up to the faith which should afterward be revealed in christ verse 24 wherefore the law was a school master to bring us to christ everybody there that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come after jesus christ come everybody there we are no longer under the school master we are no longer under the law for you are all children you see now it's not dealing with jews only now it's children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into christ how do you baptize into christ by one spirit we are all baptized that's why john say i cannot do it but one is coming that person will baptize you with the holy ghost the lord will enter his temple suddenly we're now clear on that have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew that jewish dispensation is completely over there is neither jew nor greek there is neither born nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus and if you be christ then you are abraham seed abraham was before israel you see now abraham's seed and hair according to the promise i want you to go to verse 14 if you can that the blessing of abraham might come under gender through jesus christ that faith that we might receive the promise of the everybody clear now the firmness of the spirit through what so faith have to come to open the door for the holy ghost to enter not only to the jewish people but also to the gentile are you there we've seen that jesus was the temple of god but in the day of pentecost they also saw 120 temple in the old testament when the pillar of fire came he deviated the people and anointed the temple but when the sacrifice the prophet sacrificed the lamb was crucified when that same pillar of fire came down into the same temple he deviated the temple now we went to 120 people why the blessing of abraham now can be given to the gentile everybody clear so far now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us lord father here you have given us another opportunity to gather together lord before the coming of the lord to take your children all the way lord home father we were rebuking every demonic spirit everything that can bring your children to an atmosphere of destruction or lord father sleepness or all kinds of things lord that is contrary to your word father we rebuke it from this place to the dry places in the name of jesus christ lord as a shepherd i ask forgiveness lord forgiveness for myself and forgiveness for your children if there is anything in our life that we did that might block the blessing or clog a channel this morning lord may you forgive us lord may the channel of heaven be completely open lord and may your spirit be outpoured again this morning lord changing the life of your children sealing your children healing your children stabilizing opening the eyes lord father in the name of jesus christ may the holy spirit may the inside teacher come down lord may you open and unveil and reveal your word to your children in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all we greet you all in the name of jesus christ and we appreciate every visitor this morning now on part we are now dealing with part 18 the unchanging pattern of god as we stated we are placing the basis everybody can see the screen clear now in the message absolute brother bradham say in the day that we are living in now and everything is so breaking up so fragile and carried away and i think that this message absolute will be a very appropriate thing especially to christians when they are going through their deep waters now the christian church is passing through the deepest water it's head for the last 2000 years because we are coming to a spot to where there is something presented to christianity something they have to make a decision on it's a message and i think that the christian church ought to have something that they know that they are tied to instead of just floating about like a leaf upon the water the wind as the bible say carried about with every wind of doctrine the wind comes and blows the leaf the little leaf this way and then another wind comes another wind comes the north wind the suffering the east wind the west wind you shall never get anywhere you are not stable are you there so there are trouble that are coming troubling the water we must make sure we are tied up to something that is solid and there is nothing solid but crust everybody clear so the christian life should be a stable life it should be something that's a principle that you are tied to it that is more than life itself that's why we are clarifying this to make sure you understand why we need the message what was the purpose of the message and why we need to be tight and hooked and connected to the message of the hour now on wednesday we seen that israel had seven church ages if you miss this you need to go listen to the tab and we found also that the gentile have also seven church ages and we prove to you in the bible and by the quote of brother branham that israel in the wilderness was the church of god just like the gentile also was to have a church it was the church of god now when the church of israel started it started with a prophet called moses and when the church of the gentile also started it started with a prophet called paul and we know that paul brother branham explained to us that he was our modern moses everybody clear moses met the pillar of fire paul met the pillar of fire moses wrote the books paul also wrote the books are you there but we found out that toward the end of the gentile of the jewish dispensation there is a spirit of elijah that came down and that elijah was called john the baptist and we prove to you also through the seal and through the series that there is also a spirit of elijah coming to the gentile before the coming of the lord moses prophesy about the coming of the lord and paul also prophesy about the coming of the lord but before the lord comes elijah must come before the lord comes again elijah must come before the lord comes to israel elijah also must again come because god does not change he's the same yesterday today and forever so the church of israel was under the dispensation of the lord but the church of the gentile was under the dispensation of grace and we explained on wednesday that even though israel was still under the dispensation of the law because of the fact that spirit don't die the nicolet and spirit attack the jewish church you remember the sermon on wednesday and the nicolet and spirit attacked and entered through the elder because before the death of moses moses called the elders and told them that i know after my departure you guys are gonna leave the faith and paul also before he dies he called the elder and he said before i leave i know that you're gonna depart from the faith and we found out that in the days of samuel when samuel started over there the elder came they waited until the prophet's son commit arrow and they took opportunity by the era of the prophet son to reject samuel it is the same spirit today people usually have a tendency to attack jeffersonville to attack the prophet son and to use that reason in order to depart or to reject the brother branham and the prophet the bible explained to us that when they rejected samuel god said that it is not samuel that you are rejecting you are actually rejecting me everybody clear so when the spirit begin to work in israel israel asked that they want to be like other nations they don't want to be like the message of the hour the message of the hour is too hard for them the message of the hour is too tight from them they want to be like the nomination they want to be on tv they want to wear pants they want to do all kinds of stuff like the other women and they want and they took opportunity to bring it to samuel like they are really concerned about the children of samuel but they were not concerned about the children of samuel they were just trying to introduce another kingdom and reject the messiah kingdom that was overruling upon them everybody clear so since that spirit entered went through the church ages through ahab through jezebel keep going all the way before jesus christ came israel was completely divided into many denominations are you there moses gave them only one book of the law are you there but before jesus christ came they have the sadducees they have the pharisees they have the rehearsian this one doesn't believe the angel this one doesn't believe the resurrection this one doesn't believe this and this is until israel was completely lost but god already tested a ministry in the old testament which is the ministry of elijah it is a ministry that is specialized into bringing the heart of a nation of a people and bring that heart back again to god that's why elijah must come but this elijah was john the baptist to take the heart of the father the father were pharisee the father were scrabbled they were herodian they were sadducees all kind of denomination and bring the father back again to the faith are you there and we found the same thing in the church ages where paul spoke about the grievous wolf which was the same spirit of the antichrist now we know it's the anticlass because the seals are broken but when israel was battling with it they didn't know what was going on are you there so that spirit started again and before the second coming of the lord we found out that we have more than 900 denominations in america we have presbyterian we have baptists we have methodists we have catholics we have oneness we have two nurses we have three nuts until everybody is confused so another elijah must come to return the heart of the children back to the faith everybody clear but we found out that before the coming of john the baptist the holy spirit was already moving into the land when he moved he moved into the family of zechariah he moved into the family of elizabeth he moved into the family of simeon he moved into the family of anna but when the holy spirit was moving there the holy spirit was filling them and they were prophesying the holy spirit was not sealing them because it was not the time of the sealing of the holy spirit the holy spirit was only activating the gift of the spirit that's why when if you notice when simeon went into the temple simeon was giving only a promise that he will see the messiah before his death in other words simeon was under the anointing of death are you there he's going to experience the messiah he's going to see the messiah but after seeing the baby born he's gonna die are you there which is the pentecostal spirit of the shark it is a spirit that carries the baby it is a spirit that carries the seed but after a while it must be church from the seed and die into denomination and let the seed continue to grow so the move of the spirit is only for the restoration of their gift that's why in azusa street when the pentecostal movement starts brother branham said that movement came to restore the gift of the spirit but that was not the thing because elijah must come and when elijah come elijah will introduce the messiah and when he introduced the messiah he's going to bring the faith back again to the first day original faith are you there so the move of the spirit in henna all of them was just to activate gift that's why if you check the bible you will see and elizabeth begin to prophesy and simeon begin to profess her and anna begin to prove all of them and i was a prophetess it was a gift of the spirit which is a similar anointing on the pentecostal people the holy spirit was moving but that was not the true restoration it was just to restore or to quicken the gift of the spirit until faith came and when the faith came we found out that faith was crushed are you there now the key is this before we move on because we were trying to find out what is that faithful on wednesday we explained first of all that that faith was the restoration of the baptism of the holy spirit are you there because john the baptist have a message repentance what the baptism about and also the holy ghost and he pointed to them and the first one who was baptized and the holy ghost enter and seal him was the lord jesus christ are you there and on the day of pentecost when peter came out peter took now the prescription of john and begin to upgrade the prescription he said john said to be baptized but john didn't have a name so the baptist must be in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin so he have to upgrade the prescription and that promise was unto you and to your children and as many as the lord your god shall call so the coming of jesus christ opened the door for the genuine baptism of the holy ghost into the believer that was the original faith so if we go back to the faith we must go back to the genuine baptism of the holy ghost are you there all right now this is the problem brother brown i'm saying in the message cross the mystery of god with you brother branham said that god had a threefold purpose he said the first purpose was he have to reveal himself in christ which he did in the river of jordan the spirit of the lord entered there and then christ began his ministry then brother branham said the second reason we have to have preeminence into his blood in his church which is the body the bread still he could have preeminence to express himself through them and we found out that in the day of pentecost the holy spirit came and entered into the church are you there but the third reason here the brother branham said that thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adam so if we cross this just like that we're gonna be missing something but let me drop this and then i'm going to explain it to you adam had two things i want you to understand this very good because adam fell and when jesus christ came jesus had to restore everything that adam fell but you need to understand what did adam have are you there you can go to somebody you say give me my stuff what is your stuff are you there you must know that you need this this and this and be very specific are we clear so adam in the garden of eden first of all there was the tree of life which was connected to eternal life are you there so this tree of life when adam sinned the way to the tree of life was blocked are you there because god requires a penalty somebody must die a lamb must die in order to redeem and to open up the way but we found out that through the law lambs were dying over and over and nothing happened until in the time of john the baptist then john luke he said behold the lamb of god that take away the sin of the world and when jesus christ came and died the veil of the temple was whipped together opening the way to the tree of life i am the way i am the life and i am the truth are you there that's number one that one was restored that's the reason why we have access to the baptism of the holy ghost that's why when the mother of the son of zebedee asked jesus christ jesus said yes you want to drink of my cup and you also will be baptized with the same baptism that i am baptized with are you there that was clear but the other problem is this that in the garden of eden adam was given the earth if you need the scripture you see me but whenever they give you a property there is a tattered deed are you there that is connected to the property so the second thing that was in eden is the tata deal are you there now when jesus christ came jesus only paid the price for the tata deal but jesus never brought the tragedy before we get to elijah you need to understand this it is clear hallelujah christ has redeemers we are now redeemed everybody believes that but he has not claimed his possession because what happened when adam sinned adam had the tattoo thing and he was speaking to the mountain doing this doing the doing this no problem when adam sinned the tata did left the hand of adam and when the devil wanna take hold of it the doctor did say your hands are dirty you are not supposed to touch me so the tattered he went back to the original owner and the original owner was sitting on the trunk and he got the chatter deal and he said somebody must pay the price before i return the tattered d back are you there but when jesus christ came he paid only the price he opened up this mark he checked but this mark was still locked that's why elijah when he comes he's going to restore all things not only restore you to the faith of the holy ghost but the elijah must make sure that everything even the terrorist must come down we understand clear now okay now but he has not claimed his possession yet now you might die fair with that but just hold on a minute we'll see he has not claimed it see if he took the book of redemption everything that adam had and never think that he he lost cross with jim's back and he has already redeemers but bottom is remembering that but he has not took the possession yet he cannot until the appointed time are you there because if the book the tattoo was came with jesus christ everything will stop reading are you there okay no problem he cannot until the appointed time and then will come the resurrection and then the earth will be renewed again so the thirty is connected to the resurrection are you there because the first thing he revealed himself to christ the second thing he revealed himself through the bread but the third thing we must go back again to eden but you cannot go back to eden only with the holy ghost you must go back to eden also with the title deed are you there then we're gonna be like adam then we're gonna leave for a thousand years are you there that's why it is a threefold purpose dawn in christ dawning abroad but before we go back to everything the tata d must go back to the one he was supposed to be given everybody clear and then he shall take possession his possession which he got when he redeem us but we'll do it at the appointed time everybody clear praise the lord that's why we must understand when they say a prophet like unto moses you ready now now you're going to be preaching with me praise god we have moses on top there we have jesus christ when jesus died and rose again brother branham said the anointing the influence of the anointing of the son of man drop into paul like the lion anointing are you there no problem all right now moses was a prophet everybody agree with me moses met the pillar of fire everybody agree with me when moses was born they killed children you agree with me moses have three sons i explained this already we preach on this those sons in our day we call them the pools we already explained to that everybody there moses was initiated and next to this everybody is following me praise the lord moses had the power to create things a prophet like unto moses everybody clear moses gave israel the manner that fell from heaven everybody clear moses went into a mountain come more horrible and a cloud met moses there a prophet like unto moses are you there moses when he went he have two table of the law we already explained this one was written and one was unwritten are we there clear praise the lord moses also took a poll everybody there and put a snake on top of the pole and raised the snake for israel everybody there which was speaking about the crucifixion of jesus christ we're clear no problem moses was dead and moses was resurrected amen on one evil that's why your on one transfiguration moses was there and jude opened up the mystery to us he says that tomorrow night michael the archangel was there because at the shout at the voice of the archangel are you there a prophet like unto who moses let's go to jesus christ was jesus a prophet check mark when jesus was born did baby die praise the lord did jesus have three pulls let me help you up jesus ministry consisted of three polls did you know that notice and be sincere if you ever was in your life now for a minute few minutes his first pull was healing the seat we already explained this in detail he became very popular man everybody there the ministry of healing is always popular the problem that people have brought with brother branham is not about the healing ministry the problem they have with is about the second and the third pool are you there because if you notice when jesus christ died jesus was placed into the womb and he was sealed by the roman are you there the roman seal was put on the tomb and it was closed completely then the soldier was there and when the resurrection of jesus christ came the mighty angel came down the military service of that time witness the coming down of the mighty angel i hope you caught that are you there the military of that time the military service of the time of jesus christ they witnessed the coming down of the maori and jeff and the witness the breaking of the seal that they married are you there when the military reported that to the church the clergy are you there the clergy corrupted them to tell a wrong story to deny the evidence that they first saw are you there that's why when the cloud came on sunset mountain are you there it was completely clarified that the angel of the lord came but they are using the military again saying that it was the army that was destroying the rocket they are again using the soldier they are again using the military in order to reject the coming down of the mighty angel to break the seal spirit don't die are you there but the soldiers saw it but they also tell a lie so you better know what you are listening to it the military can be corrupted because they were corrupted in the time of jesus they saw the mandatory the witness said they saw the breaking of the seal then they turn around and say no he was his disciple it was a rocket that we were destroying everybody there the first pool was the healing of the sick he became a very popular man everybody believe him seems like seems like is that right went he fought when he went forth healing the sick everybody wanted him in the church that's why brother branham said be very sensitive in other words the read between the line you will understand my ministry but one day he turned around and start prophesying we explained to you that discerning of the spirit and prophecy was the same praise the lord which is the second poor for he was the word and he was the prophet the moses again moses and when he went to tell them and they tell and tell them how they was living and the things they were doing he become very unpopular are you there when it comes to the healing of the sick brother branham is a good prophet brother branham pray for my mother that one you can't deny brother when i pray for my father but i want to pray for my uncle but we have a problem with his teaching that was his second poll the second was rebuking the organization and prophesying what they had done what they were and what was coming 279 but his third pool was when he preached to the lost that could not say be saved no more in other words jesus have also three balls everybody there jesus a prophet moses a prophet moses have three pools jesus also have three poor check everybody there initiates an exodus did jesus initiate an exodus let me help you up this great angel of the covenant jesus christ in the form of god 30 not robbery but become equal with god now he is a pillar of fire in the same form that he was back there bringing that first exodus bringing the second accident and here he is with there the third doctor that is here i'm going slowly everybody there the first exodus what did he do what did the pillar of fire do he brought them out of a natural land to a natural land egypt into palestine the second exodus he brought them out from a spiritual condition are you there into a spiritual baptism after a spiritual baptism of them the one who's coming after me i am not ready to latch the shoes that the the and i'm not ready to touch the legend of his shoe he will baptize you with the everybody clear second exodus third exodus now he is bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the holy ghost right back to the eternal land of the millennium and the great here but to go back to the millennium you need there are we clear brother branham help me again the holy spirit in the form of the pillar of fire god coming down in manifestation brought out the first exodus brought israel out of egypt the second exodus was christ bringing the church out of what judaism that's why john the baptist pulled them from the law and put them into christ and christ initiates the exodus say moses spoke the lord said this like i tell you are you there they say over there i try to fortune but i'll tell you pulling them out of what judaism everybody there the third exodus is when the same pillar of fire takes the bride from the church out of the natural that's number one out of the spiritual number two and the spiritual out of the spiritual number three three the spiritual out of the church rather then we get the three the three ages of eight so did jesus have the exodus here so now check mark did jesus have the power to create everybody remember when they brought him fish and loaf of bread when he cut the fish when he cut the broth everybody there let's check that one mark a prophet like unto who moses did jesus give them the manner in john chapter 6 jesus said your father did eat manna are you there manna was the bread that came down from heaven and jesus said but i am the bread that came down from he brought the true manner everybody there a prophet like unto who check mark the bread of life everybody there did jesus went into a mountain was the cloud coming down on jesus when he was in the mountain the cloud came and said this is my beloved son do what hear ye him everybody there check mark did jesus had the law and did jesus break the seal in the message the six seal brother what i'm saying now watch the first seal is revelation 6 1 and 2. everybody there who did we found these fellow walls an antichrist matthew 24 4 to 5. brother branham said when jesus was talking in matthew 24 verse four and five he was prosperous he was speaking about the first seal you go read the six years now the second tier matthew 24 6 are you there the third seal this is feminine matthew 24 7 and eight the fourth seal pestilence and death matthew 24 verse seven and eight the fifth seal matthew 24 verse nine and thirteen the sixth seal matthew 24 verse 29 and 30. what about the seven seal now jesus omitted the teaching of the seventies it is not here watch he goes right on with the parable now after that john omitted the seventh hill so what jesus was doing on matthew 24 is exactly what john was doing also in the book of what matthew what in the book of revelation are you there so in other words when jesus christ came jesus came and restored completely the tree of life and opened the door and bring the people to the baptism of the holy ghost but jesus when it comes to the title d jesus only gave the title the ensemble like john are you following me let's go to the book of revelation chapter one people say we must preach christ we must preach christ we must preach jesus right let's go to the revelation chapter one if you dare you can say amen revelation chapter one verse one the revelation of jehovah [Music] the revelation of jehovah the revelation of who so if you need to preach christ you must preach the book of revelation [Music] are you there so when jesus christ restored this he had a revelation that he sealed i'm going slowly that when then when he died he rose again he spoke to john and say there is something a revelation of myself that i have i'm gonna give it to you are you there and when he gave it to john he gave to john in symbols remember the point he restored this but never brought the book are you there okay the revelation of jesus christ which he gave to him to shout to his servant things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified by his to his servant john so this book must be explained by a manger it is a revelation but that revelation still when god gives it in symbols what does it mean we don't know everybody clear so john omitted their seven seals the seventh the last the seventh seal that is going to be a great thing it is not even written omitted the seventh seal both of them did are you there and the revelator when god just don't say there was just a silence in heaven jesus never say a word about it down here when we compare the scripture here with matthew 24 with the six everybody clear the seven seal was left out because you see christ said only god himself knows not even the angel no wonder it was not even written they hushed nothing take place then angel don't know it nobody knows when he is coming everybody there so he spoke about the sales in symbol form now did jesus lift up the serpent on the pole take john chapter 3 a prophet like unto moses take john chapter 3 verse 14 if you dare you can say amen everybody there page is still turning everybody there verse 14 and as moses everybody clear as moses lift up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be is that checked or crossed checked everybody clear when jesus died did he bring the resurrection checked everybody there a prophet like unto who any question let's look at paul because paul received also the baptism of the holy ghost we're trying to see are we going to be restored to what was paul a prophet we already prove it to you give you the bible scripture this is the faith this is the faith that john the baptist pointed that faith have the baptism of the holy ghost and all of this because they ask they say are you that prophet come and see the one who moves this and the other spoke are we there thank you all right let's go to paul was paul a prophet everybody clear with me did paul have three pools no okay did paul bring an exodus no you agree with me did paul created something in his ministry no everybody clear did bob did paul preach the word of god then brought the word [Music] check mark everybody clear did paul go to a mountain somewhere and meet a cloud no paul was a prophet moses a prophet jesus a prophet met the pillar of fire met the pillar of fire made the pillar of fire everybody clear but three pools no exodus no there is only three are you there [Music] created the the staff no going to a mountain no did paul went and break the seals let's put that to the idea he just spoke about it did paul bring the crucifixion paul spoke about the second crucifixion of christ are you there did paul bring the resurrection of the dead paul is still dead today any question so far was the fifth restore under paul why is those missing with paul why are they missing take first corinthians 13. if you dare you can say amen praise the lord a prophet like unto moses first corinthians 13. you there let's go to verse 9. for we know in can i repeat it again who's speaking for we know in fullness are we clear for we know in part and we prophesied in so everything that paul was doing that seems to be like the foundation was just huh everything that paul was doing was just uh we must be restored to the faith of the apostle it's gonna be first air part that but elijah must restore all things because we need to go back to eden i want to see that in the bible we prophesy in part but when that which is [Music] if you look at the seven church ages we usually draw them like this all right everybody remember that by the day we do we have more of this this is like completed thank you praise the lord if you notice we say this is paul this is martin this is columba this is errands if you remember the people in the message then we do this right which is the capstone right we go here all the way with seven church edges all right if you notice when you do this it gives you a perfect pyramid everybody see that right everybody there what makes this base a pyramid is the top part here if you take this top part out you have four sides everybody understand if you take this part you hook it there then this building becomes a pyramid but if you watch this building it is a pyramid of itself are you there this pyramid is already perfect he can live without you [Applause] are you there so you need that pyramid to come to you and make you perfect [Applause] are you there that's why they call the stature of a perfect man capsule when the caption comes he make you perfect are you there are we clear praise the lord so when that which is it's already perfect on itself it is called love it is the capstone it is already perfect but paul saying we are doing stuff in paul until the prophet comes when the perfect count then the entire building is ready for the rapture let's go back to the bible hallelujah verse 10 but when that which is perfect is come that which is part is what in other words was this coming here we don't talk about this anymore the entire building is now talking about the pyramid because the entire ship now is what pyramid that's why paul said it is not me that live it is who it is not paul paul paul when cross enter it is now are we there let's look at that scripture a little bit brother branham help us first corinthians 13 says this everybody there when that which is perfect he's come that which is part shall be what done away with so all these little things they move off the pentecostal of jumping up and down like a king trying to talk in tongues because they speaking tongue speaking tongue and all these other when that which is perfect it is something that follows the movement of pentecost that follow simeon that follows zechariah that follow anna the prophet are you there that's why simeon said my eyes have seen this now i can't doubt because the shack once they see this created the shack have to pull up and die are you there praise the lord now he said and we heard today by god's help the prophet interpretation of the word let me jump down here that which is in part will be done away with wonder which is perfect is come or when that which is perfect is made no may not mean to be revealed are you there ah now i've got the question on that i hope i get it tonight if that won't happen when there are you there so brother branham connect this scripture with them let's go please explain first corinthians 13 8 12 now when the perfect word is restored to the church are these verses fulfilled clear now i think i just went through that didn't i and when that which is prophet has come now which is important shall be done away paul say listen bodybuilding do i speak with tongue of men and angel and do all these things but when that is perfect he's come we say love right now is there anything perfect about god no sir is god the prophet in the beginning was there you see that the congregation with black world and the world was with god and the word was and the world is still in other words that which is perfect is the word are we there now that's why paul prophesied on me so when you get him here he's missing so who's going to bring us something like unto moses did moses hear the people of fire [Applause] if you don't see it i'm presenting are we there you heard about it here you never seen it you heard about it here you never you heard about it [Applause] hallelujah how are we there [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] 33 praise the lord if you dare you can say amen hallelujah all right let's go by verse one and him and this is the blessing where with who moses the man of god bless israel they bless the children of israel before his death and he said the lord came from we know sana is more holy i already showed you that moses is telling us that when god came to mossannah i already gave you scripture if you go back to the series you'll find that horeb is sana he said when the lord came down came from musana and rose up from sail to them he shined forth from my parents and he came with ten thousand of cents from his so on sana brother robert already caught that on sana on mohawk in the right hand of god when god came down we usually say the angel came down and god spoke to moses that's superficial let's get deeper when you get deeper moses say when god met me on santa in the right hand of god a prophet like unto in the right hand of god went a fairy for them moses said in the right hand of god there was the book of law and the law was filed because it's judgment it still needs for a kingsman redeemer to pay the price so when god came down on monsanto moses unveiled to us that in the hand of god the right hand of god there was a book and that book was the law of moses the law of moses came with god down in the cloud with a book in the right hand thank you are you there brother stephen saying the bible says brothers that's the church the bible says i'm saying the bible says what i'm saying no people are dead are you there let's go to acts 7. after chapter 7 verse 38. usually we say bosses yeah the angel come the cloud came when the cloud came there was god in right hand with a book the book of the law are you there the law was only a substitution a school master until fed camp that log who was not the one in the original owner was just a school master but he came also in the right hand of god acts chapter 7 verse 38 if you dare you can say amen this is him how many person one person this is he that was in the church right in the wilderness with the angels oh so there was only one angel okay with their angel singular which spoke to him i thought he was god who was speaking to him god is also the angel of the lord right so here luke is explaining to us that on monsanto the angel of the lord was talking to moses and this angel moses told us that in his right hand there was a book yes okay 38 the angel which spoke to him in my sana we see that and with and with our father who received the lovely what oracle to give to us the lively oracle came the law in the right hand jump to verse 53. how many angels was there according to acts 7 38 he was only one injured so when god came on santa how many angels were there let's go to verse 53 you there who have received the law by the disposition of what i thought he was one so there were many angels i'm going slowly that came down on monsanto are you understanding but one of them was talking to moses and the one that was talking with moses has a right a book in his right watch and who receives the law by the disposition of what angel and have not kept it take galatians 3. a prophet like unto who galatians 3. if you dare you can say amen verse 19. you there okay paul said wherefore wherefore then serve the law what is the purpose of the law he was added because of what till their sin the seed of the woman should come to whom the promise was made and he was ordained by what confirmed again that he was not one angel it was many angels everybody seen that confirmed by angel in the hand of air media that means there was moses do you believe it or not somebody is quiet keep your finger here i don't want you to say brother steven say let's go to deuteronomy 5 5. i want you to say brother stephen or our pastor say if you look at a different translation he will tell you moses but i don't want you to say no but it's even saying the different translation ah detron on me five pounds are you there are you there if you're sleepy or what wake up detron on me far far are you there verse 4 the lord talked with you face to face in the mount of the midst of the fire verse five everybody there and i stood between the lord and you at that time are you there to show you the word of the lord for you were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the man who stood between the lord and the people that's why they say by the hand of a medieval that's why he said remember the law of moses in word you want a prophet to be between you and me that's why in the in the ministry of brother branham the angel of the lord comes it's why brother who look at him and say he's dead he's right here he's in between me and you you don't see him he said you feel that funny feeling it is him he talked to the prophet and the prophet talked back to you are we there but how many angels many angels let's go to hebrew chapter 2 a prophet i like unto moses if you dare you can say amen the law came by angel but not all the angels one of them has the lord in his right hand on my sana so when the cloud came they were anger in the cloud one of that angel has a book in his right hand on the mountain hebrew two two are you there fo it's the word spoken by so those angels have word that they spoke each angel had a message not only was one angel who brought the book but in changing one has air seal and if the words broken by angels plural was steadfast and every transgression and these obedients receive a just reward what i'm pointing you here is what their angel when you go back to sunset mountain revelation 10. i don't want you to say brother stephen revelation 10 if you dare you can say amen it happened in moses bringing the law when jesus christ came jesus went to the mountain but no book is stopped today are you there because jesus only restored the baptism of the holy spirit he closed the seal are you there when paul came no mountain but the book of redemption must come down are you there but the same on you that happened in holland tell us that god came down without the angels and those angels also have messages and god also has a message with a roof in his right hand revelation 10 1 and i saw another mighty angel came down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was out he wear the sun and his feet has pillar of fire and in his head was a leader so in revelation 10 um they are speaking about one angel that came down and that angel also in his hand their book how many take second thessalonians chapter one next second thessalonians chapter one praise the lord praise the lord are you there second thessalonians chapter one everybody there second thessalonians chapter one verse seven and to you who are troubled whether the cloud happen or not to you who are troubled trouble rest with us are you there when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his money it is a revelation in heaven in the sky the lord jesus christ is going to reveal himself but with angel marty angels that's why in the book of revelation they say another meaning they were other mighty angels but another that one when he came down a book in his hand on mohamed on monsanto and one angel came down with a book in his hand and there were also some angel that also gave messages to moses in sunset mountain one angel came a book in his hand but there were also other angels he took the prophet to give you the correct number that he was seven injured in a flaming fire just like inaudible are you there that's why brother brother called that clown a fire a prophet like unto who moses was brother branham did he have the pillar of fire the brother of adam was a prophet did he have to improve was that the next on this did he create him yes did he bring the world was in the mountain and then a cloud came and that cloud have a man with to have a ninja with a book in his right hand did brother branham reveal the word was the second crucifixion with brother branham in the message indictment and my indictment is against the churches of today i am not bringing the sinner into this he's a sinner to begin with i am speaking to the church the tape is the tips now i shall glad i shall try to get through as quick as i can i induct this generation for the second crucifixion of who are you there and then when brother branham spoke he said when the messiah when the marriage comes he dies all through the shout the voice of the archangel which is the voice of resurrection and also what are you there that's why brother branham said the cloud that was taken is a confirmation that the message is right and it's speaking about the resurrection a prophet like unto it happen in christ paul missed it because paul preached only in part it takes elijah in the end time to restore all things the problem is john 14. according to john 14 whatever happened in the messiah will be multiplied the ministry of moses was portrayed perfectly in christ and the ministry of christ was portrayed into the end time ministry but john 14 says that whatever christ does you want to do it more that's why elisha asked for the double portion are you there what elijah deed when it comes under elijah it is double the works that i do shall you do us shall you also sam can but greater shall you do listen close get on your i pray that god will open your heart and your mind to understanding so that you shall understand without saying it too much here it's not for the public let's see some of the great work he done let's just stop for a couple of things let's think one time he said you feed them something to eat [Music] jesus said hey bring me the food he cut feed him that's what he did we have nothing say what have you got bring me what you got and they said we have five barley loaves and two fishes he said bring them to me he took the original five barley loaf and began to break the loaves and from the original he made bread in other words when jesus was creating he was using something that is already created and create something from it he got fish hand me the fish he was a fish to begin with he took off that fish another fish and another fish but in this last day according to john 14 12. in this last day he had nothing are you there in the time of jesus he was cutting and pulling carrying and pulling but this time the doctor d is back again and when they turtle d back again even though you don't have a substance you don't need the substance you just have to have a concept because that's how god was creating at the beginning god only have a thought when he spoke the thought materialized did not your lord say that you are god [Music] a dog child is a dog a child of a donkey is a donkey a child of a fish a leader of a fish it's a fish a child of god is god but in this last day he had nothing he just spoke with back in the beginning because that which is perfect is come in the beginning was there because the word was just concept speak concept speak concept speak you don't need material the material is in the concept say he'll be there and he was there without anything in it he never had a squirrel there was none there let there be we are back again in the beginning we are back again in eden we are back again with land before the fall you need the restoration of all things and there he was oh his word is infallible he has to be fulfilled what is your take home message we need to go back to the origin of faith that origin of faith first he comes in the ministry of john the baptist to pay the price by praying the pros god enter into the temple and john brought three elements repentance water baptism and the baptism of the holy ghost and then the lord entered into the temple and we found in the day of pentecost he entered into 120 temple that was the first part of the original faith but according to the prophet like unto moses when the lord come that origin of faith concerned a ministry in that ministry the one who comes must meet the pillar of fire the one who comes must be a prophet the one who comes must have three pools the one who comes must have an exodus the one who comes must have the power of the spoken word before the mountain that's why the square were created in 1959 and the seals were in 1963. are you there the one who comes must bring the manner from heaven the one who comes must go to a mountain he must meet the angel and one of the angels must be the angel of the lord and must have the book open the one who come must reveal he must reveal the word on the rock that's why the the vision of genio jackson have a party that was written and another part that was not written the one who come must be crucified and he inducted the generation for the second crucifixion and he must bring the power of resurrection the key here is that of thee must come down the book that was sealed in revelation 5. in revelation 10 it is now open and we have that revealed word in books and tips that is your title d so the origin of faith restored the baptism of the holy spirit and must restore also there totally back to the rest of adam then we are ready for the rapture now this messenger of malachi 4 revelation 7 it's gonna do are you there number one according to malachi 4 he will turn the heart of the father to the the children to the father i'm sorry are you there which we start the baptism of the holy spirit of paul number two he will reveal we need the title the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelation content in the seventh it will be this divine reveal mystery is true that literally in other words their seals will be the very thing that will turn the heart of the children to the pentecostal what we need is the restoration of the baptism of the holy ghost but today when you talk to the devil you must have the title of thee you just don't speak by word but you have also the title d that proof that you own the property god which we bless you [Applause] now when we say we store the back of the the the heart of the children back to the father you know because you're gonna say well we were already restored why do we need again the seals no you need the seals to complete redemption if you don't have the sales we're going to be like paul we're just going to preach in part that's why before the seals when brother branham went into the sixth dimension he said i preached like who in other words brother branham only was preaching him but when the seals broke it is more than paul are you there he could not die until he break the seal because the seal is what bring that which is perfect now we have paul plus we have the pyramid total and now we are ready for the millennium because in the millennium you must act like adam in the millennium it's christ and his blood that are living on honeymoon for a thousand years because adam did not fulfill one day which is a thousand years so you cannot be in the millennium hesitating to create you must be in the millennium comfortable you wake up in the morning you move that mountain you put it over there you move that tree you put it over there what adam stop we must fulfill it completely and we're not even waiting on the millennium we started now you speak healing to your children you speak healing to your family

was created create your job create your job i always my wife knows i say i don't want to be in depth you have a right to live under the american system but i refuse that am i there yet no i will continue to speak because the bible told me you will not borrow but you will be landing are you there take no for answer either you accept the condition or you begin to wake up and you begin to change you say i have the right to tell my supervisor this is what i want you pray when faith drop you go there you say sir i need the race you don't ask for it they also sit down you ask for it hey yes yes that's true let me talk to the other one i will see later before you know it you got a raise ask and it shall be we are tired of talking about the message it is time to leave the message let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy father it is this grace that brought this stone from the hand of zero baby lord you knew that your children will be in the condition that we are today but father you spoke in your word that you shall not live as comfortless lord there is so much confusion so much so many things the devil is throwing to your children lord but the more he's doing it the more you are raising a clear standard father to remove all the smoke and to stabilize your children more and more into your word lord father this is not just a restoration of the person but you're restoring the person of the holy spirit in our heart plus you are giving us the title deal of redemption your prophet told us that when you went and you took it at the throne it belonged to you but you didn't want to keep it you send it down lord father to your children back again in the hand of adam reyes because the price has been paid the sacrifice was accepted in heaven and now the race of adam have a right to the title deal to claim that which belong to us father may we realize who we are may you quicken our heart to go higher and to be raptured in this revelation lord until our life will completely express nothing by the message of the hour lord help this church remember our brothers and sisters remember those that are struggling lord remember the young people that the devil is targeting trying to bring confusion in their head lord you spoke in your word that you are not the author of confusion lord father but you came lord so that your children will see clear and clear lord father because you say in the time of paul that he was looking through through the mirror but now we're not looking to a mirror we are looking face to face because when the cloud picture was turned to the right we saw your face and we want to look at that face and that face need to look to us lord and we will be transformed into the image of your son lord father we commit this day unto the hand may you help us lord and take the preeminence lord in our heart now life and lord father guide this church in everything as we commit lord this day and the beginning of the weekend to the end in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you church we love you brother abel would you come and take the service if you can back the slides up a little bit i wanted to i wanted to point some point out something here but um can we go back a little bit further by the day keep going people get confused about you know william branham because he made this mistake and he made that mistake but we know moses was told to speak to the rock and he smote the rock it's not about the mistakes of a man and furthermore a lot of the mistakes they said he made i don't necessarily believe he made those but i was just pointing out i wanted to point out can we go back a little bit further sorry right here all these things all these check marks we know that it wasn't this man that did these check marks god used this man to make these check marks god used this pillar of fire the holy spirit to make these check marks it's not about the man the man might have had mistakes and this man might have had mistakes because all men have mistakes we don't see no mistakes here no mistakes or no confusion and we don't see no mistakes here either don't get me wrong but i'm saying just his life in general wasn't about his life it was about what god used him for and we see he didn't bring glory to himself never once never once did he say i'm a prophet or or i spoke squirrels into existence never once did he bring glory to himself but he always said that you know i'm just i'm a hum i'm humble he always made himself humble and god used them to speak squirrels god used them to turn the picture aside and people will say oh the cloud was a rocket you can believe whatever you want but despite whatever it might have been i i don't believe it was a rocket but if it was a rocket do you see this picture do you see this picture of the hoffman's head of christ a perfect outline but oh a rocket went up and puffed that into the air and then furthermore the man who we believe to be the prophet and we know to be the prophet happened to have a revelation of turning it to the side to reveal that picture but it was a it was a rocket and oh he wasn't there and all this confusion you all can have it it's true to me i believe it with all of my heart because i don't see how by chance that could appear in the sky when it did the time it did and use this man to reveal what it was i can't believe that by chance that's not by chance to me and i believe that just as he was so many places by vision he could have been in that same place by vision we don't know we don't know we don't need to know we just believe because it's the word that's what i believe that's what i believe but anyway i apologize i'm one of them i'm one of them and i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them and they were gathered in the upper room while praying in his name they were baptized with the holy ghost with power for service came now what he did for them that they will do for you the same i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of oh i'm one of them i'm one of them and i'm so glad that i can't say i'm one of them hallelujah i'm one of them i'm one of them oh i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them and there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all the same with the fire that fell at pentecost which cleansed and made them clean it heart is glory to his name i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them oh i'm one of them i'm one of them and i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm one of and them so glad that i can say i'm one of them and come my brother seek this blessing that revenge or heart from sin it'll [Music] i'm so glad that i can't say i'm one of them amen i'm one of them i'm one of them and i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm one of them and i'm so glad that i can say [Music] and i'm so glad that i can't say i'm one of them i'm one of them good
