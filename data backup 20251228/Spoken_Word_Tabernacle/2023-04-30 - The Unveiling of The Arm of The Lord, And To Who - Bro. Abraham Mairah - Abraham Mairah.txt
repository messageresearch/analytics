very good teacher I just admire I sit down there listen a few of those series on the roof and so forth and I said wow so maybe I'll come just to look for some little gazil or antelope in the forest and in so doing I'm chasing out a good moves for him to shoot I know it's good at shooting the moves while I can pick the small antelopes so as I'm chasing the artillery he'll get a hold of the moons amen but we just feel that Joy of going home I can't wait and I can't accuse the Lord by saying the Lord is starring no we are the ones who are tarrying [Music] he's already here he descended you know he's ready to take us home but not willing that any of the elect should perish that's why he's always holding on so he's not carrying we are the ones starring him and we really appreciate him for that amen you're so of course everybody knows I'm not a good speaker I'm completely helpless without him coming down to do you know English is not even in my language I didn't study anything NFL so whatever I have is just by the grace of God so your mostly will take me for what I mean to say that and then what I'm saying maybe so I would request that we all stand up and have a word of Prayer loving heavenly father I want to thank you for such a wonderful ability you've given us to be in your house and to be gathered here together with the Saints Lord Those whom you have gathered from the different places to come here and you are the one who led them and we all saw Lord God reckon they are those many others streaming around the world as they always ring and confirm Lord I pray that your blessing will be upon them in what am I that am I mean even standing here Lord is only you who can come and break yourself because you're the bread of life break yourself Lord God that your children can partake of it come on Lord God being that you are the great El Shaddai the Lord you'll hand over that particular teeth for a particular need that your children have got and Lord may I completely step out of the way and come and anoint your servant and speak through the sleeps of clay that we can which can be a blessing unto them and preparing us for that final hour the grand hour that we are waiting for bless the reading of your world and bless your children anoint your servant in Jesus name amen we shall turn to our Bibles of just a couple of scriptures to read if you can turn your Bibles with me in the book of Isaiah chapter 59 and 53 and revelation 3. Isaiah chapter 59 verse 1 and 2. he says behold the Lord is Hindi is not shortened that it cannot serve neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear but your iniquities of separated between you and your God and your sins of heed his face from you that you're not here going a little bit behind there in chapter 53 verse 1 it says who has believed our rebought and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed that is a question and we can we come to the Book of Revelation chapter 3. verse 15 and 16. I know that it works or hot I would thou what called or hot so then because Tower look on either cold or hot I'll spill thee out of my mouth may God bless his word and bless you you may be seated excuse me I have a problem you know change of weather change of times has had it stall on my body sorry it's slowly going to adapt and we are dealing with that question the one the first one is a statement which emphatically puts is clear that the Lord is hand is not short neither can it be shortened it's not a short and it cannot be shortened that it can fail to serve and then he comes in the second party there he was saying unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed who has believed our report where did we get that report and Isaiah as a prophet is presenting himself in a plural says Allah report because the way believers who believed his message and whoever receives you know a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet it's a reward so the prophet becomes plural by that of those who received the message and he says who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed so I'm speaking about the title of the unfailing of the Lord's arm and to who blessed be the name of the Lord and if you want to go back to the some some scripture here in the book of First Kings I think if I am to remember very well um First Kings here chapter 8. Solomon dedicating the temple he speaks here in verse 22 he says and Solomon stood before the oath of the Lord in the princess of holy Congregation of Israel and it's prayed forth his sons towards heaven and he said Lord God of Israel there is no God like thee in Heaven above on Earth benefit Covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart now look to this verse 24 he says who has kept thy servant David my father that thou promises to him thou's biggest also with thy mouth and has fulfilled it with dining hand as it is this day so God speaks with his mouth and he fulfills it with his hand so it is unto Those whom the arm the hand is revealed that become part of the machine that that fulfills and sees the Fulfillment but who are those because he speaks with the imams and he fulfills with the hand but to whom is that hand revealed who is going to see the Fulfillment of the spoken word of God who are going to overcome all impediments or the obstacles all the failures all the demons that the devil has released to fail the word who are going to be those people who are going to be triumphant and see the word of God full of fearing in their life the people to whom the arm of the Lord will be revealed because he speaks with his mouth and full of fears with his hand but what is his mouth glory be to God because he brings it out in Revelation he says because you are lukewarm you are neither hot nor called I will spill so where are you when you are not lukewarm where are you you are in the mouth of God [Applause] you are in the very mouth of God that's where you reside that's where you are it's only when you become cold lukewarm towards his word towards God that is peels you out but when you are warm I mean when you are hot when you are hot when you are on fire for God when you are energized [Music] when you are part of the system that he is you stay in the mouth of God [Applause] so that remains you are both there when they speak it [Applause] and you are part of the fulfilling past machine you are in the hand and you are in the mouth because come on we are not a lukewarm Church and if you have been lukewarm get out of there today be on fire there is enough fire to make you fiery there is enough Holocaust to make you full of power and power and matter there is enough Grace to keep you on fire why should you be Europe because out of the mouth of God comes the sword the fire laughs our God is a consuming fire and that consuming fire comes from the mouth and you are in the mouth how can you be in the mouth where there is a fire and you are lukewarm so now we are coming to something if you were part of the mouth that speaks the word [Music] in other words when God spoke it you spoke it together with him [Applause] America the word we are believing is the voice of God it's the voice of God the message that we have got is the voice of God it's the vindicatory truth we are not looking for truth we have got the truth we are sure we have heard from God we have heard from God we are not guessing about it we are sure about it we know where we are standing [Applause] so when God's Pocket I was part of the mouth hey until you get lukewarm he spills you out but when you're on fire you are there [Applause] let's go and look at something here in the Book of John I'm just using some moves for brother Stephen let's look at what the Bible says here and in John chapter 1 in the beginning was the word and before the word can be spoken forth there has to be a thought and a prophet says you were in his thinking so you were not just part of the world but you are part of the thought before this the word was spoken think about how important you are think about how established your foundation is think about how sometimes you belittle who you are and how God established you before there was any negative thing before even any belief came up before even the devil was was the devil before even Lucifer became what he was in God's thoughts and in the beginning was the word so when he's part of the word and you are in the mouth of God glory to God no wonder you cannot have room for unbelief how can you doubt how can you doubt what you believe what you spoke when he is popular what you were down there saying amen how can you doubt it how can you fail to get it [Applause] in the beginning what's the word and the world was with God of course that is the logos and the world was good and then he says the same was in the beginning with God the word all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made now look at this verse for in him was life in who in the world was life and the life was the light of men it doesn't say the life became the light of men life was the light of men in the beginning who are this men [Applause] who are this men in him logos was the light I mean the life and the life was the light of men what does light do manifest [Applause] so what manifests is the life which the life is the light and the light was for men men who were there when God was speaking the word oh I wish I was a good preacher like brother Stephen I could start preaching now the light the life was the light of men what does the life like to do and you know here the prophet says let's close our eyes to our imaginations for a few moments let's go way back in before there was anything the great Fountain of all eternity was that Spirit of love joy and the spirit of honesty and that spirit of cruelness in Perfection and then out of the existence of the father went in the logos which was the son which was a theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body that is the logos the word spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went forth and there was the there was the theophany which was God made into the world and then that theophan of course Elohim now forming into the world he says then that great if you're funny was made flesh in the passion of Jesus Christ and all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and the Holy Spirit all in that and that's the very way we go come back to the original beginning that's the way we go by Jesus Christ back Plum back to the original beginning of God so jesus takes away all the rubbish oh the most if you can go back to Isaiah he says look to the Rock from whence you were healed so because this rock was healed from the major Rock and cast into time and it stayed there dormant forgot where it came from most started a building on it the most of sin but now when you try to look back you couldn't fit back in the hall whereas they got you because there is a lot of sin there is moss there is that around you then the blood of Jesus comes and cleanses you from all the most and now you look back and you see where they cut you and you can go back and fit Plum back by Jesus Christ to the original the beginning which is the word which is the logos and you are in the mouth [Applause] then he says glory to God original Plumb back to the original the beginning of God there listen there we are born again so when you talk about being born again you are born again back up there you are taking him back to the original beginning when God spoke of the word and the sons of God shouted together for joy where were you [Applause] maybe I'll be preaching somewhere about that who is darkening my Council who is this one using your lips job [Music] I know can you doubt that job was there job was there but God is saying who is this who is this one speaking through you thinking in you acting in you making you believe like you behave like a failure making you behave like you you don't know what is going on making you believe behave as if like you are supposed to be affected by the surrounding you were there before the surrounding you were there before circumstances you were there before demons came up you were back there before disease came you were there before problems came you were there in the world that's where you are born again from back away and you have got your anchor back to the beginning not in American society [Applause] not born again American not born again African not born again Chinese born again see the charm of God born against word of God manifested never to fail [Applause] and the devil doesn't want you to recognize that once you come to that you are going to be very dangerous to the devil's Kingdom very dangerous and I want you to become very dangerous because when the devil is dealing with you he doesn't spare you and we have to come to a point where we don't spare it ever either [Music] [Applause] all our potential [Music] Glory oh God foreign that went out of God when it began to brood upon the Earth and brought forth marine life where the spirit of God the logos the word which God said let there be and there went to the logos and when God said let there be you way with God and you didn't have an ayat of unbelief in you because there was no unbelief the first sinner who sinned from the beginning was the devil not you you are you are not the first sinner it's the devil and he just wants to smear you with his dad but we thank God that there is something that can cleanse you so he says oh Hallelujah glory be to God it says and finally upon the Earth came the genuine image of God himself again which was good the Lord was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now that same logos has a part he has got a bride and our same logos this word that cannot be tampered with anytime Parable if that's English Glory oh God cannot be someone can try to fidget with it but it's built in such a way that it cannot be tampered with it stays original [Applause] it is sealed it is classified a classified message to a classified people sealed away from others the recipients are known by God is for our knowledge their stand is guaranteed oh my Hallelujah foreign it says cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches himself is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word it's full money Festus what will manifest it their hand but what is in the hand Isaiah 49 I want to show you some scriptures quickly Isaiah 49 let's see here let's begin from verse 15. can a woman forget her suckling child that he should not have compassion on the son of ham yeah they may

Are you are the hand of God [Applause] EX IST stretch the fourth clear I give you another shock maybe in the scriptures we are preaching a new book now open the book [Applause] new Bible let's see how the hand of God works let's go to Leviticus chapter 8. oh I wish I was a good one Glory oh God Leviticus chapter 8. somebody should get ready to read for me Numbers chapter 4 verse 49. let's see Leviticus chapter 8 verse 36 he says so Aaron and his sons did all the things which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses not the mouth so Moses was speaking the word but he was not counted as a mouth okay God commanded he gave the word but what was the what coming how was it coming by the handoff not by the mouth Glory oh God so the prophet Moses was not the mouth of God he was the mouth of God for in another angle but God describing him he says the hand is there somebody ready with the levitical numbers 4 49 numbers 449 I want to just prove this point by the hand of Moses um [Music] buy the handoff number 16 40. I just want to prove this number 16 verse 40 says to be a memorial and the children of Israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of Aaron come near to offer incense before the Lord and he be not a scorer and as his company as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses amen look them up amen chapter 27 verse 23 just ahead of there chapter 27 verse 23 let's see what the Bible again says chapter 23 verse 23 I mean 27 verse 23 he says and he laid his hands upon him and he gave him church as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses so Moses the way God looked at Moses yes my brother Moses was God his hand [Applause] because Moses became a god says I've made here God to Pharaoh that's right glory to God and now you're going to make my word come to pass whatever you say we have got the road of authority when you say it and vindicate it you say it I confirm it you say it I confirm it when you lift up your hand I'll come down whatever you say you have become a partner you become a partner with me we are Gods together we are joint heirs together we share their Glory we share their power which because I am not coming down there to do the things you are the man who put there [Applause] [Music] you are the man who put there to do no things so you are my hand [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] when you speak you are my mouth but what happens after you have spoken is my hand Glory oh God [Applause] that was the first Exodus we are now in the Third Exodus and we have also got a prophet [Applause] [Music] no the god of William Branham was not a god of History he was not a man who preached and preached and spoke and spoke and there was no manifestation he was not pleading and praying and fasting and seeking and crying he spoke to God God was his friend it happened brother Branham was God his hand [Applause] glory to God [Applause] Miracles upon miracles signs and wonders the supernatural that is the god itself that's the god you serve that's why we are here that's why you refuse to die that's why you have not gone yet there is a work for you there is a work for me there is a work for you glory to God all right [Applause] not only are you God's mouthpiece you are his mouthpiece when you speak what he spoke but when it begins to happen [Applause] when it begins to happen you are God's hand [Applause] he that receives the prophet in the name of a prophet receives the prophet's reward [Applause] so Hallelujah so Moses sees the being just the goddess mouthpiece he was the hand in other words it was the word together with manifestation coming together working simultaneously the word and the manifestation the word and the fruits the word and its Glory the word and its power the word and His glory coming together we are now the mother of twins the twins are to be born [Applause] the Dynamics upon the mechanics not only mechanics not only mechanics but the Dynamics coming the twins must be born and when the twins are born you are the hand of God [Applause] Glory [Applause] [Music] oh my Hallelujah so the logos the prophet says the locus he comes here and says that's a good one Christ the Holy Spirit is not with me only it is with you this is the prophet saying how many believe it is theirs the holy spirit is Not only was not only with the prophet the bit of fire you know when I talk about a pillow fire there are those people who say that said no go area brother Abraham the pillow fire only appears to Prophets I have got enemies for that and I accommodate with him I'm ready to be called anything but I thank God that I've seen the pillow fire if I've not seen the pillow fire then I don't have the Holy Spirit [Applause] the pillow fire is what led the children of Israel in the first Exodus and the prophet says that same Holy Spirit and that's why he says that's a good one that Holy Spirit is not only Within Me is he with you it just appeared there when the Bible teaches that the children of Israel was brought out of Egypt what happened there was a pure fire that followed them it wasn't the children of Israel that done the miracle it was the pit of fire that he followed him is that right how many knows that that was the angel of the Covenant the angel of the Covenant the logos [Music] that same one that spoke of the word the angel of the Covenant coming down with a rainbow Revelation chapter 10. a dispensational angel he's coming he's coming because he has a covenant hey glory to God so to those who don't have the Covenant with him they will not see him [Applause] those who are not in the mouth those who have been spewed out they will not understand it you remember Sister what we talked about the other day it is a deal between the thief and the stolen [Applause] people are saying oh they have stolen something they have stolen but their stolen is very happy behold I come as a thief [Applause] so the others will call him a thief but their stolen is very happy because she's part of the deal she's happy being stolen she's very happy she's calling you home the one who is telling him stalling her is her friend is her husband is the Angel of the Covenant is fulfilling the Covenant but the others is a thief [Applause] [Music] oh God so they fear their logos they fear the whole they pit on fire they fear is Supernatural Abraham I I when you go that area of this financial the Miracles the power of God I begin to fear my body begins to think I said come on do you have some bunch of demons in you I cast them out because if your blood begins to think because of the pill of fire because of this financial something is wrong [Applause] tell me when did God ever bring a message and he never proved that he's the one [Applause] and how can you doubt what was spoken when you were there and you were in the mouth shouting Hallelujah saying amen saying so be it and you say it when my time to be on Earth shall come I Will Rejoice at that word in my time and according to what I know you agreed with God my brother to be here now you [Music] you are in the right time you even live in the right place you are with the right person you are the one who can manage that husband you are the one who can manage that woman you are the one who can manage the day in the demons in the neighborhood don't start complaining yeah nothing is in you you have just forgotten [Applause] you have just forgotten but now when you will be reminded that's why Peter says it behooved me to Star you into remembrance although you asking you this [Laughter] you once knew it so the devil doesn't want people who are on the implementation side he wants a God who just speaks [Applause] and he knows the easiest thing is to make you disobey but when you you know what is being spoken I remember it was spoken I was there my name is I can hear there I can't even hear myself screaming Hallelujah hey do you know why you say Amen you are just echoing back what you said in that life echoing back what you said when that word was spoken so the devil has no problem you coming here sitting listening and then you can go back home and doubt he has no problem let me bring something here again the prophet said what turns hell or loose what turned the hell or lose in the days of the Apostles our fathers the Holy Ghost fell down and they all Pentecost the devil didn't bother that's the prophet now I have a quote on that says three three thousand people got saved and they were baptized and they didn't even the devil didn't move he remained in his chair and today I honest I told one brother recently one fellow Pastor I said on our forums we want to show we we baptized so many people in our church so many believed in our church and we put baptismal pictures on the ministerial forums to show that God is moving in our church so many people God saved so many people were baptized so many people received the Holy Ghost that's not what bothers the devil what makes the devil shaken is when God comes and proves that is the same yesterday today and forever when the Spanish was manifested on the lemon man when Paul Peter and German and John picked up the lemon and say gold and silver we don't have but what we have we give you in the name of Jesus of Nazareth rise up all hell was dandelus they were beaten they were imprisoned their past tuition started and the church went back to ask for more power [Applause] they prayed again they realized they didn't have enough [Applause] so the devil is blinding us somewhere when you watch on forums baptisms we baptized 20 we baptized we baptized the penny today and we put on the forums and then the Emojis of clapping man oh God bless you brother you did it hey brother we have got a very big church may have got 500 we have got 300 and the devil doesn't even get off his chair [Applause] the devil is looking at you he doesn't care whether you are one thousand two thousand whether you speak in tongues and dance around whether you baptize a hundred the devil doesn't move he's waiting for the manifestation of the hand [Applause] that's what shakes the devil that's what upsets the devil and that should be my focus I am looking for that which makes the devil annoyed Glory oh God yeah so today remind yourself here that I was both in the mouth and I'm in the hand what is Cinema can handle both can handle the word when the word is preached when the promises are identified when the teaching is done now the next is me again to make the word become a reality it's me now it's my time devil you are not going to cheat to me I'm not going to live before my privileges Glory oh God to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed to who not so many they say I've got the revelation of the word good what about the hand what about the arm which brings it to pass all the preaching was good we have a good preacher we have God we hear good summons wonderful what about manifesting it [Applause] what about manifesting it hallelujah oh Jesus is the same yesterday and forever that is good the word is true that is good God is under Prophet that's good and because we are failing to hit the jackpot [Applause] because we are failing we are losing Steam [Applause] until you hit there you are not complete [Music] [Applause] you are half-baked you are not a finished product and that's why God has kept you sister that's why God has kept you brother you are here to hit the jackpot one of these days one of these days you don't need even a pastor to pray for you you don't need brother so and so pray for you you need to see you are named in the fingers in the palm of God and you know I am part of his hand and his hand is not shorted that it has only ended with the Pastor Stephen his hand is not a shot that he has only ended with sister so and so I should not be there to share testimonies of others God is not a god of partiality he is an impartial God what he has done for you he can do for me what he can stand for this one he can do for you he loves us all oh [Applause] the devil wants you to sit in a corner and you feel like for me in my corner God his hand cannot reach you there it's not God's hand you are supposed to be the hand [Applause] you are the aunt he has already reached me there you just have to exercise what you are and tell the devil tell the devil I am the word manifesting machine I am the what but the word must be quickened the healing must be quickened the power must be quickened the glory of God in Me the virtue of God in Me my God is not a powerless God he's a god of power he's a god of matter he's the god of Glory he's a god of healing he's the hand has come up to me the hand is here and it is not short that it cannot save me what is serving the Lord his hand is not shortened that it cannot save what is to serve the Greek word is Isuzu serve though he will be both physically and spiritually full package Glory oh God the logos the angel of the Covenant he loves it fulfilling his word in you than anything else Glory oh God he says then that was Christ the logos the Morning Star the alpha omega he came to the Earth he was seen many times and in what we call I guess a few funny that was back in the early Testament where they seen this form this inform of a man talking about Melchizedek and so forth but he was made flesh amen and dwelt Among Us the fullness of God dwelt in him all right then he said a little while the world won't see me no more you yet you'll see me for be with you is that right is that right what God he says I go to God is that right then he came from what the pill of fire is that right then he returned to what the pin off fire when Paul was on his run down to Damascus that a pit of fire made him and struck him blind why did he strike him blind because he had a lot of moss had to be dealt with the fast get blind before you can see become foolish before you can understand laughs get sick before you can receive the healing okay is that right he said soul soul why past you just tell me he said he said Lord if you notice that Capital means Elohim Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus the pillow fire [Laughter] and here he is in the last days before his visible appearance sinning for the spirit so dominant eh here he is in these last days just before he is visible appearance sending forth his spirit so dominant [Applause] so dominant and so real until they even took a picture of it here it comes into the church can do it now by the help of the Holy Ghost there can't be a secret on your heart but what it can reveal the Bible said and then he comes here and he says there it is it isn't me it isn't you it is him so what are we [Applause] when I look at you it isn't you when you look at me it is sent to me so forget about you I am a failure I am a cast things don't work I have suffered I have done this I am I am I am I have weak Faith Lord I I it isn't you it isn't me it is him thank you Glory oh God [Applause] come to that reckon with that accept that brother it is unto you so if they want to cast they are not going to cast you you are no longer there how can they cast Christ how can they cast the arm of Deliverance Glory it isn't me it isn't you it is him that is the pit of fire that he follows is the Holy Spirit the Lord of Heaven the Lord goes the Jesus Christ the alpha the Omega he that was which is shall come the root and offspring of David the Morning Star the I am the Father the Son the Holy Ghost the counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father the wonderful one that is him you couldn't find enough titles to tell him [Music] Lord oh God so he says aha Glory oh God so he was God the logos the one that went out of God they when it began to brood upon the Earth get it and they brought forth marine life when the spirit of God the logos the world which was which God said let there be and they are went the logos which is the word cause all this was in the Locust the Hall of creation all that God created and so that it is good was in the logos the whole word of God the Holy Bible for every age and as the logos begin to breathe upon the Earth there came forth marine life building up bad life and no one up to animal life and finally there come something in the representation or looked like the thing that was brewing it Brewing over it gold a man in the very image of God now God then comma a man in the very image of God that is the masterpiece of the logos blessed be the name of the Lord let me just come to something here when God speaks forth his word and every spoken word of God must be fulfilled he speaks all his promises and his word through his mouth we have said that and every true or Genuine believer is residing in his mouth unless if or when he was spewed out because of lucumsy then when time comes God fulfills the same Spoken Word by his hand and as we have proven every predestinated child of God is engraved in the palms of his hands I want you to look at this [Applause] when you get down to that now and let your faith rest solemnly not upon a man not upon theologies of man not upon church denominations as good as they are as good as money is let your faith rest alone in Christ is finished work at Calvary for both sin and salvation you see it rest there notice let me go down here he says that's where you ought to have faith if you believe this to be God is internal unchangeable word then every precept that has been spoken God's word is a seed and everything that God has spoke of in the word is already confirmed in glory is already confirmed in and it's been given to you listen to this it has been given to you to act upon [Music] I wish I could scream now but I don't have been given to you to act upon that's why the prophet says when you come to recognize Who You Are and the authority that is invested in you you will serve God and yourself a lot of trouble so we are giving God a lot of unwarranted trouble because we don't know that God has already given us to act and then you are crying back to him God do this God help me God you are the hand [Applause] let just that hand be uneved you have folded your hand a long time and you want Jesus to do it for you don't blessed be the name of the Lord before I came I think it was just like a few days before I came they bring a younger girl of about 15 years she's a daughter of a deliver refuse to believe also and then she comes from school and she's like upset and complaining of a headache and in in bad spirits and he's not willing to talk to parents and she's by herself and then all of a sudden she picks a better sheet and climbs to the roof of the house inside there and she wants to commit suicide and they claimed After High and he tried to pull this from her and she stuck in there like she's really bolted to the woods up there and the parents seat and the neighbors watching her the whole night to the next to them then they bring her my place you know in that kind of condition just bound and she's just not speaking but just crying she wants to die and then the mother will say well we see me and my husband you know we serve the Lord and we are believing we have been praying for her I said the whole thing is simple this is now not a baby this is now a mature girl she's 15 years you are not going to do a religion for her and that's the problem I was even wanting some Rivers they even tell their children don't get saved yet don't go and accept Jesus because time can come and you fail and then you come back to church it will be a problem blah blah blah foreign I said I was asking the church you think God who saved me at 13 years was was not reasoning he called me when I was 13. why didn't he wait for me to strike 17 18. there were the things you know they want a religion done for them go around the world you know what is what is happening in the churches there's somebody that prays for the church and opens the service another brother comes with praise maybe for the offerings and so forth and prayer requests and then a preacher comes and prays and preaches and after preaching he prays and goes and you sit there dumb [Applause] and then the pastor has left the prophet and is inviting the song leader to dismiss the congregation what relationship is this between the so-called bride the bridey groom speaks and for you you came you are quiet you have not spoken to him you are going back home and the pastors are becoming like priests doing for people religion [Applause] you are supposed to speak to your father you are supposed to speak to your God when you come to church it's called The House of Prayer [Music] how can you come to the house of prayer and you go you have not prayed [Applause] because there's somebody that prayed for me that they couldn't pray they for the offerings the pastor prayed before he preached and after preaching the pastor prayed for us and then the pastor called the song leader and dismissed us where are you coming from the House of Prayer something is wrong we are not here to do for people religion we are not Hail Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners a Catholic Spirit again everything done for you done for you and you are just there sounds good [Applause] and like came into the land of Lord [Applause] [Music] why should you stay in the land of note when you are in the Tabernacle of worship and praise and prayer who is going to pray for you who will pray for you better than yourself who will pray for your husband better than you the wife who will pray for your wife better than you the husband who will pray for your children better than you yourself [Applause] [Music] there must be a relationship between you and your God moreover an intimate or an intimate one close one of love until God is your friend God is your father and you are you know I am speaking to my father [Applause] [Music] brother Branham said he's not having grandchildren and we are not about to hatch some grandchildren and give him make sure you pray before you leave those doors make sure you talk to your God and if the song already is hurting you out remain here and say I'm now going to speak to my God [Applause] yay my house shall be called of all Nations the House of Prayer and you have had the word in order to pray in order to know what to tell God so I told you that the woman I said the problem with you and your husband you were doing a religion for your family but these children have outgrown the level of protection by the blood of the parents of the grace they are now mature they are having girlfriends and boyfriends and you are telling them my children they are still young my children [Applause] when you are above 13 years start seeking god seriously 13 years 12 years seek your God talk to your God [Applause] yay not my dad is a good prayer Warrior my mother is a good prayer Warrior and you whatever they did they were training you praying up a child in a way should grow how are you going to offset all these demons that are marauding around [Applause] yeah [Applause] the devil is not joking that's where you ought to have faith if you believe this to be God is internal unchangeable what then every precept that has been spoken in God's word is a seed and everything that God has spoken of in his word he's already confirmed in glory and it has been given to you to act upon then he says so don't be afraid to take any face of God is internal blessed word and a phrase and a face and a statement get out of it stick to it say it claim it call on it don't be afraid act on it you are the hand now you are God's hand extended now glory to God [Applause] anchor it in your heart Glory oh God I have to find a way to finish now I'm finished [Laughter] he says now Faith is ridiculous to everybody else apart from God and the one who has it so don't be afraid to be ridiculous now it's not ridiculous to God because he's the oath of faith it's not the ridiculous the man that has faith because he's a believer in God so it isn't ridiculous to him God is the author of Faith he created it and a man who received it from God Faith was delivered we are talking about the faith that you manufacture in your intellectual realms intellectual faith I think I preached about that one time the transformation of faith it's the faith of God so he says that's why the Bible says we contend for the faith that was worse delivered it was delivered by a delivery fun and the delivery funding that delivered the faith was Jesus Christ and Jesus is the faith himself [Applause] it was manufactured in heaven created by God then he put in a delivery fund and he handed over to the Saints now we are here to contend [Applause] maybe I'm sounding ridiculous [Music] uh cause it isn't ridiculous to God because he created it he knows what it is and they believe the Lord receives it it is it it isn't ridiculous to him because by that is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things they can't see test feel smell or hear but he knows it is there so it is not ridiculous and and then he says he don't have to worry about anything anything about it he knows God told it God decided and that is enough God told you to go to say it and that is enough and it's part of God and he was part of the mouth and he's not spewed out of the mouth [Music] so he's part of the mouth and his part of the hand [Music] [Applause] so he's everywhere you are both in the hand you are both in the mouth merry goodness glory be to God so he says he's bringing loud this is in this age God is saying I'll spew you from my mouth this church age will be rejected there will be just a Remnant out of it that will be saved so better mark yourself write good to find out if you are in that Remnant now The Remnant that remains in the mouth amen amen amen the rest are spewed so because they are out of the mouth that spoke the word they don't have the authority to be part of the hand because the mouth is on the intelligence here the brain that commands the hand what to do when to do it how okay so when you are out of the command center the hand gets paralyzed and they paralyze the hand can do nothing oh brother these things of this financial a brother these things of Jesus healing these things of Jesus speaking I hear they must tell us brother I only know about healing we believe a message what message what is this message this message is alive without that life you don't believe the message [Applause] this message is Jesus Christ he's the bridegroom he's the head how can you say you believe the message and you don't have the hand that performs the message is your god deformed no my God is Not deformed he's a full-bodied God he has all the parts and I'm glad I'm in the hand [Applause] so I told the mother I said you knew there and the father I said now you Neil here I said kneel here I'm not the one who told you to refuse to get saved and they laid in my hand on the hand and rebuked the spirit and then she could come to herself I said now you have to accept the Lord if you don't this demon still has a certificate to get back and I'm not going to be your guarantor [Applause] work out your own hey Time Has Come friends there is nobody who is going to be your garage the garage of rapture the grant of healing they had a guarant of protection no act upon the word you have seen your name in the book you have seen your name you have had your name in the world now you have sin you have to see your name in the hand I have engrafted your names in the palms of my hands and my hand is what makes my word live [Music] glory to God Market yourself find out where you are whether you are in that Remnant and the prophet says we will go into that then he says if you are a saint in another sermon if you are a saint act like a Act aren't you people who are taught so much of exercise when you begin to die slowly after 40. exercise you are trying to tell me to put your body in a form when

God used to sit around and sing the Redemption songs and sing of the blood and sing of the power of God why can't we go back to that that time when children of God will sit together and talk about his

[Applause] you can go around the world you look at even we ministers we seek on we sit on the pulpits and this is how we sit [Music] [Applause] we sit like this on the on the parapet [Applause] where is that cherubim respect for God they covered their faces they covered their feet [Applause] they didn't even want to look at him and they were crying holy holy holy holy under the Lord and they have never been redeemed like you [Applause] you are a sinner a sinner served by grace and you feel you are so big that you want to sit like a boss in the house of the Lord so if you are a boss what have you made Jesus to be [Music] [Applause] so when the churches begin to become our offices when churches become our churches our church we have the Liberty I can clap I can refuse to clap I can't stand up I can refuse to do this we have democracy in our church there is something wrong somewhere that is [Applause] you no longer clap like you used to clap you no longer shout like you you are no longer having the joy of salvation who took it away because wherever salvation is that Joys to accompany it [Applause] so why are you not happy anymore why don't you worship him anymore why don't you praise

see their faces light up no more and they sing and clap with their hands they raise their hands to God and praise God pray all night night prayers these days I cast [Music] I've seen it in many places and and one believer was telling for us since we have ever been in a church we have never had a night prayer is saying pray all night it doesn't even mean night prayer for the church but nightly prayer for you in your house you can pray yeah in your house laying out in the corn fields and things why you can't sit in the church 30 minutes without grumbling and growling laodicea is upon you it's a preacher also I wish they don't invite him again I may not come again don't worry [Laughter] we we are going I may be the Rapture tomorrow solo probably when you can't sit 30 minutes you begin grumbling feeling an easy uncomfortable some stomach exciting why those demons begin to be activated because you are out of tune with God and then they make you uncomfortable you go to the toilet seven times in one summer [Applause] have you ever seen brother Shambo saying wait a minute I have to rush to the toilet first I think so because when the anointing is upon you brings everything under control [Applause] you can go once you can go twice but three fourth times five times before you sit you have gone again you are your seat you've gone again the devil isn't interested in keeping you away from something which is going on [Applause] oh and Glory and yawning hey oh [Music] he says true it is the truth borderline lukewarm laudicial my shame on you let me come to my finishing Point
