brother polycarp I told him to preach like home as he usually do and we will P for the gift of God of the remaining just stay in prayer everything is okay God is in control and all things work together for good every move brother I'm say the Lord is behind it even when I'm moving my hand the Lord is behind it God is behind every single move we gave credit too much to the devil so we got to the point where we need to remove all the credit from the devil and tell the devil that even whatever you were doing in our lives God allow you to do it and God was using that for our benefit so there is nothing that you can do that can put us in hell I don't have a DNA for hell we have a DNA for heaven so you can fight all you want at the end of the day at the finishing line I will see God face that's what matter amen so let's go we fly believe as we call Brother poar believe I got everything [Applause] covered [Music] all things [Music] [Applause] [Music] are [Music] only oh believe all things are possible only [Music] believe yes Lord we believe mer thank you musicians God richly bless you before we start let's go to prayer and speak to the author of the word ET Eternal almighty God creator of Heaven and Earth Heavenly Father tonight we are coming as we are so that you may speak to us so that you may save us so that you may restore us because you're the only one that can do it when people fail when men are limited you are unlimited and that's where you start that's why we coming into that presence as we are Lord your people came to hear thee not to hear us Lord but you always use men to speak to men so Lord take us as simple instruments tools that you will be speaking to your children there is a need somewhere you're the god that can restore it and we humbly ask it in the name of Jesus Christ that you take the full preeminence of this those that are here and those streaming May you help each one of us Lord and speak directly to your children and deliver them Lord so they can give all the glory back unto them we also Lord we have nothing to give them and we are waiting and expecting for so Lord move us out of the way and we take authority upon every negative spirit that are not confessing your name to depart from this place and to leave your children and go back to the dry places we thank you for that Lord we are giving you the place May the Holy Spirit be free to move to and fro in the room and do what you want to do in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen everybody can hear me okay praise God as you still standing let's go straight to our scripture before you sit if you have your Bible let's go go to the book of joob the first chapter verse 4 to 5 The Book of Joel after hose if you thereare you can say Amen the book of Jo chapter 1 I'm going to read in the name of the Lord verse that which the palmerworm has left has the Locust eaten and that which the Locust has left has the canker e and that which the canker has left has the caterpillar Iden awake ye drunker verse five and weep and how oh you drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth you might be seated and we will continue our scripture [Music] reading go to the second chapter of Joel verse 25 the Same Book of Joel Grand and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten and the canker and the caterpillar and all and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you amen if you would let's go to the Book of Genesis chapter 20 I would like to read something there as well Genesis 20: seven if you thereare you can say Amen Genesis 27 now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a Prophet this is God to abik and he shall pray for thee and thou shall live and if thou restore her not nor thou that thou shall surely die thou and all that are dine amen amen amen may the Lord bless his word that we just readel if you would go with me also in the Book of Ezekiel I would like to read something there as well or maybe we can read it later but the two chapters the two books that we read in the scripture tonight this is where we are drawing our tle tonight the restoration of the Brad tree the prophet William Mario Brother Bram preached the same message and brother Bram Jo this ttle after the sermon of brother Neville and the word that brother Neville was using that morning and he used the word restore and when brother Bram heard that he went straight home and he searched the word in the dictionary to really the meaning of the word amen amen and from Dance come the title The restoration of the Brad tree amen amen and you will notice in the two books that we read tonight in the Book of Genesis CH 20: 7 God was speaking to AB just a portion and he was telling him to restore Sarah back to Abraham and brother Bram interpret that scripture such as this that's to [Applause] restore it means you taking something and bring it back to the original owner to bring it back to the original state noticed that Sarah was more beautiful since he was a just man in his heart God acknowledged his righteous heart and God forbade him to touch Sarah because Sarah was a wife to the prophet that's why he gave him instruction to restore her back if you don't do it you will die you and your house and everything that is dine amen amen that's why we read that scripture God told him to restore SRA back you know and you are acquainted with the story just to give you an idea what a restoration means and where we read in the Book of Joel they talk to us or they mentioned three or four creatures and they were there to destroy as an army to destroy the life of the children of Israel maybe a work maybe a health maybe uh families it was the great Army that the Lord sent and that Army was completely destroying Israel and how were they doing meaning when the first Army step in the first group they will attack when they destroy they will make way before you regroup again they will prepare the ground for the next Army coming in and the next one will take over until the scriptures say everything will be wiped away amen amen and that's the way God sent this Great Mighty Army God remembered his people and God say I will restore them amen amen and God to restore his people God himself doesn't come down to do God uses his servant that he ordained he will use those servant to do his work and this is what we will try to investigate tonight if you go to the book of 1 Samuel chapter 1 in verse five you know you are in quainted all of us with the story of Hanah amen amen and we as preachers we are led by the spirit of God to interpret that the way that God inspires us as brother BR mention it that he can take one scripture and preach many ways but the book that I mentioned in the book of First Samuel 1 Samuel 1 verse 5 they were talking or they were describing how El I know that this is a story was the husband of Hannah he had two old two two wives it was Hannah and Pana sacri and every time he goes for he year for his yearly sacrifice he will give to Pana and her children a portion to each person but when he belonged to anah he was giving Hannah the double because he L Hannah but the only problem she was barren was fine was good because she already got children but that was not the case for Hannah amen amen and in verse 11 Hanah vowed to the Lord and she said this she said Lord of host if thou will indeed look on the Affliction of the hand and remember me and forget and and not forget handmade but will give unto the hand man a man child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life amen and you notice here anna was praying just as any believer can pray Hanah was praying and God heard her but if you notice God never replied to her amen amen God knew about the situation and it's God that allow her to be barren amen amen because sometime we ask ourselves questions why did such a situation happen why am I going through this trials why did I find myself in the valley have I seen somewhere no no it is not that you seen or done something wrong yes of course we are victims of people's uh ideas speeches or maybe statement people say or behavior of people toward or maybe the people around us we are victim of those circumstances but we are also victim of our own self about our own actions for instance one day the day they were crucifying Jesus Christ the people that were screaming crucify him they say let the sin be upon us and our children in upon our children can you imagine the children were completely Innocent but now they are victim of something that they have not done and it goes from one generation to another that's why I said that we are victim some of maybe somebody else action or maybe a behavior of somebody or maybe a statement someone made or maybe something somebody wrote or to condemn you and when you read that message and you find yourself and you cannot even move because somebody told you something and that you don't like maybe and also we are also victim of our the cross there were two thevs according to them it was legal for them to be crucified because they were guilty of the action that they condemned them for amen amen that's the reason why I so sometime we could be victim one way or the other if you notice now Hanah prayed God heard but God never replied to her but in Samu chapter 1 verse 26 to verse 28 let me go back first in verse 17 God who allow Hannah to be Barren when Hannah vowed and the Lord heard her vow God spoke to his servant El amen amen it was that spoke he was the one that spoke to an and listen to what changed the life of Hannah he say go in peace and the god of Israel Grant the that petition that th has asked of him was not the one who prayed do you listen to me he just took an authority as brother Bram says we don't have power but we have authority am amen he said go in peace may the Lord of is Grant thee that ask him this is what solved the matter am amen this is what gave her the child and in verse 26 all the way to 28 when she got the baby she kept her vow and brought the child back to the Tabernacle in the house of the Lord for the service of the Lord now imagine she only have one child at that time how many times me and you my brother my sister when we go through problems when we are praying how how many promises do we vow unto the Lord maybe you are looking for a job maybe you want to get married maybe you are looking for children but when God bless you when you didn't have something you saw the pastor you were coming to church when you when you didn't have anything you were praying but when God give to you only few people comes back to be to acknowledge what go what they spoke to the Lord now I'm still going into the same road to show you this everything the God says this in the Bible that trust believe the Lord and you will be established do you listen to me to be established you must look unto the Lord but you must look at his servant and then you prosper because your Prosperity is always connected with a servant with a man of God Amen why just like now we are here we are not here to speak our own words but we want to give God's verdict to you amen how is God going to speak to you God will speak to you through his word by his servant am amen and you will noce something we will see something here in the book for in the book of Exodus chapter 3 I'm just going to save time God Called Moses it was God that chose Moses god establish and he was a leader amen amen but you will notice in Exodus 31 from the first to verse 6 God chose he chose B amen amen B and God chose both of them but if you noce in the scripture God never spoke to them directly that I chose both of you I chose you to work for me with Moses God never done it because God worked through his servant God deal with the authority he has established he is a god of order God spoke to Moses he said Moses I have chosen a chosen Bel and for my service that I see over there I want them to build the Tabernacle they have the wisdom that I put in them I chose both of them but God didn't tell them because they will come with their pride spirit and come and say Moses oh the Lord sent us oh God told us we are also leader God also chose us do you see the way God work God chose Moses chose those people but God don't speak to those people I chose you am amen Moses himself who have to make the choice of God in the congregation to pick this and this one to work with him amen amen and when Moses chose them they will respect Moses and there will be order in the congregation of working amen amen blessed be the name of the lordy in the message Revelation books of symbols 1956 June the 17th paragraph 58 brother Bram says this your pastor when he stand here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church he is the messenger to the church that's why a pastor should never never leave that word but stay straight with the word because he is feeding the shepherd's Place amen amen the word Pastor mean shepher look at and find out if that a right a pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer a certain flock to feed them what with the word of God amen amen do not forget that our tonight is the restoration amen now let's look at how God will restore us I'm going straight to the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel 37 amen amen it's a story that all of us since everybody knows about it I don't want to read everything but let's go to the interpretation of what God want us because somebody must get [Applause] his must be delivered somebody must be restored amen tonight [Applause] we cannot be like Naomi know that Naomi left because of hunger and when she went she never possessed that land it was the land that possess she lost her husband she lost her children it's like when you got into 2024 if you don't this year year will take over you so what you were thinking about fulfilling if you don't do it they year will take over you so we are here to take over the we are here to be restored amen amen I'm going straight to verse four skipping and again he say prophesy upon these bones let me just go back to verse one the hand of the Lord was upon me and carry me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of a valley which was full of bonds amen amen you see who did they move the prophet Propet he was the prophet amen amen because the word of God always God speak his people he goes to the [Music] prophet just like tonight I don't know which Valley you find yourself in now God is sending me in your Valley God is sending us in your Valley where you have dry bones we don't know what is going on in your life that don't have life we don't know what is but we are all together in this Valley amen amen to execute the Judgment of God amen amen and he caused me to pass by them round about and there were very many in the open Valley and L they were very dry Valley my brother is not a good place amen amen it's not a city it's a bad place maybe it's a Wilderness a place where there is no life it's a place of suffering am amen it's a place of pain amen amen and he said unto me son of man can these bones leave and I answered oh Lord no when God asked the question but a man of God he said I cannot have a answer you the one asking me the question you alone have the answer even tonight in the problem you have God have the answer to your problem remember this he say look unto the Lord believe the Lord and you will be established but to his Prophet you will prosper now here the prophet will prophesy will also prophesy we will prophesy upon you what is prophesy it's to predict something that is not yet and we are speaking that in advance so that that will take place later that's what the prophet did he was facing and God told him to speak to them blessed be the name of the Lord he said prophesies upon this and say to them oh ye dry B the word of the Lord let me say something here there are certain situation in your life that you spoke you spoke they don't hear you there are certain situation you speak to them they are very stubborn they don't listen to your language but when God bring his word in the mouth of his Serv even if there is no the ears will be there to listen to the word of God he will listen to the word of even if it's an object made by human means if you speak that object will listen because God say even if something mov in your life maybe you forget something somewhere by speaking the word it will collect itself and it will be found just like this Dy is born amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord say oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord if Dry Bones can hear the word how much more you amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord

my dictionary I am just trying to show the meaning of to be restored and I'm going straight to the point brother said the definition to restore means to return to the former owner meaning what you lack in your life in your health in your marriage it belongs to you to begin with but you lack it you must be restored by amen amen amen amen that's why we talk who took Sarah he had to return her back to Abraham amen amen hallelujah back to the former estate of condition brother say we can enforce a claim to be restored my my meaning you have the right to enforce now to enforce your restoration by the word I don't know if you really catch the meaning of it you can enforce Restoration in your [Applause] life let me go to paragraph 83 same to bring back to the for woman or to bring back to the former state of condition and if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it make it come back to its right [Applause] place may God bless these feeble words to restore 84 means or restore a claim can be enforc to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs therefore what belongs to him that's why some way he went away from its rightful owner maybe your health left you and the demon of cancer came in or whatever sickness came in you can enforce amen amen to depart Hallelujah you can wander around anyway restore is to bring it back who really owns it your health must be correct bring it back to Natural State where he was at the first time bring it back to his natural condition we have a right to enforce if there is a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration rest to restore the thing blessed be the name of the Lord let me continue like if somebody stole some property and they are holding the property then you
